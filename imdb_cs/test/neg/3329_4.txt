Some movies are simply ??? unhappy. These are films that seem to have thrived on a lot of goodwill and a handful of potentially great ideas, but they simply didn't have the budget and / or professional cast and crew members to make it happen. This category definitely includes "The Strangeness". You really like it, but even the most demanding and demanding horror fanatics of the 80's will have to admit that the film hardly reaches mediocrity thanks to the atmosphere of cheapness, clumsy stop-motion effects and harmlessly dark cinematography. "The Strangeness" has a fairly original plot and set-up (all right, it's like "The Boogens", but I sincerely doubt that director David Michael Hillman has deliberately ripped off a fellow B-film 80's) and the players are performing enthusiasts, though it's all wrong. The gathering of amateur speleologists sets out on an expedition to explore the infamous Gold Spike mine. Many years ago, some miners had mysteriously died there, and the place has been abandoned since then, but there should be too much gold to keep it closed forever. Shortly after they descended to the mine, the group members met with the slimy ruler of the Gold Spike mine one by one; Lovecraftian monster with tentacles and incredibly handy way to move forward. For most of the time running, "The Strangeness" is a boring and incompetent mess that is difficult to track due to the total lack of lighting. The characters are uninteresting and mine remains a secret because the only light effects come from helmets of speleologists. There is very little action or horror in the first hour, but director Hillman cleverly catches the audience's attention by displaying pieces and pieces of the monster at regular intervals. Once you catch the first glimpse of the monster's tentacle, you are doomed to watch. Creation is realized with stop-motion effects, which I usually adore and worship, but here in this case they look extremely weak and sad. The person responsible for the special effects should pay more attention to Ray Harry's work. Deadly sequences occur mostly off-screen and there is very little tension in the entire movie. A horror movie with such a setting should benefit from a claustrophobic atmosphere and unidentifiable sound effects, but "Strangeness" is missing. The biggest trump card is undoubtedly the beautiful look of blonde actress Terri Berland. It resembles a speleologist just like I do to Mother Teresa, but she certainly looks good in her white and beige trousers.
