First, let me make it clear that I like airplanes, and it's usually worth watching any movie with them - and I was sitting in some shocking. The same is not true for this movie. James Stewart is an excellent actor, but he is wasted in the Strategic Air Command promotional film. Negotiations are moderate and the direction is weak. I had to stop looking at this terrible waste about halfway. This was despite some really good, maybe even the best, aerial photos. The problem is that even for aviation matrices like me, doing something of the shocking aircraft featured (B-36 and B-47) just grates on the nerves too much. It's a pity that the movie wasn't created when the B-52 appeared, then the superlatives used on the plane in this movie would be valid. Then I could sit. Maybe I miss the place of the film, which may be an anxiety that the loved ones suffer while their loved ones have active duties. In any case, it could have been done much better. Recommendation? It is worth missing.
