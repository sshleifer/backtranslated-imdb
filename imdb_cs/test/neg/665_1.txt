After watching this movie, I have nothing but contempt for some of those involved in making this abysmal movie. For one, as a general commentary, the story was literally incredible and full of incredible clich√©s all around. The same, of course, is a dialogue that sets itself on the lowest common denominator and can offer absolutely zero unpredictable original lines. Acting was also horrible, and Kane showed no more than three separate and different emotions throughout the film. Even the use of modern special effects failed as each prop was easily recognizable from its real life counterpart. Overall, I wouldn't recommend for anyone to even think about this feature because it will probably waste 83 (or even 90!) Minutes of your life.
