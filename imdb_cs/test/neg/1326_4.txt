Do people have this film highly valuable because it is a film about foreign war ??? For me it is nothing more than a bad movie about the Hollywood war in German. This film is so bad on many levels. Even mentioning it with a platoon or an all-metal jacket is absurd. Battle sequences are pathetic, dialogue and frightening. This so-called group of "storm troops" is a regular player in Wermacht. Not SS soldiers. There is so much wrong that this movie is sad. Wrong adjustments, bad behavior. It's all. The film goes on and on and on like the audience should suffer as much as soldiers. <br /> <br /> I read in a review that this movie had a budget of $ 20 million. <br /> <br /> Really? Where was it? In fake train sequences? In pathetic "special effects"? Ugh. As a WWII history buff, and a WWII movie fan, I found this movie to be a serious disappointment. <br /> <br /> For an excellent alternative war movie check out "The Beast". (It's not a WWII movie, but still excellent) <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this.
