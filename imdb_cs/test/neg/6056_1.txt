I survived for the first hour and returned for the last ten minutes just to say I saw the end. If you want real mythology, flawlessly done, check out Armand Assante "The Odyssey". Great narration doesn't have to be improved - stories are fantastic. I just hope Sean Astin needed the money. And Sophocles and Ovid have to whirl in their graves - wherever they are. At least with the Sorbo version, the language was stuck in the face - we knew it was mostly balderdash, but maybe enough interest was generated in backstory to send someone to the library. So fun (TV series), and follow him with something so no quality.
