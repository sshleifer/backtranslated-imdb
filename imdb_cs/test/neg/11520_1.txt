Ed Wood is driving again. The fact that this film was created should give promising movie hopes to all young <br /> <br />. Any scenario that you might think of using a line on the <br /> <br /> line should now look so bad. Do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy Tylenol or Rolaids hideout. Watching this movie <br /> <br /> I realized that Boa vs. Python wasn't that bad. It would probably be better to make this film in Claymation as at least such a way no actor would have to take credit for being in this movie. It is understandable why this director has so many nicknames. There is a clear side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips, then you can eat the way out of the cocoa cheese that surrounds you allowing you <br /> <br /> Make your clone to the TV that surrounds it.
