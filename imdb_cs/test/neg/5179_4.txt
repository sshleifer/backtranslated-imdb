"Rise of the Footsoldier" follows the inexorably cruel way of gangster Carlton Leach and his co-workers through drugs, violence, sex, violence, arms, violence, and violence? The protagonist Carlton Leach (Ricci Harnett)), member of the ICF (Inner City Company); a group of football hooligans has turned into a professional gangster, leading viewers through events leading to the 1995 'Range Rover Killings', in which three gang members have fallen victim to particularly bad professional 'hits'. The success of Leach as a porter and a talent for placing super violent friends who could control the stubborn perpetrators at a local nightclub will take him to the company of notorious drug dealers and gangsters who benefit from the rave scene of the 1980s and 1990s and drug culture. Opening by brutally realistic shots of dead men, the viewer is thirsty to understand what has happened, but remains completely dissatisfied. The next 2 hours intersect a number of countless performances of characters. Each of them basically creates another typical "hard man", showing him that he usually attacks undeserved victims before he is likely to get even more nasty. What little emotional understanding the audience has to create for several characters (such as a family man blamed for missing drugs) is quickly destroyed when they are either anti-climatically killed or their story remains unsolved. The conspiracy ideas introduced at the outset are inadequately closed, with a vague impression of how murders have occurred, as events are in place with little reward for perseverance with the hazy confusion of previous events. This film was created with a standard pattern in mind, for an audience that prefers violence and 'Ard Nut' slang into a real story. "Rise of the Footsoldier" borrows too much from the "football factory", omits good bits and does not show any moral consequences of a hooligan subculture or empathy with the protagonist. Violence, though brilliantly shot, seems disproportionate and unlikely because no one is long enough for the audience to create an emotional attachment. The consequence that the police are inviolable is fair enough, but the doorkeeper, who performs in public in public, is pushing for even the poorest viewers. The audience is left confused about the importance of many key events and developed characters that have no impact on the conclusion. The "brave realism" attempt is further destroyed by a substance called "True Serum" that the Turkish Mafia uses to address honest answers from reluctant individuals. It is NOT a genre in which psychologically unrealistic drugs can be invented and makes the questioning almost absurd. The actual scenes of violence (before they become repetitive) have some tension, are associated with rapid flashes of color or film reel. The trouble-free choreographic disturbances associated with a mandatory but effective shaking handheld camera save the film, but unfortunately the plot (or lack of it) limits it to a demographic niche. Basically the events of this movie are based on not deservedly represented, and a sufficiently sequential plot is sacrificed for stereotypical characters and a non-original plot. This movie has a place on the market, but if you like a little brain with your brutality, this is not for you. <br /> <br /> http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/
