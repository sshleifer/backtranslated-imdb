Sometimes he deliberately camps, sometimes inadvertently stupid (as in the opening scene where a woman is "informed" that she has been raped and that her family was defeated only for the show), this film is neither funny nor competent (as a direct adventure story) to make it really enjoyable. I'll let you decide which of them can be the highlight, but the lowest point is probably the fight with the silly metal dragon. Brigitte Nielsen was a good choice for Sonja, with a fresh face and a solid, slightly muscular body (and I think her dark red hair fits perfectly), but Schwarzenegger gives one of his colorless performances like Calidor.
