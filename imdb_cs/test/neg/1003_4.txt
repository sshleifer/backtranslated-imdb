This high-class story, as it reaches its nature and roams in its miserable class, is like the current Mid-Sommerish version of Joan Crawford's old movie, in which she suffered in mink. Here, people behave terribly civilized in the face of adversity. A well-supported London lawyer (Tom Wilkinson) found that not only was his wife having an affair with a local nobleman, but that she had also killed her husband's housewife in an accident caused by an intervention. He throws up, but otherwise his hard-top-lip barely scares. Written and directed by Julian Fellowes, who won an Oscar for writing "Gosford Park" (this is his directorial debut), from Nigel Balchin's novel, it's pretty comic, though I'm not sure how much is a comedy intended. It's like returning to the 1940s British movies, when characters acted more like characters in books or games than people in real life. But it's not all bad. Wilkinson is amazing, even if you never believe him as a person, while Emily Watson (adulterous wife) and Rupert Everett (high amoral high class) are both very good at covering up cracks in the material. Tony Pierce-Roberts' cinematography ensures that no matter how hard it is on the ear, it is always good for the eye.
