Giant Claw is in a wild competition with films like 'Robot Monster' and 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' for the worst movie of all time. False-looking giant vultures "Lionel Trains" in this totally subconscious movie. The script is so bad that all the characters say is ridiculous. Not surprisingly, this film is a prime target in "It Comes from Hollywood", where this gem is hammered for the line, "Bird as Big as a Battleship", with cheerful, endless needles. The line steadily emerges during the film, so it won't escape. There are a few shots from the movie "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms" and "Earth vs. My Life" The Flying Saucers "among other sci-fi films from the 1950s to boost vulture attacks. At one point, the great vulture is responsible for several deaths, so the army puts the whole world into martial law and no one can leave their homes. Of course, the huge buzzer is mainly concerned with watching the stars of this classic, Jeff Morrow and Mary Corday, wherever they are. However, the director is so weak that he does not even provide a few honey shots of pretty Mary in a decent dress and black heels for a little relief from the boredom of this zero-star thriller. It's the second time that happened. In 'Tarantula', Mara Corday floats in a hot dress for the entire movie, but is relegated to pants throughout, 'Giant Scorpion'. The budget for this film must not be more than thirty or forty thousand dollars, and I doubt whether Morrow or Corday got more than three thousand to do it. Looks like the whole thing was shot directly from someone's garage.
