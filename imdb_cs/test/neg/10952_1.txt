Wow, I was told it was going to be B's worth watching. I feel like I was misled by the preview event. The storyline is twisted from several movies at best. Even the title is taken on another movie if you can give the movie that much credit. I'm sorry I was taken to a dry cleaner. I shouldn't waste time on this. This movie seems to be a bunch of wannabes who have teamed up and made a bad idea of ​​a weekend movie with a borrowed camera. Being in the entertainment industry, I can judge a decent movie and this one deserves to be postponed or discarded. My advice to stick to the classics like 1979 Dawn of the Dead. On a scale of 1 to 10, producers are also pretty 1 because this BLOWS movie. (Below what he sucks) Producers must stay on their working days. If you're viewing a movie, be honest with your post, it seems that this movie has been upset and inflated by several people. There are several who have seen it for what it is and is properly published. Sorry, I have to say that this is omitted.
