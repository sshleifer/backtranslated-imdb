Predictable, clichÃ©, incredible, boring ... what else can I say? It's just a cast of caliber that saves all the redeeming features of this bloated mess. Yeah, and the fun end of the antics zone. But wait for eleven hours of highlights because the result is as predictable as who will win the Globetrotters / Washington Generals match. > <br /> I was fine in the second act before I figured it was PRO teams we watched (all dressed in Padres brown). Imitation of the character of Cameron Diaz by the teen Georgia Frontier was poorly conceived on the page. (That's not your fault, Cameron. Would you like to go to dinner?) <br /> <br /> Enough - I'm just a rant because I was looking forward to this movie. Instead, you rent the longest yard. <br /> <br />
