... at least during the first half. If it started with three navy friends and focused on marine action scenes, it would be a much better and tighter movie. The other half of the film is worth it, especially for action sequences and close up shots of early 20th century ships, but it's like a boring toothache. Also, don't watch this movie just because Ginger Rogers is in it. He has an important role, but it is small. The film begins to show three friends from New York who work in the field of tourism and also in a good Sally (Ginger Rogers) competition singing the salesgirl sweets along the avenue. The First World War broke out, all three friends seem to be completely indifferent to the fight, but they still have to join the Navy. One in three with the smallest industry as a civilian (Bill Boyd as Baltimore) winds the commanding officer to the other two (Robert Armstrong as a Dutchman and James Gleason as Skeets). To make things more difficult, Sally fell in love with one in three, but she has no chance of telling him before three sails go to war. on board the ship, mainly because of the narrow shots we have on the ship, and also because the chemistry between the three friends is believable. However, James Gleason at age 49 looks a bit long in the tooth to get rid of it, especially if the sign in the service office said you must be between 17 and 35 to be eligible. One real obvious mistake in a movie that made me believe that everything outside the marine scene was slapped along with minimal care is costume design, or, I would say, lack of it. In the scenes in New York just before the First World War, we all have a 1931 fashion, and everyone who was driving a 1931 car - no effort was made to get the film into the period. In conclusion, You watch a few scenes with Ginger Rogers in them, and you've seen everything worth seeing for the past 45 minutes, including a maritime suicide mission. The rest is padding.
