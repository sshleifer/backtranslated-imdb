This film is very disappointing for the reader. As Rafael Sabatini wrote, it was a pure story of piracy in the Caribbean, and that would make a big move. It would also be very simple. All the action takes place on a ship and on a deserted island. Unfortunately, the screenwriters took the title from Sabatini then threw the rest of the book away. Even the name of the main character was changed and his personality on screen was quite different from the personality described in the novel. It is a sad loss for one who loves a good sea story.
