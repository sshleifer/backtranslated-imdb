This is the kind of film that could ruin a few careers if the garbage could ruin the film movie career these days. Melanie Griffith took off her shirt and was really dressed up on her preoperative days. Jeff Daniels was totally useless, but fortunately for him and for us, ever since ... this ... this ... well, damn it, a piece of waste. Oddly enough, all his main players continued to do bigger and better things, including director Jonathan Demme. His work was also unnecessary, but he deserved resentment. I mean, it's not worth it to be good. But he did it well anyway. Yet, there was one clear, shining aspect: Ray Liotta, who is named the way down the credit list, just totally stole everything. Liotta was amazingly fascinating! Hypnotic! Exciting. I saw this piece of waste when it was still relatively new in a private theater friend. For some strange reason, my friend LOVED. I think it's because Melanie Griffith took off her shirt (and, really, honestly, she shouldn't), though he was trying to say it was other, more artistic reasons. By the way, I thought even after his first scene that Ray Liotta would become a star or at least a significant, highly respected actor. Despite the nonsensical aspects of the nonsensical scenario, utter ugliness from the whole story, Liotta is almost worth watching. In fact, it's worth seeing once, just to see how far Ray Liott has come. I think for one thing, his name is now usually listed on or near the top. Even in a pile of garbage, Ray Liotta shone like a diamond. <br /> <br /> If you see this waste, be ready to hold your nose. Each main character is either amoral or immoral. Terrible movie. Terrible movie idea. <br /> <br /> Added comment: Too many people answered "Was this comment helpful?" with "no" because they disagree with the expressed opinion. Maybe she should ask IMDb instead: "Do you agree with these views?"
