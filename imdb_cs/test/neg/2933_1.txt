Maybe I was expecting too much of this movie, but at least it should be a funny comedy that has very few fun moments. He can offend homosexuals, heterosexuals, women, obese and probably other groups. The graduation scene where _everyone_ claims to be gay is one of the most disgusting I've ever seen. Tom Selleck and Matt Dillon are ridiculously mistaken, and Kevin Kline appears to be confused most of the time. Other reviewers compare the movie to "Will and Grace" but at least "Will and Grace" _is_ funny.
