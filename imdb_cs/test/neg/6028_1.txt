I was also the wife of a violent husband, although in my situation the attacks were psychic, not physical. He introduced a very respectable, responsible and generous person to anyone who saw us together, which, unlike me, led me to be treated as boring and unstable to me. At first I was so incredibly flattered that anyone like Gus (who worked in the bank and was confidently confident) would give me the time of day, and I fell over my head to help him with IDEA and not the person. was. If I had my head straight and first recognized him better, I wouldn't have left him behind. But this is my fault. It wasn't my fault to be abused. I didn't deserve it, nor did I see it until I was involved in mind, criticism, and isolation. He acted as if I had no business with an opinion that was different from his own - he actually went on. If I disagreed, I assumed that I had not understood, and increasingly simplified its formulation ... at a time when I finally lost my self-esteem, I was unable to recognize the difficulty in which I was, and I had to be hit by reality by external influence. My dad said Gus called me a bitch. Well ... it was still half a year before the anger that started at that moment finally exploded and I packed some things when he was at work, and I left. And it was still a few months before I could understand that I was being abused, and that it wasn't my fault to do the things he did. ..... so please, anyone who assumes it is a victim's fault, ROME !!! If a puppy is dug by a cruel owner, when he has a car accident in a close situation, do you blame the puppy? at a time when abuse in relationship has reached a manifestly violent level, the target of abuse has been so wounded and depersonalized (as in Nazi concentration camps) that it is almost impossible to accurately assess the circumstance, because by then the victim believes that all the horrible things that abused the abuser. To have a heart, people. Marking victims of abuse as stupid morons is like digging someone who is already terribly beaten. -------> and it helps how ???
