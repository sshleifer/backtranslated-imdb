I suppose the filmmakers' heart was in the right place, but frankly, this movie is really rude. I was offended by the tone and the overall end. You can't take trouble like that! Without knowing the film's last objection ... we watch his boys do after his nine-month-old pregnant wife and two sons and be followed by another 2 + hours as he tries to create a new life? You can't have sympathy for the character who does it. Can not! Not to mention that we have given nothing up to the last half hour of this unnecessarily long film, why the guy suffers so much. No flashbacks, no sudden reactions to noise or movement - things that the real veterinarians are suffering from. All we know is that he's got a pain in his ass and can't take care of her and his 3 kids. Indeed, there did not seem to be any research into what Iraqi veterinarians are going through. In addition, the film suffers immensely from a heavy and totally inappropriate score. It's a disaster. This is really harmful to some really good dealings on the part of male leadership and occasionally Joe Morton. This predicts EVERYTHING you should feel, and sometimes gives you completely wrong clues! Again, it was a brutal thing this guy did, so when he saw him get a new job, meet a new blonde, fight for the toast counter isn't good! And really, the end? What a fool! How dare you? There are much richer films dealing with the effects of war on returning soldiers, please don't bother with this.
