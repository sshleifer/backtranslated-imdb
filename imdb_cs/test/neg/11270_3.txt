I've seen almost all Kurosawa movies and dozens of other Japanese movies. Compared to these other films, it is rather average than bad film. There are two war brothers on the conspiracy - neither of which I was very interested in - and it is very confusing to keep up with who is connected to who. Music and cinematography are pretty good, but special effects are sometimes horrible - rubber heads fly away with the same realism as the average high school! In addition to these complaints, the end of the film completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture. It turns out that the end is not true, but was completely "fudged". What does that mean? If you've seen this movie, understand that there are better films on me, so don't give up!
