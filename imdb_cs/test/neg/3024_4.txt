Losing is just that, a waste of time. MTV is throwing on TV movies today. My friend recommended it and I rented it, no need to say that I will not follow any further recommendations anytime soon. This film shows the path of drug use. The problem is that you don't care about any of the characters because of the lack of credibility and your own discipline. This movie is in the word unpleasant to watch, from horrible cameras angles to the quality of dialogue and stimulation. The "digital" format seeks realism but distracts attention. If you want a real range of drug use, watch the Requiem for a dream.
