They must be. I'll write them out so you can check them one at a time: <br /> <br /> - The police are regularly leaving tens of millions of dollars of money and drugs around them because they have no evidence of equipment. When you are shot, you will always churn out in the same way and fly the same way, even if there is never a mark on your body. - Police aren't able to identify the sound of gun shots, and I don't think there's anything suspicious when a secret police call during a high-level deal with drugs and money is shot. - Bad guy gunmen can hit one-shot mannequins, but can't hit a big, bulky 100th combat artist. <br /> <br /> - If a car launcher in a parking lot, another three cars in line in 15 seconds intervals evenly. <br /> <br /> - Next to the last point, all cheap cars are always parked side by side. The smoke caused by the rocket launcher is a much larger amount of smoke caused by four cars that blow up. <br /> <br /> - Virtual reality games that are long, far before any other gaming company can produce five floppy disks. The virtual reality games, which are a long, long way ahead of anything another gaming company can produce, have graphics that look like Windows 3.1 screensavers. <br /> <br /> - Even after being shot, floppy disks can be read. Semi-drunk guys in bars are watching the news closely when they are in the pub, and have a deep understanding of American modern military history, Agent Orange, and pedigrees of high-ranking military officials. However, they are only able to formulate their points using a dialogue that sounds stupid coming from anyone over the age of seven. Although the bar seems to appear almost every hour, this bar has only one employee who pours beer and ensures safety. Of course he knows martial arts. - Golden Olympians regularly make a simple transition to corporate directors of software companies over the years. A woman who works for the Computer Games Company knows all about how to beat a game she has never played, continually competes with her competitions and can rattle the facts and figures of her company's competitors - but she didn't know that it outpaced almost all other companies. in large corporate mergers. <br /> <br /> - Bad people always die in slow motion. Always. - Wives tell their husbands that they are pregnant by being mistaken for the bravery of their man in killing bad guys. Women are doing a lot of their husband's police work; This could explain why she whines and complains so much every time she has to go to work. Although it doesn't explain why he loves him so much every time he gets up in the morning and can read about his murderous escapades. - It's pretty typical for police officers. kidnappings, kill tons of people on three different occasions and stop a number of more millions of millions of illegal deals a week. <br /> <br /> - If you're trying to lose a car that follows you, it's wise to continue driving under speed limits. And if you're watching a cop, subtlety isn't important - you can close it for miles and then park next to it. He'll notice. <br /> <br /> - All cops are experienced martial artists. <br /> <br /> - It is possible to kick a man at a distance of four meters. People scream or grunt in pain when they are punched or kicked, but when they have their hand broken, they don't make a sound. Bad guys clean their bloody axes with handkerchiefs, and leave them for a few days in your pocket. - Pieces of wood that tear on a sudden wound break solid ladders at six or more places at the same time. <br /> <br /> - Photos and special features listed on the back of the DVD are not necessarily on DVD. Advertised Interactive Offers? Why not any menu at all! Advertised Scene Index? Why not the whole thing as one scene / chapter and you don't need an index! Likewise, it is okay to use the font and name of the Matrix in the tag tag and not be rip-off in any way. As a result, I am shocked that 12 out of 15 top actors never participated.
