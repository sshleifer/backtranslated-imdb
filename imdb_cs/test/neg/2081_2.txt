Paul Mazursky is missing on this film. Fonts, direction, casting and gaming (with the exception of Victorio Gassman) are off the mark. I remember the reviews of 20 years and over, which are average, but I thought it was worth seeing. Of course, with remarkable ones like Susan Sarandon, Raul Julia (who overcomes most of her scenes) and John Cassavetes, I expected much more. The music chosen for this film is unpleasant, the cuts between New York and Greece are confusing, and the overall pace everyone wants is very desirable. Why Paul Mazursky felt the need to update this story or add a touch to it that is mysterious - this story of Prosper and his daughter takes very little import from the game and is no more. The game is not so much one of Shakespeare's best games and it doesn't seem to be a good decision yet. Unfortunately, there is nothing recommended in this movie.
