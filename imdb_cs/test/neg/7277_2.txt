The hills have eyes, there is no big movie of any imagination. They look almost normal for one of the villains, not what you would expect the madmen to look like. characters repeating. That means there's a lot of fill in the movie, with lots of running aimlessly. The film had no clear direction. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre came out a few years earlier and is a much more effective film in horror. once suppose that music was used to hide the fact that not much is happening in most of the movie, even though it has failed in its intended purpose. he was basically still looking at the time every few seconds, hoping something would happen or end. when something finally promised Film was destroyed by mere chaos and loud noise.i sat through it because I like to make the film benefit from doubts. get to any kind of paycheck, if you can call that.my buddy enjoyed it, so at least one of us got some of it. The Hills Have Eyes Not The Worst Movie We Could Watch, But I Doubt I Will Watch It Again. se. Someone running around your block, shouting your head, stay away from this movie. a better bet would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973) 1.5 * of 10 *, which is generous
