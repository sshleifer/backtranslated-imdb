I have to admit that many of the many movies I've seen must be one of the worst. I was shocked to find out that the job was 1.5 million Budget. When it started, I thought the opening sequence was pretty good for this kind of movie, quite standard, but just as good. But as the film progressed, I began to feel clearly uncomfortable with the lack of tempo I saw, each sequence seeming to take hours. The reason for this was that the film was bored for tears, nothing was done except for infinite accusations, confused by confused flashbacks and the occasional bout of bad mood. Well ... after wading at what felt like the life of these scenes, we finally reached the great finale ... of all the singing, all the dance demonstrations of how the lack of imagination can completely destroy what might have been a good movie. Overall, I found that this movie is predictable and lengthy, and I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone other than the people I don't like personally, but if you have a few hours to waste and want to watch a thriller that's not even remotely frightening, This is a movie for you.
