I love most Jet Li movies (with the exception of the Romeo Must Die) and I bought this movie in VERY cheap three-packs with "The Master" and "Twin Warriors". While the Twin Warriors were very impressive and I was thoroughly impressed, and the champion was a little "Karate Kid" but also enjoyable, I thought this movie was horrible. I'm not just saying this because I'm used to better movies. I say it was almost there with "Kazaam". Combat scenes were horrible (blurred cameras and no real fighting) and the storyline was your typical "stupid kung fu conspiracy". If you have a conspiracy this stupid (see 'Man turns into a woman to become all-powerful then he falls in love with Jet Li'), you have the best of any great fight to go with him. If you're looking for an original HK Jet Li movie, I suggest you borrow "Shaolin Temple 2" (aka Kids from Shaolin).
