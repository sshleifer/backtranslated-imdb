For the first time I watched this show hoping for a few laughs, a good acting performance and a good plot. Unfortunately, I didn't get any of these things. First, this show is completely unrealistic. How can someone go to a boarding school that is a super hip, amazing location and hardly any rules? Plus sushi bar. SUSHI BAR. No school has a sushi bar. And what's going on with huge, ultra-cool, ultra-modern dorms? This won't happen in boarding schools! Everyone in this show seems to be perfect. Zoey, looks perfect, has perfect friends, never does homework and is super popular. Sounds like a plot for me! I hate how they use so many clich√©s in this show, Example: Dana skating cat. She is completely ignorant and wears "nervous" clothes. Jokes are also old sooooo old! I'm not gonna watch this show, if I were you, it's one of the worst shows I've ever seen and I hope it will be canceled soon! Rating: 1/10
