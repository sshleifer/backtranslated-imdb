Being a former MST3k guard, though I found this film unnoticeable. Terrible attempts at humor-heck scary attempts at acting. No one needs to read this piece of junk. <br /> <br /> I like how all the positive reviews were clearly written by members or family friends. Just click on their other reviews and wow - they're all reviewing Modern Vampires. Give me a few bucks and I can make a movie better than that. One of the most competent films I've ever seen and it says something. Watch at your own risk. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10
