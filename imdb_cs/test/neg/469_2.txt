How to take Charles Darwin's fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a cub. His pivotal and key ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are intact, with the exception of two short scenes claiming to be "killing God"; pure demagogy to make the film emotional. And the rest of the film is attached to this purpose: it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with exaggerated music that one must cry. Anyone who has actually read the "Origin of Species" would be vividly aware that there was no violation with God in any of Darwin's works; on the contrary, awe and awe and a new revolutionary way of looking at things have increased. A good film about Darwin could be educational, thoughtful and deeply inspiring, even in a religious sense - but that would be contrary to the intentions of the soap opera of this film. It is a movie that is designed to make people moan in fancy sympathy and then feel transformed, though they can't understand why; it makes rapid use of Darwin's big name just as a marketing influence, as one would drop the famous name at the party to create an impression. Sadly, the sets and costumes are so good: production values, except writing, were obviously high. See if you want to cry because of the loss of intelligence in American literature.
