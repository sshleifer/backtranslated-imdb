This was offered as a sequel to Crash Dive, which was a very good movie in the low budget category. I assumed that this film would also be good, but the boy was wrong. First, this movie has nothing to do with Crash Dive before both take place on submarines. Secondly, the conspiracy may be slow, tedious, and in some cases completely nonsensical. This movie doesn't keep the attention of most people. (I remember reading a book during slow, boring scenes.) There will be scenes to be used for a dramatic effect, making the viewer laugh aloud. The corkscrew scene is definitely one. Having overcome my initial shock that someone would slip in and not know that people would believe it, it would not only believe it, but laughed at its utter stupidity, I was able to find humor in it. <br /> <br /> you want to see MD in a good sub movie, watch Crash Dive and leave this lame movie on the shelf.
