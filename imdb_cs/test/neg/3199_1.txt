Quite probably one of the biggest waste of celluloid for the last 100 years. Not only does it suffer from a painfully (and extremely predictable) discontinuous scenario, but it is clearly a carbon copy of Aliena II. Within five minutes I correctly predicted who would die and who (and in what order). Special effects are ridiculous; there is a scene where one crew member is thrust (unconvinculyly) by two Krites that look like a pair of teddy bears, and the sparse humor is poorly placed and severe. There are better things to do with the VCR remote than to use it to watch this movie.
