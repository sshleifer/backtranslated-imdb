Seriously, I don't understand how Justin Long is ever more popular. He has either the best agent in Hollywood or recently sold his soul to Satan. It is almost unbearable to look at the screen, it has very little charism and terrible comic timing. The only film he was trying to dock and enjoyed remotely was Waiting ... and that's just because I worked in a restaurant. But I turn. Aside from being a terrible lead, this film has a lot of other debits. I understand that this is supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean she has to completely insult our intelligence and have such incredibly hacked writing that it borders on the offensive. The considerable talent of Lewis Black is also unnecessary here, because he is most flammable when he is unlimited, which definitely does not allow PG-13 to score. The only clear film was Jonah Hill (who will appear almost unknowable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in between). His one liner was occasionally fun, but it wasn't enough to make it almost bearable. If you just want to completely transform your brain (or even better, you don't have it), then you would like it, but I can't recommend it at all.
