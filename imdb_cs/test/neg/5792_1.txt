This movie hurt me. I don't get it ... things happened, inexplicably, and it usually led to someone bursting into a song and a dance number. I don't understand how people can praise this movie. There are B-movies, and then there are B-musicals, and then there's Rockula. The song made me run headlong into the wall. The only austerity grace is that one of the music explosions turns out to be a music video that relieves pain but still cannot justify why it must have existed. The scariest part of the film is Toni Basil's creeping dance, which accompanies her strange song. But on the clear side she manages to find the notes she is looking for, unlike the pop music feelings of Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona ... wow, we can say the tone deaf. So if you want to challenge life for about 90 minutes, check out this movie. If you hate your life, then buy it.
