This movie is so bad they wouldn't buy it at my local CD / DVD store. I only have it because it was in the box I bought for the masterpiece "Deadfall". The store bought two more movies that I sold from a set of four discs, but wouldn't buy back Underworld, and the other two films redefined the position, so what does it say about this movie? So I tried to sell it back to another store that even bought back a budget DVD that you could buy for a dollar in a local store, but they wouldn't even buy back Underworld either. This film is bad at all levels, and is one of those that came out in the post-Tarantino-clone supersaturation in the mid 90s. The only easily redeemable feature is Dennis Leary, who tells Joe Montegne he is a "smelly friend" and calls him "Stinky Friend Master". This line is so beautifully horrible that I can't help but quote it at least once a week when I describe a smelly friend. But now that I have refreshed you with a quote, you do not have to go through the pain of watching this movie.
