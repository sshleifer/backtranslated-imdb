I tried to follow this adaptation, but it was so horrible that I couldn't be so tortured. The performance was quite subpar, except for Ariel. Fonda was on top in a role that should be dealt with some subtlety. I studied Shakespeare and saw many adaptations, which is by far the worst I've ever seen. I have to wonder why someone made this film on Earth. Shakespeare can and was in many cases beautifully modified. This is not one of them. If you have to watch this movie, can I suggest a drinking game? Make a drink every time they leave the book from the original idea and two drinks each time Fonda plays. You should be pretty drunk in a very short time.
