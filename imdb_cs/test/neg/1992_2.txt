Cowardly and cynically, "The Hospital" presents the nadir special brand of Paddy Chayefsky's status quo, which is masked as a satire. <br /> <br /> Thanks to clever director Arthur Hiller, this sad script gets a visually ugly scenario. , the poorly stimulated presentation they deserve. Only George C. Scott's brilliant performance, in the sense that he was born a game, keeps the "Hospital" in complete disaster. Ironically, Scott's performance brings a bad service to the audience. His magnetism keeps them on tracking when they could shut down the VCR and clean the cabinets, watch the clouds, or watch the "Baywatch" recap. Anyone who emotionally invests in set-up modern medicine seems to be gone amok will feel cheated by a desperate reward where Chayefsky reveals that the system works fine, so stop your carping. While the first half of this film provides some fun black comedies, it all turns out to be red herring. Before it clears, Chayefsky gives Scott some good lines like his middle age, middle class, white male stand-in. Bitter, Alcoholic, Impotent, Scott's Dr. he has alienated those who know him best, and has bile to be alienated from them. Of course, in Chayefsky's view of the world, all of this makes the Bocka Magnet a hippie chick half his age. Playing a collection of adjectives, longhair, longhair, braless and almost bust-less Diana Rigg fights in part of the girl. British Rigg is miscast as a southwestern free spirit, but every other actress would fight as well. As well as the rest of the good cast that has fallen away, Rigg cannot overcome a scenario that is not interested in any character except Bock or philosophy beyond banality. <br /> <br /> For George C. Scott fans, this is another star to turn around and worth watching. For black comedy fans, turn off after the first 45 minutes. Don't bother anyone else.
