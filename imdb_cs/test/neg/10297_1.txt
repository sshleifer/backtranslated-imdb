That must be the worst thriller I've ever seen. Direction, acting, and story adaptations leave what would probably be a good conspiracy to wasted time. Within minutes of watching the movie, it was easy to find out the whole plot, and then there were many more obvious tracks that left no mystery. I guessed it in the first few minutes and I was hoping I was wrong and I was a lot of anger that I wasn't. a spree that left three witnesses, a young girl, a drug addict and a cop. They are led by an interview under the cameras separately and everyone says their account of the day. Everyone has something to hide and the day develops when they tell their accounts. This part seems to be a saving grace and could be improved if it were developed. Spoiler: The whole story ends with FBI agents being real killers, and the young girl is the only one who means it is what they don't interfere with. Why are they going through a whole charade of interviews with three witnesses and sticking to a young girl if their idea was to kill them first? How did they get away with pretending to be FBI agents (if you find that the actual FBI agents were killed and their badges were found on them)? How did they know how to set up and use cameras? Bill Pullman and Julia Ormond are so unconvincing from start to finish. Perhaps it is the end of the idea to develop their characters for revelation. Come on, they both look ridiculous, stupid and least ominous. The character of a young girl is also unnecessary potential. There is no sense of her actions and no meaning she prefers to tie up with her suffering. It does not look desperate but rather separate, which is not yet explained. Playful movie on the whole.
