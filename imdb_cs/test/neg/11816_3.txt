The title will largely allow you to know what you get. It's Grade-C howling, but not as extremely funny as I hoped. Directed by the film exploitation director Eddie Romero of a story originally from Jonathan Demme (long before he directed "Silence of the Lambs" and "Philadelphia"), this low budget movie was apparently filmed in the Philippines but set in anonymous film. third world countries. Playing the pedaling and petty drug dealer Lee Daniels, blaxploitation superstar Pam Grier plays the first half of the title role, while the long forgotten Margaret Markov is the second half, Karen Brent, the unlikely politics-like Patty Hearst political revolution. her comrades overthrew the repressive local government. Naturally hostile to each other, they are in a women's prison camp, wearing inexplicably bright yellow miniskirts like uniforms. The jail is guided by a hidden guard and a lush matron and is just an excuse for a lengthy shower scene, and some half-hearted feline warriors like Lee and Karen are facing each other. Of course they were running, but they tied together the "The Defiant Ones" and continued to fight the cats until they attacked a few nuns to steal their habits. Meanwhile, they are in different groups of indecent men. persecution - lute drug lord looking for Lee, who stole $ 40K from him, rather passive revolutionaries looking for Karen, and incompetent police (who suffered from humiliation to expose his soldiers to the drug lord). Needless to say, everything will eventually come to the head, but not before the gratuitous nudity of many Filipino women, the dog wears Karen's panties and some of the worst men's fashion in the seventies (one revolutionary of beer-bellieda wears a straight-headed halter top). face). There is a somewhat sad ending, but what is really sad is how much of a potential black comedy is missing completely in this cheerfully absurd exercise. Sadly, Grier is disappointing in this trip because her character doesn't have much to do but to deal with all the "jive" while Markov is an amazon blonde that I believe is desperate to be credible. Since no one shows any talent for acting, the rest of the cast is not to be noticed, besides the bald, bug-eyed Sid Haiga, who uses his standard psycho persona as a drug master. DVD 2003 contains only original trailer.
