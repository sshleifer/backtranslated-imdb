*** BIG SPOILERS! 1970's "Flesh Feast" is more than an unworthy conclusion to Veronica Lake's great career. It has a great reputation for being a terrible stinker, and I have to say it right. As a huge fan of low-budget horror / exploitation, especially from the 1970s, I decided to watch it, mainly because of the great image that looks at the camp on this site, but after watching it, I had to realize that the picture really has nothing to do with the film. The image on this page is a cover of a DVD collection called "Flesh Feast", which includes four films, including Sergio Martin "The Mountain of the Cannibal God" and Dal Tenney's "I Eat Skin". But what this collection doesn't have is a boring turkey. "Flesh Feast" is not only camp and ridiculous, but mostly quite boring, which is even more pathetic that the film is only 70 minutes long. Also, don't be fooled by the title, the movie isn't bloody at all. However, it is observable if it's just for his trashiness and especially the extremely stupid but therefore somewhat funny ending. The film follows the absurd conspiracy of Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake), a brilliant scientist who can somehow restore youth with carnivorous worms (don't ask how). A bunch of criminals (or terrorists, or anything) who is paid by a radical political group, instructs the doctor to restore the youthful "mysterious" commander. After an endless hour of meaningless drama, it turns out that the mysterious commander is actually Hitler himself. It was already quite obvious, but I still had to laugh because the film's final was so incredibly stupid and unintentionally cheerful ... This is a movie that is the last movie of a great actress and former beauty queen like Veronika Jezero. With the exception of the lake, performances are ridiculously bad, even for zero-budget production. However, poor performance is something I can easily forgive in films like this. But what I can't forgive is extreme boredom. In the last five minutes, this is traceable to hardcore camp stuff fans, but I would recommend skipping it.
