Warning KazisvÄ›ta !!! <br /> <br /> This is probably my favorite movie, Cary Grant. I spent most of my time thinking: ignoring it, leaving it, etc. Trying to kill it? Should we assume that after she finishes convincing her to come home with him, she'll eventually kill her? I see from control in several books that this is a reading that some viewers / critics have taken. Completion is soon after all a more sensible way to film a book than to change the end - and this is a more disproportionate change of ending than, for example, in Altman Long Goodbye. Unlike Hitchcock's earlier example, that a killer is not a killer because the star was cast (when Gosford Park refers to The Lodger, the murderous habits of Ivor Novella are not mentioned), the book is definitely not excluded. In Robin Wood's film Hitchcock's Revisited, he writes: "As one mentally" swiches "from end to end, the meaning of each scene varies, the apparent strength of the story dissolves, the illusion of fiction's" reality "disintegrates , film becomes a "modernist" text in which the narrative process is told. I enjoy playing intellectual interpreting games just like anybody else, but if the movie doesn't stay in direct reading then it fails. This one will fail. Even after considering deadly glasses of milk that are repeated in several Hitchcock movies. <br /> <br /> Annoying question. The year is 1941. Nothing in the film says it's set in the past. Beaky (Nigel Bruce) holds his money in a Parisian bank and goes to financial business there? Doesn't she know it's war? Indeed, were there any flights from Croydon Airport? Is he in good relations with the Nazis? How come it was never suggested that the Germans shot him as a spy or something. Curiosity. When Johnnie and Lina have dinner with Isobel, a secret writer and her brother, a pathologist, there is a fifth person who is never explained or introduced - a woman in a tuxedo. Credits say it's Nondas Metcalf playing Phyllis Swinghurst. Isn't that an example of how lesbians were coded in the 1940s? Should we marry her as lover of Isobel? Books that discuss overt and hidden gay / lesbian lesbians in Hitchcock (eg Robin Wood again) do not include Phyllis Swinghurst.
