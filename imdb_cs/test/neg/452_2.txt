Rose ?? Did something happen in this episode? It represents our two conductors, a slow witty idiot doctor and a totally uninteresting companion. There is no storyline, childish humor, mixed with some extremely poor stimulation and random music. What else is there to say? <br /> <br /> The End of the World ??? Marginal improvement in seeing our first universe scenario. Subsequently, he reduced poor contemporary humor, paper-thin logic, very poor stimulation, and tired SF cliche. Unquiet Dead ??? The best episode so far shows what can happen when someone knows how to structure an episode, write an interesting character dialogue and integrate an interesting chart. Let go of a doctor and a rose. Foreigners from London / Third World War - A doctor who degenerates into a farce. What more can be said. Penelope Wilton brought a little gravity control, trying to do her best in bad circumstances. In these two episodes there are some misspelled and on-site elements of soap opera and a return to poor stimulation, poor rendering and deception worthy of humor / satire. <br /> <br /> Dalek ?? It's not great but still far above the RTD price. Stimulation and script are fine (though the doctor and the rose are still irritating). The effects and threats of Dalek are well established. However, the finals captivated the interesting premise that reduced the doctor's most famous enemy, into the plush untouchable mess, and turned a previously unseen threat into a blue rubber octopus that looked like a child's toy. The Long Game - The first RTD script to display any graph, even though it was in the style of a clich√© in the 1980s. Yet it was somewhat marked by his usual over-dependence on juvenile jokes that made her too far in the future to be a logical sense and again a poor stimulation. It's not as bad as his previous efforts, but immediately forgotten. Father's Day? The initial assumption could be vaguely interesting, but common sense and logic leave this episode from the outset. We are also working on the entire episode of Soap Opera. Before you start thinking, it's all about characterization, remember, there's a big difference between lame soap opera and characterization. On the plus side, this proves that RTD is not yet the worst writer. Blank Child / Doctor Dances - It started in a moderate way, with some cruel moments, and some illogical mistakes a primary school pupil would not make (well lit windows in a power outage, anyone?). After this, the first part takes a more interesting and sinister turn. Florence Hoath really steals these episodes and shows us how an interesting companion might be. She could also act. Instead, we get annoying and politically correct Captain Jack as a new companion. The conclusion was rather hasty, but sufficient. Stimulation and script improved with a fairly good story, so these two episodes were quite atmospheric and interesting. Boom Town - I have to be honest, with a few examples, I was so disillusioned with the current series that when I saw the trailer for the next episode 'Slitheen', I gave up and didn't do I don't care about torture. Bad Wolf - Reality TV, probably the worst aspect of modern media, is basically used as a premise. There is no subtlety. Do we get any interesting social commentary like Running Man or Truman Show? No, of course not. This in the RTD episode, so they are basically here cynically try and retract the audience of the shows. The logic comes out of the window again, because we'll be 200,000 years in the future. RTD is trying unnecessarily to try shoes in some "exaggerated" story without it being different from its own existence, and when the villains reveal themselves ... They evoke empty threats and the doctor smiles again. idiot to the top! A faster pace for the most part than other RTD efforts, it has one or two interesting moments. Otherwise, a more insignificant installment. <br /> <br /> Separation of Tours - Grand Final. More humid octopus, literally. All the Dalek threats set in 'Dalek' is brought down by crashing down because they are becoming rather pathetic. So many episodes of the hole cover so many holes with typically weak controversies. Daleks want to reap people like Daleks, but then vaporize entire continents? Dalek's couples can vaporize the continents, but not destroy the Tardis in space? Now the Tardis is indestructible and can land anywhere, even over humans, to be saved in it? This ability cannot be used to easily destroy Dalek's "God"? The Daleks can vaporize entire continents, but not just the null satellite 5, to destroy the doctor and instead let it play? The doctor is a pathetic coward without conviction of his actions, after eradicating all of his kind to try to remove Dalek? These and many other holes aside, are processed to lamest dues ex machina solutions sometimes conceived, coupled with an almost insignificant arc of the story. <br /> <br /> What can we say about the new series, all-in-all? If it was anything other than Doctor Who, with RTD behind him? Would most of the episodes be perceived as something other than non-genuine and forgotten, if it were anything other than Dr. Whoa and the name of the RTD appended? I think not. Some people would think we can't say anything against RTD because we owe him for bringing Doctor Who back to our screens. However, at the expense of good characters and stories. Personally, I'd rather not have a badly planned, poorly conceived product, scared at that price. I'd rather wait for someone to come and make a real effort. For the most part, it is a kind of Cumpan waste that gives SF a bad name, and marring what is otherwise the most creative genre.
