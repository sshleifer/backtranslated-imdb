Ben Affleck, who is about to marry, is shaken by an air accident and engages with one of the other passengers (Sandra Bullock, who is forced to act crazy). Who's to blame for this awkward, ugly morass? It's so badly edited when I looked into credits, it wasn't to read the editor's name - to see if the man actually took the credit! Filled with clich√©s, controversies and Sandra Bullock's make-up with raccoon eyes, the film is not even interested in creating chemistry between the two main characters. Laughter does not exist: a scene in a gay bar with Affleck could make a laugh if it wasn't so stupid (bar patron - a big fool of them! - scream at Affleck to get rid of and start kicking cash). It should have no other meaning than getting Ben to relax a little, but the direction of the entire scene is poorly guided and the result is invisible because the idiotic editor is cutting off ... or was that the movie he had? It's a small moment, but it's typical of this movie, an amateur piece of pop art that wants to be a nervous modern comedy but has no guts. Made to fit the bottom shelf in the video store. * of ****
