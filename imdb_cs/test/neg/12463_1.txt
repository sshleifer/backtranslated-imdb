I just wish I had a good sense to turn this movie off at the beginning when I knew it was awful. Instead, I gave him the advantage of doubt and waited for him to improve. <br /> <br /> Don't make the same mistake I did. <br /> <br /> The title has nothing to do with film. The film has nothing to do with the real world. The plot has nothing to do with the land. Acting consists of a guy who wants to be John Cusack but can't pull him out. The leader is a girl trying to be Claire Daines. Sadly, he can't even pull it out. They are in love, though God knows only why. And in the end, I was hoping everyone would kill each other so I couldn't believe any of these children would pollute the world again.
