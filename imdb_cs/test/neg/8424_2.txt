Forget any document that is uncertain! This movie is really out and out of comedy about a 40-year-old porn star whose goal in life is to sing junky songs to a party party. Only problem? Colton Ford can't sing! And the film cuts off whenever it seems ready to burst into the song. Still, Ford, as well as Vapid's friend Blake Harper, whine and run around in their tanks, determined to fulfill their dreams. Even a funnier is a "manager" of Kyle who seems to have I.Q. from turnip and whose collagen-like lips look like a bee stabs him. How can adult men be so confident? Bwa ha ha! As for the documentary, the filmmakers do not seem to have POV and the film is poorly structured and wildly uneven. Very little background information is available about these three leads. Such inclusion could cause the three to appear to be something other than the aging of Hollywood stereotypes.
