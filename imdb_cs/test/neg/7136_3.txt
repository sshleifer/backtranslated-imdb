Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) travels to Tokyo to explore the mysterious disappearance of her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and is trapped in the same mysterious curse that so many people have killed. With a group of others trying to curse and end the curse for good. <br /> <br /> Grudge 2 plays everything from the first again and produces just a few scares. The first Grudge was at best an average movie. The assumption was decent, but the acting was wooden and some scenes were really ridiculous. Grudge 2 is even more stupid and less frightening than the original. Also, Scary Film 4 made it almost impossible to take these films seriously and I had difficulty keeping a straight face during "scary scenes" which should encourage laughter more than fear. As Takashi Shimizu spoiled his own series, he was inexplicable, yet he managed to create a decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, the film held a slow pace with a bunch of dull characters and poor tactics. It is clear that he made this film for money and I am glad that it failed. The script was pretty bad, mainly because it didn't make sense and the characters didn't develop at all. Three different stories were made in the film, and each of them involved "grudges" in some way. The connection was weak and a group of people were killed without a real reason. The rules of the curse do not explain very well and it ended up being a little blood bath, because everyone is dying, even though PG-13 has kept things interesting, so even some death scenes were lame. The dialogue was weak and none of the characters were sympathetic or developed enough to care for it. Acting was on par with everything else and it was much worse than the first. Amber Tamblyn was uncomfortably wooden. She moved slowly on the screen and all her emotions seemed false. Sarah Michelle Gellar was fine, though she had only a portrait. Jennifer Beals gave the best performance, had some good scenes and was so effective. Arielle Kebbel was all right, a little bland. The rest was either horrible or just too forgotten. Overall, Grudge 2 was a disappointing sequel. She was missing a lot of things and it's not good to watch. Rating 4/10
