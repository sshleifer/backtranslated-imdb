This film is full of pseudo-deep thought and it's cloning in its writer-ness, which includes canned-ham-voice-over and some incredible dialogue. Dialogue that is tinny and tone deaf way to Spike sometimes (not always) is when writing "certain" characters. For those who like senseless movies like Pieces of April and One Hour Photo, it's more for you. This comment is nothing against Ryan Gosling, who showed his amazing chops in The Believer. The film proves that films are the director's medium, and when the film is rotten, it is fair to say that the fault is there and not in the actors.
