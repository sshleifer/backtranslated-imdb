Couple with financial difficulties gets box delivered to their door. If they press the button, they get a million dollars, but someone they don't know will die. Press the button? This is a strange movie based on the short story of Richard Matheson, who has a few frosts, but mostly it's a chaotic matter. The trouble is, there is so much that it looks like writer Richard Kelly didn't know what movie he was doing. Is it a horror movie with a supernatural context? Sometimes it looks like it is about moral choices, damnation and afterlife. Is it a science fiction movie? Maybe there are lots of questions about this Mars project. And what are the strange looks that seem to have some big conspiracy? Is it Invasion of the Body Hijackers or Demonic Movie? Maybe I don't know. And this is a problem, there are many questions, most of which are interesting, but there are too many. There seems to be little explanation, and when we get to the end of the movie, things seem to stop, and then to the end (even at the open end). I'm for the creation of a film rich in motives and points, but writer Kelly fills her script with just too much that director Kelly can't handle or does so that every theme or plot plot gets ten minutes of screen. and for these minutes it holds the court before postponing the next bit. That scared me. (I'm not going to get into two leaders, Cameron Diaz and James Marsden, who aren't very good or more likely to know what to do from a material that is so shifting) <br /> <br /> It's a heady mixture that doesn't work (there are too many holes in the end). I got to the end and suddenly realized that I had no idea what I had just seen. I really didn't like it, but its more is not good because it just is missing. I would have a pass or wait for a cable where it would cost you nothing
