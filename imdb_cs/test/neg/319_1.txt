If you're looking for masochistic excitement, rent this movie and show it to your friends' group sober. This film is just a lame, but it's not entirely devoid of value. The short breasts are nice and the death of one victim is fun as hell. Other than that, it's straight garbage. But it's still better than "Grim" or "Spookies"
