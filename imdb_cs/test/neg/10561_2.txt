Maybe if he just laughed at how my favorite works of Jane Austen were depicted. Maybe I'm too hard on this adaptation, but I'm afraid I'm preoccupied with the A&E version. It was hard to imagine Mr. Darcy, whom someone other than Colin Firth portrayed. The characters seemed shallow and often forced. Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that was so evident in the book. Her fantasy for Wickham was overthrown, and then her sudden coincidence for Darcy was unbelievable. Darcy was pictured tolerantly well, I'll give it to him. He managed to keep the reserve that is needed, but I felt he was not showing the feeling and the inner struggle that made his character so pleasant, especially in the design scene. Mr Pan and Mrs. Bennet was also well played, but she was missing in many ways. Mrs Bennet's middle performance was not fully captured in her performance. Mr. Collins was a good picture. Very consistent with the book. I'm going to refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine, except she may be the worst depiction of the whole movie. Other Problems I saw few freedoms they took with the ranking of events such as Darcy being present at the first meeting with Lady C., and also that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy on her visit to Collins '. The choreography was terrible during the dance scenes. A scene in which Lizzy and Darcy dance lose much of their intensity, because one cannot overcome the feeling of akward on the ballroom floor. At least this version of the BBC missed a dialogue between Lizzy, Darcy and Sir William when they praise the two of their dance because they really did very badly. but overall, I consider this version to be a disappointment. I wouldn't say this movie if you're not like me, and you are excessively diverted by these feelings. <br /> <br />
