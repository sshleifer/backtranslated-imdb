This film is about a mysterious love letter that turned the love of life of 4 people upside down. The film's idea is interesting and the film could be funny. However, this movie is just what a romantic comedy shouldn't be. The characters are initially introduced inadequately, making it confusing. Supporting characters come and go without reason, as if they existed for one particular scene and then disappeared into the air. Stimulation is extremely slow, which means it takes 90 minutes more than 180 minutes. It could have been romantic and funny, but even this movie has failed.
