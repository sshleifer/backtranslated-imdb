I went to Blockbuster to look at some good old action movies. So I walked around the action section until this movie caught my attention, because the cover had a big bold letter SANDRA BULLOCK. Action movie with Sandra Bullock in it and is rated R!? YYY! Although I admit that I prefer it in comedy, but if it's like 'Speed' then I was sold. Unfortunately Sandra is really not in this movie, her role is smaller: "Panically kidnapped girlfriend" (She is fifth in the list of actors for Jeebus shake!) It seems she was her first role in the film (and after watching this movie, I'm came to Sandra is the only living person in this movie, everybody else could also be a Zombie in B-Horror Flick .This movie deceived me and said Sandra was the leader ... I fell for it as Biff of "Back to the Future" "when Marty screams" WHAT'S ... !!! "God, I wish I watched instead instead. <br /> <br /> Sandra is the only bright side of this movie every time she's on camera, it's like picking shock paddles and shouting "CLEAR!" to get these movies going, but that straight lines no matter how hard they try. More about Sandra later... <br /> <br /> The film is dim, very boring, think about the moment of Dullest in your life and then imagine that at this point you will be to live 110 minutes (this is the movie for me) This movie even somehow affects Gun Fights and Bullet time, so boring that Elephant Tranquilizers are ashamed. And the idea of ​​this Bullet Time movie is close to AK in a slow motion that taunts you because the caps protruding from it every second of your life as it slowly leaves. And I knew I was watching a bad movie because I found myself in a fast handover of "CEZ-ACTION!" Plot? . . . there was a conspiracy? Music? . . . even after the 1980s it is bad by default, but at least it's one thing that kept me awake. Acting? Sandra Bullock was good and. . ummm. . . posouvat se. Is it good because R is rated? Not if R does not mean Ridicules-snooze-fest. And it's really 80s Cliché when the movie opens with a view of the city (rocking guitar olives or power ballet) and ends with a gun fight in a gloomy factory with steel walkways and assorted pipes. They both meet these films. At the very least, this film determines from what time it is unnecessary, because Sandro's hair was shouting "80's !!!!" And the movie gets really ham when you are looking at a killer stripper to kill a nerd in the bathroom and stuff his body in a box that you react to sadly says, "This is probably the most action that a poor sap ever got." Another moment for Hammy is when some secret agents-Dude cover a crowd of people and this movie seems to think that people jump into the air and fall to the ground when they die. Everything the scene needed was Mario death ditty or maybe Contra sound effects, but Nintendo could sue. And it is sad when the main action hero of this film breaks away other better movie icons. Before the big scene on the gun, the hero Da found himself in a boxing ring ('Rocky' anyone?), Sports a leather fedora (not also 'Indiana Jones') with terrifying spot lights behind him (Terminator 2 before T-1000 owned). ) What really is really sad is that people on Youtube or Dailymotion can film better videos (with nothing less than a lousy webcam) than this movie. I'm serious, most Rant videos recorded with bad sound and blurred images are more fun than this movie. I can't even call this movie by it's name for it's very name to bring horrible memories of watching this cruel and unusual punishment (a scary violation of human rights!) The only bright spot in this dark abyss is Sandra's career began to take off thanks to this film . But oh Sandra. . . Why did you have to be in such a nightmare? The payout paid off. The DVD will also enchant you with a little story about Sandra, who is extra, seeing him as the only one of this movie that ended up being the name of the house. Which explains why this movie uses her name as bait for unsuspecting enthusiasts, Crafty Little Creature. I don't have much experience with bad movies, but I know BAD when I see it. I could go back from 'Maze and Monsters' with good old camps Bruce Willis comedy. But even Bruce couldn't encourage me after this movie. I haven't seen any Ed Wood or Uwe Boll yet, but I think I'm sent for them now. Because I can't even understand the film worse. . . "GAG". . . 'Hangmen'. . .
