After several failures, we are still waiting for a French horror, which critics will certainly desecrate, but will start a new trend. Not this time. Doug Headline cannot be accused of not knowing in this genre (he is an editor of a first-rate fantasy imprint, he has worked for the legendary Starfix magazine), but why the scenario that uses EVERY clich√© in the book (except perhaps Odious Comic relief)? Why is it so predictable? Even a nod toward Argento fails. It's not even a Euro-teen movie like the German "Anatomy", much better, just compiling scenes that barely have any relationship to one another and the LOTS feature plot holes. The whole Celtic aspect hardly touched. And after "revenge" the painfully predictable scenario offers us a boring, endless pursuit in an underground necropolis that seems to be larger than Paris catacombs. I really wanted to love this movie. Really. But even a mother wouldn't do it. And the writer Valerio Evangelisti was supposed to have a portrait, but I was looking for it in vain.
