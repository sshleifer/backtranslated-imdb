Whoever covers this silly idea of ​​playing and producing a film in Himesh's head, which is always hidden under his eyelid, almost half his face? I just hope it's the first and the last, also for God! From Assalam Valekum to Gayatri Mantra, Himesh tried every thing to create an aura of his so-called singing talent, which is nothing but a cruel pronunciation of words like Tanhaiyya that completely kills the beauty of terms so commonly used for love songs. Why doesn't Himesh smile? Easy because it doesn't use Close Up Toothpaste! Now there, his friend, who surrounded him all around, and this number one lawyer in a city that has to restrain itself and try to seduce Himesha, of all the handsome German people she might have met before, maybe the male lawyers on this section The world could be a curse of their fate, because every day they want to deal with a hard, unattractive amount! The action scenes are so wittily shot, like a thief's event planner, cars driving over cars, and so on. The bride's father seems to be in a great hurry to get rid of her daughter by marrying her, flying in and around. Mostly a hypocrite, he praises HR for distributing love between people in the world as if they were sweets, and on his back, coldly giving a lecture to his daughter on these men's business shows. when Himesh proved innocent, he recklessly gets rid of the other as if it were a music chair game! I didn't want the poor guy to face, did he? In the role of Rie, Hansika looks as if she needs an eye examination to make herself hard in her eyes! A boy as a friend is a good guy who has behaved quite naturally and should be in better movies like Sharman Joshi. Trisha's childlike artist is sweet but unnecessary. It seems that today's young generation is gone because they prefer this kind of ridicule of lyrics and musical scores, and gossip is associated with it, for example when you sing ek bar aaja, the ghost comes. this is a strange taste in music and rather funny. I am surprised how these classic lyricists, like Gulzar, have chosen Himesh of all people to release music. There is a story in Panchtantra that the crow attaches so much feathers to a peacock to look beautiful and attract birds; but feathers eventually fall away and the real dark crow is revealed! I hope Himesh takes the hint, and refrains from making such nonsensical things and wasting precious money he earned so that he brewed his nose so briefly! His friend tells him if you wear your nose, how do you sing? Thanks for showing us Germany, Himesh, for a reasonable price for renting a DVD! and correct the spelling mistakes, right? extra e in the movie and not in love! There is also a famous figure from the old movie Sholey, Mehbooba, on which Mallika Sherawat curls, again, but this time with Himesh, winking at her, and comfortably, Ria, his so-called true love, and his new bride is not nearby! Now it was very clever, Himesh! At least one thing in this movie that you made smart to justify the presence of Sherawat. But does it look a little rinsed?
