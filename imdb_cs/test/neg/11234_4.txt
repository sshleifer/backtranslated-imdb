"A lot of the movies I did could work just as well 50 years ago, and that's just because I have a lot of old fashion values." - Steven Spielberg <br /> <br /> Some points .. <br /> <br /> 1. Although this film is a free remake of "Guy Named Joe", it also borrows heavily from "Life and Death Matters" and "Wings of desire". 2. This was Spielberg's second attempt at being Frank Capra. 3. Spielberg often said that he wants to do "Frank Capra film" in the vein of "It's a Wonderful Life" and "Mrs. Smith Goes to Washington". Judging by his recent attempts to get a "Harvey" remake from the country, it seems that Spielberg still holds this dream, the director rightly dissatisfied with his last 3 businesses in Capracorn. 4. Critics at that time bashed "always", saying that complicated action sequences scattered from the romance movie, but it really is not a problem at all. The problem is that "always" needs much more special effects to distract us from the fact that Spielberg cannot film any dialogue line that doesn't end in an exclamation mark. 5. The movie is full of comedy that just doesn't work. Spielberg's comic tastes are not very sophisticated and seem to have been torn straight from the 1950s and Looney Tune cartoons. These exaggerated rumors can work in the cartoon of the universe, but in the movie it just looks like a special marriage. 6. The leading pair of the film meets as brother and sister, not lovers. Spielberg's films are always concerned about sex and intimacy, but this film goes into extreme lengths: it's a wisecracking tomboy and it's the old man's wisdom. They are more irritating than cute. 7. The film contains one good scene in which John Goodman argues with Holly Hunter, but mostly the characters of the film are uncomfortable. There is no subtlety, every emotion is played, every joke over the proposed, every sequence filled with unnecessary busyness. 8. "Always" and "Hook" taught Spielberg how to con audience. After their failure (and double financial failure of "color paint" and "Sun Empire") Spielberg blew crazy color cinematography "Colors of the Purple" and "Sun Empire" in favor of more desaturated "black and white worlds" Schindler's List "," Munich " , "Minority Report" and "Saving Private Ryan". From there, "less light" and "dark cinema" have become comparable to "serious themes." 9. After the financial success of each "dark film", Spielberg returns to his colorful cinematography and falls on his face again. "Amistad" followed "Schindler's List", "AI" followed "Ryan" and "Lincoln" will follow "Munich". These "color" movies are always excited to be too cheap, sentimental, sloping and hockey, but the truth is that if you remove desaturation, all these "serious" movies would feel the same. 10. Since the 1970s, Spielberg has tried to distinguish himself from other sponsor directors (Scorsese, De Palma, Coppola, etc.) by pretending to be an "optimist" and a "humanist". He would have repeatedly stated this during many interviews in the late 1970s. The reality is, however, that he is probably the greatest sadist of all these directors, a form of his films that often undermines their content, and their box office performances are always proportionate to their dazzling manifestations of bloodshed. 11. Spielberg's failure to connect with some characters in "Always", and the pleasure he reveals, instead, for filming forest fires, air-planes crashing etc, perfectly fills the remainder of his filmography. People running from dinosaurs, sharks, Nazis, tripods, rocks, etc ... that's what Spielberg delights. The moment his characters stop talking, they destroy everything themselves. The film like "Amistad" has failed, in other words, because there were not enough blacks and too many whites spoke. 12. Flying movie scenes are not up to the standard set a few years earlier in the mega-hit "Top Gun". Of course, when your "enemy" is a forest fire, it's hard to do things in the cinema. 13. Failures like "1941", "Hook", "Always" etc. are often more illuminating that Spielberg's more successful films. Under this technique they reveal a steel frame. They show how the amusement park ride looks when it doesn't work and reveals a vacuum under a broken machine. <br /> <br/> 5/10 ?? There is one good succession (two actors in the room, just improvising), but this is usually an annoying picture with a predictable scenario. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing.
