The story of a man's love for an innocent child who finds himself with a disfigured face and on the opposite side of the world had a shallow self-centered "girl's valley" that shares her date of birth with a big difference in both. lives. This is a great story. But in this narration, screen writing and / or directing and / or editing is so bad that most of the joy can be extracted from the story. Linda Hamilton's character goes from understanding mom to evil witch and back faster than bullet, and for what purpose? Conflict, conflict, conflict, falling hat. Katie (a Californian girl) and her boyfriend, Katie's mom and everyone, including a poor lady at the airport check-in counter, adopted by Lin, who is the most beautiful, most loved man alive, and his wife and biological son. constant conflict. I really wanted to enjoy a pleasing story, but the only thing that made me feel SMILE was when all the hatred and fighting ended. There were too many inexplicable or illogical events, many of which do not contribute to the story. My wife and I were looking at each other and asking ourselves how such a good cast and what should be a great story could wrap up so badly.
