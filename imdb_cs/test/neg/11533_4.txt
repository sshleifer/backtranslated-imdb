The only reason one of the hundreds of users watched this movie was because they belonged to the crew, they were friends of the crew, or they were obsessed with fans of either Lance Henriksen or Lorenzo Lamas. I personally follow the "Lance cult", so I was disappointed to see that despite being a headliner, it's just in the title. Playing rich criminal Newcastle, Lance is a pleasure to watch but all his screen time is ranked at the beginning of the movie. Newcastle prepares a 747 heist that includes Ketchum (Lamas) and lots of forgotten characters. The biggest shock of this viewer was that the scenes in front of the heist were not so bad. Except for the somewhat unpleasant and somewhat confused view of Aviva Gale, who times every line of class excellence playing an actress, acting was decent all around, and none of the lines really crouched on me. But once the robbery comes, the film falls asleep. Not only is their plan the funniest thing he has ever captured on film, but it's been stretching too long. This is not a very deep movie and you have to complete 90 minutes, but these scenes are so boring that I nodded almost two o'clock in the afternoon. It is especially difficult to get into one particular sequence in which we watch each and every character again and again. The name of the movie is "Rapid Exchange", but the exchange is far from fast - it's too long and bloated to extremes. Maybe it would work if any of the characters had real personalities, but it comes up so much that you can ask a direct video on Showtime Extreme. Fortunately, there are a few laughs, deliberate and unintentional (Lorenzo Lamas is seemingly a master of disguise, which is for a few incredibly bizarre scenarios) and Lance returns to the end of the movie, though for a short time. It's a bad movie and I probably didn't have to say it, but it's far from the worst I've ever seen. I wouldn't do it too high on the list of Henriksen movies because he was in some real gems with more screen time, and so though the movie starts to lose a lot of steam once the robbery starts, but the best thing I can say about Rapid Exchange is that the last two the movies I watched before it was a mainstream hostage and overrated, flashy Crash - and that was better than both.
