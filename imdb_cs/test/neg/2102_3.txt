Snakes on the train starts as a Mexican couple Brujo (A.J. Castro) & Alma (Julia Ruiz) cross the US border crossing, then illegally board a 17-hour train to Los Angeles. But Alma's family disagreed with her and Bruj's relationship and put an old black magic curse on her that turns all her guts into snakes, not life b? As snakes pour out of Alma's mouth and slip into other parts of the train, they begin to infect other passengers with the same unusual disease ... Modified and controlled by Mallachi Brothers (although IMDb says it's just one person who uses a pseudonym, Peter Mervis) one has to say that I thought Snakes on the train is crap, it's so simple that it really is. It seems that the whole movie was set to cash on Samuel L. Jackson's cult film Snakes on an Airplane (2006) by every horror fan of the least popular Asylum production company, which specializes in ripping large Hollywood budgets. evident than here with Snakes on the train, so the film is just because the title rhymes with a more successful film, not a good starting point. Eric Forsberg's script is a waste, for Snakes to start on the plane was great fun, while Snakes on the train is much more serious and when you actually break it and look at it, it should have been much easier. In fact, it would probably work better than a lot of Scary Movie (2000). You know something, I'm trying to find one positive thing to say about Snakes on Train, it's so bad. For starters, garbage is impossible and it is impossible to emotion with anyone, the story is terribly horrible and makes no sense (unless people spew out all the little snakes where the huge ones come from? Why did Alma turn into a giant snake on Why Bujo killed the driver? How did the train stop once he arrived in Los Angeles, where did the typhoon come from ending?), it takes too seriously, the first seventy odd minutes are so boring and carefree I'm surprised I stayed awake and it's just a very, very bad movie at almost every level . <br /> <br /> Director Mervis has just a few car seats that look almost the same, making the film very repetitive and boring. There is hardly blood or gore, there are some snakes to lend under several skin peoples, someone gets shot & that's about it. Special effects are also garbage, the huge CGI snake in the end is really horrible and the least he said, the better. It's not scary, there's a zero atmosphere and it's a bit of drilling from start to finish. Real living snakes are also a problem, they are just so docile and untouched. If you look at any scene that contains a real snake and actor, the snakes never move to them or act aggressively, and in fact they always seem to want to slip in the opposite direction. Technically, the movie is probably a low budget and it's a show, basically it looks cheap because it is. Acting is not great that actors have no material to work with. The snakes on the train are trash, I'm sorry, but that's what I feel and don't know how to describe it otherwise. I really can't see what anyone would see from watching snakes on a train, it's really so bad.
