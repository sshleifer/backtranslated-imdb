This movie looks great and that's where my praise ends. "Love Is Many Splendored Thing" came out in the very schizophrenic year of 1955, when candy-colored nonsense like this co-existed with the trail-blazing art fair as "Kiss Me Deadly." As a trend towards smaller, socially conscious films such as "On the Waterfront" and "Marty" settled in the mid-1950s, other directors felt the need to stick to the unquestionable, panding melodrama that classifies so many other films from this decade and "Love" is one of the latter. This is a kind of 50th movie where Technicolor is used to his blatant maximum and lighting is always high-key; even scenes in the dark room or at night are brighter than the average sunny day. I never want to hear the theme song again, because in the course of the movie, it is often enough to last for a lifetime, and I definitely don't want to hear it being sung by a shrill choir that penetrates the ears over the end titles. Jennifer Jones and William Holden are passable, but someone could really play these parts. Jones's role is terribly written - her character is incredibly inconsistent, and when her character has to decide something, the screenwriters have flipped the coin to decide what decision to make. Undoubtedly, people will tell me that I took this film too seriously, that I am non-romantic, etc. But I loved "All That Heaven Allows", which was released the same year, and like Cornball in its own way, except Douglas. Sirk is able to turn melodrama into an art form, while Henry King (director of "Love") is not. I am usually able to enjoy the bad melodrama, but in this case I was bored. <br /> <br /> Level: D +
