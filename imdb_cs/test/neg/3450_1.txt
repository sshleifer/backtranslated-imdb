That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Cinematography was boring, with long boring shots (like a camera on a stage play filming tripod) scattered by "dramatic" angles that made little sense of content on screen. The cut was terrible, scenes along with the butcher's subtlety. The storyline hanging on the viewer was familiar with the historic night in which Mary Shelley wrote frankenstien. Acting was enforced, with a type of character development that left you with an intense interest in seeing each one die terribly (the sooner the better).
