PROTECTOR. You hear the name. You mean, "ah, it's a lousy Hong Kong movie." Guess what - it's not Hong Kong. And yes, it's lousy. This amazingly silly movie, Jackie Chan, destroyed by us, yes, Americans (I cook with anger, ooh, I think I'll jump out of that window!), Has Chan as a New York policeman hunting a gang, avenge his friend's death. Sounds good ... but it's not like that. Don't waste your money by renting. To prove that he could do a better cop, Chan made an amazing POLICE STORY (1985).
