Cybrog 2: Glass Shadow plays Elias Koteas as Colton Hicks (rhymes with kicks!) Karate instructor who helps to escape the Pinwheel cash (Jolie), its creators who want to detonate it and destroy a competing company. Along the way Billy Drago and Karen Shepherd appear to replace the duo, while Jack Palance is there to give the duo a lead on the run. One of the things that is quite shocking about the Frankfurt franchise is how the series managed to get quite fruitful and off beat players in the actor. The original was Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dayle Haddon. The third is William Katt, Zach Galligan and Malcom McDowell. (Okay, the Cyborg 3 cast isn't so impressive.) I've never seen Cyborg 3, but I saw it on a Sci-Fi channel and I must admit I wasn't impressed. In fact, the strike that Cyborg 2 is often a beautiful looking movie, it's a snapshot with excellent style and visual detail to make it easy on the eye. However Cyborg 1 was the same, the film was directed by a certain style, slow motion and music. Unfortunately, first, this one has no new ideas or something similar to plot or texture. Most of the ideas are taken from Blade Runner and Max Headroom, so for various reasons the film has nothing to offer. Another aspect is horrible action. Karen Shepherd and Billy Drago are absolutely terrible and Angelina Jolie is not much better. Elias Koteas and Jack Palance are all right, but seriously Palance plays a cyborg warrior and Koteas is a karate instructor. I think on the positive side you can't blame Michael Schroeder for not being ambitious with ambition. The film is still boring and I lost interest in the story for fifteen minutes. Also why did they follow him with Cyborg? It has nothing to do with its predecessor, which will be worse than. <br /> <br /> * of 4- (bad)
