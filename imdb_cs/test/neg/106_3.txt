Dr. Stephens (Micheal Harvey) leads mental asylum. He has a different approach to the insane. It leads unorthodox treatment methods. He treats everyone as a family, there are no locks on the patient's door, and some of the prisoners act according to their twisted fantasies. He allows Sergeant Jaffee (Hugh Feagin) to dress and act as a soldier, and Harriet (Camilla Carr) is the mother to the doll, including letting her put it in bed in the crib. Dr. Stevens is out and leaves Judge Oliver W. Cameron (Gene Rossa) to mow with an ax, it turns out to be a bad move once Dr. Stevens turned, the judge planted an ax in his shoulder. Soon after Charlotte Beale (Rosie Holotik) arrived at the sanatorium, she interviewed Dr. Stevens about a possible job. She is met by the head of Nurse, Geraldine Masters (Annabelle Weenick as Anne McAdams) and is offered a trail position. She learns and becomes very popular among patients. However, things eventually become sour, phone lines are cut, an old lady named Mrs. Callingham (Rhea MacAdams) has a tongue cut out and she begins to have a strange feeling that things just aren't right. Then, once at night, all the dark secrets of Sanitaria are revealed. Produced and directed by S.f. Brownrigg this movie has a great central idea that puts it in a cool twist end, but in the end is a bit of a chore to sit because it's low budget constraints and somewhat slow script by Tim Pope. There is simply too many boring sections of the prisoners' dialogue, not much really happens until the last twenty odd minutes. The film has no real visual quality because it is completely set in a sanatorium and that's why it's basically just a big house in the middle of nowhere. There's no graphical gore in it, a couple of blood splashes here and there and that's your lot. There's a bit of nudity, but not as much as gore. Acting is pretty strong, especially Holotik and Weenick. The photo is flat and insensitive, and I don't even remember what music is. Spinning is great, but it takes too long to get to it. A film that had great potential that was probably held back by its budget. I think it would work a lot better if the story turned into a half hour 'Stories from the Crypt' episode.
