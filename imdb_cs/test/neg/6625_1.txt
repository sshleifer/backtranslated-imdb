That's what they came up with for the prop comic Carrot Top is the first feature film. Stupid Surfer (Carrot Dude) inherits the R & D business from an old kahuna (Jack Warden). Things go less than swimming, but much worse when society is threatened with a hostile attempt to take over by corrupt corporate robbers. The most unlikely thing about this movie is that a clever girl, Courtney Thorne-Smith, has found this redheaded child step by step fascinating in the least (but then only inherited millions). The "classic" moments include Larry Miller comic drinking pot from plastic cup. <br /> <br /> Funny comedy? Try the funny humor of the UN, exactly where it belongs - in the toilet ... flush twice.
