A mixed group of "experts" (explorers, divers, and scientists) will go mile underground and go another 2.4 miles underwater to a place even further away where they will find salamanders, giant albino moles (??) and some large, razors, winged , computer generated creatures lurk around. The cave is sealed rockslide and then the monsters attack and start killing all away while they are looking east. And that's all she has written with this low-focus effort, which she even can't combine action, science fiction and horror at the most basic levels. Imagine someone giving people the Sci-Fi Channel $ 30 million to make a movie monster. That's exactly what CAVE is; sometimes he is almost surprising in his uncertainty, full of clichés and almost entirely dependent on the special effects he enjoys. The only difference is that they had more money to build kits, more money to polish monsters and more money to hire allegedly professional actors who do the same thing. Otherwise it's as usual. Some of these movies are still fun to watch. This is not, and there are many reasons why: <br /> <br /> 1.) It takes too seriously and has no sense of humor. You get a totally unoriginal and predictable movie that doesn't even know how unoriginal and predictable it is. <br /> <br /> 2.) The opening sequence has no other purpose than to kill a few minutes and add to redundancy. 3.) Non-original looking CGI creatures don't feel like this day and age. 4.) The use of shakycam and quick cut for your horror scene is simply a lazy, unusual movie. And why another blackout action by putting things too dark and adding annoying distractions like fire and a burst of bubbles? This makes these scenes not only difficult to see, but also impossible to enjoy at the level of intense action. 5.) Even if you want to take it seriously, the script is full of clichés, the dialogue is terrible, and it doesn't try to characterize it at all. Casting 25-year-old role models as brilliant scientists and explorers with grumpy veterans could provide some eye candy, but it completely kills the credibility of a movie that otherwise plays absolutely straight. We're sorry, but you can't do it in both ways. <br /> <br /> 6.) There were two exceptions to the model rule because they chose to cast an old guy and an average-looking Joe. It was the first two killed characters. 7.) For little diversity, they also squeezed in a black man and a Chinese guy. Oddly enough, neither of them has a big voice in this movie and basically stands behind when whitey discusses what their next step will be. Insulting. 8.) In addition to how many movies must be made where a black character sacrifices his life at the very end just to ensure that the Hot White Female Lead and the Hot White Male Lead end up at the end ? Ugh. Give me a break. 9.) Much of the game was HORRIBLE. The performance of Cole Hauser was absolutely ridiculous. Another male chief looked like he was just leaving the soap opera set and running around using a patented technique that features a blunt-smile-does-all-ladies-swoon, which is PG-13 gender-switch equivalent to big-breasts-make-all -the-boys-swoon technique often uses ladies in R-rated movies. Either way, his performance was completely called in. Daniel Dae Kim (from the TV series "Lost") and Piper Perabo also burst into the room with a set and monotonous line. 10.) End of the Joke? Absolutely terrible. Please, God, we don't need the continuation of this garbage. So basically I wouldn't bother with this if you never saw a monster or if you're really desperate and the only other thing is "Simple Life". The kits were good, the blue-tinted photo was fine and several actors (Lena Headey, Marcel Iures ...) tried their best, so I decided to increase the rating by one degree to "2".
