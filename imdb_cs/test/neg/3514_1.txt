I have to start by saying it's one of the most unpleasant movies I've seen in my whole life! Annoying Factor One: You never see a "son" face (for the entire movie). And an infinitely more annoying factor: It keeps ringing the phone..nothing but listening to the phone's ringing over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over ... you get my opinion. The old man was bothered, but VIEWER was too! The movie was interesting for me, but it got worse very quickly. The film may have been good as a short, but it was certainly not enough to keep anything close to the length of the feature film. I think what I am trying to say is that the report on racism (which finally appeared during the last two scenes of the film) is secondary, given that this old man is being harassed. Who cares to sit and watch what's more than an old man who jokes when someone calls him? If you've never seen a movie that gets under your skin and drives you CRAZY ... check this!
