This movie is stuck. There's no more. The last fight looked like Walker, who took my grandmother, not some supernatural demon with the power of ten men. I found that ads are more interesting. Plots and jokes could be seen a mile away. The only redeeming quality of this movie was that it was over. Avoid it at any cost ... if you don't like the bad Chuck Norris movies.
