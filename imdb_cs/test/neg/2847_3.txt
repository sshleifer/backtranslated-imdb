Worse than the average thriller about a battered woman who goes to lama after being associated with the death of her husband and sister. She is determined to prove her husband is alive. Chasing after her are traditional "good policemen" and "bad policemen". One is convinced of his innocence that others are more interested in closing the case and returning home. This pair is often able to attack its suspect, but it can never catch it. All major players gather in a remote desert town, and the truth begins to develop with fatal consequences for some. <br /> <br /> Wow! That was a bad movie. The leadership behaved as if it were calm, the cops couldn't find the suspect if he's at the police station (that's what happens twice) and everyone else is just one-dimensional. Avoid this at all costs. <br /> <br />
