Man, man, this was a bit of a dog. I read a few reviews here after seeing the case at the local video store and thought of myself ........ Ah this looks like half a decent movie. Thailand. How can you go wrong? Right? No, no, not so bad. Jesus, if I could just smooth my eyes and not remember this movie, I'd be happy. The lead actor always had the smoothest, smoothest voice. My friend and I actually changed the DVD soundtrack to Portugal, so we didn't have to hear his voice. Subtitles and all ... and this made the movie better. I'm seriously if your something like me and wondering what this movie was ... STOP WONDERING. I have an answer. WORST VAMPIRE MOVIE EVER! No good action, no good gore and only the slightest nudity. Only pure sh * t for 90 min. Don't let it rent, buy, think about, or watch at 3:00. It just doesn't cut the cake ...... ever .... in any way. F * ck this movie and watch All Anal 7: Real Deep Cover. You'd have a better time. I am sure.
