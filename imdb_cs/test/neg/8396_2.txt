I signed up here right after watching this movie, feeling it was so horrible that at least his reviews could be fun. But it seems that all those who are wrong are like that. Ever since I want to work correctly ... <br /> <br /> The opening film is based on the viewer's disdain for the long time showing an extraordinary picture of an irrelevant bridge. long. Then it goes to some slow skateboarding, which is at least a little cool, but then compensates for the flash of excitement by overlapping the most repulsive sound I've ever heard. Some girl whispers into a whispering French over what sounds like plywood bangs together. Anyone who has decided to be there has never jumped on a skateboard, I guarantee it. He seemed to be there to test the limits of the audience's patience. <br /> <br /> The film is about 50% slower from here. Do you know what's worse than a gratuitous slow shot? Gratuitous slow motion * nothing happens. * Here is the man who walks the way. Here's a guy. Here's the man who looks around. Here's the guy who looks at another guy. After a while, I began to watch the film twice as fast as I came back whenever people appeared on a screen that was dealing with real dialogue that was rare. Once, tremendously, I slowed down the film to find out what the girl was saying, just to see that the camera was showing her talking, but the sound was another terrible, horrible song, and her real voice wasn't audible. That reminds me of some great advice I have heard about writing once - if you have nothing to say, don't use fantastic tricks to pretend you're doing it. Go back to work and come up with something you say. All these camera tricks, such as slow motion and strange lighting and lenses and strange music, are what looks and sounds like the absence of content. Many people apparently bought it and felt emotional gravity and profound meaning, but I think they project it into a film that has not done any work that would contribute to its creation.
