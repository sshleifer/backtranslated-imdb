Respected Western author Budd Boetticher is woefully out of place with this shattered modern day of cops and robbers who suffers from a severe lack of emotional credibility. Boetticher seems to have given up rehearsal time and settled in the first run because he leads Joe Cotton and Rhonda Fleming, who have made little effort in their roles, supplying lines straight and without power. Slightly behaved employee Leon "Foggy" Poole works as an inner man on banking work that is bad and gets his wife killed in the process. He escapes from prison and immediately sets out to kill the detective's wife who killed him. Hundreds of cops are mobilized to prevent him from going to a home intended to be moved to another place, but you do not know that in the last moments of the film, we have the legs of Foggy (who thought it was with the bus) back to the house was the soundtrack) while the cops watched and argued over what to do. Sounds meaningless? You should see it. It's all and more. Lucien Ballard's camera does a decent job of bringing a noir to the suburbs, but the cut is rude and formless, and the film drains its tension and pace. Like Poole, Wendell Corey is the best thing in the film to make a big liking when shifting from a subtle soul to a killer. These Killer Attributes Uniformly Fail in Construction and Implementation, Making His Report Clear. Go Western Old Budd.
