Although usually my preferences are not for romantic dramas, because this movie left me a little short. He had a promise, characters and relationships could be explored much deeper than they did, but the story seemed to be no. To understand the direction they wanted to take. The comparison and parallels in the story, especially the three generations of women in the family, had great potential, but somehow they did not fully spread. It could make the film much easier to relate to and join in, which is the goal of any film about lost love and life it has gained. IMHO, I think the film suffered from a lack of writing skills, though Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock were desperate to breathe a little life into the otherwise flat outlines of the characters. It's not such a bad movie. the development of plots, its just the film is imperfect and generally small apartment.
