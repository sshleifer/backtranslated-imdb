This movie is really so bad, and I'm normally crazy for bad movies, but it was too much. When I see it as OD'ing on pure SUCK. Maybe you think you've seen the bottom of the barrel. You may have waded every Full Moon and Troma title, all of Edward D. Wood Jr's films, Uwe Boll, Albert Pyun, and directly on DVD-flicks from faded men's action. You may even have seen Death Tunnel, Ghost Lake, and a huge number of movies that MST3K covered, but in their original form. But you don't know that really scary filmmaking until you've seen Darkhunters. And if you don't, you shouldn't. Don't bother. Not only is this film incredibly poorly written, directed, filmed, edited, acted and sprayed in raw, inexpensive after-effects. First, it's a showy mess. But not good, Greenaway or Lynch-style flamboyant or merrily messy in Ittenbach or early Waters kind of fashion. It is a kind of arrogance that comes when someone thinks incredibly stupid that they have come up with something incredibly clever. A bit like M. Night Shaymalan (sp?), Just the man looks like a crazy messiah compared to this train (and it comes from an uncontrolled Shaymalan hate). It's also boring. It's not hard to go boring, which is fine if the film gives patience. Darkhunters won't do anything like that. It's boring in "Oh my fu (King of God when I see another shot of a cat set on an annoying sound instruction I'll fu (King kill myself!" - kind of way.) Anyone who claims to be this The film is a bold liar, and anyone who claims this film is complex or deep knows what their mother is in bed.
