Algiers is not a classic, it is a perversion of the beautiful original Pepe le Moko, directed by Duvivier and playing much more attractive and charming Pepe, Jean Gabin. If you want to fully experience Casbah and characters in Algiers, I recommend that you do not watch this movie and instead see Pepe le Moko because it is much more complicated, more beautifully filmed, the lines are not clich√©s and characters. much more to reality. Besides, the end is so dramatic and the key to Pepe's character that you'll find that the version of Algiers is unbearable. Although Algiers does almost excellent work imitating each scene, acting lacks the credibility of the characters. In addition, the wardrobe is really breathtaking in all the scenes, especially Pepe is in the last scene and Gaby is (all the time) but also when he's on the boat. Frankly, Algiers is cheap when it comes to imitations.
