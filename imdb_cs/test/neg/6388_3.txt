Maybe it is unfair for me to read this movie because I went well before the end. This is strange because I usually like Shakespeare on the screen and I enjoyed the Midsummers Night Dream once, many years ago when I saw it on stage. twerp with Shakespearian name, Calista Flockhart, and Michelle Feiffer sitting in a giant clamshell. I suppose it could be said to be a comedy - but when the scenery is funny and the actors aren't, I guess we have a bad movie on our hands.
