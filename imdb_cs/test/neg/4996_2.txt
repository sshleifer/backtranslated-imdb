Don't be fooled. This is not a zombie movie. Take it from a guy who loves zombie movies, and who is renting them all: good and terrible. Yes, this movie has an extended zombie sequence, but it's basically a breathing exercise in existential horror, which is a long way to say it's boring. If you've been working hard all day and want to spend a few hours of fun, rent something else. <br /> <br /> "Rise of the Undead" has cheap special effects, average acting performance and crazy dialogue. All this is understandable in India, the low-budget movie, and I can forgive such flaws as long as the film has a fun story to tell. Unfortunately, "Rise of the Undead" has hardly any story at all. Moreover, acting is not as badly bad as non-existent. All the actors seem to have studied at Buster Keaton School of Wooden Faces. Would they kill them to show some emotions? (And no, screaming disagrees with emoting). One character who actually had a pizazz was killed first. It is true that there was another character who briefly captivated me. He watched and acted like Kyle McLachlan, who directed Norman Bates, but it was too little, too late. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten a little detail: the film is VISUAL. This means that your scenes get in order for the viewer to see what's going on. And all the frightening jumps and close shots seemed fine at the time, but all they did was watch a movie that trembled and was confusing. There is nothing wrong with telling the story in a simple, clear way - just look at George Romero's low-budget "Living Dead Night" to see how well it is done. And I know that these people had a small budget, but if you can't hire the equipment and techniques needed to make the dialogue audible, then go ahead and make a silent movie (then these wooden faces of Buster Keaton can actually work). <br /> <br /> I'll say it for the movie: zombies were scary. Unlike most zombie movies, where undead people appear in all their crumbling fame, the bigger the better the zombies that are being blended are bloody people. Actually, it was to be more similar to us and therefore more frightening. That's why I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1. The sad part about all this is that, despite all its flaws, "Rise of Undead" won't hurt your intelligence. In fact, the filmmakers seemed to want to make a clever, scary, original film, and it is a pity that they have failed so badly. If they could just give up too much imagination, buy a few more bulbs, start a dialogue and come up with a real story that goes somewhere, then I think they have the talent to do something really good. > <br /> Believe Me: Don't waste your time on "Rise of the Undead".
