Vicente Aranda made a horrible historical film. It shows bad sources of Spanish film. In the movie, the unreal script shows Juan as ninphomaniac, faced Felipe, worried only for sex ... but sex with others not with her. Technical mistakes begin with the wedding ring that shows Isabel Castilla. Then it seems that the voice in the movie seems to be a documentary, the actor and actress in the movie sometimes laugh - look at the succession when Juan arrives at a board that wants to keep it isolated; Castles are almost broken when the age of the movie, which was recently built, are crowds of just "four" people, the lights are poorly placed ... Compared to Amelie Poulain, the French film for oscars ... it makes no sense to talk about the wrong movie as Juana la loca.
