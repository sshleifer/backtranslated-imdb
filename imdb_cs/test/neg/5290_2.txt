20 years ago Chopper (yes, he drives a helicopter as well as chopping people) disappeared when the police found dead bodies at his clinic. Since then, people have disappeared around Lake Tanoka (or something) and dead bodies have been found everywhere. Dr. Chopper turned out to need parts of his body to stay alive, taking them from strangers like a couple of lesbians and five girls from the consecration (you get a picture) that travels across Lake Tanoka. When a group of teenagers decide to go camping, they have to meet the doctor ..... <br /> <br /> Well, if you want to waste time, it's the right choice. Acting differs from really bad to average with tripping girls and falling all the time for no apparent reason. Every chance to show the skin is taken but without actually showing anything at all. The same goes for special effects that are pretty pathetic with every slash angled so you can't see, but there are lots of body parts in the movie all covered in blood (probably to hide how sad they really look). The plot is pretty bad and the dialogue is rather sad. Only when I laughed when Dr. Chopper asked, "Howdy!" when he tries to be scary. Don't look at this if your hack'n'slash freak. Even then I would advise you to look at something better.
