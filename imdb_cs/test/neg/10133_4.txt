The description of this movie is a difficult task. On the one hand, it is an over-the-top vampire spookfest, complete with cobwebs, scary music, a hypnotic medallion, and, of course, a cap with a lid. On the other hand, this side of Edward D. Wood, Jr. is one of the strongest scenarios. Produced by the same people who gave us a "bloody vampire," "a vampire invasion," and this film's predecessor, a modestly-titled "Vampire," "the film keeps close to the lack of logic that characterizes other movies. <br /> <br As I mentioned, this film is a sequel to "The Vampire" I haven't seen, but no matter what ... it's easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel "The Brainiac" Salazar, is confused when well-intentioned but misleading Dr. Marion brings back his Vampire enemy, Earl Karol de Lavud (I suppose somewhere is the rule that all vampires must be numbers of some kind) Dr. Marion complains that all major doctors throughout history has had to resort to some kind of grave to continue medical studies, and hopes to use a vampire corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire's lack of normal reflection (to which point to hold a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the vampire skeleton. ???). <br /> <br /> Enrique is not pleased, and it seems he is determined to hand over the events of the first film as a fantasy and superstition. "This man wasn't a vampire ... I admit he likes to drink some blood, but that's all!" he says. Also confusing is the fragile Martha, a part-time sister and a shortened showgirl (!) Who becomes the object of Enrique's love. Martha narrowly escaped de Lavud's clutches in the first film and apparently Enrique spent a lot of time "healing the mind" and getting to think that everything she experienced was not real. OK, so if you were the screenwriter for this movie, you'd need a way to get someone so stupid to get a vampire bet, right? How about the greedy man who helped Marion steal a coffin? After looking at Le Lavud's body, he focuses on the precious brooch worn by the Earl and returns comfortably to steal it when doctors don't look. But hell ... he can't remove the brooch because of the roll, so ... you guessed it. Again, De Lavud is a freelancer, this time with a shadowy horse as his human follower. OK, so the vampire is, of course, after Martha again, and in the meantime, the doctors are really confused by what they believe. Initially, they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, and then at the end of the film they are trying to get the police to give a versatile newsletter for "a man who is dead but still alive!" ". <br /> <br /> You may imagine the rest of the plot, but the filmmakers are throwing themselves into a few pleasant twists. One of the movie files is the haunted wax museum (is there any other kind of movie in these types of films?). With the REAL equipment of torture and execution, the film has a very keen sense of style and not just in the webs, and one spectacular haunted sequence of de Lavud chases the victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleys, following their progress along the vague buildings without doors while lighting scenes such as the German expressionist nightmare ("Dr. Caligari's Cabinet" seems to be influential). <br /> <br /> However, the rest of the film is youthful, especially at the top of the film. when it was done, and the ultimate fight with de Lavud in the form of bats is ridiculousâ€¦ but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha will fade and collapse t directly over the top of the guillotine, positioned so that its head is in a perfect position to cut off the blade that is in danger of falling, because the lashing rope suddenly began to shake TRUE ON THE MINUTE! What an unfortunate accident! To make matters worse, he cut off from the breaking rope to the Enrique scenes, trying to avoid the floating rubber bat, basically standing and waving his hands. It is definitely Ed Wood's moment if there was one, especially when Martha seems to be reviving herself and rising to her feet as the blade slams down. Ms! What a relief! In terms of kookiness, the "vampire coffin" does not have the madness factor of "bloody vampire" or "vampire invasion", but fans of these types of old horror movies appreciate atmospheric photography, and the fact that it is. The director manages to squeeze some real chills out of this material he must "count" on something (haw haw).
