The real surprise of this lightweight film is how such a top cast has accumulated for what is nothing but an affair that is uninteresting. It was probably the proverbial snowball that rolled up the hill and gathered pace and size and shape. We can imagine that when Miranda Richardson turned to her agent, the conversation continued: "Do you want to make a film in Dublin written by Neil Jordan?" Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are in! 'This is a boring' comedy 'that sees Michael Caine and Dylan Moran trying to break away a well-planned bust where Moran has to emulate the London chief of a London gang (whose coming is imminent) to collect a considerable amount of cash from King Michael Gambon. The rest is simply forgotten, which is fortunately quite fast. Moran is slightly entertaining in places, but on this evidence it is preferable to live on a canvas in hit comedies like black books. Caine is unquestionable in its role and provides stable performance without being dragged. We can only imagine what made him join this film - it couldn't even be a summer in Dublin because many scenes look remarkably autumn in the background. Gambon actually steals the show, and anyone who has captured some of his performances in the forms that I have received News For You will know that he is an amazingly funny man. But overall, the result is unsatisfactory and it seems like it's been a lifetime that Neil Jordan has made good movies like Mona Lisa.
