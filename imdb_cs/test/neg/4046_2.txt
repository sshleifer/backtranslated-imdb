This movie was so terrible that I couldn't go through the whole thing without turning it off, it was so bad! As I watched him, I kept thinking that it looked like some really cheap movie that came back in the '60s, or something with those awful special effects, but then I realized it was just in 2001. <br Dialogue and acting were really very horrible and the story almost did not exist. I didn't think anyone would go back to making movies that look so cheap and old, I'm not sure if they did it deliberately, or if they have no budget for this movie at all. Looks like it was filmed on someone's camcorder in a local person's house or something. Maybe they thought they were retro or something, but it just came out looking really cheesy. <br /> <br /> I really don't know how anyone could really enjoy watching this. <br /> <br /> 0 of 5 *.
