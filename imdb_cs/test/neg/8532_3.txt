Despite a totally misleading advertising campaign, this film appears to be an exasperated clich√©, a subordinate haunted house with a totally unlikely ending. Keyword 1 for all who are considering Turkey: Sam Raimi did not. Although the commercials for the film play its involvement, in fact he is one of four producers. It's too bad that someone like a talented Raimi allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a bad movie. I do not think he would ever manage such a thing; this task was left to the Pang Brothers. The screenplay for this movie seems to be cobbled together from many other "horror" movies, so in "The Messengers" you'll find absolutely no original content. "What we get is a scene that was pulled straight out of" Pulse ", a pair that could have come from" The Birds ", one or two of" The Other ", etc. Almost every scene, almost every series of dialogue that The whole thing is for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to come to a "surprising end" long before it comes. <br /> <br /> that an advertising campaign focused on the idea that ghosts can only see children has nothing to do with this film, in fact everyone can see ghosts, and teenage daughter and mother figures will see them, even at the beginning of the movie. who was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal that is otherwise completely missing, now you know, so don't be fooled! most of all, it is something like chemistry among the actors, which is simply not the case. In conjunction with the arid story and ridiculous conspiratorial holes (what is the guy who murdered his entire family, who is still lurking around a small town where murder has happened, anyhow? Didn't anyone think he could be arrested?) ghosts who can surprise anyone older than 10 years with cheap shots: loud noises, visual flashes and anything that should be a shortened figure that jumped out of the closet and screamed "Boo!" This time we'll get to another badly made ghost movie trying to warn people in front of the house. If there's a message that "The Messengers" brings, it's "Don't waste your time on this movie."
