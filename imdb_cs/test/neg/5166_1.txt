A pathetic attempt at a film about the victims of Australian soldiers during the New Guinea campaign. A complete waste of money, even if you only see it on DVD. Fortunately, the video store provided a free weekly rental with a DVD otherwise it would be a complete waste of money. Probably made by the artistic types and the full symbolism that today's Chardonay socialists look like. Frankly, this film is an insult to the memories of brave chaps that never returned. Please give some money to make a decent movie at least equal to Saving Private Ryan. Hopefully, RSL will give the greatest distance to each other and this film. The story must be told from all sides by the Australians, the locals and the Japanese - even if it is the second to tell the truth about everything that happened during World War II, it is very unlikely. Basically his garbage, you don't see, don't buy it. Go away
