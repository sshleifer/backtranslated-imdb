Yes, the movie was so boring and clumsy. After some point I wanted croc to eat these people just so we could get a movie with it. The land is that the three Aussians went on a river trip to a small boat with leash guides on the gun. He says he only does it for insurance purposes, all the crocodiles were hunted from this river. He is immediately eaten by Croc. The trio then chases after the tree where it crawls while trying to escape. He spends most of the movie arguing about the best way to escape. Predictably, one survivor finds a gun guide and shoots a crocodile. Aww, they only killed the likable character of the movie! Where is Paul Hogan or Steve Irwin when you really need them?
