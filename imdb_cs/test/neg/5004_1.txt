This film was total cheese. Stank. All that was good was acting. Otherwise, nothing remarkable at all. Great Time Spoilers! They don't read yet if you haven't seen it! This film is aimed at a family whose happy and wonderful lives have been destroyed as a result of their younger son, and later, when they found the older son harassed by their childcare providers. Although they are called liars in lawsuits and a lawyer is a real prick, the jury considers them guilty and condemns them. Finally, I say to the director: "Next time you want to make such a movie, do it differently".
