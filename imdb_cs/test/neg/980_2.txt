.. but unfortunately nobody thought about killing Van to save this convicted production. The only positive thing about him in the movie is his nice singing voice ... too bad songs are mostly crazy and unhappy. Why did I hate Van so much? Throughout the film, he seemed to be doing a copy of a third sale - with many ambushes, bad jokes, and the fact that too much energy was dedicated to making everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he "taught" the class - these kids laughed at ALL he did. Damn it, Van could read the phone book or show them autopsy photos and probably laugh! Van wasn't the only bad decision about casting in a movie at all - he was just the most obvious. Of course, John Gielgud (a beautiful actor) plays Asian is ridiculous, just like Michael Michael plays his brother Peter Finch! The bottom line is that because of these crazy casting options, the film was doomed from the outset ... and the worst of them was the divine, horrible Bobby Van. Now in real life he could have been a beautiful man, and sad that he died so young in real life, but with the material they gave him, I wanted to rip his tongue out to be quiet. Now I also mentioned the songs - egad, the horrible songs !! Frank Capry's original LOST HORIZON was a delight - and not a single song and dance number in the movie. So why did they decide to add a song to a song that didn't do anything to help the movie? They only served to make it look like a greasy mess - like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sick movie for sweet kids - not one that anyone from 8 years can enjoy. <br /> <br /> Now that you can fix these problems, you have a decent movie base. After all, the land is beautiful and is still hidden under all the goo. Peter Finch is especially good (though definitely not the same as Ronald Colman in the original). But since the original was an almost perfect classic, why bother with this sticky candy. Who wants to wake up evil? By the way, this film was included in the book "The 50 Worst Films" by Harry Medved. Although I didn't like the movie, it wasn't bad enough to deserve to be included in the book. I think it was mainly involved because it was such a big box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. Excellent book - just not one of the best selections for the "sacred hall" dreck.
