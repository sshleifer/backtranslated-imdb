Two things are always signs of watching the wrong movie: <br /> <br /> 1) If you are immediately alerted to other movies like TERMINATOR, HARDWARE or BLADE RUNNER during the subtitle sequence <br /> <br /> 2) If death occurs during a sex scene right after a sequence of titles <br /> <br /> There is actually a third warning sign and this is a lazy explanation that warns a poor unconscious naive audience of the danger of corporate greed. Guess what ? CYBORG 2 starts with a headline that highlights corporate greed in the future, followed by a title line reminding me of TERMINATOR, HARDWARE and BLADE RUNNER, followed by death during the sex scene! Don't you think I'm gonna watch a bad movie by accident? <br /> <br /> As you can guess, it's a bad movie. It is basically a series of action scenes that are written around a bare cyborg plot on the run from a greedy corporate company. It's poorly written, directed and played, and especially poorly lit, which means it's hard to see what's happening on the screen, even though I'm not quite sure it's a bad thing. The only interest to be is that it is the film debut of Angelina Jolie who plays the cyborg on the run and that says the prophetic line "Are they nice, I wonder if they are real?" alone when I see one of her movies
