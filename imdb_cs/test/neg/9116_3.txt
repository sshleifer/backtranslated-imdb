I personally watched it because of Leo Thompson's appearance, and I didn't really expect to enjoy the film as such, but surprisingly I watched it until the end. Let's face it - just one of the saga-like stories and it's not particularly original or entertaining, but it strangely holds on to television. My opinion of their own will be much better if there was not one point that I just wouldn't get. There is a beautiful and really tangible scene in which the figure of Lea Thompson runs on the street holding the baby in her arms, the snow falls, she is cold, scared, and has no place to stay, she does not know what to do gave. And then about 10-12 years later, when things are better for her, she just leaves the same guy without warning to take on a career she dreams of. I just don't get it - I can't see how she could do something like that, it was the opposite of what she did in her life when everything she did was focused on the child's survival. After this flip I couldn't enjoy the rest of the movie.
