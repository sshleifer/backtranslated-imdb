OK .. at the time of writing, 65 people voted for this movie, moving it to 5 out of 10 ratings. I think only the film crew voted. So I'm here to bring some justice. Never has a movie provoking the audience's intelligence more than that. Since I laughed quite loudly - but the movie / story didn't want me. <br /> <br /> I've seen a lot of bad movies. MANY. But man, this one will blow them all out. Speaking '96 computers, ridiculous performances and wheelchair harassment - and we have young Tarantins who can't fund their ideas. Yeah, life is a cruel joke.
