I'm sure many people will love this movie. The only woman who shows some "balls" (unfortunate pun regretted) is made to look, talk and look like a guy, the other 2 women are portrayed either as sex objects with one thing on their mind - sex / are sexy, having sex as their only attribute and skill (Iris) - or as a frightened pretty little princess who has neurosis negating any strength and professional authority they had before hell is lost (Doc). The only strength Iris at the end is the result of some advice of a great strong man. In addition to my negative reaction to the gut as feminists, I need to give the cameras a working prop - and Ethan Hawke is great on the first scene. Then his performance loses steam. Empty entertainment for the brain that wants it to be easy. At the very least, the film goes through the theme of good / bad duality in a criminal mind.
