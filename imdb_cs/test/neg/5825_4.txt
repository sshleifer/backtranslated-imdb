I don't understand many good reviews here. I found a photo and scenery beautiful, and two major actors appealing, but there is little to recommend this movie. The most unpleasant are the false southern accents and the poorly written dialogue. It doesn't sound like real people. While it is refreshing to show people who explore different forms of sexuality without the usual signs and stereotypical character traits, most of the story is without motivation or logic. The only thing that makes much sense is the responsibility Griffith feels to her mentally ill aunt, grossly exaggerated by Karen Black. Lee is an interesting character who would be more convincing if the dialogue he was talking about was more natural and his motivation clearer. Yes, I understand that he's a wanderer, but his actions, as he draws the film, come to a conclusion, have no sense at all. This film is worth a look, mainly because it has a pleasant atmosphere about it, but it's slowly moving and deeply flawed. Serious overwriting and better editing could save her because the assumption and outline of the story are promising.
