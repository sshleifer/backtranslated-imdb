OK, so I've been collecting a lot of vipco and hardgore titles on DVD lately and I have to say this is one of the most disappointing. A newer movie compared to other titles in the Hardcore catalog was the release on DVD. I've always been interested in the el chokeberry myth since I saw a documentary about him as a teenager. however this movie is terrible letting down a shot on cheap dv story and playing are terrible, it took me three goes to watch this movie all the way through. While the cheap films of the 80s and 90s are good because their cheap budgets and comedies are not. <br /> <br /> Take a look at some of the hardgore titles first, for example boneyard is older but much better.
