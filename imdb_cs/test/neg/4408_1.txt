I wasted time. This is a very demanding film. At first you will think something is happening, but by the time you leave for about 30 minutes, you realize that nothing is happening. I waited another 20 minutes and then I was so frustrated that I started reading the IMDb reviews and realized that the director missed the precious time of many people. <br /> <br /> An incredibly boring, nonsensical movie. Keep away. So many good soundtracks. I'll give one point for a police inspector joke because it worked for me. I laughed a long time, but otherwise a very bad movie. Stay on 1 at 10.
