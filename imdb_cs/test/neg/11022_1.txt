I'm starting to wonder after reading some of the reviews here while watching the same movie as the other reviewers, but after checking my facts, I'm forced into the sad conclusion I have. the wannabee screwball comedy must be one of the longest 94 minutes I've spent, and one of the most unusual things I've ever seen, for ages. Now don't get me wrong, I love comics, but this boring, set-bound drivel falls so far from the dizzying heights of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that they don't deserve it (to blend my metaphors) to be thought in the same breath as those greats. The dialogue of writer / director Charles Martin is neither funny, subtle nor interesting - and there is so much. He doesn't even know how to end the scene, with some reckless cut, especially for people leaving the room and saying goodbye to the others, the pace of the film would be canceled, and the fact that a limited number of characters do stupid and gratuitous things for no other reason than it has being a comedy would be a little less obvious. The characters in this movie go into themselves and out of love with each other, and move and out of the apartments, at the moment of announcement only move what little land is forward. One moment people desperate for one person, others get married to someone else - if they are interested and charmed by the screen, we don't know anything until one of the characters tells us - "Oh, they're getting married!" "(usually after someone has made a faux-pass or jumped on the wrong conclusion) If we knew that these two characters were in love or should be set in hand, we, the viewers, could enjoy the observation of someone who As it is, the characters just come to look like selfish, grumpy idiots and we have no sympathy for any of them. <br /> <br /> The sets are limited and actions limited to them in a way that does the whole thing The only moments of boredom relief are Keenan Wynn, who seems to have thrown himself from another movie and decided to hang out and be a little more fun than all the rude things that happen around him. <br /> < br /> Highly impossible.
