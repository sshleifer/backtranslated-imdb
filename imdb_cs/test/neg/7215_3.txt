I saw the promo for this movie on the Spike Channel last night, it was grouped with Patrick Swaze's repetition of another movie that he did and thought swazy was in this sequel ..... the boy I was wrong .... I see the writer also in He played it and I think the budget was a little tight. I was surprised to see that Will Patton in the film has much better credits in his name to play in "c". Bussey jr tried to portray the image of his father (one of the best actors ever to be a bad man), who unfortunately failed to think that the only redeemed features of the film were chicks ,,,,, good looking and simply not with lots of T&A. worth the time or rent your heavily earned dollar
