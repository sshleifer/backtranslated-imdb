First I will say that I will be as subjective as I can. <br /> <br /> There will be some potential spoilers ahead, so be careful. I hardly ever have movies, but one in particular I felt I had to review. This movie Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children, based on ultra popular RPG (Final Fantasy VII) for ps1, has been in the works for some time. After years of humbug and dozens of trailers (none of which I have ever seen, I've seen only photos) this movie got legion fans really excited to see their favorite characters on the big screen. I myself played and finished the game several times as a good fan, and when I was such a crazy movie, I was pretty excited. So I thought, "WHAT CAN I BE LONG?". Well, the movie started in the first 20 minutes OK, but then things got out of hand as the movie went on. Undoubtedly it is the most beautiful CGI animation around, but it does not help weak plot, undeveloped characters, and action-packed action scenes. Here's a story basically. These three silver fur coats, who have nothing to do with the game, are said to be Sephiroth's clones (he's a villain of a game who allegedly murdered all his supposed clones) and tries to kidnap all the kids for some reason that wasn't really so good they probably also have a story on a boy named Denzel, I don't know who the boy is or what his sense is, he just seems depressed all the time. So, sephiroth clones are also involved in some sort of disease involving a geostigma disease that affects only children, causing the boredom and a small amount of skin discoloration. So now Cloud must save the day from these guys. Apparently Cloud and his fellow teammates learned the ability to fly, I felt a little offended that these characters that fly around the city are fighting the dragon and landing on their feet all the time. Maybe if the movie wasn't that tall, then a glimpse of it could come loose, and then something incredible might stun it. The real problem with this film is logic. Now I know what you're going to say, "But it's called Final FANTASY! It should have the ideas in it!" well that this is a stupid way to think, a game based on some reality and the film should follow in that context. The context and logic in this film is inconsistent, I could explain it all, but if I did, I would eventually write the script. Also some of the scenes in this movie were extremely fictional and banal. as if all the characters in the game appear in zero time for their compulsory time so that the fans do not disrupt. They appear, do a little there and have no meaning in the story. <br /> <br /> If it's too long, it's a simpler review - <br /> <br /> pros - first 20 minutes top-notch cgi animation decent action scenes visually stunning <br /> <br /> consistent action action / unbalanced action (leaving the viewer on top) weak graph of super human character = no tension j-rock soundtrack / score (what happened to the orchestra?) terrible ending <br /> <br /> LARGE SPOILER TIME- <br Now the end of this movie really disappointed me. They could go for a really cool and sweet ending where the cloud dies and meets aeris in later life, but after a big battle at the end the cloud gets back, a little wounded where the bullet explodes through the chest. then the cloud has a flash of 100 in its movie and then wakes up in the pool lifestream. (Now I remember the lifestream in the game, but it didn't have the resurrection of properties, if it did, they could bring aeris back to life, so make a completely different story) so the cloud is brought back to life and everyone has a party and dives into pool and we have an exceptionally typical moment / lifetime. <br /> <br /> doesn't mean the film doesn't have moments. worth seeing his visuals. But that's all. <br /> <br /> Except it's not a really good movie. It is strictly for blind fans of the game. not for people who care about conspiracy and character and storytelling.
