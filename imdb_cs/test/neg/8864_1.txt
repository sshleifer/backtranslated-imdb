That's Pulp Fiction. I thought it would be good for a few decent laughs. It turned out that this movie was really terrible. The whole chart is not followed by the Pulp Fiction plot. It turns into another film like Forrest Gump and more. There were some laughs from this movie, but it took 90 minutes of my life to do everything and everything. If you're thinking about renting this movie, please don't waste 90 minutes of your life. Re-consider hiring it and keep going and find a movie that really makes sense. Please, if there is Plump Fiction 2, I will definitely not continue and rent the sequel. I just give my heads up to those who were there.
