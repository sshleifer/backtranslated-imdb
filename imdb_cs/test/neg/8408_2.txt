The first movie is somewhat good for me, I enjoyed it for the most part, but I thought it was nothing special. However, compared to this mess, it looks a lot better in overall terms. Why they felt there was a need for the film to be out of me, but they should know that they couldn't match the acting of the first movie if they could return Ruth Gordon back to her role. The story that follows Rosemary's kid around and so on, but in fact it's a bit of a mess, doesn't help making a movie a TV movie and television looks very good. It has a more comedy tone to it as well, which prevents it from greatly, if they really felt the need to do the sequel they had made it R rated film that had some nudity and gore in it. I'm sure it would still be bad enough, but at least it would be more attentive and fun than what this movie is despite trying to be funny. I saw this on Monstervision and Joe Bob had no good say about it in the intrus and I don't even have to say much. I must say it was a sequel that should never have seen the light of day.
