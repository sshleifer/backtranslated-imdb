I was on a mission to watch Uwe Boll movies to see if they were as bad as anything else. The first I saw, BloodRayne, was not a complete loss. I liked it more than most people, and actually rated it 4 out of 10. Next up was the first Dead movie house. Now it was terribly bad. I could have looked at it for ten minutes and a little fast, and that was it. I saw where it was, and I didn't have to see it again to rate just 1 out of 10. But I also had access to the sequel (which is not Uwe Boll, but mysteriously, written by the same the guys who wrote so uncomplicated first, and because they got a higher rating on the IMDb than the original, I thought I'd give him a chance. And I actually did. It started with some funny links and cool lines (like how the president got orders from the vice president!), And it's light years better than the first. Here we have cool flies like ultra-hot Emmanuelle Vaugier, whose coolness is in the league with Carrie-Anne Moss, Claudia Black and Evangeline Lilly. Men, I hope sometimes a Matrix-style movie comes for her. And always delicate, super aerobic Victoria Pratt. I love athletic women. And there was Nadine Velazquez (Catalina on "My Name Is Earl"), which was pretty good. The story wasn't very big and the action wasn't very good either. The end was disappointing because they failed in their mission. Well, at least two networks survived. Guess it's also a little victory. Good cast but pretty bad movie. The actors are watching, but there is no real substance. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
