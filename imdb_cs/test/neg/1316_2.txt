At first glance, it seemed that this movie could be really good - it's not. The cast is pretty good, but most of them seemed embarrassed about the whole thing. The real disaster in this film is not a flood, but a scenario. Attempting to include every clich√© in the book, it has done incredibly badly. The end is very violent, but this is a blessing in disguise. Congratulations, if you do so far. All three major male actors (Carlyle, Courtney, and Suchet) would surely agree that this is the lowest point of their career. I hope they got a lot of money, because none of their legends came out of time. Special effects are pretty good, but the same was done much more efficiently in The Day After Tomorrow. In short, meaningless exercise. Don't waste your time.
