I will not bother to mention any conspiracy - this is a strictly B movie on his way to darkness. The shock to me, however, is to see what happened to some of the actors of this film. Erika Eleniak, as well as the ones you would call thespian, seem to have turned into Anna Nicole Smith (in her Great Period). Daniel Bernhardt - I almost threw a tear. He has always been my favorite because of his bravery of martial arts, as seen in the Bloodsport series (also B movies, but if you like martial arts, extremely observable). Here's the shell of his earlier self-control - he's sure he's older, but he's doing a mercenary thing and he's not even looking for interest ... I don't get it. Don't these people invest? William Forsythe is another "hard" I've always liked, but his last few roles are what you would call "mailing to in". I will not even mention Mr Reynolds - his performance here means a journey, nothing more. The only winner is Andrew Divoff, as usually a haunted, evil, pockmarked villain with a voice of emery paper that can bend milk - the best kind! That's a movie you're looking at laughing. There's nothing else about it.
