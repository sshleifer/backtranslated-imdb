Dr. Marnie Bannister (Magda Konopka) is a terribly disfigured woman. When one of her colleagues discovers a rejuvenation recipe, Marnie sees it as an opportunity to become beautiful. When she denied the drug for possible side effects, she kills her colleague to get what she wants. The drug works and becomes beautiful. But the formula brings the worst in it, and it's not long before she left the string of bodies behind her. <br /> <br /> Have you ever heard the expression "like exciting to watch the colors dry"? This is largely summarized by Satanic. During the film, one of the characters voices a line, "something so terrible, that's incomprehensible." I wasn't sure if she was talking about anything in the movie or the movie itself. I'm really disappointed because I had great hopes for it. Satanic had options, but he never realized it. On every occasion, Marnie has done the darkest things imaginable. Writing is terrible. Part of the problem is Magda Konopka. She is not so attractive and cannot wear the film alone. Another big problem with Satanik is direction and cut. That's a mess. We see things and places that have no effect on anything in the film. The camera remains on images too long after the scene has ended. I can't think of a single shot that would call anything but a non-original shot. This group of filmmakers has little imagination or talent. Maybe I'm not familiar with the Italian comic book on which Satanic is supposedly based, but I'm sure it must be better than this.
