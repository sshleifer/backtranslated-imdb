It's not unusual for Hollywood to love to get lousy movies. Some good movies occasionally emerge from them, while most of them suck the main ass. It is also no wonder that these bad movies are a repetition of old TV series. Occasionally there is a surprise with "The Fugitive" (who saw Best Picture oscar nom coming?), But for every "Fugitive" there is a McHale Navy or some other completely non-original film without any plot or interest. Mod Squad, in my opinion, goes to my top ten really miserable movies, in which Hollywood should get an excused ass beaten for what could be a good movie. We are shifting the true smack dab in the middle of a story that doesn't seem to make sense, wasting talent and dialogue being bad. We actually don't know who the hell these characters are, and we could put a flying f ** k on what they are. You are expected to automatically know who they are and what they will do. There's one particularly bad riff about being too old to be so stupid. Something my friend verbally remarked when we wanted the movie to end. It's just an insult to Hollywood film. Grade: F-
