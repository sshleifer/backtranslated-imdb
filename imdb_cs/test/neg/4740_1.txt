this film watched me by Paul W.S. Anderson's AvP1 and enjoy it! I'm not even dreaming of comparing Requiem with any of the Alien or Predator movies, this is HORRIBLE TEENAGE B-HORROR FOOTAGE SET in an American small town where no one cares about it. AvP1 at least had piles of handcrafted art carved into film sets, it had eye-candy bags not previously seen in any of the original movies - but was destroyed by unconvincing characters / acting. Requiem takes the wrong It is the lowest imaginable level and also in every other department is missing the same ... it's a sacrament to include foreign and predatory suits in this kind of waste.
