May 2: Someone clicked 11 NO, and then continued 15 others in my previous 15 comments: almost as funny as this turkey! May 1: <br /> <br /> When writing this, I'm still under a lot of what must be the funniest thriller I've ever seen. I have a big case of giggling, but I'll try to calm down. (It's a little hard to write when your nose spills a knot and your mouth drains out sporadic drooling on the keyboard.) A couple of young women just returning from vacation are driving on a shuttle bus. A couple of young guys join them. But the bus is not really a taxi: it's a bearable vehicle. Her driver was part of an organized "white slavery" gang that caught young women from airports, and they've been doing it for five years. (Don't laugh.) Five years at the SAME airport without ever making it to the police or even the FBI. (No giggles please.) Dozens of women seem to be missing in the same place for years and years - and yet no one will notice the trend. Is the FBI incompetent? It seems that the world of "shuttle" consists of three types of people: easily kidnapping blondes, silly / comatose / invisible FBI agents, and almighty psychotic gangsters (who hate sexy blondes with tattooed backs). The driver barely remained alive on this one mission, yet he did it for - I repeat - five years without killing or losing one of his limbs. (Stop laughing ...) I mentioned that the driver is immortal? Do I need to mention it? We all know that film psychos have immortal DNA. You can stab them repeatedly, bounce them off the walls of the bus, gently stroke them with a hammer, prick nine-inch nails in your ears ... Damn, could you put the average Hollywood psycho mouth in your hands, and still escape with little scratches. No, the driver is not Satan or even a smaller demon, but just a plain Hollywood psycho with better survival capabilities than the largest, most distinctive sewer cockroach. Basic plot outline: The guy loses all his fingers on one side in a silly scene. (A magical bus that reads and listens to the mind!) Passengers try to escape. They can't. It gets hurt. They are troubled. They argue. He's trying to escape. They can't. They're hurt. They argue. He's trying to escape. They can't. They're hurt. He's trying to escape. They can't. He's trying to escape. The kidnappers will catch the gun from the driver! Unfortunately, they do not kill him because the golden Hollywood rule of pacifism similar to Gandhi does not allow them to do it. (No giggling.) One of the other passengers will be part of the gang! (Stop laughing.) He is played by an actor who studied at Rob Zombie / John Travolta Over-Acting and Silly Mugging. There is a threat of rape. Later, one of those girls hits him with a crowbar over his head, about a dozen times ... very hard. A few seconds later he realizes again. Yeah, he'll survive. (Immortal, remember?) Kills a little later. (No idea how it would be! It shouldn't be destroyed.) The kidnappers argue. He's trying to escape. One of them escapes! Unfortunately, the psychos are too much of God's power to refrain from capturing their prey. The game begins again: passengers try to escape. They can't. They are troubled. They look into space. It gets hurt. He's trying to escape. They can't. I'm hurt ... <br /> <br /> Frankly, I believe a dazed, heavily disoriented, drunken snail would escape these nincompoop kidnappers with ease. There were many opportunities. At one point these blunt psychos (remember: five years!) Even send one of the hijackers to the grocery store! Leaves a message to the police. But yeah ... you guessed: this fictional fairy tale American city has no police. And just as you thought the movie couldn't get any stupid - even when Luc Besson and Brian De Palma joined forces to help him with the script - he does. Girls are kidnapped to be sent to a remote island (?), And this is accomplished by shipping as a cargo. It seems that this fictional America has no FBI, no police, and no border customs. But he has immortal criminals with more luck than twenty lottery winners. One blonde had her billionth chance to kill the driver and still failed. How come the victims in these stupid thrillers NEVER try to finish their immortal opponents as soon as they have them on the floor and hurt them? I think I answered it myself: they are immortal! So why bother, must think ... <br /> <br /> So why was one blond gasified to death and the other boxed and delivered alive (complete with a box for cats and the funniest photo ever since Demi Moore Primary School )? Could it be a tattoo? I think they killed the nicer, but it's me. Was it a nasty tattoo? Could it be that I don't care? Why should I look for logic in a movie made by imbecile (for imbeciles)? Besides, how can I think straight when I half laughed?! Naturally, this is a horror / thriller of the 21st century, the mobile phone doesn't work ... Maybe this unbeatable gang controls not only the FBI, the police and customs, but also satellites in space. Do I have to explain this? There are much easier ways to kidnap people. And much more intelligent people who should make movies. Give the idiot a camera and always lay an egg ... Such answers to the eternal riddle that came first: an egg or a director with birds.
