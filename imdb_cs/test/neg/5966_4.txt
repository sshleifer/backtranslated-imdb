I really liked this movie. Number 5, the star of the movie robot gets hit by lightning and something happened to its circuits. He behaves and thinks more like a man. The robot repeats ads that are learned after watching TV. He then applies these statements to his circumstances. Number 5 is fast and funny. The character imitates star voices, tries to dance like John Travolta at Staying Alive and many other things. He has a speech he remembered for most of his circumstances. Robot activity is really good. Number 5 wants to drive, cook and please Stefan with all the characteristics of man. The way robots move and line up is really hysterical. I'm disappointed that writers couldn't keep it clean for all viewers. This movie has a surprising end to what you wouldn't expect. I hate the movies they scold at them, even though they like to give them a lower rating. This movie had swearing words. Jesus Christ was used as a sworn word that offends me to be used at least three times. G-d D-m, Bull sh_t etc. It could have been an amazing movie that had all these offensive talks. There is no sex in this movie, some violence like robots who throw cars and machines.
