Avoid this! It's a horrible movie. What if it's very exciting? It's just meaningless murder. And the whole thing with Thorn and Michael's curse was the worst thing they could ever do! Why couldn't they leave Michael's story with a mystery? It's supposed to be Boogeyman, he's not part of a stupid cult! Ugh! Thank God for Halloween H20, which destroyed Halloween 3-6! Everyone licked! But anyway, if you see this movie, please expect more than senseless murder and gore.
