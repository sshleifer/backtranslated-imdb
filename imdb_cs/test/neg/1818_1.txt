This series is still frustrating and annoying. How will they pull it for another year? Each episode offers more and more questions while providing very few answers. If you want to quote another very popular website, I believe that this show has now shark skipped! <br /> <br /> Will I watch it? <br /> <br /> Probably <br /> <br /> Can they keep the show airborne to the end? Probably Not ... <br /> <br /> How did two qualified doctors not notice that Naomi is still alive? How did 30 plus people not notice the corpse that woke up and left with the knife still in the back?
