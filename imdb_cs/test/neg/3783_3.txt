I give him three instead of a lower number he deserves for his history. A feature film of high school students! It also shows, but it is part of the magic and attraction. Get some of the things that George Lucas did at UCLA; this is better. Maybe because it's a group effort. A monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage - these kids were far ahead of their time - they will begin to devastate the city of Milpitas in high school dance. The monster destroys accidentally, leaving trash and smelly traces. The film has local TV and radio people, mayor of Milpasu, director of Samuel Ayer High School, and a number of high school students and their students. parents, not to mention the mayor's daughter as a virgin. <br /> <br /> Stupid? Yeah! Entertainment? Yeah! Great typing on screen? Well, they're untrained college! Copy this note for acting, cinematography, directing, etc. <br /> <br /> Milpitas is just off San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley; maybe one of the graphics geniuses updates the video in some way. It's a challenge now.
