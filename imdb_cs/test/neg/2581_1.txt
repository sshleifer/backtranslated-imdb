"Patriot" staring at Steven Segal is a late 90s thriller / action movie that is not really a thriller and not a real action movie; rather, it is Steven Segal playing Steven Segal in a different name, but this time he is a native American physician who kicks his ass every now and then. Baring a distinct plot of hole hole, the film itself is absolutely amazing in terms of the obvious overlook of the nature of the transfer. From a marketing point of view, I asked myself, "Whom the world is heading for?" When you deep fried it and put it between the crunchy-cream donuts. The whole movie is right there, even for Segal fans, because it just doesn't give it any level.
