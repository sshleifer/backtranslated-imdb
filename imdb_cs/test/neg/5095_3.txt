This was one of the hardest movies I've ever seen. I am in the late 1940s and I watched it with my son-in-law (early 20) and son (17). The scenery was beautiful, but the story was a bust. We watched and turned off the hour. During the hour we watched, I spent more time on my iPhone than I actually spent watching the movie. I gave it 3 because I enjoyed the scenery and cinematography; otherwise I would give it 1. I'm sure there are people who are really in the "art" of all who find my scary rating, but we all have the right to our own opinions, right? I couldn't figure out if it was supposed to be a "cub" where she focused on her mother, or if she was supposed to be a movie for boys, focusing on battle and adventure. In my opinion, it did not succeed.
