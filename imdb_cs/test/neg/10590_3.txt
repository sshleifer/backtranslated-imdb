This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. The three chief members of the congregation didn't seem to click well. Giovanni Ribisi's character was quite unpleasant. For some reason, he seems to like to repeat what he says. If it was "Rain Man", it would be fine, but it is not. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10.
