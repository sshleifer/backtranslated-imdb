Yet another TV show is becoming a movie. Steve {The Office} Carell plays the ugly agent Maxwell Smart in a movie that's so bad that the worst movie you've ever seen has become the second worst movie you've ever seen. The Seventh Story - if you can call it a megalomaniac trying to dominate the world. It's so rude, it's totally pathetic. The only thing Anne Hathaway does when Agent 99 looks good - she seems to be unable to do anything else. Bill Murray has a subtle sense of limiting his screen time to approximately 90 seconds, and several faces of the TV series appear in very small roles. The film is supposed to be part of the thriller and part of the action movie. It's not so. Although I wasn't really a fan of the TV series, at least it was the light of years before this -hit. All this is dragged over dirt and cheaper any good memories we had. Thank God Don Adams isn't here to see it. Hold it hollywood! Make a lousy movie like this, and keep sendin 'em on multiplexes on a weekly basis. No wonder the film industry is coming down. This film is so rotten, it's not even good for laughter. If this movie were a newspaper, it could be used to align the bottom of a bird cage. There's no reason to see this movie. The root channel is more enjoyable than this. Rating - zero minus five stars. If you are not Masochist, STAY AWAY. Better yet, do what the name says - Get Smart and save yourself nine dollars. With it you will be able to buy about 2 liters of gas. Put it in the car and be grateful that you didn't waste your time going to the multiplex to see this bomb!
