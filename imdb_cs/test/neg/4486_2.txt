The only reason I rated this movie as 2 is because Channing Tatumis is beautiful, but the film is lacking in emotion and boring. I usually adore good romance, but this was just a waste of time, I didn't miss a tear, though it contained sad content that wasn't good at all. I'm not a film critic, but I advise girls to avoid it, unless Channing Tatum is the only reason you're watching it, and the rest of the movie is waste and if it wasn't I was good, I stopped watching much faster. It is a shame because if the actors were chosen for this film, they could have the potential to be a real blockbuster. .. If you are looking for a good scream or movie for a girl's night in ... give this girl !!
