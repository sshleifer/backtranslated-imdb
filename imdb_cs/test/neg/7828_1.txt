Tired, spoiled dreck. The chemistry between Argento and Madsen was as exciting as a wet donut. Their dialogue was dramatically uninteresting. The story was a mess. Forced action. Cinematography remains missing. Lazy and pointless. Kim Gordon and her character had no reason to be there. No one else was. I couldn't give two farts for any of the 'characters'. Their emotions jumped and jumped up as a drug addict who hates her heroin. Empty and boring. Why do I have to write ten lines of text to comment? I think I summed it up in the first three words. But of course it is not enough. I think it's the last time I'm bothering to waste time criticizing the film. Anyway, I saw 'Clean' and thought it was quite ineffective as well. Again, I didn't care about the characters, whether they lived or died.
