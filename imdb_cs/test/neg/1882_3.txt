Unlike Endearment and Steel Magnolia's, I left the cinema and felt very disappointed. I started getting into the characters and their complex relationships mother / daughter and father / daughter at the beginning. I even cried. But I had no sympathy for the characters with the end. The final act did not seem to be consistent with the character of the mother at all. Although it was pretty good, I thought the movie was disappointing overall.
