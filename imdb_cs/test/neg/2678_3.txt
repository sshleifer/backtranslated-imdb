Scanning through comments, there doesn't seem to be a lot of love for this movie, and it's not too hard to understand why it's garbage. Now I start by saying that the finished product was wounded in many ways by the death of Donald Pleasance (Dr. Loomis) in post-production. This required a re-jigging of the film's conclusion with Loomis buying a farm and taking what was supposed to be a double twist at the end with Micheal's place exchange with the mysterious "Man in Black" and I don't think Johnny Cash. /> <br /> Now to the story. The fifth film ended rather unsatisfactorily with Micheal Myers escaping from prison with a mysterious man in black. It turns out (aggh) that this person knows the origin of Michel's evil and is also a colleague of Dr. Loomise on behalf of Dr. Wynn. They also kidnapped Jamie Lloyd (played by Danielle Harris in Parts 4 and 5 but here played JC Brandy). Jamie, pregnant, escapes from Dr. Den. Wynn and Micheal follow her and kill her. But she had a child, so now she must watch the child to kill his great nephew. We hear some sad explanation of Michel's evil, which includes a gelic curse, bloodlines and mysterious symbols. The radio show is broadcast from the home town of Micheal for some reason, giving Micheal more unfortunate casualties. At the end of the film, just as this review is, it is vague, confusing, and without a very anti-Muslim end. Some sex scenes and nudity. Poor conspiracy, passive effects, with some good course of the mill slasher kills, but seriously lacks motivation. What was supposed to explain everything just aroused some new questions, made sections 4 and 5 useless, and it was the wrong way for a great actor in Pleasance to end his life and career.
