This movie confused me. I couldn't catch it. I thought I was missing something. I'm glad most agree with me. This is not always the case (see my recent RE: Extinction review). <br /> <br /> To explain the mistakes of this movie, it would be another famous waste of time ... so I'll do it. They are dressed like cowboys, but it's a modern age, isn't it? No? I do not get it ??? When I took the box, I thought: ZOMBIE WESTERN! COLD! So it was presented. I haven't seen it yet. I hope they did a good job. <br /> <br /> NOT! They tried to create an iconic character that would produce a series. They didn't try. They tried to make the Aussie indie zombies step on the caliber (and maybe riding on the ends of their coats) very well made by "UNDEAD". Well, maybe they just wanted to make a confusing, incoherent, messy movie salad that could eventually be made into something observable. No! This is the new number 2 on my Worst Zombie Movies list ever. There are really only two so far, "DAY DEAD: CONTAGIUM" being the first (not to be confused with "DEAD Day" which is one of my favorite zombie movies of all time). If you want to make a zombie movie (and I'm not a zombie movie maker, I'm just an expert), make a good one. A live dead flight is a good example of a decent recent zombie shoot. FYI. <br /> <br /> If you really forgive, you might think, well, they didn't throw at least something that would make us not want to go back? Guess what ... NO!
