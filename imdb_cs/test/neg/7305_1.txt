okay, let's cut the chase - it's not possible to give anything more than 1 out of 10; and yet you have to see it! Behavior is bad, but nothing is as bad as the scenario that is left before the production values. Cardboard Axes? Yeah, then we do. Car floor mats painted in silver and used as armor? here it is! The film pretends to be artistic, but it's just cheap; the same shots are used repeatedly - especially in stretched battle scenes; There is (thankfully!) a very small dialogue, and there is a lot of 'artistic' music to come home horror! And yet all that terrible is convincing - you just have to look through it so that you can say you've seen it. I didn't even get to the barren orchards, the "conspiracy", or the terrible special effects; It is really "how to do" school filming. This has to be seen - spreading the word and letting the whole world unite in mystery over what is happening on Earth at the end.
