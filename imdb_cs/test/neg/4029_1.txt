This is a lousy movie that I have no idea how it got on the shelves, they had to pay a movie shop to put it there, really! The story has no meaning at all, if you aren't on some serious drugs, you'll have to be on something to watch this whole piece of waste so you don't care about what's on TV because you're almost in a coma. Writing sounds as if a 5-year-old actor did it and his acting performances are worse than those in elementary school. Huge special effects that have been trying to do so stupid to spend $ 5 to make the whole movie look like that! Oh, that scene with an old woman who has a haircut for 80 years and ugly girls in rubber suits laughed with me and my friends. Did anyone really think it was a good idea to do it in the movie? That's hard to believe!
