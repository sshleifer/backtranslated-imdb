This film is about two female murderers who are about to kill the random men they meet. Wow, "Baise-moi" has become the worst movie ever in my list. The storyline is crazy, useless and useless. The whole movie is full of violence and sex and I'm sure no sensible parents would like to show this movie to their children. I don't understand what people will do or watch this movie. Maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires filled. There is simply no excuse or reason for the existence of this perverted and corrupt work. The only comfort I offer is that I watched him fast, so I didn't waste so much time.
