The only good thing about this unfair dreck is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free in college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless. Still acting and bad jokes can't be masked by the superb but stunning scenographic design (out of the way) on the Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers did in this movie, but I've never seen anything more depressing. It was nothing more than trying to get the success of Grinch (who has his opponents, but I really enjoyed it). It's hard not to sit in this failure and think about what better projects have been passed for funding. <br /> <br /> Want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with Grinch.
