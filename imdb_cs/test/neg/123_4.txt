First let me say that if you enjoyed Van Damme from the Bloodsport movie, you probably won't like this movie. Most of these movies may not have the best plot or best actors, but I get these kinds of movies for what they are. This movie is much better than any of the movies that other action guys (Segal and Dolph) have been thinking about going out for the past few years. Van Damme is good in the movie, the movie is worth watching Van Damme fans. It's not as good as Wake of Death (which I highly recommend to anyone who likes Van Damme) or In Hell, but in my opinion it's worth watching. It has the same feelings as where it is going to run. Good entertainment!
