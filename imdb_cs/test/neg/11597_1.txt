A group of environmentalists travel to the island to uncover a secret animal experimenting lab. When they arrive, they find themselves late. The government apparently tested its experiment on the chest of drawers and yes, you guessed that the cobra that grew out of them was very large. I'm not sure if this movie really needed or deserved an explanation because it's almost identical to Komodo's curse, which it also sucked. Computer effects are like cartoons as always comodo roars like a dinosaur who really got on his nerves. Like Boa vs. Python, this movie is not worth seeing and it is so fun to watch how it is to nail a hand to the table. Avoid!
