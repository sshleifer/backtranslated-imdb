I had this movie gave me, and I have to admit that I'm glad I didn't pay for it. The back of the box seems like a sexual triangle, with 2 women trying to seduce it. But the reality in this film is far from such. In fact, the main theme is the victim of evil and sadistic rape from two other characters. There was nothing at all that was interesting. Even movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things (which this box tries to compare with this movie) were thrilling because of unexpected turns and tensions. But Jaded has none of this. It focuses on rapeists and a sick relationship with a friend of one of them. And the conviction of a videotape that can prove that the story of the victims is true. Although it shows that rape of the same sex is possible, it is not a film that should happen. If possible, pass this film at all costs.
