I've never been a big fan of Almodovar, but in general I've always found something I like about his films. Unfortunately, I had more problems finding something to look forward to in Broken Embraces, then I would normally think I would. The biggest failure in Broken Embracesch is a character and a lack of depth they depict. The film is essentially a love story that is tragic, and one that wants to engage the viewer in their stories. I found this problem from the beginning. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero" director / screenwriter Mateo has sex with a very attractive young woman he has just met. His agent comes when the woman leaves. <br /> <br /> In the opening scene, our "hero" director / screenwriter Mateo has sex with a very attractive young woman he has just met. His agent is coming and his eyes are rolling. Mateo is babbling about the need to enjoy life as the only thing he left. When the viewer was blinded by the tragic car accident that also killed Lena's "true" love, which Penelope Cruz played, the viewer could get into that idea, with the exception of the rest of the film that never tells why Lena was the love of his life or any other life . the depth of his character or other. Cruz plays Lena's mistress to an industrialist named Ernesto Martel. From the outset, their union is pathetic, as Martel paired jealousy with Lena, and Lena avoids the uncertainty of staying with much older Martel. To get ahead, Martel finances a movie for Mateo to watch Lena's cards. Lena and Mateo naturally fall in love. And in the world of Almodovar, it's that simple. Mateo, in the opening scene, has sex with a sexy young woman, now Mateo falls in love with Lena, later revealing that he had a son with his agent after their love affair. Her son reacts to this information with a laugh and: "Well, well." Again, no depth, no understanding for some of these characters, it all happens. From the beginning of the film to the end, I had no emotions from Mateo. It's flat and doesn't act much different from one scene to the next. One scene I enjoyed was when film producer Martel watched a video of his son recorded under cover of doing documentary Mateo. It's a nice moment when Martel watched his lips read his worst fears. Later, Lena meets Martel as she looks at the footage, and speaks loudly to her part that corresponds to the video of her lips as she speaks. Some brilliant moments. On the contrary, but still really fascinating. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie bored me a bit. I couldn't worry about these characters or their situations, so no lack of cleverness on the part of Almodov could replace this lack of depth. I think if you are a fan of his work, you will enjoy this movie, but if you are like me, in between, you will find it missing.
