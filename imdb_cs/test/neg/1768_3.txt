A badly-walked sf / horror business that takes itself too seriously, unforgettable only for (and) beautiful Mathilda May wandering naked through chaos and (b) terrible miscasting. It has some mildly horrifying effects and surprising moments, and some unintentionally funny scenes, but it's usually a waste of time.
