I've seen some bad action movies in my days, but this is just awful. I feel it's a waste of time to write it, but I'll make it short. Why suck this movie? Here are 10 reasons: 1. Very amateur directed and edited. 2. Poor bad performance of the whole cast. 3. Silly dialogues and too much clich√©. 4. Too much hole plot, lots of scenes do not add up. 5. Bad photography (and lots of continuity issues). 6. Sadly bad performance of leading female actress. 7. Unreliable action scenes (and not too good). 8. Even for Snipes, he shows a great lack of acting material. 9. Stunning accents (from all casts). 10. Last but not least - too many unlikely facts, such as the US football tournament, the CIA that need to perform background checks to get new information about their employees, a mattress that is explosion-proof and so on. Basically - it's a waste of time, it's not funny, not funny, not even a joke - DON "T WATCH IT !!! Seriously, just not."
