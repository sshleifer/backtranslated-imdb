Bad. Personal opinion? The people who did it? They knew when they did it. To play in this movie, again my opinion, you have to meet three criteria ... # 1: You had to own your own clothing and jewelry in Goth style. This makes the cabinet easier and cheaper. # 2: You must have been able to remember and repeat your card rows. Note that I didn't say you have to do it well. Saves time and paperwork. # 3: You had to be willing to be naked. It provides an R rating to boost sales. Want to watch a better movie? Easy. Get the camera and some of your friends together and do it yourself. Trust me, you won't be worse. How vampire movies, well, this is upset. And a hint here for people like me who like to look for peculiarities in movies ... Consider the connection between vampires and crosses. Now look at the symbols and names on the tombstones in the cemetery parts of this thing that were filmed. Ed Wood couldn't have better planned this kind of accident.
