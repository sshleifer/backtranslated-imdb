After a good start it turned out to be the worst piece of holier I've ever seen. This movie is an open insult designed to make you feel bad when you don't read "holy bible". <br /> <br /> To continue ... OK let's say a conspiracy ... Basically a stranger kidnapped by people (we already know ..). No, in fact, his demonic powers will kidnap people who are in a new age or witchcraft, or read a porn magazine (as one protagonist does). It's complete with a little emotional piano music when the main character realizes he must blindly follow Christ to be saved. <br /> <br /> Quotes summarize everything, imagine soft piano music in the background: "You can't let the others, even the ones you love, stop you in following Lord ..." we're supposed to live in an enlightened age ... keep working
