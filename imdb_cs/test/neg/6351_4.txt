I rented this movie from a local library and thought it would be a good idea to think that I like this type of movie and consider who is in it, but the boy was wrong. Combat scenes, battle scenes were just as bad, and they got a couple of well-known people to be in it, but they didn't play anyone with acting ability. I noticed that some people gave it 10. Why would you ever consider giving this pile of horses **** and 10. You can say it's worth 10 for total comedy, but when you vote for a movie that's not supposed to be a comedy that you can't give 10 for comedy. You have to evaluate it on what it was supposed to be, and not on something the director did not intend. Maybe some of you voted 10 because you thought it would be funny to have this crappy high-ranking movie so people go out and rent or buy because you think it's fun to introduce people. You play with people time and money that you do not have the right to do. If the film is sucked in to give a bad rating if it was good to make it a good rating, but don't lie. I gave this movie 4 and I am glad I could check it for free from my library because this movie sucked and is not really worth paying a penny to see.
