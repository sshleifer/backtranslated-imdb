Well, it represents one beautiful wink-and-you-miss-it-wit (when the dead rise from their tombs, the names of old times "horror" directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in tombstones) and smashing morally bankrupt beet / con / rightist villains is in place: sad skanking of sermon morals etc. But why are these soldiers ant Republicans?

Why did this story create a movie? Questions never answered ...
