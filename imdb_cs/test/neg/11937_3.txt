I had great hopes for this movie when I saw the list and decided to watch it on TV, uninterrupted by commercial breaks. I liked Lee Van Cleef in many movies, but I'm afraid that when other characters call him, Chris doesn't change him to Chris Yul Brenner's sensible faculty. <br /> <br /> I found this movie is a total disappointment - the music soundtrack tried to pass the magnificence shown in the original, but also failed to bring the film to the original. The rich textures of the characters in the original were mostly missing from this film. I think if you didn't see the original, it would be fine. Too much clich√© and too little depth to the characters. I missed humanity and compassion and three-dimensional figures of the original.
