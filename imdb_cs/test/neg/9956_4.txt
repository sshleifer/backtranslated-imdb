First, I must say that I am not a big fan of werewolf films in general. It's not that they don't like it, just that they don't like it very much. There are some that I enjoyed ... Werewolf from London (1935, Stuart Walker), American Werewolf in London (1981, John Landis) ... and some that I thought were okay, but nothing Special ... The Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner), Howling (1981, Joe Dante), Dog Soldiers (2002, Neil Marshall) are some examples ... but overall, a werewolf sub-genre is not my favorite. But I had this on one of those 50 movie sets, so I thought I'd give it and watch it. Spoilers follow ... <br /> <br /> Mad Monster is a werewolf story, but a werewolf is primarily used as a means of revenge by a mad scientist Dr. Lorenz Cameron (George Zucco). Dr. Cameron discovered a way to transform human beings into animals, specifically wolves, but ridiculed and ostracized the larger scientific community. Forced from a prestigious position, he went crazy and plots revenge on those who mocked him in an old country mansion, where he lives with his daughter Lenora (beautiful Anne Nagel) and his assistant Petro (Glenn Strange) of limited mental abilities. Dr. Cameron uses his serum to turn Petro into a werewolf and send him to kill his old opponents. But finally, the werewolf Petro gets out of control and both the mad doctor and his creatures are killed. The film also takes place somewhat like murder / criminal drama, with Lenor's journalist suitor (Johnny Downs) investigating the strange behavior of the doctor and the rash of murders. It seems that the story has borrowed many elements from other large images that preceded it. There are reminders of Frankenstein (1931, James Whale) in creating a monster that runs an amok, and a creature to kill an innocent child. In the minds of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931, Rouben Mamoulian or 1941, Victor Fleming Version) and Wolf Man (1941, George Waggner). And this is one of the problems with this movie in my opinion - it's an average combination of some great movies. It doesn't add much to the genre. It is true that there are some redeeming properties. George Zucco's performance was convincing and the scene on which Dr. Lorenzo talked to his visions / hallucinations of his torturers, helping me to show his madness. There is some rational character to build, at least in the case of his character. But Glenn Strange's character is not convincing at all and seems to have this comedic quality - whether deliberate or not - I'm not sure that it will not fit into the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> It seemed like I liked it more than most IMDb users based on my 4/10 rating, but it was still a below average movie. Perhaps it is worth seeing if you are a fan of early werewolves or a big fan of horror movies of the 1930s and 1940s, but are unlikely to reach you unless you are.
