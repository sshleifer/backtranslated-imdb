I loved the first "American Graffiti" with all my heart and soul, which I thought was the best rock n 'roll movie, along with being the best teenager I've ever seen. The first film spawned the career of George Lucas who would later make a blockbuster epic "Star Wars" before doing prequels two decades later while doing Richard Dreyfuss's star in Jaws, Close Encounters of Third Kind and other movies as well. Somehow without the two, magic died. "More American Graffiti" shows viewers what happened to other characters later in the 1960s, when Steve (Ron Howard) and Laurie (Cindy Williams) protest the Vietnam War while their friend Terry "toad" "Field (Charles Martin Smith) is at war alone and trying to get out. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is still a hot racer in California, where he never left home. The rest of the supporting actors in Debbie's Candy Clark (Terry's girlfriend), members of the Pharaoh gang, don't do much with Harrison Ford and others. The original film showed teenagers crossing the streets without bloodshed with early music of rock n 'roll by Buddy Holly, The Fleetwoods, Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, Bill Haley and Comets, Buddy Knox and others that brought back a nostalgic mistake. classical music. More American Graffiti is a blend of rock, soul, country, hippie music, and everything that moods during the 1960s, protesters, drugs, victims, and more. After watching "More American Graffiti" it seemed like he wanted to show the audience what happened after the epilogue of the four main characters in the first movie (with the exception of Dreyfuss' character), where it was not necessary. Nor was this film necessary because I was glad that neither Lucas nor Dreyfuss had gone to bigger and better projects.
