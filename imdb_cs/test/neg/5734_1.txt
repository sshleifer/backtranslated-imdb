In the mid-70s my NYC apt. The building was finally involved in cable TV and since Showtime (instead of HBO) was the only premium channel offered to display recent movies, I signed up for it. Being a writer and a night owl by nature, I soon discovered that the channel shows movies late at night and until the early hours of which I have never heard of - most of them are independent American and foreign films that have never been given an American theatrical release. Many of them had recognizable "star" casts and reputable directors, and thanks to Showtime, I discovered many first-class movies that I would never see (and other Showtime subscribers). Most of these film mongrels were really "dogs", but often so bad that they were unintentionally cheerful. One night, Showtime presented a small Italian gem called "Redneck" (filmed in 1972, with a limited European edition in 1973). Although the film was never released in the US, the MPAA rating was "R". Since the director was one of Sylvio Narizzano (the director who made his name with the famous "Georgy Girl"), and the three leaders were Mark ("Oliver") Lester, Fabio Testi and Telly Savalas, I decided to try. And for 89 minutes I approached the TV screen in disbelief. As I recall, Savalas and Testi played two criminals, a former frantic maniac who accidentally sent a German family to their deaths in a stomach-shaking scene by shoving a trailer off a cliff, plunging deep into the wilderness below. So bad. Then, out of the blue, Testi (like "nice" psycho) and Lester (all 14 when the movie was made) are seen naked, in a man's room, Testi sneak peeks at the baby's body while shaving, and poor confused Lester fixed on close-up shots of Testi's naked ass. As a not-yet-tired member of the film industry, and a card-bearing liberal (I was as much against censorship then as I am today), all the film upset me (and, being early '70s when I thought "I saw everything what is in those films of the liberated era in terms of everything in what is going on - including the uncut version of Altman's "That Cold Day in the Park", the real jaw until it was trimmed for "R" and spelled Career The End for Altman, when he wasn't dating anything called "M * A * S * H", I was still wondering if anyone else but me had ever seen "Redneck" and was horrified as I was. Catching up actors and moviegoers is a pleasure the maladjusted filmmakers are happy about since the beginning of time. But sipping a highly respected and talented child actor (Mr. Lester) at a time when he was starting to make a difficult transaction from child to adult actor (and I'm sure his movie offerings have diminished to insidious junk like "Redneck"). Mr. Narizzano, you should hang your head in shame. (By the way, I was soon with friends who appeared in Narizzan's future, undifferentiated effort. They both disdained him.
