"Electra Glide in Blue" is a slow B-flick movement in which Blake plays a desert motorcycle cop who wants to be a homicide detective and becomes involved in a murder investigation. At best, the average movie "EG in B" presents some members of the Chicago band, a whiff of action, philosophizing, and lots of boring dramatic fillings. It's not worth the time.
