The first watched 2/9/2008, 4 out of 10 (Dir-J.S. Cardone): A sexual political thriller that will not do very well in any of these areas until the beginning of the soft-core scenes. The film begins to portray a couple of exploration of their sexual fantasy in the middle of their working environment or anywhere and what suits their imagination. The couple go on a trip to a hiding place and a spa house where they come across a woman who is willing to be part of the trio and fulfill some of their fantasies. At this point, we only know that this couple is well off, but we do not know until it comes back that the fiancé is part of a well-functioning political family. The man hopes to be up to the point where he may get a congress chair after marriage. Then they get a package in an anonymous source mail with explicit pictures of their meeting at the spa house, and their qwest begins with how and why they were filmed, who sent the package, what they wanted, and how to clear their names before they got out of it. This qwest becomes an obsession that leads them deeper into the lighter worlds and takes a lot of time for their friends and family to wonder what they're doing all day and why they keep looking at what they look like. This movie is sometimes interesting, but it delves into ridiculousness because they are personally looking for a problem instead of getting involved soon because of their pride. This error, of course, keeps the movie going. The performances are all right despite the no-name cast, but the madness of the situation prevails and the film is beginning to be a buzz around the ½ way. And, of course, at the end, he tosses a twist that defies and questions everything that happened before (as it is now the norm when they don't know what to do to make the film). But this does not help this film.
