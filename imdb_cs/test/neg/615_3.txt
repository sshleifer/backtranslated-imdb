This is a movie that makes me cringe. In 1951, MGM and Looney Toons made some of their best cartoons - with amazing animation, exceptional backgrounds and great stories. Then, in the late 40s, a new style of animation began to appear (such as "Crusader Rabbit" series on television) - an animation with an extremely simplistic artwork in order to save money. Unfortunately, Columbia Picture is a cynical trick worked !! Instead of hating the toons (as they should), many have been accepted and the Oscar people (AMPAS) have actually awarded this film Best Animated Short - giving legitimacy to a lower product. Unfortunately, in the dollars and sensory world of Hollywood, it soon began to sneak into the products of legitimate studies - which led to somewhat miserable cartoons. Later it was even worse because, in addition to lousy animations and backgrounds, stories themselves became almost unbearable for adults. The wisdom and style of classic cartoons were gone. And for this tragedy, guilt, in part, GERALD MCBOING-BOING - one of the granddaddies of cheap cartoons. The story is not so bad, but animation is a horror and listening to a boy who says "boing-boing" is always pain.
