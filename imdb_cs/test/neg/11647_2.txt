What did I think when I rented this one? What did the distributor think when you copy the tape and sent it all the way to Holland? That anyone would like to see this with ***?!? The point is that some astronauts get into a troubled universe (Apollo 13 flashback, but never in the shadow of this subtle film) and want to go home. If you're in such a movie, you should be glad to be as close to the ground as possible! This one wants to surf the small wave of space movies in 1998 (Deep Impact and Armageddon), and this fails everywhere. Deep Impact and Armageddon were not perfect (far from him), but at least once they were worth seeing (and maybe once again when we're all old). They had some fun. Max Q is not. Gives irritation. Good good. It's a TV movie, but does it mean you have the chance to come up with such a mess? If you haven't touched your own vomit (with all cheap drama and worthless Dialogue), you have to be bored of death with this waste of time. It gets to the worst at the end when the shuttle lands on ... No, I can't spoil "this one (IMDb instructions banned). So you have to see for yourself. NO! DO NOT DISPLAY IT (sorry), but rent a movie worth renting (like Battlefield Earth ... just kidding!) <br /> <br /> Probably the worst I've ever seen.
