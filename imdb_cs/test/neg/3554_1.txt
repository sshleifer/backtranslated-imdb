One of the most boring movies I've ever had to sit on is absolutely formal. Just a movie movie, you can predict every scene in the movie just because you know the genre, because this movie doesn't bring anything new. Dialogue is never funny, interesting or intelligent.

Nothing fresh, unforgettable or fun in this movie, combined with the fact that it's LONG gives an easy thumb down. Sorry, fans. <br /> <br /> F
