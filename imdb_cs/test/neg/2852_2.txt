This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only reason I gave him 2 stars out of 10 is the look of a wonderful Lydie Denier in some scenes. Despite her 42 years old she is an amazing woman in every aspect, her nude scene in the bathroom with Armand Assante's as hot as hell. Anyway, about the movie, and nothing really interesting to say, Neonazi and the Turkish gang fight for Berlin in scenes that include people who open fire on the street in daylight and inside the club where they shoot 30- 40 people and machine guns in place that is no bigger than my house, and amazingly after a few hours of shooting only three 10 is injured by LOL. While the gangs are fighting for the Berlin Territory, the serial killer kills small children and then puts them in different places on the white. Armand Assante appears as a Turkish detective who has worked for the police but was a former leader of the Turkish gang and is now in the process of solving the serial killer's crimes. The film seems to be a very bad tear of the classic M movie. Killing children, engaging the underworld, the character of a serial killer, and the ultimate "attempt" serial killer scene is more than influenced by this classic movie. Acting is terrible, the scenario is just stupid, the production of the lowest standards is possible and in general it was a great waste of time and money. Don't even bother renting this.
