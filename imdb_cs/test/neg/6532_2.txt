I saw this film at the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2005. <br /> <br /> This movie was compared to the EIFF with Sideways - which I liked - so I was really looking forward to this movie. I also liked Garden State, Napoleon Dynamite etc ... so I had good recent experiences with slightly strange American indy movies. Unfortunately I found out that the Puffy Chair does not compare favorably with any of these films. I sat for 35 minutes waiting for something funny, funny, bright or even slightly interesting. No - and the shaking video camera made me sick - so I left. This is just the second movie I've ever left (the first was "Showgirls"), which is slightly disappointing. Probably I could take the duration if it wasn't for the vomiting effects of the ripple image - but nothing in the first 35 minutes gave me the impression that I was missing something. Disappointment.
