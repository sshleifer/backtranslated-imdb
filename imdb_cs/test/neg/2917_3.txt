Harold Lloyd's lame soundtrack makes him laugh and makes a miracle if this Lloyd is even the same who did all the beautiful and happy silence. when we hear him speak and the slow, restrained pace replaces the old man's silence. Lloyd plays a young missionary son who grows up in China and then transplants into contemporary New York without knowing how life outside his Chinese village works. He finds himself unlikely to win the mayor's election and quickly draws the wrath of all governmental organizations because he refuses to look the other way in the face of exuberant corruption. When framed in an effort to cut him down, he decided to play as dirty as everyone else, and he impersonates the false performance of every cheater in New York as a frightened tactic. This dark satirical ending does not feel completely next to everything else in the movie, but it is the only part of the film that takes place remotely. Everything else is boring. I do not like to admit that Harold Lloyd's film will fail because I love him, but I have no choice. br /> <br /> Stage: D
