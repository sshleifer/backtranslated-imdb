This film was allegedly based on non-fiction literature. I'm not sure what book he wrote the script to write his adaptation, but it has nothing to do with the real life adventure of Frances Mayes in Italy. Instead, it is an uninteresting story that takes freedom at any moment to bash men. Write down the following examples: <br /> <br /> ************************************* ******************************* <br /> <br /> SPOILER DETAILS <br /> <br /> * ************************************************** ******** ***************** <br /> <br /> Bash Number One: Husband Lane cheating on her and her marriage ending in divorce. Bash Number Two: Lane launches in the local Italian city and is prompted by every man on the street. Bash Number Three: Lane is rescued from horny urban folk by enchanting masters. She falls on him after eating afternoon making love. She later finds out she is already connected and cheating with her. Bash Number Four: You have to expand your horizon for this one because the link is definitely in the movie. Her friends with a lesbian couple decide to have a baby by invetro (SP?) Fertilization. I am told that in most lesbian relationships you have one person who takes on a female role, and another on a male role. In the movie, after a woman was pregnant, a "male" lesbian decides to run for a relationship because she can't handle it. In conclusion, this film has nothing to do with the book it was supposed to be based on.
