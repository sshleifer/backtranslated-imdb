I saw it at the Fantasy Filmfest in Cologne and I left the cinema in the middle of this "movie" (with a bunch of other people), so maybe I'm not the one who can comment on it, but I think it's really leaving. "it's a good reason. "S.C." is another film. People who need coherent narration, characters or conspiracy will find nothing in this. It's supposed to be an experimental film, relying on the power of images. But these images have no power. They are thus forced to simply earn people that they have nothing to say. Gibbering off-narrator is just boring, visuals are cheap. OK, the effects are good, but if it's the only thing to worry about? Husseins wants to be shocking and provocative - instead it is boring and unpleasant in its creativity. Note: Not every film without a story is an art and there is absolutely no creativity in breaking taboos - not at all if everything is done as badly as in "S.C.". I would suggest that director Hussein visit a psychiatrist or film school before returning to art. Note: I never want the baby to give birth again at birth.
