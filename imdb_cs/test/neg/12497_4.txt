Plot Synopsis: Los Angeles in the future. Crime is maintained under the control of Core Trackers, killers of androids dispatched by the United States Computer Trial to execute the culprit. Secret Service Agent Eric Phillips prevents an attack on his boss, Senator Robert Dilly (a man who founded USCJS), a human rights group, a group of machine activists. Dilly attempts to initiate Phillips into his private circle, but the SS agent is on the run after seeing Dilly murder the UHR agent in cold blood. Dilly sends him Core Trackers. Phillips joins the UHR group and helps them discover the Dilly plot. "Cyber ​​Tracker" is the first of a series of sci-fi / action hybrids by director Richard Pepin, co-founder of PM Entertainment, the power of action movies in the 1990s. Other Pepin movies include "Hologram Men", "T-Force", "Shockers" and "Dark Breed". Pepin's films typically begin with a major action sequence that lasts about 10 minutes before plotting permission to dig in. Script for this movie has a few hole plots? It is never clear what is actually a plot that heroes are trying to stop. As for acting, Don "The Dragon" Wilson may be tough, but he can't act for beans, with little charism. His stars are much better. The best film tip is action scenes that evoke an impressive artillery fire, huge bodycount and not one, but three moments when the vehicle flies through the air, flips over and hits the ground, explodes. Visual effects border on the left side and the music score is low-key and piercing.
