Drug Runner Archie Moses presents his friend Rock Keats to his boss, drug king Frank Colton. Unknown to Moses, Keats is actually a secret police officer. During the bust at Colton's factory, Moses accidentally shoots Keats in the head. He survives the wound and later arrests Moses. Dodge Colton's hired killers, the duo must overcome their mutual hatred to survive. Adam Sandler's films are usually a hit-and-miss affair, with his comedies either loved by his fans or hated by everyone. This one isn't as stupid as his other movies, but he still can't overcome the lazy scenario. The direction is incredibly uneven, with fast action sequences that cause slow comic exchanges between Sandler and Damon Wayans. Some of the action scenes? flying a plane without engines, chasing a car at night through the woods? they are absolutely absurd. Acting is the standard for this genre, with Sandler and Wayans making good pairing. In short, the movie is stupid but fun to watch. Degree: C + Review by M. K. Geist
