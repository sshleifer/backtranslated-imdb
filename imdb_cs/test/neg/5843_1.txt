That was one of the biggest pieces of crap I ever had to watch. Seriously. How would someone else feel if they were in Woody Harrelson's shoes and your wife would even consider that it would be good to sleep with a second guy for a million dollars. After all, she talked about it in bed and said how good it would be to them because she could build her house or anything with money. Woody never agreed to this until she told him. How can you trust her? Who the hell would he even think if he got married? I don't care how desperate they were. That's the funniest thing I've ever heard in my life. Then he jumps at her. Apparently he had no right to distrust her, except that his wife had just slept with another dude who was extremely rich and handsome. And wait, then he should apologize to Him after he gets a divorce order to be with the guy she slept with. Of course, Woody has no right to tell her or trusts her, especially after she has Roya Hobb's card in her wallet. At the end of the film, he is obviously in love with Woody, and he lacks so much that he doesn't want to leave Hobbes until he makes some ridiculously stupid story to try to suggest her go, and she bleeds thanks to Hobbs ???? Are you kidding me? Was she in the contract as his sex slave or something? I mean, what the beep? Oh and wait for it to be better. Bleedingly kisses him before he gets out of the car. Yeah, she's not a bitch. Thank you for letting me go, let me go with you for good oil. Smooch smooth, smooth, though I'm still married to the guy I left for a rich guy. I've never seen such a piece of crap in my life. How the hell do we feel good after the terrible end? What was this movie supposed to present? NEVER THIS GAME! That was the nonsensical movie I've ever seen in my life. Two pathetic desperate people. If I were Woody, I'd tell her to drown herself in the water body she was in. Apparently he had no respect. What the hell was Roy Hobbs thinking when he took this terrible part. After watching it, I feel like banging. This movie was so bad, it was really laughing. I want those two hours of life back that I watched unnecessarily.
