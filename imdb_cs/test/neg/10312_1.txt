He found this movie in a discount DVD rack for $ 10. It wasn't worth it. Some camera and dialogue work looks and looks like a film student did. Sandra's performance was somewhat credible, but the movie was predictable, and the action was speckled and dragged. One thing I give them, however. Unlike most action movies, people in this movie actually ran out of ammunition and scattered dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition.
