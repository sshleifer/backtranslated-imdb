Once upon a time, back in the 1940s, there was an actress named Veronica Lake. A beautiful, talented young woman who was once in high demand for many big-budget, Hollywood pictures. Fast Forward at the end of the sixties, age, alcoholism, and all-round bad luck tarnished all the popular actresses. Miss Lake decided it was time to follow the steps of her peers, Joan Crawford and Bette Davis, and return to good, reliable horror. But flesh feast? Really? She couldn't be so washed up. To say it gently, Flesh Feast is a lifeless waste, maybe one of the top 5 worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all. The lake plays a scientist who draws with the Nazis to bring Hitler to life, with attempts to restore youth that include worms, that's true, worms. If you are a huge fan of Heather Hughes, run away and never look back !! I know about this person, Veronica Lake, as well as 40 years, I know very little, but I think that such a successful career has actually become so depressing, it's actually quite sad. Flesh Feast is almost impossible to go through, and almost, I think absolutely. Director Brad Grinter, director of Nudist Camp Pictures, and the man who suddenly brought us the biggest B-movie ever made, Blood Freak, just a few years later. You must be surprised that this would be what it would be if it were if Grinter and director Steve Hawkes did not manage? If so, then God bless Steve Hawkes. You don't think Religious, cruel desire for blood, Turkey Monster could be much better than experiments with Maggots and Hitler, but really, really. So forget that you've ever heard of this and you go to find Blood Freak, it's just waiting for fun. Fast forward a few years later, Veronica Lake dies of Hepititas, broke and forgot. End. I hate you, flesh feast. 1/10
