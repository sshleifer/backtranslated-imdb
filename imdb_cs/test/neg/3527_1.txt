"Nuts in May" can be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If Ed Wood was still alive, it would be the kind of movie he would do. But how bad is it? Well, here are the two levels of badness that I'm going after; "It's so bad it's good" or "it's so bad it's a great God". This film is part two. What little unintentional humor does not replace the slow, hard to understand, boring majority of the movie. SUMMARY: SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Two Middle Age Anglo-Saxons Take a trip to the countryside for some R&R and camping where they met Ray, who soon becomes Jim ( I'll explain later) which tent is next to our main couple. For most of the film, the two trips go to the beach, the quarry and other places of interest. Among these adventures they talk forever about the environment, vegetarianism, fossil collection, the duty of a good citizen and the right diet, all I want to see in comedy. They wore no one to listen to them. Dialogue is not only bad, but stimulation in some scenes is so slow that I sometimes felt like dosing. The scenes would go on forever, and just when it starts to build and something happens, the scene ends. In the middle of the movie, I thought, "Nothing's going to happen in this matter, it's really a movie about nothing." <br /> <br /> Characters are annoying and keep repeating things. On the one hand, I felt that the director played a cruel joke on his audience. The scene I mean is the "Sing Along" scene. In that, our two wild British play some music for us, actually it was the same four four lines over and over and over and over. The idea was for Ray to sing with them, but Ray knew, like us, that they were the worst composers known to man. This scene was out of time, the fifth time the song was played, I began to doubt the existence of a merciful God. The words can't describe the horror of this movie. The first thing that hits you is the indecipherable British accents most cast. Remember the strong Scottish accents in Trainspotting? Times that do 10. <br /> <br /> Towards the end of our tree hugging, incoherent, the couple get into battle with some of Ray's friends who have total disrespect for camping rules. Our hero is so angry that there is a climate battle between our hero and the main hell. To settle their dispute, the two men engage in a stick fight. That's the right fight! Right now, unusual humor begins. I laughed so hard that I thought it might be another 80 minutes. After this histeric battle, our hero runs behind some bushes to shout eyes and the other calls Ray by calling Jim for some unknown reason. and the character's name changes to 3/4 in the movie, Ed Wood would be proud. Although I was once again forced to last the last 10 minutes, they will end up with a long selection of pig. Why? Who the hell knows. At one point, we see the grazing on the pig and other shots begin to play on the screen. One of the worst ends of one of the worst movies ever.
