Full and complete film throughput. "Dark power'is is the kind of film that would be three embarrassed to relax. The screenplay, directing, acting and action sequences are so desperate that it's almost painful to watch and one cant help thinking it's just 75 minutes of running time. The aforementioned reviewer must be in relation to the director because this is the only reason I can see his rating of this waste, some might call him b-movie entertainment or "so bad that it's good" just to excuse the enjoyment him, but when the leading actor (and the most experienced cast member) cant deliver his line convincingly you know you have a very, very bad movie.
