The heart of darkness, Joseph Conrad's short novel about greed, corruption, and Africa's travel, was at least tedious reading. The narrator follows Marlow, a sailor who travels to deep Africa to save Kurtz, a somewhat miraculous ivory merchant who is allegedly mad, this conclusion came when Ivory stopped coming to the main port. The basis of the story is that Conrad write richly from the surroundings, the scene beautifully, but maybe a little to a great extent. The story looked more like a water-color painting that resembles the slow creeping mild action story Conrad intended. Sometimes it happens that after reading a book you may be watching a movie feature might help correspond with some thoughts with those in the book, or vice versa. Not so with Heart of Darkness, even with the supporting role of actor John Malkovich's masterpiece, the film confused me more, there were no real main characters in the movie, no one excelled in others, not extensive symbolism. he explained. It was somewhat bland and drunk to say at least. In all respects to the author, The Heart of Darkness is a true short novel work, that touches on some very serious subjects, lies Marlow. and Kurtz's greed. It's not a book that should be taken lightly, and it will be in a somewhat dark mood. I feel that a book like this could be difficult for many people. However, I would recommend this book to those who long for a sad pseudo action story without a happy ending textbook.
