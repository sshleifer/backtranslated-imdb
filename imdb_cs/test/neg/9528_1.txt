Lois Weber "Hypocrites" was and still is a very daring and courageous film. I liked it and I was impressed by the shooting and the story. The priest sees the hypocrisy of the people in his church and tries to show them the "naked" truth. People are horrified to reveal a naked statue depicting the truth after not leading it to her, and the few who did it helped along the way. People do not want to face the truth that they are doing something wrong, but they show them that they put things before God, go to beach parties who act inappropriately, their materialistic ways and other things in which people of our world tend not to be morally correct. Eventually, if he has no followers, he must enter only through the gates of heaven. It seems to me that this film is very courageous in the fact that a naked woman appears in it, especially in view of the time period in which the film was made. The images and symbolism portrayed in this movie I found incredibly. The way they made a naked woman translucent and using naked women to symbolize naked truth, shows a lot of creativity and art. To show the different sins of people when they walked on the road and refused to follow the road, each with different excuses, failures and / or higher priorities, was a great way to represent people today. This movie has a very good job of getting a moral message to your audience. Lois Weber has a tremendous way to capture viewers' attention through creativity, symbolism, visual means and through hearing. Even the music of the piano in this film is very beautiful and it matches the whole theme.
