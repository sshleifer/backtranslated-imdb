Holy Sweet Murder is perhaps the smallest funny movie I've ever seen. you can take it as a truth, because right now he's playing on TV. it's really one of the most pitiful productions I've ever seen. it is not the only redeemable aspect of this film. he has no humor at all. The only good thing he may have is that it's so rude that it's totally infallible. In fact, I just sat over some ridiculous sub-fence and I can't tell what's going on. The only reason I even remember that I saw this movie is that it's so totally humorless that it will stick in my mind forever on the basis of it myself. <br /> <br /> Absolutely must be missed. If your friend wants to show you, shoot him and save yourself boredom.
