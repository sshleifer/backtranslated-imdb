The film tells you to be conscious and conscientious. It also destroys all and all things, the Bible claims to be true. For people like me, the first episode was interesting and the second was disastrous. It was called "blasphemy", and it is if you are a believer. It is sad to hear that many people consider it a good continuation of the Bible. However, the film shows you a lot of things and things that can be interpreted as a film version of "Revelation". Some of us think that such things should not be abused. One good thing about the film is that it strongly promotes ethical awareness and makes it your action twice. The director seems to have forgotten that some people act in this way just because they believe and love as prescribed in the Bible ... Why is he trying to change it if you're not the devil himself?
