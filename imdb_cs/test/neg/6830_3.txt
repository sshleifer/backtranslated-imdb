I'd like to avert the temptation to see this movie, it's just boring. The characters are predictable and mindless. Assassin is quite illiterate. There is no tension, fun, no style or flash of originality in this train wreck. And the morass of Hollywood clich√©s is stuffy. And you have a movie that makes the hero an IRA terrorist. Cute. And now I have to talk to fill ten lines. And a little more Is it enough? Not quite, how is it now? No, further confabulation should do a trick, but Jackal is really not worth ten lines of exposure. But the original was great.
