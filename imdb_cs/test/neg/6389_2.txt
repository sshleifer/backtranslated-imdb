This puddle derived drivel stole from every Soviet film and failed miserably. I stayed with the experience of everything that is wrong with organized religion in general and the particular shortcomings of the Russian Orthodox Church (remember that this commentary comes from a person of faith). Even the excellent cinematography left me unnoticed. I spent the most beautiful moments very well aware of masterpieces that were poorly imitated. I would not recommend seeing this film unless you have a deep passion for the Russian Orthodox Church, its monastic traditions, miracles in the face of Communism and the Seventies. It is a pointless film from (and around) a narrow perspective that has done nothing to me at all.
