Give me a break. How can someone say this is a "good hockey movie"? I know that movies tend to make a nice p *** - a bad job of displaying hockey to the general public. And yes, it was done at a time when the United States was doing our sport to the extent it is today, but in reality. I played hockey all my life and I watched even more, and my friends are a total madness. The ice scenes were tremendously bizzare ... a special instance I mean is "fighting the sword", er I mean "fighting the stick" at the end of the movie ... during which everyone just stands around and watching the fascination that this is really happening, but in wonder, who wins the battle between Youngblood and his nemesis Rakkie. Yes, the ice story is a little bit better, I stress LITTLE. I don't know, maybe there's no point in going ... I want to say: The movie is right. Hockey is just one big battle on the ice ... Yeah, with a small piece of vulcanized rubber, which is sometimes reflected in what is freely called "the goal." Youngblood is either scary or hysterical, I can't figure out that ... maybe someone else will be more lucky.
