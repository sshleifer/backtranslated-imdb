"Graduation Day" was released in May 1981, during the height of the craze slasher movie. Earlier that year, fans were exposed to swings like "My Bloody Valentine", "Just Before Dawn", "Friday 13th Part 2", and "Burning" and theaters still waited for a flick such as "Halloween II", "Prowler" and "Happy Birthday to Me". I've seen all of these movies, and of all the popular 1981 slashers "Graduation Day" is by far the worst. <br /> <br /> What "Day Graduation" is a workout in bad, low budget movie creation with bad acting, bad writing, absurd characters, nonsensical scenes, unnecessary nudity, kitschy dialogue, and experimenting in adjustments that didn't work so well, and who could forget the classic 80's disco that takes place throughout the film (the opening scene music) however, when renting a movie like this one, he should be aware that these details will be in this movie. Like "Halloween", "Friday 13", "Nightmare on Elm Street", "My Bloody Valentine", "The Burning" or "Prom Night"? Why do fans still look for these movies, but no matter what? Where slasher films need to succeed over all other areas, it's in the stage. There is nothing worse than the slow moving slasher and the "Graduation Day" moves quite slowly. The most aggravating part is that there are plenty of opportunities to speed things up; There are many pointless characters that are introduced and who never have a chance to be suspected of being murdered or being a victim. There's a slim teacher, a prominent director, a cunning secretary, a security guard, a clueless detective, a father-to-mouth alcoholic step, a mindless grandmother, and the mother of the former victim still mourns. All these characters might have a motive for killing or a reason to kill, but they are all unnecessary. The worst thing is that the story is still focused on them, and sometimes it marks the scenes just to fulfill their character. But what? What impresses me with "Graduation Day" and its little fanbase is that people aren't more astonished by the scenes of death. Fans go wild for deadly scenes like the raft massacre in "The Burning", the death of a washing machine in "My Bloody Valentine", the death of the cabo in "Happy Birthday to Me", death upside down in "Friday 13th Part 3", and death in hot Bath in "Halloween II" and even a car hood of death in "Madman". But where there is respect for some truly unique (though kitschy) deaths in "Graduation Day". One victim gets a sword pulse while the other gets a sword as a spear. The best death includes spikes under the landing. Why aren't these deaths famous among genres like death in more popular slasher movies? "Graduation Day" is trying to be a great and unique movie, but there is only a element of logic and lack of stimulation that really destroys the whole experience. It's not the worst of its kind (try trying "Don't go to the forest ... Alone") and there is a bit of tension, plus what fans are looking for (blood, gore, nudity, sex, and nostalgia), but "Graduation Day" won't be remembered as one of the biggest films ever made. It's not a budget issue - almost all slashers have a low budget - but it is a question of ideas, creativity and craftsmanship. That's all the movie makes ... <br /> <br /> Recommended for hardcore slasher fans. Municipal horror fans might get a little bored, and people who are not interested in horror should be avoided. It's not the worst movie ever made, but its a long way from the best.
