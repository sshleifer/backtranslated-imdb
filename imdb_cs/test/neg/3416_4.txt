Noble love says title. Another metamorphosis during the film's promotion was about inner vs. outer beauty. In this case, beauty - if you decide internal or external - is provided by scattered clothing (or it is terribly dressed / stripped), Zeenat Aman, whom director Raj Kapoor called a "volcano of talent" when the film was made. Of course, one cannot blame him for sarcasm - after all, he has promoted his own film. The thin paper chart is about a woman with a disfigured face who has a well-balanced body, a big voice (thanks to Lata Mangeshkar) with whom the hero Shashi Kapoor falls in love. She doesn't want her voice to be just her voice. Acting is desperate and even 4 is due to music with Lata Mangeshkar giving some good numbers. The rest, of course, is a bun. Avoid - Save Money. Inner Beauty vs. Outside Beauty. !!! You don't have to be Einstein to find out where the director is concentrating
