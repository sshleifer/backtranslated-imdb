For weeks I was looking forward to seeing this film just to be very disappointed in the wards. In my opinion, the only good thing River Queen was for it was the amazing scenery used as a background. The story of the story was everywhere, Samantha's character Sarah was very hard to understand and what in the world were all the close shots of her face? It didn't bring anything into the story at all - if there was one, a better actor for a part of the boy could have been chosen, it sounded like he was reading his lines straight from the script when shooting his scenes. real pity how could it be such a good movie.
