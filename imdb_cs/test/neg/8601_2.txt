Sometimes, when critics criticize a film, it's enough to see if it's really as bad as the claim, in this case it was. I believe it was supposed to be a sexual comedy, but it was neither sexy nor funny, I think I laughed once when Johnny Vegas couldn't steal the road fence and that was it. The film follows the life of four men who feed potatoes, each having a problem with their sex life; Dave left his wife and was looking for an old flame that had once invited him to a three-year-old, Ferris was living with his mother as a sexual subject, Tolly had an obsession with strawberry jam in his meetings. and Jeremy says he's in a loving relationship, but he's actually chasing a poor woman. The tone of the jokes differs from the tasteless to "I don't believe anyone could write that" is the second of them when they tell a young child that his father has died in a car accident, then for a hit line, when a boy asks how his mom says he's in a coma. The blame for all the countries right on the writers' feet, the actors apparently the wrong choice agrees that in this movie, but I didn't think their actions were all so bad ... not that it was all so good either. Surprisingly, for a relatively slim movie about sex, there is no nudity and sex is never erotic. Certainly I would not recommend seeing it for any reason other than morbid curiosity, even if I judge from other reviews it seems to be love or hate that movie, I suspect it would be better to follow a few beers and friends.
