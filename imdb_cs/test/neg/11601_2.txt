I only voted 2/10 mainly because Hitchcock agreed to drive it. Surely he had conspiracies out of the day with predictable lines, stupid childish characters who were desperate to be funny. "Scenes at a time when the Hollywood Production Code was in full force.Lazy male characters in the movie who like" soap "characters never make a punch out of work for which they are paid. It's always irritating me when food is usually never eaten about the actor (one exception in the eating scene in "Tom Jones" (1963); although a lot of drinks are consumed - actors have to leave their mouth free for the next line! Carole Lombard certainly recalls Hitchcock's "cool blond" idealized image heroine what owned him to drive this worthless nonsensical scenario, he should stick to his thrillers. \ tIt certainly doesn't have worn well for the past 69 years. I couldn't wait to end it, as it gradually irritated me not the end.
