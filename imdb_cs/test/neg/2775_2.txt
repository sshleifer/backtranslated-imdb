This is a cheap film made by Al Adamson - a man who was perhaps the worst filmmaker ever - perhaps even worse than Ed Wood, Jr. Adamson specialized in extremely low budget horror and skin films in the 60s, 70s and 80s. years and with such titles as FIVE BLOODY GRAVES, HELL'S BLOODY DEVILS, SATAN'S SADISTS and LASH OF LUST it is clear that Shakespeare did not do it !! His films have all rotten production values, feelings, gore and amateur gaming. Here in BRAIN OF BLOOD, several Adamson actors (for example, his wife, Regina Carrol, Zandor Vorkov and Angelo Rossitto are together for the ride and appeared in Adamson's previous film Dracula VERSUS FRANKENSTEIN, which is lucky Because the previous movie was so awful and so badly executed at every level that BRAIN OF BLOOD can't help but look good! The stupid plot (that includes the ubiquitous scheme of brain transplantation) and playing is level Z, but it's STILL better than their latest movie The only positive thing about this movie is that an aging actor, midget Angelo Rossitto actually had a better than usual part - with more dialogue and a more important role in the plot - and in fact there is some sense of danger and the tension with Mrs. Carrol, she STILL looks like a stripper and the rest of the cast limped with this stupid move. For good watching bad movie fans - you just have to see makeup on a guy with acid burns as well as a ray gun that seems to be made of old tail lights!
