Not original on the property. Hm. There were several angles that could be quite interesting, but the film follows the path of 90% of Hollywood movies. I don't really "get" Samuel Jackson playing most of the time in his other movies, but he was pretty good at this movie. He seldom shouted and went much further into his character than to return to "your face anger." I liked Eva Mendes - as usual - and even though she is a great eye-catcher, she proves she is much more than an actress. In fact, Luis Guzman was also good, except at the end of the movie, I didn't like changing his character to Samuel Jackson. How can a character stand around a resistance to a former cop and then turn into a lollipop in a split second? Is there no original idea in Hollywood?
