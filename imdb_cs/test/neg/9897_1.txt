Well, to get started, I was like wow this is new, so when the movie starts, and beyond it is things. But it never ended. The movie is just one big between it! And after 10 minutes waiting for something that actually happened, besides the water splashing around, I got angry! There is nothing in this documentation and nothing will be learned. BORING and RUBBISH!
