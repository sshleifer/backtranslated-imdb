I didn't expect much from the movie, so I'm not so disappointed. Carrie looked ugly, Mr. Big had crayon-colored eyebrows and Samantha didn't say f ***. Charlotte's baby was annoying to watch as she was in too many scenes - the title could easily be "SATC: Parents' Night Out." Camera angles were not so good, especially when it comes to Carrie's face. There was a token of a black woman thrown in whose character he did not get the right exit and too few gossip friends appearances who seemed to have thrown in without any purpose anyway. Samantha walked back and forth from LA and choked the story, especially when she comes to Fashion Week and nothing happens. It seems that the movie was made in a hurry because it could have been good, but the scenes were just thrown to show different clothes or offer viewers the chance to jump back to the show without being too big . story movie.
