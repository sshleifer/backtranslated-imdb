"SHUT THE FRONT DOOR DOOR" That's what I said when I was told that the sensation got a new movie in the Snakes on the train. Okay, maybe that's not exactly what I said, but you're right. I didn't have to know who was in the movie or anything else. All I knew was I rented this movie. I should probably ask what it was about. In retrospect, I don't know if I really want to watch a film about a Mayan curse that causes a woman to put snakes inside her snakes and pour out of her mouth. Also, I wouldn't want to see a movie that would appear to be a man who looks strange as a pedophile version of Leif Garrett. Anyway, while the curse might be interesting on some levels (well, maybe not), there was still a promise to these annoying characters as they ate or at least killed the snakes. So I was willing to sit in the first hour of a very little storyline other than the Texas Ranger, which forced the girl into a nice little titty grope to keep cocaine, or a Hispanic shaman who sometimes stabs people. But then the hell relaxed and the girl began to spit more and more snakes. SPOILER ALERT \ tSo everything is good at the end and I'm willing to overlook the fact that some of these snakes suddenly turned out to be 25 feet long. After all, people eat, so it's all good. But then suddenly, and I won't tell you how it would destroy the best part, one of the snakes is about 300 feet long. He then continues to squeeze and gulp the train, with all the Serpentaura graphic art from the old GI Joe cartoons. Unfortunately, I couldn't create a Nemesis Enforcer with this movie. Anyway, so you think the snake that the big who ate the train would be pretty unstoppable. Well, if you know your Mayan voodoo rocks and have the ability to summon tornadoes from heaven. Yeah, that's all I say about it. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is bad. Really bad to the point that you could be numb after watching, or your brain could hurt. I didn't give that up because no matter how stupid it was, it wasn't as bad as Date Movie. So if you like camp or badly built B horror movies, this is right for you. If you think it will be really cool as its bigger, more infamous brothers, just leave the box if you see it. And I'll leave you with a quote from a movie that should basically summarize it. <br /> <br /> "Snakes can't get on the train!" Because it's just stupid. Not like they make stops or something.
