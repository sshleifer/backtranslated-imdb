I understand the director's purpose of telling stories that are not stories, but the way he tried to show the time around him (a couple of runners who first appear together before running with a stroller (sic!)). man alone ...) and combine the "adventures" of the characters (the last scene, the maid climbs the mountain to see a big black man on another cliff, and then see the boat with his former employer and said, "Oh, boat!") was terrible. I liked the way he displayed the middle class, even in an excessive way, and I think it's a lousy movie. If you want to see it, do it as a film school student trying to see technical aspects and problems. .
