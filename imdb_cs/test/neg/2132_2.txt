the movie I've ever seen. Actually, it's one of the funniest episodes of the MST 3000 I've seen. Not that it was good, but for anyone who saw Manos: hands of destiny know that this was not two bad. The monster in the movie looked terrible, all wearing upset swimsuits, and the plot was ridiculous. I still have no idea why they were a monster, they never really gave a good reason. The leading bitch had to be the weakest gallery I've ever seen. They would do better to cast a gal that was initially killed as a leader. On the plus side dolphins looked great !!!
