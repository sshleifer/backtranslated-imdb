I don't see what's all about this movie. Patricia Kaas sings, yes, and that makes the movie charming, but singing isn't enough. I mean, if you want to get all the benefits of this, go buy a Patricia CD and enjoy! The storyline is simple (if omitting "dreams"); the main characters seem to love each other instantly, and they immediately forget their other friends. Relationships seem to be almost "binding," and a small "detective story" that is thrown makes things even worse. What initially seemed to be the perfect film ending would go wrong first, and then it would only come out as a dream. I measure movies according to how well I remember them, and I forgot about the details.
