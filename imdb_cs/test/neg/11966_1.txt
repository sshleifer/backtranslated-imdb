Launching a local sports team involves eliminating newcomers to the cornfield and guessing what? There is a scarecrow murdering people there. Only one of the newcomers survives, but falls into a coma due to diabetes. Meanwhile, the scarecrow starts killing all the people involved, one by one. What about the scarecrows secretly? Will they find it before the scarecrow gets them all? This is a low budget movie and shows. The sound is fine, but the image is really scaly. The plot / script really sucks and is quite pathetic and illogical. Acting is really bad and sometimes just ridiculous. I can't say much about special effects because there's not that much, but those few are in the range from bad to OK (for a low budget that's). There is some nudity and this is probably the only thing worth watching in the movie (that is if your horny teenager, if not, skip the movie together). Another complete waste of time and money, so you don't see it. It's also for hack'n'slash fans.
