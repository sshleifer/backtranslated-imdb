Yes! this movie was in every respect bad in all things like cast, effects, boredom, excitement, and of course it's fantastic and we all know that the four heroes in this were a little more colorful compared to the new ones, but they still have to go, Fantastic boring, as it really was just a silly garbage that I knew no one would want when I saw it, I guess certainly with this budget of about 3 or 4 good movies could be made but not. I am just glad that the new version of this year showed everyone how fantastic the four should be made with a good story, great cast like Jessica Alba, one of my favorite actresses, otherwise it would be completely forgotten, but fortunately not. The new one was great when I saw it with my friends in the cinema, but this old fantastic hole has to go.
