"Milo" is another answer to a question no one has ever asked. Do we really need more slasher? I think we have more than enough. I think professional tall guys are overcharging, so in this we're dealing with a murderous child who is also a zombie or ghost when he feels like it was. He drowned long ago, but he didn't mind and still kills people ("Friday, 13", what is that?) One day his survivors have a great reunion and as a surprise, Milo comes to pay them a visit. Despite some really bad shots showing everything except murders, the cast is diluted until only the last girl remains to find that Milo is boring, I mean the dark secret. She and her friends are dying to know. Once he appears, Milo continues another murderous rampage (isn't he still sleeping?) And the girl is screaming a lot. the barrel refuses to be associated with it. Milo may be from time to time one horrible bastard I give him, but some movies just can't be saved without a big script or gratuitous nudity.
