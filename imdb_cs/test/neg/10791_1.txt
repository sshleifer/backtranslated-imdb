This story is about a safari in Africa that meets a guy named Trent - who convinces them to look for a white babes tribe. Naturally, it turns out to be Amazonian warriors and capture men. The rest is quite predictable. This film has everything you would expect in a beneficial basement of the film about Africa - the substantial use of often irrelevant footage, the film of animals that are not native to the continent. (such as Orangutans, Moose, Coatamundis and Ground Hogs), a white actor in dark makeup playing native, bad acting (particularly from Trent - a handsome man with the personality of balsa wood), comic relief (sounding Chico Marx) Dressed in a suit of gorillas and bikini dressed white women with perms who are allegedly wild jungle fighters - like a tribe of angry woman Tarzans. In my opinion, my assumption is that the film was made for less than $ 49.95 - including cost development and paying for renting a gorilla suit! But what I didn't expect was an IMDb score of 4.9. This is bad, but not so poor, because we think it is a production of shocks in every possible way, and there is no possible reason why the film is rated so high! Now I'm not saying the movie isn't worth seeing - it's campy and stupid to be enjoyable watching - especially with friends. Don't expect anything that resembles a professionally made or competent film. Finally, here's a torn dialogue from this classic jungle: "Oolama as a strong white man." Oolama wants a strong white man ... "oonga-bunga" <br /> "me-te-tonga ... no, .... keeel ('kill ') man"
