This latest version of Mansfield Park seemed to try to roughen up the theatrical version of 1999 (basically copying some thoughts of it in reality), but to lighten things up a little to make it consistent with the original story. Unfortunately, the result is rather bland and schizophrenic production. And as with all other versions of Mansfield Park, Fanny Price isn't here anymore. Instead, he is an oddly strange, faded blond woman running around, who never really develops like a character. At least in the 1999 movie, the character they call "Fanny Price" is firmly anchored as a rebellious savage who is too smart for his own good. This "Fanny Price" is a complete mystery. One day I would really like to see the dramatization of Mansfield Park, which actually includes the portrayal of Fanny as written by Jane Austen. Sweet, kind, compassionate girl with shy personality and fragile constitution. It is reserved in a way and painfully honest, but also strong in its beliefs, steadfastly loyal, extremely intelligent and remarkably smart. A little late bloomer, it's not just her eighteenth year, when she finally starts making the transition from an unpleasant adolescent to a confident young woman. And in life, she wants nothing more than to be a real asset to those she loves the most. It's a wonderfully complicated figure I look forward to for a day.
