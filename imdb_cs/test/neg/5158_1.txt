Worst movie ever! It is not clever or funny or provocative thinking. 84 minutes of bad actors who do the best with a terrible scenario. Acting was so bad that you could see dead people breathing. Maybe the writer / director of the combination believed they were Quentin Tarantino or something (you know the movie is nothing cool) but failed miserably. I hope the writer never makes another movie EVER !! Not everyone was born as a writer, sometimes we have to count our losses and go back to being in the bathroom or anything. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at this movie, even when it is muted when the stereo continues to move for 84 minutes.
