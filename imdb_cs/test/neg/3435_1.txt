Ten years ago I really wanted to see this movie in the cinema. But I missed it and then I forgot it. Oh, boy, I'm glad this movie wasn't lost from my teenage eyes at the time. Yesterday I saw it and seriously, it must be one of the 10 worst movies ever made. And I'm talking about movies that have too much attention, such as those wonderful trailers on TV and too much money for actors and movie making. <br /> <br /> The scenario and acting sucks even worse, do I have to say more? <br /> <br /> Please Hollywood, NO MORE ARNOLD !!
