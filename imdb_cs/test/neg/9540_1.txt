Go through Manos. Back Boogens. It doesn't take Baby Genius to know that Malibu Beach Vampire (MBV for the rest of this tome) is now and always will (if anyone makes the sequel to Zarkorr Invader) the worst movie ever. The only horror in this matter is to watch them. I was wondering if it was an attempt at someone to meet the babes throwing a movie. If that were the case, the girls are not girls just like this is not a movie. It's dreck. No, wait. I dishonor the word dreck by calling it dreck. Ulli Lommel (from Boogey Man fame) would call it "uber dreck" or Schei√üe. It should be used to torture prisoners. If you find it on the shelf in the video store, please remove it and inform the authorities.
