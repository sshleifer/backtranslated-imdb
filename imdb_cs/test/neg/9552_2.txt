I saw it early in the morning on Fox Channel by coincidence (my dog ​​woke me up) - I saw it years ago and I thought I remembered it pretty well. I enjoyed it as a child. But now? As he commented on another poster, several reels were out of order, and although it was initially disorienting and bizarre, it seemed to fit into production - what was just terrible became unreal and entertaining. Music numbers for what I thought was a "big" fundraiser show ("you're in show business, I'm in show business, most kids are in show business, let's put on show") come out of nowhere all the calls about Putting on the show, and then fading without applause totally unrelated "direct" scenes. The Lead Man Girlfriend appears, prints lines and dialog lines, and then disappears. I was half awake and loved every insane minute.
