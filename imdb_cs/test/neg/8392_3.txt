The paranoid park is about Alex, a 16-year-old skater who causes death, though by chance the guard. As the movie goes on, Alex deals with small issues like divorce of his parents and sexual warmth of his girlfriend Jennifer (played by Taylor Momsen, whom you currently see in Gossip Girl) while being blamed. I've seen only one Gus Van Santa movie, Elephant, and I can assure you that he kept all his mannerisms when he did. Once he passes through the time lines again. Footage of people walking ... maybe you like these shooting techniques, I know not. The story seems unsatisfactory ... it's almost easy to explore for so long. The feeling of being (like Elephant) is that Gus Van Sant is trying too hard to make an "artistic" film that makes the film release the substance itself. Also, Gabe Nevins was bad enough as Alex, is the difference between being estranged or separated and looking like a robot. If you are a Mr.Van Sant fan then watch it, otherwise skip it. <br /> <br /> 3/10
