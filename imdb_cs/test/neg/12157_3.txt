I've been waiting for this movie for a while. On the first day of air in Turkey I watched it. It was totally disappointing for me. I wanted to watch a historical movie, but the one on the screen was fictitious. First, the main character of Cengiz Han, a great conquest was depicted as soft, calm, even losers. You can't feel much in the movie. Historically, the war machine he created was conquered Â¾ (even more) of the world to know in those years. To do this, Cengiz first unites Asian tribes. However, in the film, this defeated man is in one scene a poor man, and in the second scene, he commands the armies. The war scenes were incredibly a week. In the final battle, the Mongol riders used double swords on their sides and cut the enemy. :) Me and my friends as a consequence laugh at the scene. Mongolian Army means Mongolian archer rider. You can't see it in the movie. Another bad thing was to use fantastic elements in the movie. I don't want to go to the scenes that were displayed by Cengiz as a prophet. In the integrity of the film we can say that it is acceptable. However, the scene when an old monk saw the future and go find a woman Cengiz Khan after Cengiz's mission is really funny. When a monk died in the desert, Cengiz's wife feels dead and she finds a corpse on the continent. Are we talking about Asia? We laughed again. There are a lot of other things I can say, but I do not feel that this film can speak more.
