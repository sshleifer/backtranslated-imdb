What kind of waste is actually part II? If this movie really ends up as it did, all those involved in this film should be ashamed. This movie is nothing close to a movie like Outbreak, which was actually quite a decent movie. This movie was rushed in the hope of being able to get a few easy dollars. I started watching the movie assuming it was bad, but I never imagined it to be so bad. This film was nothing more than a way to harness Americans' fears for profit! If you haven't seen this movie, don't bother. The film is full of poorly developed characters and bad acting. I really hope that the production of this film was only a few weeks. Keep away! Don't be fooled by the hype!
