STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Danny (Mel Raido) is a lonely factory worker who Trying to get with his work and good dad for his two daughters after a chaotic divorce from his mother (Maxine Peake.) But after arguing with the daughters present at the Men's Working Club, she uses her trip to her dance class to take a look at Louise (Colin Salmon ) and his gang of hard men who train in the boxing gym / free weights section and train themselves into the harder, assertive person. Before he took Louise's philosophy into the heart for a long time and joined him as a nightclub porter when the disco falls in the 1980s ... but when Sparky's companion (Scott Williams) tries to make a side-line to the drug store, everything changes shaped pear. As Robert De Niro once said in "The Bronx Tale" is "no more tragedy than useless talent". Clubbed club writer had a good idea and talent to get into a movie ... but without it all seemed to put it into a coherent movie. Some filming locations (especially the scene outside the Ring O 'Bells pub in Moseley!) It was very simple and fun to do as a brummie ... but the gloomy view of cinema is actually really weaker. . Some really bad gameplay, for example, lead actor Raido with an incomprehensible accent that is everywhere, and the hammy script with some failure talks are more of a problem for the film. More well-established actors such as Peake and even telly favorite Neil Morressey are being pushed to very small supportive parts, while the disastrous Raido and the cheap villain Raid and Ronnie Fox are in the spotlight. Williams makes a poor man Sick Boy out of Trainspotting impression, so Salmon and Shaun Parkes seemingly the only artists who have stayed with any integrity from all over, because of the excessive, blood-stained violence (becoming a common trend for Brit Flicks!) Takes over. Really missed opportunity. **
