An interesting and short television film describes some of the machinations surrounding Jay Leno's replacement of Carson as the host of today's show. The film is currently highly relevant to the public drama around Conan O'Brien and Jay Len. The film has a good job of attracting audience interest and showing some concerns among stakeholders, especially NBC managers. The performance of Ovitus was particularly convincing and interesting, I thought. However, many characters were very briefly restricted or touched, and some of the actors seemed perfect. An interesting story.
