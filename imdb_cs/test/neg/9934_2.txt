Since 1966 I have been an angry fan of Star Trek. One thing I learned from Star Trek is that special effects are secondary to characters. The meeting at Farpoint failed in its mission. <br /> <br /> Great made. Fontana really fired this. This episode is so embarrassing that tape tape should be fired. <br /> <br /> The first half of the first season didn't try much better.
