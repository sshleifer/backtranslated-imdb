start, i'm glad. In any case, I am not a real critic and movies that authentic critics, friends, family and newspapers find it horrible can be fun for me to watch. <br /> <br /> not this one. > <br /> I got it because it was the latest wesley snipes movie in my DVD-store. I like snipes, but this was a beat. bad story, bad actors, continuity-glitches, lousy sound, depressing places, pseudo-cool snips, I really had to make a movie finish <br /> <br /> even left some marks in shots where the car was supposed to stop. <br /> <br /> And I'm not talking about a "small production company / young director / low budget" kind of bad where you can ignore some bugs because you feel sympathy. that disappoints like no other in a long time.
