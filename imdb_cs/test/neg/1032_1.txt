Although the numbers are higher in relation to other areas of society, I have no objection to the extremely high salaries of many of today's entertainers and athletes. A-Rod, LeBron or Brady have all the offers either well with 8 digits or low average areas. Ray Romano and Jerry Seinfeld could actually become billionaires from their shows, huge remains and the fees they currently require. Even their cast members, and all of the "friends" group reached close or over 7 numbers per episode. Letterman's revenue for one show could solve most people's financial problems and take care of a week or two a lot. But they are all based on the sound principle of supply and financial benefits to their employers. And they all do their crafts with enthusiasm. But then he comes up with someone like Rachel Ray, who reaches a level of earnings far beyond the apparent level of talent or skill. It seems to me that it is a piercing, annoying and forced "perkiness" that is as false as the proverb "3-dollar bill". My friend is responsible for special meetings, events and congress plans. its branch. One of the major sources of talents has hundreds of clients available from $ 5-10K levels, to a handful who get $ 200K and up for appearance. (This area includes Trump, Seinfeld, Lance Armstrong, Robin Williams, and no fun, Larry Cable Guy.) <br /> <br /> There's a greater number of $ 100,000 to $ 200,000; the list included Bill Cosby's likes, Steve Martin and even cable guy Larry's benefactor, Jeff Foxworthy. <br /> <br /> Rachael Ray belongs to this category. I suppose I have to admit that there may be enough demand for her "talents" and offers to justify her talk shows and that there may be some who pay more than $ 100K, + first class air, hotel suite, all expenses and limousines from door to door, just a few hours of her angry prank at their organization's event. <br /> <br /> I just can't figure out how it might be possible.
