I am shocked and amazed to find that this short film is unhappy. I rented this "movie" or feces, whether you want to call it, with a few friends, and after 30 minutes we had to stop watching. Just listening to the dialogue left a terrible taste of sour milk in his mouth. This movie was about as smart as pimple's ass. I hope I never see that bra-less, shabby Anne look alike (Julianne Nicholson) again. It was like watching the most ugly pilot for a sitcom who never went to TV but instead of a quick but painful 30 minutes (all I could bare) it was unbearable for 90 minutes.
