Great set cast, but unfortunately a lot of undeveloped ideas to drag the movie. One does not feel filled at the end after waiting for a conclusion, conclusion or at least an ironic intervention. It had the familiar "Curb" feeling, without dare to say it, Larry as an annoying polar opposite. The music was there, the "show about nothing" scene pops up, but without any common thread or tension - it beats as a solo project that ran out of budget. Spoilers: The film title talks about cheese, but prefers rice pudding. Is Cheese a Better Selling Title Than Rice Pudding? It only favors any junk food, regardless of the date of sale. Maybe I want someone who eats "cheese-dogs" or an ice cream in a pirate suit to have at least a few common scenes. Marty: It's not just funny and exaggerated. People don't care about the show at all. The table of books on coffee books was fun. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of the cast, you'll save yourself time and eat some cheese. It doesn't have to be with anyone.
