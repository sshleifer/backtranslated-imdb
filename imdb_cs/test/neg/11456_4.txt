This film is dated in so many ways, it's sensational. You can either laugh or shake your fists in rage. This film deals with the many problems of American history, but with the typical white-man-Christian-American paternalism. You-can-do-it-all-and-you-got-to-love-me-for-it-kind-of-guy. It is so pompous and must not be taken seriously. This is horrible creation! His wife is a weak little woman for the first part of the film and at the end is still a very crying but stronger figure. Too bad he still forgives his sad travels after he left her for the second time. It's just sad that the character didn't really change. Though he is to portray a strong and independent woman at the end, she is consumed by worrying about her husband seeking adventure. So 2 out of 10 points from feminists between us (and that's just good intentions ...)! The problem of Indian oppression is quite pretty, but there is a charming storytelling again. And the fact that all African-American characters are typical stereotypes makes the film more hypocritical. Most of the time I was so angry! So one point (for testing) from the civil rights movement. <br /> <br /> I know the movie was made at a different time. I like old movies and I have a lot of patience with some of those dated views. But that was just disgusting! <br /> <br /> What this film will save is the non-mainstream part. Mr. Dix's actions are over the top and smug. Maybe it's because his character is so unpleasant ... I liked Mrs. Dunne's performance, even though her character occasionally made me angry. But I have to say that the famous land rush scene was incredibly done. And the way the Oklahoma settlement was portrayed made the film useful. It's just amazing how civilization came out of the dirt and dust of the 19th century. And I don't understand the problem some have with this church scene. I thought it was pretty funny and fun. Maybe it shouldn't have been, but I liked it. 9 points for these scenes and an impressive story about the development of the state of Oklahoma. This is a total of 4 points!
