Don't get me wrong, I assumed this movie would be stupid, I honestly did it, I gave it an incredibly low standard to meet. The only reason I saw it was that there were a lot of girls (another story for a different time). When I started watching, I noticed something, this movie was terrible. Now there are two types of terrible, there's Freddy vs Jason terrible, where you and your friends are sitting and laughing and joking about how awful it is, and then there's a movie like this. The cat in the hat didn't even create a momentary interest in me. When I watched the first piece not only get bored, I was nonsensical, but I felt like I was somehow disturbed by the horror of this movie. Mike Myers is usually brilliant, I love most of his work, but something in this movie didn't click. One of the things the director / producers / writers changed was that they refused to use any of the colors of the original book (red, black, white) on any character, but on the cat. By coincidence or not, they also refused to capture any of the original (and I hate using this word, but it sets) the original Zaniness. The book was like Sunday ice cream, colorful and delicious, and the film was about as unprecedented and hard to swallow as sawdust. Avoid it as a leprosy prostitute.
