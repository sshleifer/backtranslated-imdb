Another record in the sub-genre Pacino-As-Mentor. Do you know the drill: a young hotshot with a hubrist defect (in this case, Matthew McConaughey, who is trying to jump on the starting career by targeting Pacina's coats - hey, it worked for Keanu and Colin, right?) Father (Pacino, Natch). Young Hotshot learns from Father Figure all ins-a-outy lucrative but humiliating careers (this time it's handicapping football). Father character struggles with Young Hotshot money and hookers and strength, but we all know that this decadent state is on a collision course with dissolution and despair. . . that is, as long as Young Hotshot does not find his moral center by rejecting the Father's character and everyone, or almost all he represents. (Obviously, Stone's Wall Street * has largely laid down the basic rules for the sub-genre of Pacino-As-Mentor.) <br /> <br /> We are also intended to make these Pacino films recently parallel to reality. You know again that exercise: Living-Legend Actor demonstrates its undisputed superiority compared to Inferior Young Actor. He can carry this process and smile, but he must realize that he will not get any of the good lines, much less the chance to chew the great scenery before denouncing. Now it should be said that there are actually two good movies in the Pacino-As-Mentor: * The Fragrance of a Woman * and * Donnie Brasco *. In the first case, it was one man's show; in the latter case, Pacino met his match as a scene thief in Johnny Depp's. However, these two movies were serious, not just showboating exercises for showboating. Pacino was pretty damn sure that his younger teammates in * Brasco * were far from charismatic as Depp. By the way, none of it says very well about actors with a life legend. As his current De Niro, Pacino has spent the last 10 or 15 years resting on his laurels. Two for Money * is the worst example, even worse than Devil's attorney *, who at least had the privilege of introducing naked Connie Nielsen and was chronologically ahead of this film. Well, this is what happens when you are crowned King too damn early - ask Marlon Brand. Frankly, I've seen too many Al Pacino movies with the same conspiracy - and the same exaggeration from the star - to be more charitable. Did I say "none of it says good"? In fact, it is humiliating for everyone involved, including paid audiences. No one will blame Matthew McConaughey for being a Shakespearean actor, but neither does he deserve the role of second violin to this unbearable old performance, saying that he, McConaughey, will never measure up to size That's Al. <br /> <br /> I don't have unnecessary desktop space data. If you want synopsis, IMDb provides a nonsensical summary, although I think I have given a rather comprehensive summary in my introductory paragraph. Basically, you've seen this movie before. Many times. A special environment in * two for money * is a decrepit world (underworld, indeed) a sports handicap. Pacino runs a "betting advisors" office - the middlemen between you and your bookmaker - and even has a handicapping show with cable TV, along with some of his top guys. One thing the film got right was the thinness of these exhibitions. . . but one detail that died was the constant use of the words "gambling" and "gambling". If you've ever seen ProLine or other ilk-like shows, never, you never hear Jim Feist and his cohorts say the word "gambling". They ask you to call 1-900 to get their selections. . . but if you were from, say, Mars, you wouldn't know what to do with those selections. "Gamble" is the word F on sports television shows - strictly verboten. <br /> <br /> Gambling is against the law, you know. <br /> <br /> 1 Star of 10.
