The controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe, who herself met a diver in the wreck of Estonia, put this silly "thriller" together to save her investment. Of course, Donald Sutherland is always observable - but it's only in three scenes. It delivers your material perfectly - as you can ask a professional. Also, chief leader JÃ¼rgen Prochnov is sometimes very good. However, the rest of the cast is bad. The actress who plays the Swedish Secretary of the Secretary (or whatever she dreamed of - not listed in the cast) is EXTREMELY bad. <br /> <br /> The script has some nice ideas and the story is really interesting. However, the final scenario should be rewritten several times. Some scenes are totally ridiculous - especially at the end. The movie is almost 2 hours, which is about 45 minutes too long. This could be really interesting, presented as a 60-minute TV movie. It's a two-hour game, it's polite, boring, stupid and stupid. Jutta Rabe could be a good journalist (her ideas about the governments using Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden were closed) as well as recently when the Swedish army officially said that she used the ship Estonia), but as a film producer she gets angry. The director, writer and actors suck more. /> <br /> I give this movie 3/10. I would like to give him 1 if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times, Donald Sutherland is in it and has real footage. But we don't even see the sink! What movie about a ship that is sinking, is that? Like a werewolf movie without werewolves ...
