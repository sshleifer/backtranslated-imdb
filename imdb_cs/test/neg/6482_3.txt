The role-reverse remake of 1942's "Major and Minor" has Jerry Lewis entered the part originally played by Ginger Rogers, but unfortunately this anemic trip lacks much more than just Ginger. Lewis tries to hand over the child on boarding the train; is successful, but illusion leads to a series of comic and romantic confusion. Sidney Sheldon adapted the screenplay, throwing into musical moments for Dean Martin (playing another in his stable of second-bananas) and a jewel-robber subplot (which is terrible). Diana Lynn, who played a teenager in the original film, plays Lewis' love interest. She is cute; Jerry is not. * 1/2 from ****
