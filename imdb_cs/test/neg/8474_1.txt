Satirical Movie Website Dateline Hollywood joked that "the mask son" was all practical joke star Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for his show "Jamie Kennedy Experiment." And if the film was just half as fun as that piece of satire. <br /> <br /> "The Mask" was the ideal vehicle for Jim Carrey's faces, which so many viewers warned; It also pleased the man for over 12 years by introducing Cameron Diaz. So having a follow-up minus both of them wasn't a good idea, and you'd think New Line would learn their lesson after "Dumber and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd." But not ... though fair, having all the new cast is in line with the original comic (in which Mask went from owner to owner). As Lance Khazei and director Lawrence Guterman wrote, there is nothing in return, except for the steady stream of truly decent FX by the usual home squadron (Industrial Light and Magic are improving on "Ally McBeal" dancing kids and their own "Kids Day Out" with Tippett) Studio, Giant Killer Robots, Digital Dimension and so on to support) and even more panding for cartoon fans by our hero working in an animation company (responsible for these gems as "Siamese Pope"), naming his character after Tex Avery and work not only in links to classic cartoons, but also to real clips. The problem is that the last approach doesn't really work, partly because most attempts to bring cartoon traps to live action are falling straight (especially cars get into the party's mood) and mostly because the honors of Flintstones, Woody Woodpecker, "Duck Amuck" and especially "One Froggy Evening" show how weak this film is in comparison. In addition, the film fits into a Shambol slapstick alongside tense sentiment (the family is the basic theme of the story; our hero is not ready to have a son and his nemesis - Alan Cumming as the Norwegian god Loki - is far from Oda's eye ... and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin , even after "Super Mario Bros" is behind me, and Kennedy just isn't in the same league as Carrey in the zany stakes - though it's not like he gets help from the script. Also note that unlike Diaz, the very cute Traylor Howard (as the mother of a son's mask) doesn't have much to do; It could help the film if I helped him with the mask. Other points are lost for dropping Cumming, Hoskins, Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski; under suspiciously reduced running time (which would account for some holes and scenes that appear to be missing); and for the incredibly bad attempt at an inner joke when our hero can't sell the concept of "green guy" as an animated TV series - "The Mask" has become a real animated TV series and was far better. than this continuation. The fact that it actually opened up in the United States to Britain should tell you everything ... what to do with this and "Blade: Trinity," the New Line seems to care about cornering the market with a terrible sequel with cast members from "Two guys and girl. "What's next," The Butterfly Effect 2 "with Nathan Fillion? Someone stops it.
