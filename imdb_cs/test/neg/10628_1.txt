About the film itself, there are sufficient comments. I just wanted to say something about the German version I recently saw on TV. It is heavily cut. From 103 to 76 minutes! It is usual that the bloodiest scenes are cut for German television. I understand the reasons, but this film was something else. Not only did they cut "gore-shots" - they have entire sequences, they only save glances. Like: "We have to attack them" - one 5 second shot of explosions in the camp - the protagonist is running away. <br /> <br /> When an attack on the island begins, it is no longer possible to follow the story line. All cuts create something equal to a chain of erratic, disconnected scenes that no longer make sense. I couldn't stand to watch the end after I spent 60 minutes on this nonsense. /> <br /> I think I'd give the original 7/10 German version worth just 1/10 <br /> <br /> Put it on DVD (and check runtime first) or forget it.
