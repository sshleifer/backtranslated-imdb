I had to watch this Canadian course and I was told it was "the best Canadian movie". When I looked, I really disagreed because I saw much better. I understand that there were Canadian motives and messages, but the fact that the characters and the plot with me were (as a viewer) so distracted that I really didn't care what the movie was telling me. The story was too dry. The characters did not have many positive personality traits, but it is to emphasize the message, not to tick off viewers. This film shows a bit about the history of Quebec. It's not a very interesting movie; they certainly do not deserve to have such a tall pedestal laid.
