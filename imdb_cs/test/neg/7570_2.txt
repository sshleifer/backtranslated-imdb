This must be one of the most horrible scenarios I've ever seen. It's basically a remake of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms (1953), but it did with your standard snake-like puppet monster instead of the elegant Ray Harryhausen creation. Combine the storyline of this classic monster movie with the production qualities of The Creeping Terror and you have an idea of ​​what a movie is. The film is dubbed, although the original actors (I think the movie was originally dubbed in Italian for these country audiences, then redubbed for the American release), which just makes the movie seem weird ... sounds, Like in a Japanese monster movie, you just don't quite match the action right on the screen, even if the actor's lips move correctly. Poor Ray Milland ... it's definitely a long journey from The Lost Weekend or Dial M for murder or one of the number of excellent movies he was in. Add it to his next science fiction tour (Panic in Zero, X Man with X-Ray Eyes) and you can see once a good actor in Boris Karloff's syndrome ... Stuck makes really bad horror movies abroad just for work.
