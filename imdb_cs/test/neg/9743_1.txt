I remember this film vaguely. I remember it for one hard reason it's the only movie I've ever gone! and since I've never seen available for rent ANYWHERE !! I can't spoil it for everyone because I can barely remember it! Thinking about looking at the cast, it was the winner, with director John Landis, but with a good god, a lot has to be paid for this drivel! All I can remember is that Dad disappears and the family tries to find him by inserting a real photo into the computer's disk drive. After half an hour I left. I have to admit that I would like to see if I can get a copy just to see if it really was so bad !! It wouldn't be a surprise if it was on a black actor. list! I think Christopher Lee was in this? The legend of all the bad guys who were in the Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings? As I said - black movie, The Stupids!
