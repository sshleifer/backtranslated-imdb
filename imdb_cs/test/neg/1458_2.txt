Bad Movie About Bad Movie. Is it the original or what? If so, then it's the only good thing. Beautiful Ally Sheedy couldn't stop this bomb to destroy the movie and the video is everywhere. It should also be noted that she, and other actors hired by Danny Aiello's character were charged as themselves, as well as the characters they played in his D-rated film. To call it a B-rated movie, there is too much compliment, and would lead to delusions of grandeur.
