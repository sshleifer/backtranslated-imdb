What was the goal ... I started looking at it, but then I realized that it had no goal ... bad behavior ... no action and no story .. I ended up surfing the web reading About David Beckham's $ 250 Million American Football Galaxy Contract. Don't let it be rented Do not let it borrow NOT THE LONG LONG THROUGH I have seen so many movies that I could feel it will be from the collapse of courage. War movies should be accurate and, if possible, have some artistic merit and actually do not feel like Christian melodrama ... This film fades in comparison to what I have seen before. I have to say that Iam really disappointed this movie.
