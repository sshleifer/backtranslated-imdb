As the main character, Lillith Silver likes to point out - "you know f ** k all about vampires". Obviously, this statement was focused on cast and crew, who create an extremely bad image of the favorite bloodshed. According to the misleading director, all vampires are covered in white and foamed into a latex-like piece of meat in a shrink wrap. With Bannan-like fangs and bad asthma cases, our main character, Lillith, creates a grotesque cartoon of a "modern day" vampire. The storyline consists of a 9 year old collection of boys playing on a playstation. paper, then mixed together to devise this terrible story. Lillith our pale protagonist is a vampire tenant hunter who makes a living from alienating members of every favorite cult, the Illuminati! Rather than incorporating the classic killer stealth methodology and precision however, Lillith rolls through an open window and then proceeds to rush her targets through the necks before shooting them a point empty with a pistol (it apparently does not leave bullet holes due to delicate continuity). The PC Fetus is then assigned to deal with the murders, arriving at the grizzly, but noticeably obvious conclusion that Lillith is actually Vampire and continues to hunt her armed with the usual vampire dispatching tools, including a cross, garlic and a sharpened piece of wood. Meanwhile, Lillith, who got used to redeeming her boss, is upset when an old nemesis kidnaps him and demands that Ransom be delivered in person. As you can imagine, it doesn't go according to plan. However, I will not go back to the pain of the following scenes, so I will jump to the end. Lillith and her "nemesis" have a showdown, and after Lillith's victory, it is revealed, with the whole extravagance of someone who told them they have cancer, that the two are old lovers and the whole story was a twisted game. Yes, the ball kick was the real end of the movie. In my eyes, this conclusion wit is icing on a latex canvas cake and this film closes in the vault "Never Look". <br /> <br /> As for film techniques, the film doesn't just bother to create any style. The director is trying to save his catastrophic instrument from the brink, throwing some close shots and several multiple shots, but this is not the thrill the film needs. You may scream "this is a B movie, its meant to be crap! â€œ. But I have no sympathy. I've seen some cracking B movies like Evil Dead 2, and Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter, and therefore this shame can't hide behind apologies. The budget was low, which is evident from the lack of space and good actors. Perhaps if the director had been more creative and spent less money on paying for makeup and fake blood, he could have done something good with this frightening attempt. Bad sex scenes are not in any way beneficial and serve only to give me some laughter on obscene acting skills. Half of the budget had to be paid to a woman who was only occupied for winning lesbian rompy. If I wanted to watch vampire pornography, I'd buy Muffy The Vampire Layer. The cast is bad, the story is worse and the effects are falsely false. This film had some potential, but his greedy undertone and embarrassing portrayal of the classical horror character only served to his downfall. <br /> <br /> If you want to laugh with a few friends, I suggest you follow this laughter. If you're looking for a more serious Vampire event, try Blade or Underworld to soothe your fierce bloodlust.
