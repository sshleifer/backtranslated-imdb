This film was disappointing. After fifteen years of returning to the mind of reviewing some information about Mariel Hemingway, all the regrets I felt about the film came back. While I remember Peter O'Toole, I was completely forgetting that the woman "leads" (fine - she was a little more than the subject for discussion in the story) was Mrs. Hemingway. I saw this film back on days when I was writing film reviews, and warned people about how stories just didn't work, and fifteen years of my subconscious, trying to solve things, still had no sense of flow of thought. Part of this may have to do with the fact that after the original movie was filmed (whether it was about it), the editor came and tried something together. I don't know if it was a project of a former studio boss, so he was sabotaged to discredit his successor, or it was a disaster from the original scenario that rescue attempts were unsuccessful. The theatrical version just didn't work.
