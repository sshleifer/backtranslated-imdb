But to be a little more accurate, I don't think it's as bad as it could be. Though the actors (famous to seminal) did not do a great job. Directors' Disorders? Could it be a difficult scenario for me? By the way, if you are after a lot of cool weapons and action it is not a movie for you, but they are running around with lots of ww2 vintage weapons. A little fun :) Well I think I could say more, but it just doesn't feel like it's worth it. Otherwise, if you're desperate or a hackman jester, it's not! <br /> <br /> Live well and prosper
