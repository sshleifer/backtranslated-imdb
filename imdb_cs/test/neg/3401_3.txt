What is this document? Much more like a walk with a ghost that one could take in the southern city. Quotes were generously dropped without first attempting to identify the source. The most identified quote was George Orwell. <br /> <br /> The documents were marked without being produced in any form. False scams capturing contemporary film stocks were set aside aside historical film discs without separation from reality and self-promotion. The film reels, which were completely unrealistic and unlikely for the time they were at hand, were dropped as if they were trying to appeal to Blair the witches, hoping they could make a haunted house for what would otherwise simply be dead property. Isn't it somehow disrespect to the actual TB victims, to dance on their common graves for commercial purposes? The line between the actual shots and the self-service made is so thin; drippings of doubt played so insignificantly; scientific boundaries so obviously ignored ... how could it be mentioned in the TiVo document as a document? It's a holiday promo, and that's why it's absolutely successful. Hell, I'd visit a joint if I could find it on Google Earth. Not scary said the previous poster. Not too serious, says I. Fascinating story. Flimsy film-making.
