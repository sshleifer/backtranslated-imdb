For the uninitiated, almost any Andy Milligan movie is shocked, but despite the fact that I have seen many of his films, this one is still taking a cake for utter strangeness. Of course, Milligan is taking Sweeney Todd's story, done with period costumes (but not necessarily period hairstyles, in some cases) and the usual head-causing camera-work and grainy quality. As for gore, well, the version I saw might have been somewhat shortened because there isn't much on the movie with "bloodthirsty" in the title. The best indication of subversive filmmaking here is the meat pie, which consists only of a poor victim. So, even if I still remember this piece, uh, working on my video, it's definitely somewhat cheaper in terms of content. It is only recommended for those crazy and morbidly curious. 3 out of 10.
