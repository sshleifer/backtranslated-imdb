Razor Blade Smile has an interesting title and a leading role. Now most of them may not like this movie for the storyline and the acting was a bit cheap, but that's the appeal of the film as Razor Blade Smile. In a way, it was supposed to be a bad movie. However, if you watch this movie all the way to the end you will see it is, as I said a cheap vampire movie with a bit of humor. (Also, how they manipulated the colors in several scenes is very interesting.) Finally, this movie is the type you rent and laugh with your friends and enjoy what it is. It's not too bad for any movie. How Lilith Silver says: "People just don't smile ..."
