This film was utter insolence. It is possible that it is pollution. The delicate tense atmosphere of the original remake is nowhere to be seen. Sarah Michelle Gellar has nothing to do, even in her succession of death, but it's still the best performance in this movie and her death is the best thing, even if she deserves better death. It's a sign of very bad writing and directing. I guess she did this film to end the connection with him as her waste. It's not scary. He's not tense. It's not funny. It makes no sense at all. And, as has been said, Sarah Michelle Gellar gives the whole cast only a reasonable performance.
