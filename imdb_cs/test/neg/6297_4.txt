Basically a road movie. Homosexuals, transsexuals and other sexes are somewhat disturbing, especially when it is a child. You must give it to costume designers. As for the actors, the only one I met was Terence Stamp. I suppose it was a very good performance, outside of his (or anyone's) normal range. The film as a whole was shallow, just a vehicle for a clever, biting joke. All in all, I do not recommend this.
