A neckline of the usual video action plane, Airborne has enough in the tank to keep it for 90 minutes, even if you can't help but think about how low the former 80s comedy, the golden boy Steve Guttenburg, has bent down to be in such cheap production (and also play hard man!). The storyline is simple, the baddies have stolen the deadly virus, and Guttenburg and the rest of his good friends sent them to pick him up, it's not bad of its kind, but not in the same league (of course) as films that are also compared to cover, like AIR FORCE ONE and CON AIR. But the cast is good when Sean Bean reprises his British character, which we had in such box decays as GOLDENEYE and PATRIOT GAMES.
