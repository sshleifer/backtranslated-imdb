I assumed the 'Scarecrow Gone Wild' was a dull slasher flick. Yes, he's got a good point, but he's a freak from another movie. Acts are so terrible or conspiracy. The story is based on the legend of a living scarecrow on a cornfield. When initiation becomes a joke and causes the life of a boy at risk, the scarecrow comes alive and begins killing madness. Sounds good, right? It's derived from shouting, Friday the 13th, Jeepeer Creepers, the children of corn, you name it! 'Gone Wild' Scarecrow is such a below average film. I barely have a frightening moment. Even the last scene is ridiculous! Sadly, we could enjoy it as our time killer. But I prefer to watch something else instead. If you're not a big fan of bad and kitschy movies, off course. <br/> <br/> 4/10
