Larry Clark is not renowned for his talent as a writer or director, but has created some undeniably important films. Children, Bully, and to a lesser degree Ken Park all achieve their intended purpose: shock, resistance, and even resistance. These films are uncompromising in their content and use their controversial nature to reveal very serious problems in modern youth. The children exposed us to the spread of A.I.D.S. and sexual promiscuity among the young. Bully touched on similar problems. Ken Park was somewhat engaged in sexual abuse and suburban traffic. Undoubtedly, all these films revealed something terrifying and left a bad taste in their mouths. skate. That is all. Wassup Rockers is nothing. <br /> <br /> No substance. He has basically a non-existent narrative. And like children, there is a cast of actors who were filmed from movies. However, unlike children, none of them have any semblance of talent. There is better playing in porn. This film undoubtedly represents the worst performance I've ever seen in a feature film. One can respect Larry Clark to expose these young men to a film-making process, but these children are utterly crouching-worthy, people. I can add that apparently these gentlemen also produced a soundtrack that contains some of the most dismally awkward punk garages you will ever hear — my advice is to pop a few migraine pills before entering the theater, or you'll regret it then. But again, it's not like they had a lot of script to work with. Every line that is spoken is fanciful, pathetic and irritating. The story itself is ridiculous. It starts pretty reasonably, but soon it slips into total absurdity quite unexpectedly. This of course begins with the capricious sexcapade with a pair of rich white girls, followed by a series of clichés of the National Lampoonish Meeting, characters are killed for no reason, and eventually the result is ridiculous anti-climax. The shots go much longer than they need. Be ready to watch people fall on a skateboard for about fifteen minutes, straight, long-lasting footage of characters who do nothing or skateboarding on the streets. But then again, with a script on limited 32 pages, they need as much unnecessary fill. Wassup Rockers might work better as a short film. Anyway, I could go on like this. That's the worst movie Larry Clark has ever done. For those of you who are interested in seeing Clark, just for his shocking pederast antics, look elsewhere. This is by far the most beautiful movie ever made, and it's also the worst. It's horrible. Like Uwe Boll terrible. Certainly the worst I've seen at the festival. <br /> <br /> 1/10
