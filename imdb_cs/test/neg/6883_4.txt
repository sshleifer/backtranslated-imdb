It's hard to comment on this movie. It's one of the few movies. In fact, Dimension is not postponed (it's hard to come up with the reason why) and it was rushed to unimaginable 500 theaters, it's an open day. Maybe Dimension was afraid of how people would react to a swampy beast using their towing car to pull the house apart by piece. Ray Sawyer is just a tow truck driver until Voodoo Priestess is saved from a bad car accident and a sack full of snakes gets in the attack and drowns in return. At the morgue, Ray returns to life and pursues a group of teenagers who have witnessed a terrible fall. <br /> <br /> Thin paper is what this film brings. I wasn't interested in one moment. The dialogue was also smaller than ho-hum. It was also very predictable. The characters made typical silly horror movie character things, like checking creaking sounds, evoking people's names, and tripping on the rock while they are being persecuted. I could also immediately choose who will be the last girl. And why did the camera have those quick white flashes whenever someone died or whenever the killer was shown? <br /> <br /> What's good? Well, there's an impressive thrilling scene where a killer walks under the swamp waters to get to his victims, and a tense succession where the last girl has to disguise herself with lots of other dead bodies while the killer looks on. But besides, it's another disappointment from August / September. I was looking forward to it, but I didn't get what was expected.
