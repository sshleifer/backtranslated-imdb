I grew up watching a sitcom like Seinfeld, Roseanne, Simpsons, etc. In other words, television broadcasts. Over the years, many sitcoms have appeared in the air, a very small percentage of which is really smart and funny. War at home is a prime example of most modern American comedy. I'm giving a show of 3 out of 10 because that's what it wants to be, comedy, but it doesn't seem to be a good comedy. A good comedy should sweep you off your feet with your big jokes, you shouldn't be able to see them coming, and I see just every joke in TWAH. Characters are probably the simplest and terrible stereotypes I've ever seen on screen, and acting isn't for a father who portrays a stereotypical beer drinking sport that loves American idiot, very good. Poor acting, incredible characters and jokes that don't catch you from the guards will get away from this show to the point where it's unnoticeable. If you don't have a cable and want to see a comedy worth watching, try Boston Legal. It's worth your time.
