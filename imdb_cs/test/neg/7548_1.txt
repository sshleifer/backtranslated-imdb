Assumption Bottom crossed with Fawlty Towers sounds great! However, Ade Edmonson & Rik Mayall managed to create a film that barely titers. Ten years ago, the crazy looks of Rik Mayall and Ade's idiots were funny, now they are just annoying. The film had a promise - though Britain's worst hotel is not a new idea - but it has failed. . Economical performances were competent by Simon (Spaced, Big Train) Pegg and Helene Mathieu, and the film is only 90 minutes long. Excuse me, guys, but you really came across Bottom
