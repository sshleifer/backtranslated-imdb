Key issues in the game (God and Satan / Good and Evil) can be and should be extremely persuasive (as demonstrated by thousands of works of art / music / literature / film). End Days, unfortunately, is nothing but 2Dimensional Cartoon. Byrne's acting ability stands so obviously in sharp contrast to Arnold's corresponding lack of abilities and is further underlined by a plot filled with nothing but stereotypes. The only impressive scene appears at the very beginning of the transformations of Gabriel Byrne's character and his subsequent interaction with his wife? girlfriend? It is erotically charged and repellent - it modernizes vampire themes, seductive power of evil.
