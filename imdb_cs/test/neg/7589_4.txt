Butter Battle is a fun story about two fictional cities and their arms race. It is also like a misguided allegory about Cold-War and arms races in general. Yes, it is a children's book, but like so many of Theodor Seuss Geisel's works, it hits people through their morals. And that's exactly what exactly? Certainly it is commendable to encourage us to focus more on what connects us than on what divides us. It is even good to promote international cooperation. It is simply wrong to compare the differences between the Warsaw Pact nations and the NATO West as opposed to butter. To highlight the obvious, many of the Warsaw Pact nations had an intermittent period of lack of butter and bread - they would be happy to have it available if they were available. At a less literal level and regardless of your political inclination, Soviet socialism versus Western (especially Anglo-American) democracy is not merely a matter of preferences and customs. To make the point even clearer, nuclear weapons were not developed in the Cold War with the Soviets, but in a hot war with Axis powers. There is no doubt that Germany was developing nuclear capabilities during the war. Should the US abandon nuclear weapons research to give them confidence in their (less than inevitable) victory in conventional warfare? Once developed, the weapons were used against the enemy who attacked us at Pearl Harbor. What does a nation do at this point when a genie is out of a bottle? In addition, the backward view is 20-20, which means that there is no way to ensure that another half of the angry dictator does not face the development of nuclear weapons. The Second Gulf War showed an incredible difficulty in identifying and neutralizing credible threats. In any case, the caricature is a little more than a simplistic propaganda that explores the nuances of ethical issues behind a nuclear weapon. weapons, and instead try to instill in children the fear of weapon technology.
