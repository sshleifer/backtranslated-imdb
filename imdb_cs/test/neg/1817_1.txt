I felt that the last night's episode was slow and sometimes boring. I honestly don't think she has to do anything about writing. Because I know the story was well staged and tried to keep things in place. I thought it wasn't that bad, but overall I enjoyed it. Most of the blame has to do with the director of this episode - Stephen Williams. I've always hated Stephen Williams. If Jack Bender continued this episode from the season's premiere, he would keep it at a good pace and keep things moving to keep things interesting. I'm glad Jack Bender drives the episode next week, and it's going to be a lot better and I'm glad he got the first Syaid episode to direct and I'm wondering what this time will be because Stephen Williams has driven too many Syaid episodes before. I always thought Stephen Williams had to be fired from the show. Neither does the show do anything interesting at all. Why do I need to open a target hole when you're in a helicopter? It was so boring! Poor perspective of camera work too!
