Words almost fail to describe how horrible this Irish vanity project is (funded by Canadian taxpayers - both federal and Albertan). Suddenly, a pretty-looking Canadian woman (Kathy Ranheim), who was a real-life star athlete in Alberta, appeared for no other reason to secure Canadian content. The credits also show that some Calgary pubs have helped. <br /> <br /> All that is badly filmed here and at least three hands (pieces of badly spent Trainspotting, Lock Stock, Snatch and Reservoir Dogs are the most obvious stealing). Avoid the plague if you do not want one of those campy "so bad it is almost funny" nights in front of your telly.
