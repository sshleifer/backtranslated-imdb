This is a really bad movie. However, it is good to laugh at horrible thoughts and "special" effects. The story focuses on the EU space agency, which discovers the 10th planet that orbits directly across from Earth. They send a mission sent (they were on Mars and haven't discovered this planet yet? Is it stupid to fall for it?) On the planet and you can believe it, it's the mirror image of the planet they came from. From that point on, everything is predictable. Honestly from the title of the movie you can only guess about everything. The only surprising thing is the managed space program run by Eurpoeans. So it's good for laughter or maybe if you're in a changed state of consciousness.
