I fully understood why this film was made. The Silence of Lambs was an incredible movie - a terrible thriller with an amazing story and a high jump-factor .... What I don't understand why this movie is made ... and why Anthony Hopkins agreed that in this terrible and dissatisfied cinematography takes on the role of Hannibal Cannibal. There is no possible way to spoil a movie than it would be, but for those of you who prefer to waste money, DON't READ ON. The film is terrible. It's so bad that the transition from Jodie Foster to Julianne Moore becomes a question. <br /> <br /> The only way to really enjoy the movie is to set the watch and leave the theater exactly two hours into the movie, because until then it's a pretty interesting thriller. The replay between Moore and Hopkins is comparable to Hopkins and Foster, and the performances of other characters are pretty good. But literally, in a two-hour mark, the film falls into nothing but a fearsome D-grade horror movie ... it's sick, and it's stupid, and almost like a crew running out of filming and throwing an end in one day. shooting. Early buzzing over the dissatisfied and bizarre end of Thomas Harris's book led director Ridley Scott to order re-write ... and frankly, when I saw the film and read the book finals, I don't know what's worse. <br /> <br /> Please don't waste your money OR time on this movie if you're not ready to leave EXACTLY in two hours because it's just a way I'll feel satisfied with Clarice Starling's saga and Hannibal Lecter ... continue the secret that created the first movie, and wait for this, so great.
