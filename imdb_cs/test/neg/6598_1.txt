In fact, writers and creators of this film should be sued ... For the world to be polluted by this crap! "Man in the Mirror" is actually terrible! Journey, Journey, Journey Away! and people, I'm not just saying this because I'm a Michael Jackson fan! Or because it's really one of the most retarded depictions of my life I've ever met! I say it because it's a waste of time, money and celluloid! I'm ashamed of seeing it all! That's 1 hour and 26 minutes of my life, I'll never come back! I'm telling you; Watching grass growth is literally more fun than this movie! <br /> <br /> Be Warned!
