Here is a movie that clearly banks the market as an exotic for viewers who are not familiar with its subject. An attempt at hybrid fiction and documentary, "Kadosh" clumsily falls between the chairs. As a document on one side, it is neither accurate nor insightful. To realize his careless treatment of detail, we must go beyond the opening scene, where it is clear that the ultra-orthodox protagonist does not even know how to properly load his t'filin. More generally, the lengthy rote-style presentation of details (in this case the Jewish ultra orthodox ritual) is the task of the manual, not a good document; this should give the viewer an organizational principle (Gestalt if you wish) to appear with a better understanding of the observed. This is clearly not happening here because the ultra orthodox ritual becomes even more mysterious. The director apparently did a decent job explaining it all verbally during the film campaign; kinematic, but it is a serious case of stuttering. On the other hand, as fiction, it suffers from flatness of character, simplicity of conspiracy and dullness of message. On some points, I felt I was watching the cartoon. (eg a wedding night scene - without details in angles, positions, and dimensions ... well, technically it couldn't be a realistic representation of the human sex, savage as it may be.) <br /> <br /> there are no small things. Clever manipulation with hints, stimulation of the viewer and the idea of ​​actively participating in film text, which in my opinion is a sign of good trait, is completely missing. On the contrary: looking at the film that I sometimes felt was filling up again and again with the same already radiant and too obvious content. It's actually, as director Gitai himself said in the interview, architectural "shifting objects in the universe," and then coloring the scenes with appropriate emotions when prompted and ceded to a suitable and predictable footprint; but the spark, that creative, duende-like dark, inarticulable spark (let's not forget "Kadosh" is probably a tragedy), that casts a two-dimensional screen spell that turns it into a spectator's expansion world, is missing without a trace. Perhaps the work of a visual engineer, perhaps an unofficial ideologist; certainly not a real filmmaker. What I saw was more of a passion for animated questions than real body-blood and complexity. The activity, and in general, failed to overcome this overhead flatness of the idea forced (sometimes even tortured) into the film. One notable, though relatively small, exception was that of mikve-lady and mother, both played super and seasoned Lea Koenig. This requires more than strict adherence to the winning equation (namely, portions of exoticism, plus heartbreaking but simple melodrama, plus a popular agenda, best politically correct) to infuriate my buds. What has been said is that I was simply bored for a large part of the movie. Despite the novel, perhaps even the pioneering success of using the ultra orthodox neighborhood as a movie set for which Mr. Gitai and his crew deserve all praise, I found the way "Kadosh" too Nadosh (Hebrew for "trite").
