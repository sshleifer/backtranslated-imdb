I paid $ 2.00 for this piece of bullshit, I want my money back. this is a horror movie that is not so groovy <br /> <br /> There are many men in this film, including acting, lack of real horror, lack of nudity (which, besides a nurse (porn outfit) and still breathing naked dead lightning there is no one. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is perhaps the best thing because it has some positive sort of guitar riffs / tracks. <br /> <br /> There are your usual typical characters, the athlete, the jockey, the stupid guy (who looks more like an athlete), crazy / fool (who has the biggest gap in the teeth I wanted to slip into a few dollar coins) .gap .. or go to the goal) mysterious fella and pure girl. Make-up was woeful with side views of a dr chopper showing a clear make-up line and natural skin tones, the DVD Envelope is clearly photoshop / enhanced to make the cover more attractive as dr chopper looks like old "plopper" scraggy women who hang around dr chopper aren't explained or l ook convincing as the rest of this movie. Twist Twist was very predictable and the abundance of bad-looking limbs FAKE was ridiculous, what they thought ... um throwing some limbs around and some fake blood and you got a horror movie. Dr chopper himself is the dumbest figure I've seen in a while, though the original I believe the creator of this movie was strained for ideas and maybe tried to use a rhyme doctor and a helicopter (bike) and thought "bingo" sick make a lousy movie about it. <br /> <br /> I've seen worse before ..... but that's just bad. All this is bad ... lack of tension ... lack of real horror or character development ... lack of decent action ... the only thing that is good about this movie was when it was over. This movie does not fall into the category of Ã¯ts so bad its good "for me either / <br /> <br /> The overall 2/10 director / writer / editor should know better.
