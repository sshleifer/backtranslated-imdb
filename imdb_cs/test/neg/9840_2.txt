"Nicodemus" is almost a copy of "Red" in particular behavior meaning, but this episode focuses on other people in Clark Kent's unpredictable life. When a poisonous flower finds out it's the way to Smallville Jonathan Kent is the first to be done. the flower causes people to reverse their behavior, and when it affects Jonathan, he becomes a short tempered and violent man, but Clark can stop him from doing anything until his father comes out. good. so far so good. Next is Lana. the episode was good up to that point, because the flower causes it to try to seduce Clark. at the last moment she rejects it, but the damage has already been done. This episode causes bad impressions and is not suitable for people under the age of 20 due to adult content. the first part was good, the last part (focused on the effect of the flower on Pete) was good, but in the middle, which was about Lana's alternative personality, it was the most nasty, and that destroyed what might have been a great episode. I give this episode two.
