I think the Trash really sucks. I watched it a few weeks ago and I didn't see a kind of c ** p in the cinema like John Waters did, and that was even worse. Dialogues, acting; It's really bad, it was so bad that I wanted to leave the cinema and ask for my money back. But in fact, I'm glad I saw it because I could tell my honest opinion about it. One should see this movie even if it stinks.
