I found the 'Shuttle' incredibly frustrating movie I watch. It starts quite well and moves sharply until the first "injury" (which is a doozy). He then becomes very lazy and subscribed as a story. It was a conspiracy case to drive characters and not characters to manage the chart. If you hate a movie in which you can't understand why characters do what they do, you'll be the 'Shuttle'. The last act is strange and seems to occur in a world without common sense. Also, at the end, one of the characters admitted to a past offense to her friend, rather than generating audience sympathy, most people began to giggle. Probably because the "heroines" of the story were complete idiots. Finally, the end seems to be "shocking" and comes from a horror school "people are bad, the audience, so accept it without any explanation". Shuttle is not good or bad, but average. And annoying.
