This is one of the most horrible movies I've had with misfortune. Don't get me wrong, I love a good zombie flick, but this wasn't one of them. Maybe (out of the opening scenes, at least) was called the Titty Zombie from Space. It had absolutely nothing to do with any other movie or video game (if I could say it). The best aspect of the movie is how the two main characters can get with so much blood. and remain so useless. I would definitely suggest that this and miss and stay with safer zombies will please like '28 days later 'or' Dawn of the Living Dead '(a remake, of course, if you are in some serious campy event.)
