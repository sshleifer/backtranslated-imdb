I know I loved this movie when I was 12-14. Now that I am 24 I watched it again, and I wished I didn't. Because all the things I laughed about when I was younger were no longer funny. so it's an hour and a half without fun. For me, the jokes were lame, not funny or just too childish. So the same thing I loved about the movie when I was a kid is now what I don't like about it. Besides being not funny, it's not at all credible at all. The bad character is very badly done, but I think it's the kind of movie he is. And the last 20 minutes of the movie is lame enough with bad fighting sequences and so on ... But if you're young, you'll probably love it. I rate this movie 4/10
