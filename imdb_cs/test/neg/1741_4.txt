Uzumaki, which translates into "spirals" coming under this new wave of Asian horror films after such hits as Ringu, Ju-On and The Eye (two of them with remakes .. and much more like Dark Water and Tale of Two Sisters), not under the spooky, supernatural thriller that is characteristic of other movies, the only thing that remains is weirdness and not the way Tim Burton or David Lynch is, but irrelevant and boring. His start with a girl, another child with a crush on her, her best friend and his father, who is obsessed with Uzumakis! Everything that happens is about Uzumakis, people are dying and you see Uzumakis. All right, it goes along with it, I'm a little amused by the spirals myself, the characters don't seem to go anywhere but I'll play together. We find that the city is cursed by Uzumakis, people are starting to scream at Uzumakis and the point is Uzumakis are everywhere, the film is a disaster, it does not know where to go, except that it will show you the power of Uzumakis !!!! !!!!! There are some cool concepts like when mother cuts her fingers because she sees Uzumakis on her fingerprints, but then there's another scene where she hears her husband (from behind the grave!) Tell her she also has Uzumakis in her ear, the way they mastered that the scene was just ridiculous, not even shabby fun, there are also some (a bit) cool visuals like the collection that my father Uzumakis and the girl with Uzumakis hair .. yep, hair Uzumakis, its out of context, though it seems that was removed from a commercial fruit fruit store, where if you eat Uzumakis fruit snack, its taste is so unbelievable that your hair turns into Uzumakis, now that it wasn't bad enough, all of a sudden there are Snail Men .. or ManSnails ?? It does not matter?? and you know why? right? Because they have Uuuuzuuuumaaakiiiis in their shells. It only had enough time for a lousy anti-climatic end and by that time I was sick of friggin 'uzumakis .. uzumaki here uzumaki there, sure, look around, how much Uzumakis can you find? If you want to see a movie about spirals, look at PI (3.1416), where you will find some nice concepts of uzumaki between the meaning of life and the dark city also has a little spiral. > <br /> This movie could work as a music video, it was already a cult follow-up and that's why I was forced to see it, but then I wasn't sure why people thought it was great. I was really disappointed.
