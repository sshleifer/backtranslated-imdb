I saw "Caddyshack II" when I was ten and I mostly laughed about the horse scene. I should have realized that the film is as empty as ... I can't come up with a good comparison. It's stupid and not really funny. The cast members of the original who decided not to play in this seem to have made the best decisions they have ever made in rejecting this; why, oh why, did Chevy Chase come back?! And how did Jackie Mason, Robert Stack, Dyan Cannon and Dan Aykroyd? I bet everyone who has his name remotely connected to this waste (eg, Cooks) is ashamed of redemption. So, in all, it's more than terrible, horrible and all that. Avoid the Ebola virus.
