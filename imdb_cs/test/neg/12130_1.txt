This movie was a pure genius. John Waters is great. It's funny and I'm not sick of it even after I saw it about 20 times since I bought it a few months ago. Acting is great, though Ricki Lake could be better. And Johnny Depp is magnificent. He is a beautiful man and a very talented actor. And when I see most of Johnny's movies, it's probably my favorite. I give it 9.5 / 10. Rent today!
