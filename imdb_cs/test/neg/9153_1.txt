Who's trading here? How could any manufacturer / CEO / director give the crew a stuck skeeziest fake plastic palm in film history in the sand of a Canadian winter beach and try to fob it on us like the tropics? The trees were real palms, what a pink tinsel K-Mart Christmas tree is for real fir. And who let Dermot Mulroney go in front of the camera with painted gray hair that wouldn't be in high school? And did not any of the genius who carried out quality control in this matter say to repair the (excellent) Canadian actor when he said gaz instead of gas? Anyone who has contributed to this blazing film "film" - writer, director, actors - has done not only a good but great job elsewhere. He moved quickly between events and fatally slow in them, without any emotion except obvious, exposing and inventive - perhaps it was just one of Lifetime's worst films because of the all-over red carpet with which he was presented. And I say this as someone who loves Lifetime. What gives people? Everything that was said, the work of a certain actress at a certain critical turn in the movie (and if you saw it, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about) was so brilliant that the movie would get 10 from me, if it was the whole movie. Unfortunately, it was only about five seconds.
