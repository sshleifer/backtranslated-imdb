This hokey movie left me moaning after almost every dialogue exchange or conspiracy complication. Patricia Arquette, although looking forward to it, gives less performance than her usual mediocrity. My friends and I have created the phrase "Beyond Rangoon", which means something really bad. Low point for Boorman.
