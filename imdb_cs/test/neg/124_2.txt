STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Former New Orleans Jack Robideaux (Jean Claude Van Damme ) again assigned to Columbus, a small but violent city in Mexico to help the police with their efforts to stop the major heroin smuggling into their city. The perpetrators proved to be ex-military, led by former commander Benjamin Meyers (Stephen Lord, otherwise known as Jase from East Enders) who uses a special method he learned in Afghanistan to fight his opponents. But Jack has more personal reason to take him down, which draws both men into an explosive final showdown where only one leaves alive. After his death, Van Damme seemed tall. that shows that he could do his best directly on video films on the action market. While it was a much more dramatic-oriented film, with The Shepherd he returned to high-kicking, without a thoughtful action that made him famous for the first time and unfortunately produced his worst movie by Derailed. It's not nearly as bad as the movie, but it's what I said. A blunt, predictable movie, with very little way of any exciting action. What is little there lies mainly in some crippled battle scenes that try to look cool and trendy with some inexpensive effects that unfortunately bring them despair. Director Isaac Florentine became a Mexican film and tried to give the film a sense of Robert Rodriguez / Desperado, but it only contributes to despair. VD gives a particularly uninspired performance and since there has never been Robert De Niro a kind of actor, it can't be good. As a villain, the Lord should not expect to leave Beeb soon. In the beginning, he keeps a little dialogue when he tries to gather an American accent, but in the end he is mysteriously better. All supportive casts are just as bland and do nothing to make movie spirits ever. This is one shepherd who came straight from the flock. *
