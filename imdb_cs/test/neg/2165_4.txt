With Matthias Hues on the cover and only $ 3.00 I had to buy it. I enjoyed a few moments like the Hawks' horror with pleasing droids, but I really watched them see the scenes of Matthias Hues. I especially enjoyed the showdown at the end. It was a hybrid between Clint Eastwood's "Good, Bad and Ugly" and "For Several Dollars More" (3 man fast-drawdowndown, with musical pocket clock used as a countdown timer). Besides, I can't add anything more. The actors gave good performances, (all except "Assassin Droid" whose performance was nothing off the comic), but the film really lacked depth and purpose; they just can't fill up 1 hour and a half of the standard movie time, so we stuck with the main characters aimlessly from place to place in an hour or until the ball comes back. For example, the main character returns to the same strip club about 4 times, occupying two fifths of the film. The scenery really lacked depth and creativity, probably due to film movies. I don't think we've ever seen this "perfect city" in New Angeles, which has always been talked about when the main characters finally arrived in New York, its set in a factory or a storehouse of pipes and sidewalks; hardly any kind of "kingdom" in which the owner / creator of the whole city would reside. "Super-high security" in New Angeles has also always been spoken, but only a total of 15, maybe 20, have been counted, even when the alarm has shut down; nor is it approaching Matthias's approximation of "at least a hundred men out there". <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of one of the actors in this movie, you can watch it, simply "add to the list". However, if you value 1 and a half hours of your time, or $ 3.00 of your money, you may want to give this one a miss.
