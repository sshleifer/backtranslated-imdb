I saw this thing for the first time, today's Series 7, and I was almost thrown up on my stomach. I just couldn't stop crying my eyes on these poor people, and if the woman really had that baby, EVERYTHING I CAN BE ASHAMEDY OF YOUR !!!!!!!!!! I have a 4 month old daughter and it's just absolutely scary that she would be a "real" pregnant woman in CONTEMPORARY FRICKEN DANGER! you are bloody ANIMALS and you should be locked out for a lifetime to put something like that on if this so-called "reallity show" is real, why is someone not imprisoned for letting people die and doing nothing about it. ARE ALL AGREEMENTS TO BE FIGGEN INITIAL !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
