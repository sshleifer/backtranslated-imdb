Red Sunglasses <br /> <br /> I loved Avalon, I think this director has made a wonderful demented vision of the future. However, this film was boring demanding crap. The opening scene has shown a great promise for what the envelope and description promise surreal live action amimae style future noir. I feel like I have it with Avalon. With the red glasses I was just pulled to feel uncomfortable and longing for what the hell was. The film hardly made sense to me and I couldn't worry about the people in it. That would be fine if the film was an effective art. While the opening scene looked interesting, and the giant robot-dressed man who held the giant machine gun in the rain looked cool, she didn't see a film worth watching. <br /> <br /> Thumb down.
