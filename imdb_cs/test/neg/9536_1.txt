Wow! After the first five minutes of watching this "movie" I was tempted to put a bullet in my brain and end my life. It's really hard to describe what this film is about. I honestly don't know what kind of human being would even finance a piece of excrement. The film seems to have been either video or 16mm. Normally I don't have a problem with SOV movies, 16mm movies are strangely made, but that was terrible. And where did they find these "actresses"? I saw some bad behavior, but this is the cake. Watch the first 5 minutes and see what I mean. BCI Entertainment should be boycotted for dividing this divine horrible sludge. That must be the worst movie I've ever had when I saw it. I want 74 minutes back! If you are able to sit in the first 5 minutes without shooting TV or committing mass murder, then shoot. After all, what do you have to lose?
