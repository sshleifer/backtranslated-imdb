Terrible movie. Just awful. The beginning of this movie is like something bad in prison film. Then it goes to being a B-movie version of the aliens. B-film in this case means adding gratuitous sex scenes and women in underwear. Oh and a lot of shots are exactly the same as they were used in two other films of the same company (including schtick women). The only thing saving this movie from 1/10 is that I actually saw worse movies. Not much, not much, but worse.
