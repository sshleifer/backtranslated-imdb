My friend who has a mysterious search and horror talent! - I liked the bad movies I recommend I look at The Pest. At a time when he wasn't aware of how poor his movie was in movies, I decided to try. <br /> <br /> Bad error. The story, although clearly torn from every sixth grade English textbook, regarding the theme "manhunter", would be fun under the right conditions - good actors, writer, director, wardrobe, and so on and almost without end. Obviously, these factors are missing. 'Pest' is supposed to be funny, I think. I say "I think" because I left nothing more than a slight smile in the whole movie. No stupidity, no laughter, no laughter, no smile. At best smile. And that rarely happened while watching this movie I even remember how often I smiled - maybe 3 or 4 times at best. So do a great favor. Never look at this movie. Avoid at any cost.
