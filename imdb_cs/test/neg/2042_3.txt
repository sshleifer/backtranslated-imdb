I can't get it, the freaks on the planet talk about this as something to be seen, even dare to call it exploitation because an obsessed girl seduces a priest and masturbates all the time. Don't let me laugh. I was watching the movie, just tempting them at the end of the movie and not saying it seduction, it's just the bad language he's talking about. And masturbation is also a big laugh, trying to seduce your father while masturbating, let me be clear, with the clothes on you. It's not bloody or bloody, they all vomit on Beyond The Door, well, let me tell you this one is better for me than this movie. Only the last 5 minutes of a perverted man vomits and has strange eyes. If I knew it was so bad, I'd never catch me. If you really don't want to see the exploitation of exorcism, watch Angel Above, The Devil Below, or other raw. time pass it is.
