It is a pity that someone who is so adored by many children, as well as parents, should be humiliated in this exploiting class that jumped on the train. I often wonder if Mr. Wisdom in his later years looked back at his apology for any film of pride. At the very least, Sally Geeson had the decency to retire when she did something that paid off after appearing in this low budget. With a long-forgotten pop called Pretty Things, the camera can't save the film from its horror. If you want 60 years of nostalgia to invest in 'Here We Go Round Mulberry Bush' instead, instead of playing Barry Evans and Sally Sister Judy.
