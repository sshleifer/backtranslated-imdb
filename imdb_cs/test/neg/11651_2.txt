This movie was useless. I can't even call it science fiction because it requires more of a movie than just a place in the universe. "Max Q" is not even set in the entire movie space. The story / plot is unoriginal, the cast is nothing to write home about, though it would be strange if an average movie appeared to be an average movie ... Moreover, it is not particularly exciting or well said. At the very least, it is evenly balanced in a low quality way, nothing or nobody excels in it. Everything is just as bland. I usually found some quality in "space swings", although it's just 90 minutes of semi-lame entertainment bordering on low budget pathetic, but "max Q" didn't even make me happy. All in all, a waste of time.
