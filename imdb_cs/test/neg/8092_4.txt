Then. This movie is totally uninteresting, puerile, has gags from other movies, has songs from other movies (Blink 182's "Mutt", Grand Theft Audio "My Luv U"), unlikely leading man, ridiculous plot and lame parody movies like Mission Impossible 2 and American Beauty. Using features? Shannon Elizabeth and Jaime Pressly. He said enough.
