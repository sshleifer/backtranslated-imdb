I sincerely met the real Han Su Ying before and seen her portrayed by an American actress who has no resemblance to anything Chinese does my head spin while I'm watching this movie Why can't Hollywood get Nancy Kwan instead .... at least his more faithful the story ... because for the sake of ... Dr Han Su Ying is a Chinese I know I met her in person <br /> <br /> and looked at the entire castâ€¦ so little Asian faces in the movie about I love the Asian love story too <br /> <br /> I think acting is good, but without real Asian faces in an Asian love story, the conspiracy is so frantic and the whole Baloney burden <br> As another movie I know about 'CONQUEROR' imagine, my eyes will pop up when I see John Wayne as Genghis Khan !!!!! <br /> <br /> and make things worst. ... how on earth can a man born in MONGOLIAN STEPPES come up with a southern Alabama accent ??? !! and a cheap imitation of something Asian <br /> <br /> Good Grief <br /> <br /> I am not surprised to see one day that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr plays one of the black boys and the white minstrel show <br /> <br /> I'd love to see <br /> <br /> and laugh all over the roof !!! Cheers
