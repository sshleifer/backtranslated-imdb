I see that C. Thomas Howell has appeared in many films since his heyday in the 1980s as a perfect young actor. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD because it was cheap and partly for internet land. see how much older C. Thomas Howell is; I don't remember seeing him in all the movies since the 1980s. Just a few words: what a great disappointment. I'm giving some low budget movies a chance, but this started lame. During the first 15 minutes of the movie, this elusive woman is chatting with an Asian in a chat room. Basically, they stimulate their own chat, then insist on a personal meeting with the participant. He meets him, has sex, binds him, and then murders him in cold blood. The story is getting worse. The storyline is thin and fragile, and acting is very tough. Don't bother renting much less shopping, even if it's in a $ 1 DVD bin. I plan to take my copy of the DVD to Goodwill. I am really surprised that some of the previous reviewers gave this movie a bad rating.
