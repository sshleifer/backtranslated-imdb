Well, yes. Very well, I have to say, even though I don't speak Chezck. Nice cinematography. But the script is lame, really lame. A predictable soap opera in which you know exactly what will happen. OK, maybe the end isn't so predictable, but is it good? It's one of those movies that you feel you've already seen and forget about the day after. Just got a note from IMDb that my comment wasn't long enough. That's really sad because I have no idea what else to say about this movie, which actually says a lot about it, don't you think? The thing is .. It has no soul and no originality. Compare this film with Barri, or Riff Raff, filmed over a decade ago (or the extremely recent filming of The Child). It's sad to see it's a much worse movie.
