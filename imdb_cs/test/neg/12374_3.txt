Before we start, I can say that I hope you have already eaten when you read it. Why? Because when I first saw this movie, my bird and sound made me eat chicken after the words "End" appeared on the screen. So don't say you weren't warned. but "Giant Claw" is not that huge movie. Yes, it is a prehistoric monster flying in the air, attacking planes and cities, and occasionally treating a man on a parachute. The beast is huge, except for scenes where it is much smaller, but who needs consistent proportions in the movie? Scary? It could have been, but not, if the plot is hopelessly stupid, and the monster looks like a puppet who ran away from Sesame Street.
