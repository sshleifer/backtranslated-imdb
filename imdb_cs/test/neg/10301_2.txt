I work at Memorial Hermann Hospital (TMC) and during Allison I also worked at a children's hospital in Texas, a female hospital, and West Houston. Unfortunately, the first shots of the hospital are suburban. Texas Medical Center has a daily population density similar to Wall Street !! There are huge skyscraper professional buildings and hospitals. TCH was the biggest children's hospital before it doubled, TWICE! The 1500-bed methodist is one of the largest hospitals in the world. The Texas Medical Center skyline is larger than the Memphis skyline. But the best picture Hollywood could collect is that it is a small hospital in the middle of nowhere (except a real pic hospital a few decades ago). They also joined several characters in real life and portrayed them in one (super-sister). Actually, I know a medical technician works at a blood bank. Two where he actually worked at the time, but the film shows only one pregnant MT. There was a pregnant MT, and another MT that took the precious patient of rolodex antibody (research "alloantibodies" for more information). I will not mention their names (privacy). There was no nurse in the real life lab. Hollywood has combined these two techniques (most likely saving time and money). In the film, military helicopters (true) had to transfer our children (NICU and PICU) to UTMB until Galveston! Why can you ask when we have the biggest children's hospital in the street? Because the Texas Children's Hospital refused to take them. You read correctly, they REFUSED !!! When I employed them, I was ashamed. Needless to say, I'm no longer connected to this device. Any other comments would be repeated to those people have already sent, who live here or have experienced.
