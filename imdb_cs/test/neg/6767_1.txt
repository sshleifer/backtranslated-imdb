RAP, the book that this film founded, was one of the hardest books I've ever read. But I couldn't put it down. Angry, rude, repulsive, obscene ... you name it, it had it. It also had some of the best characterizations of any novel I've ever read. Well, like the movie ... it was pitiful. Tim Mcintire as Wasco? Wasco was the worst mutha ... speaking WASCO match ... Mcintire as Wasco is like casting Tim Conway as Charles Manson. <br /> <br /> What happened to the MAIN character in the book? Little Arv. It doesn't even exist in the movie ... A quick walk wasn't in the main dude book. Why even name this thing with RAP? In this film, none of the spirit, atmosphere, ugliness, or drama of the book was captured. For me it was not just a disappointment, but a total waste of time and celluloid.
