Films that use blue-black and vivid skin tones to create noir-ish feel that this film unfortunately does not work. In fact, it is quite irritating because it obscures the characters of the demons and reduces them to one-dimensional beings. At least the original had hysterical energy and gore set-pieces were quite overwhelming. Black gore is hardly scary, nor is the main female demon in all its terrifying attempts to growl and growl on the screen in its best Lugosi-style camp. The story is grossly disjointed and if you can imagine Russ Meyer's "Naked Lunch" you can appreciate the attempt to be William Burroughs-esque. Otherwise, give this film a wide circuit. Fans of Bava and Argento - again - are bitterly disappointed.
