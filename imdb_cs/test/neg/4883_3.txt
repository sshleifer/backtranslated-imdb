This film is overrated, at least. It's not good as a comedy and it's not good as a "serious" movie. Stimulation is too far for the first, and lame grotesque is too much for her. The only laughter comes from some of Bud Spencer's reactions when he gets angry with his brother's behavior. Copying is excellent, but full-screen framing is frightening. (* 1/2)
