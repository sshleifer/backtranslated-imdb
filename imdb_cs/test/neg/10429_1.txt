Any film school student could make a movie 1000 times better than a piece of waste. As someone who read the book, I expected it to be a fair repetition of this book. There was a chance that a talented director could go beyond Woodward's narration and make a great movie. Well, the director went beyond Woodward's narration. He added a hip Hispanic angel named Velasquez who wasn't in the book. Bob Woodward had an interview with Belushi's dead in a morgue exchange. The film looked at someone who stoned to PCP and stared at his navel. <br /> <br /> If it's a spoiler for you, you'll be thanking me for that because it's the worst movie ever made.
