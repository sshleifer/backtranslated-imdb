A young doctor and his wife suddenly expect a baby. Both are disturbed by about two hours of memory lapse at night conception. An interesting twist on the hackney story. Very good F / X and interesting cuts. Jillian McWhirter is excellent in the cast featuring Arnold Vosloo, Wilford Brimley and Brad Dourif. Brimley brings normality to eccentricity. Kudos director Brian Yuzna.
