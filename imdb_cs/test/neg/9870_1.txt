this is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life .period.this this movie goes beyond the ridiculous, it's like the director wants to get the ass sued by actors for misrepresenting their roles as fantastic four, i believe the movie should Be released in comic shops to make it as it should be said desperate geeks who can't get enough kitsch and want to see more and more bullshit movies.in the conclusion to my paradoxical statements and theses, I believe this movie had great disadvantages for the future of cast contributors, with the exception of the jay underwood character, in which I believe it was his best performance, considering roles such as not quite human movies in which the story is told in a way that has no character, cannot act, and people choose that he won't see his movies, that's why he most likely won't have any huge roles. .
