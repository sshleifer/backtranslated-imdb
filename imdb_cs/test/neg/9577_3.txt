This Spanish-Italian co-production tells an interesting and strange story about Dr. Bannister, a woman who has not only had the best years, but also has a scarred face that looks like a bitch. But in Madrid, a professor who knows has done some animal experiments with a substance that regenerates cells. The attempts were successful, but the animals became aggressive. Because the professor won't allow Dr. Bannister to be the first human guinea pig to kill him and consume this substance. She becomes a beautiful young woman, but also an evil murderer to keep her secret a secret. The storyline is great fun, but Piero Vivarelli didn't have enough skills and money to make a great movie out of it. Also, the movie will get bored after a good start and can't get a fast pace, even though the film's runtime doesn't exceed 83 minutes. And as the setting changed in the Swiss city of Geneva to the last third of the film, sometimes it looks like a vacation movie as we see how beautiful Geneva is (which is really - but it doesn't help to push forward the story.) So with a more talented director, better actors and a bigger budget, "Satanik" could become an obscure Italian classic. But, as it is, it's just a bland and boring criminal movie that really isn't worth looking for. Rating: 3 out of 10.
