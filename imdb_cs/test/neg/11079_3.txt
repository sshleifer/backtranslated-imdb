A group of caves with a sad history with an author on a "furry" adventure through an unexplored cave in Kazakhstan. At these times of remake and sequel and film companies trying to earn on any winning combination of film components, in the last few years Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave films. X-file. I like to give each film a good deal of doubt, but for me there was just too little annoyance. Camera work can cause you headaches because they seem to still confuse which way is up. It doesn't matter if the filming is realistic. PANNICK is totally unnecessary from too-experienced cavers, the last half you say is one of two things? Oh just shut up and focus on saving yourself, or I hope everyone will die to the end. It had to be very tedious for these decent actors to make this movie. Slight amount of gore and nothing special in dialogue or characters. Even if you're pretty sure you know what's going on, the last five minutes will explain all the details. But I would have a better idea of ​​the movie if I left the last minute on the floor. It just wasn't necessary. I suggest you come across eject right after you confirm your suspicion and save your settings for continuation. For a long time, I thought the film industry should share the modified cashier scheme of the restaurant industry. You pay for materials to make a movie before you go in, but no profits for the movie come from the tips you give when you leave the cinema. I can't blame what I don't like about this movie on its low budget.
