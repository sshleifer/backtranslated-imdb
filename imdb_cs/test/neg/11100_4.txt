Actually, it was a pretty boring movie. I think the problem with the French horror film is that the French must be easily scared or something, because the film was not just scary. Special effects with a mum look like they didn't even belong to a movie, as if someone put them in post-production to spice them up because the actors hardly react to them. Conspiracy just a kind of meander, which is the opposite of a real story. I think it was based on the French TV series, where they had to distill it for a two-hour film. The reason is that the mummy is brought out of the Louvre store, which seems to have such a weak security that this girl and her boyfriend can get into it several times. (That's how people steal Mona Lisa!) A friend and policeman of the 1960s movie came together and tried to eradicate the demon. So I'm not sure if the Mummy was going to be bad or not. He kills two guards during the film, but just wants to get into the afterlife.
