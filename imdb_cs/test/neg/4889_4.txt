Ruggero Deodato is often credited with inventing a cannibal subgenre with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST in 1975. Director Umberto Lenzi, usually acknowledged as deodato rip-off, directed MAN FROM DEEP RIVER 3 years earlier in 1972. Is this a worthy beginning of the genre? Well .... not really ..... <br /> <br /> Photographer accidentally kills a person in self-defense and is captured by an indigenous tribe holding him captive in retreating into the jungle of an Asian country, forcing him into slave labor and eventually accept him when he marries the boss's daughter. Throughout the film, I never felt it was a horror movie. It was more like a drama like MAN CALLED HORSE, which I liked better. Ivan Rassimov is pretty good as a photographer, but it is Me Me Lai as the main daughter who is unforgettable and great. I've always been a Me Me Lai fan since her stunning performance at JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and she has never received recognition for her acting chops because she barely speaks in her films. She is still very talented and charming. A lot of real mutilation animals is one thing about DEEP RIVER that could make it horror, but it doesn't do well either. MAN Z DEEP RIVER is good to see for those who want to see what began the cannibal subgenre, but as a record in the genre, it is easily obscured by Deodat's notation and even later Lenzi's writings. Recommended only for finalists and Me Me Lai fans.
