This movie was terrible. If it had never been, the world would have been a better place. Come on, flying car? What did they think? This was a sub-par movie with a terrible hook, and I would like to write a written apology from the studio that produced it, along with some cookies that will help me pay me for the time I wasted on this crap fest that I never get back. If you paid to see this movie, I'm really sorry because I watched it on TV on Sunday afternoon when I had nothing better to do and destroy it all week. Flying Fool WAGON?!?! And this is to compensate for having a terrible mother who cares for her own needs than her children? No wonder they don't have enough sense to tell someone that he's beating them, their mother knows nothing, but what she wants comes before everything else. Absolutely terrible.
