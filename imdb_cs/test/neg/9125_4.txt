As with many sequels, this does not have the quality or impact of the original. The first one is there with the rest of the greats. This one just doesn't cut it. The first movie had a magical "good time" feeling that's completely missing in this movie. We became in love with all these characters (minus Richard Dreyfuss) in the age of innocence. A few years later they changed so much that they were mostly different people. While this is happening in real life, we do not expect it to become our favorite movie character! The film has no humor that had the original, and we expected to laugh. Little humor is dark. The first movie also featured what is probably the greatest soundtrack ever, while this one is good but not so close to the original. This film is so completely different from the original that it is not really a sequel. I gave it 4.
