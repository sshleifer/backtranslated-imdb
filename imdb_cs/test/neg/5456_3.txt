The use of "astral projection" (the wandering soul), existence outside the body, with the result that causes terrible death (.. crushing the inside of victims leading to broken spine and torn organs) to those who are close to those with such abilities is the threat of ETERNAL EVIL, which provides Karen Black (.. like Janus) with another "unique" character who could be fooled by a woman who affects commercial director Paul Sharpe (Winston Rekert), tired of his dwindling marriage and boring career. In fact, she dies and needs his body, her spirit potentially harmful to his wife and son (.. his son has a "special friend" who talks into things, even poisoning himself in one place). Detective Kauffman (John Novak) investigates unusual killings involving those killed by a benevolent spirit, linking Paul to death and exposing Janus through him. They soon realize that Janus must be stopped or simply moved to another human host. Paul does not know that his new secretary is Janus' lover, both were in fact older intellectuals who appeared in his documentary astral projection WANDERING SOUL. Director George Mihalka (My Bloody Valentine) will surely create a strange atmosphere with this film, which contains a somewhat bizarre assumption. Paul's boy seems to see the spirit of a blue man manipulating a child with disorderly behavior. Black, despite star treatment, is rarely shot up close and uses her face to produce the type of malevolent evil that guarantees her character. Instead, he is shot from a distance, her dubbing is dubbed and, in my opinion, she never assures her own threat, which is an opportunity lost. For some reason, despite the interesting idea of ​​astral projection that causes the ghost to kill people from outside, the film never starts. The soundtrack is very "Yanni-ish" and lighting (.. and sound), while occasionally moody and effective, often is quite dark. Stimulation is also a problem, as is the story of a mule. The cast is rather flabby, especially Rekert in the lead, his performance is unbalanced, at best. It does not help that there are few characters (except Paul's wife) that we can worry less about, and what really hurts is that Paul himself is not the world's loved one. moody, his unfulfilled career the reason for this behavior. Black should be a more prominent figure in the film, but he remains mostly behind, talking about it in a dialogue between Paul and Kauffman, but rarely has a chance to entertain us with his history, which is a shame.
