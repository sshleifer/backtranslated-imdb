A college female runway star dies of a blood clot after winning a race with the commotion community against coach George Michaels (Christopher George playing him as a major ass-head who is very demanding on an athlete under his watch). He will be conserved after school to provide a film with a motive as a possible killer. Some twist psychopaths in pots (much the same as what Michaels is often seen wearing), using the stopwatch to the time of his execution, the murder of the team members track the dead woman runner was part. Early disrupted parents call the main Guglione (Michael Pataki) wondering why their children did not come home on the promenade. Halliday inspectors (Carmen Argenziano) start collecting around the campus at the request of their parents. Instantly beset by Michaels, he becomes the main suspect after the box body is in the locker room. Ensign Anne (Patch Mackenzie) returns home from her base in Guam to earn her sister's diploma from the dead track and soon confronts the killer alone on the scene of the top chase. Kevin Badger (E Danny Murphy) is a tired friend of a lost star track. Rather tousled slasher stretches in death sequences and tries to mix humor inside and rather unhappily. Low quality kill sequences just increase laughter, such as a sword embedded in football thrown into the stomach by a footballer or a pair of garden shears used to behead a poor soul with an escape. Linnea Quigley has an entertaining role as a horny student, Dolores, who sleeps with her high-school music teacher and always chases after a man's shame (receiving pruning shears before he has a chance to sleep Dolores outside the promenade). Vanna White has an early role as a blonde ditsy who reveals the gymnast's dead body in the locker. Virgil Frye has a stupid role as an ignorant officer.
