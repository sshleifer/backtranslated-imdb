When I watched this movie today, I felt that this thing was missing about 10 to 15 minutes from the beginning of the story. John Wayne rides in the middle of nowhere to meet the owner about some of the robberies. All they see are signs of a massacre, dead bodies, signs of struggle, and no one alive in sight. This is because the owner's daughter is hidden in the secret room you find in the old English murder mysteries. The reason why these hidden rooms can be found in such stories is that they were formerly priests. Catholic families clinging to the old faith of the 16th century England built these things to hide those fleeing from the royal authorities for their faith. It's not something you see in Westerns, but a good trick. Unfortunately, due to poor editing or writing, or both, we never know exactly what Wayne brought to this place. But this was B western and not the good one. Gabby Hayes is in it and he's clean shaved and playing a dim part of the time. An unusual circumstance for the brave Gabby. If you want to bother and see what's going on and see a bearded Gabby Hayes, then he'll see this movie.
