Thomas Vinterbergs "De St√∏rste Helte" is another road movie without the most important element of the film: a good story. The characters are not very original and not particularly interesting. Especially Thomas Bo Larsen is a sore throat, playing the same role he has played over the past few years and repeating in "Festen" - he seems to think acting = rage and shouting to other people! The film doesn't make much sense and not much fun - even if they're trying to be "coca" and "weird". If you are going to make a road movie, why not add something original to the genre?!
