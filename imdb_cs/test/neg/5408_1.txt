Although Casper van Dien and Michael Rooker are generally included in B movies, even though they are above this film. He can't tell even the slightest sense of excitement, fear or fear - unless you count the fear of sitting over the rest of this waste. The direction is amateurish with annoying cuts and jerky movements that hide the fact that the killer is not near the victim when attacking. And what a killer is: cheap skull mask and black hood. He liked it better when he fought the He-Man. This is one of the most beautiful jobs I've ever seen. That's Skeletor! And he's riding! Is it supposed to be some scary supernatural creature? How do we take it seriously? All we get is the scenes of this guy who rides in the woods on his horse - which he can barely keep - scattered by scenes of soldiers shooting randomly into the forest, thinking they can shoot the ghost. Occasionally, Skeletor will shoot someone with an arrow or ride and stab someone, revealing how fragile the effects are really. Generally I enjoy the Sci Fi Channel at the basic cheese level, but this film is too incapable of any level of enjoyment. Where is Dolph Lundgren when you need it?
