OK, there may be a SPOILER first, because I don't know what this is, it's too much information. My subject says everything, but definitely people will want to know why it's so stupid. First of all, this movie follows a bunch of Yuppies as they go to a sports game in Chicago, but end up considering the bad output and liquidation in the ghetto. Scary, huh? First and foremost, Emilio drives everyone in the most deadly RV / Winnebag in the world, tricking satellite antennas and crap on it. So these guys go into sports games (I forgot which, though probably Bulls or White Sox, because they are near oh-so-scary ghetto), but they can't even make it a highway without having an onboard observation command center that would ESPN was ashamed. Yet they are smart enough to make a living to pay for things, but they are such sports fans that they don't even know which way they love on the way to the game. <br /> <br I gave up the movie within half an hour, but the reasons were abundant. They conclude in GHETTO, but their main danger to their existence is DENIS LEARY. WHITE GUY. I'm not a racist, but COME. Anything that has become reality - and this movie has tried to be an urban nightmare - Denis Leary wouldn't have tried to kill Emilia Estevez, he would have been driving to get f *** out of Dodge alone !!! This is easily one of the stupidest movies ever made, even though I'm not familiar with much of the rest of the world. If the MST3K were still in place, they would certainly have devoted themselves to this episode.
