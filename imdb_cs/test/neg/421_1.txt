It is difficult to imagine how Dan Brown's intriguing novel "Angels and Demons" could be as bad as this movie version. Here are ten reasons why the film was a failure. For spoilers, please don't read on unless you've seen a movie. (1) There was no love affair in the film between Robert Langdon and Vittoria Vetr. Worse, there was no chemistry between the two main actors. <br /> <br /> (2) Breathtaking places in Rome, as described in the novel, were not visualized in the film. I am aware that director Ron Howard has encountered difficulties in filming on the spot. However, there are excellent images of Rome on The History Channel than in this film, where the Eternal City was presented in the footsteps of eternal film. The great works described in the novel have been briefly described in the film. The magnificent statue of Bernini's "Ecstasy of St. Teresa" was only briefly seen and the relief of West Ponente at Vatican Square was not visible at all. (3) The filmmaker's most tasteful choice was in the depiction of the late Pope, who in fact resembled his beloved John Paul II. In the novel, the pope is clearly fictional with no resemblance to any real pope. One of the most colorful (and important) characters of the novel, Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN, was cut out of the script. <br /> <br /> (5) There were many instances where the dialog lines were inaudible due to background noise. <br /> <br /> (6) There were times when the faces of the characters were not visible due to the shadow and the illumination of the chiaroscuro film. This technique worked in "The Godfather" movies, but Ron Howard is no Gordon Willis. (7) The Cardinal's Choir Grammar School was quite a diverse crew when one of the voters spoke in the southern draw. This dude would be more at home on a Texas ranch than at the Sistine Chapel. (8) The decisive relationship between Camerleng and the late Pope was not defined in the film. This relationship was a central theme of science vs. Religion and the Illuminati Meaning for Conspiracy Against the Church. (9) In the novel, the character of Hassassin was an unforgettable villain. In the film, the role of the killer character was a cardboard cutout villain. (10) As a whole, filmmakers did not trust the work of a successful novel. The Langdon novel makes it impossible to fall from the sky and into the Tiber River. The Howard movie was a movie that landed in Tiber.
