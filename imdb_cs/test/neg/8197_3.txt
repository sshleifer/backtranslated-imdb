This is a movie that was probably created for high school entertainment, early middle school children. Maybe it's funny, he might even see something scary in it. For me, acting is bad and the plot is bad, it's just not very valuable for an adult viewer. I saw the movie as weak and boring. Sometimes there was a possibility that the film might become interesting, but it never happened. The creatures look pretty good, but after a few seconds they seem to have no substance other than appearance. Sometimes I wasn't sure if the movie was trying to make another comedy, or it was just another attempt at the horror that failed again. This movie wasn't good for me.
