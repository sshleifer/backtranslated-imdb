There is a place in the film where the boss of "deadly machines" (a multi-ethnic trio that delights everyone is inclusive, I think it's called these days) talks about leveraging the trader. Except it's her van that sounds like "skin." At this point, this viewer raised the idea that this matt film became a corner of the new world of kinkiness. But not. The boss had to speak, because "deadly machines" didn't say a single word during the film and didn't talk. Permanently. There is action in the movie, but it's not so exciting and conspiring from one clich√© to another. Three mute "deadly machines" live to survive the next day at the end of the movie. Hopefully it wasn't a sequel.
