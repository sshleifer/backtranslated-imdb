... when we all know nobody likes it like the BBC. Being a passionate fan of this observation on Sunday night, I was really looking forward to it. How disappointed I was! In the first thirty seconds, I didn't think it looked promising, and after two minutes I found it hard to watch. However, me and my friends insisted on finding out the wrong actions and the complete misunderstanding of half the characters. The storyline was rushed to the extreme and the make-up and costumes of the gaudy and very 21st century style "bbc robin hood". This modern style could be able to be placed in sharp camera angles and visually luxurious cinematography, but unfortunately we didn't get. The direction was definitely sloppy for both playing and shooting. After 30 minutes, we couldn't watch and go out and rent out "The Prestige" (which is very good btw). I seldom felt so compelled to warn people not to look at something! However, my friends and I thought that the house and the parasols were nice, but it is as good as it is.
