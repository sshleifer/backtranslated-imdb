The fact that this film has such a low IMDb rating is not surprising. Do we need even more reminders of American obsession with greed in our post-Enron era? The theme is so politically charged that many viewers will not only be entertaining films of this kind, but will barely react with a hidden anger. It was all I could do to sit quietly in this film note of corporate corruption without extracting the DVD and breaking it into a thousand pieces. <br /> <br /> What's really wrong with these kinds of movies, including "Purpose", is their pretense that there is some meaningful message behind the glitter that makes the film useful. In "Purpose" I found no such meaningful message. I found a story that adored the materialistic traps of capitalist power and wealth. These two main characters, disturbing their glibness, do very little real work. Instead, they party, they play golf, they rebel their coolness, they sound "hip" with dialogue directly out of MTV-culture-speaking: "rock my world", and "now get to the party; that is the order ‚Äù. John is smug, confident, shallow and grins a lot. Robert, who wears funky little glasses, is even worse. The film contains two teenage garages that look and look like in "Antitrust" (2001). Stereotypes are played for everything worthwhile, and in this film also include the elegant look of computer equipment, and Barbie dolls dolls on hand for those occasions when our can-do billionaires need some relaxation after all that heavy-party party.

The movie would be much more fun, much more fun to get rid of those outrageous characters and that repulsive story, and we were simply being spotted by the audience on that little plane for the duration of the film.
