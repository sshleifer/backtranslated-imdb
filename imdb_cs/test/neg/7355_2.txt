This film is so bold that it doesn't try to hide its similarities with The Shining. She lacks originality. And when it comes to an end, trying to cover up his story "Father goes psycho under the influence of a superficial haunted house in a foreign place", he does so by collapsing into a lot of other established conventions and ideas. In other words, it is reduced to mere clich√©s. But hell, even if I like a well predictable horror or thriller, if there's an interesting story, one filled with violence and gore, somewhere in front of the film is a terrifying turn toward predictable and banal. Well, this movie doesn't have a good story and I was really disappointed with it. "Darkness" means remarkable direction and cinematography for her. It is a film that is carefully designed and full of fun, scary angles and shots. What 'Darkness' is not supposed to go is almost everything else. To start with a little guess - editing in this movie is annoying. It goes from one scene to another, sometimes unnecessarily. For example, the old man in the film (who much bears the background story, later filled with another character) is underlined by hamsters running circles. I think it looks great for the first time, but why continue to use the same image? I think you'll have to see it yourself to understand what I mean. Another problem with this film is the character of Anna Paquin, who basically films all over the movie, cries and takes care of everything too - it's a failed horror movie attempt. The film has scenes of overcrowded sentimentalism and the family drama it captures is simply not believable. By the end, 'Darkness' is confused with melodrama, with a non-encompassing mystery provided with too simple an end. And it's hardly scary.
