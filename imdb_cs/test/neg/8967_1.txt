This is really stupid work mistakenly - about as bad as Hepburn plays a Chinese woman in DRAGON SEED. The main part of Hepburn is a combination of Beverly Hillbillies' grandmother and faith healer! This movie is even worse than Bogart's Swing Your Lady, because at least Bogart didn't play on the hill - he was just surrounded by them. And the dialogue sounds as if it came from Li'l Abner's strip! But in reality, problems do not end with outrageous casting because the plot is completely confused and a "love story" can cause injury to your head. For whatever reason, he married Robert Young for this Ozark Bobcat. Was it her beautiful personality who won his heart? I doubt that she as a fiery "spitfire" movie was named after and she really seemed to be fighting 'and scrappin' and hollerin '! Was it her female charm? Without makeup and fashion that seemed to be designed by Ma Kettle, I doubt if that was the case. Finally, eventually, Ralph Bellamy also fell for her, though it does not seem to make any sense again. So here we have two falling parachutes. for the awkward bride played by Mrs. Hepburn - now it's a good movie recipe!
