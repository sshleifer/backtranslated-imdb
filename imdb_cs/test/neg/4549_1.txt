It must be one of the worst movies I've seen. I tried to love this movie, but it managed to spoil virtually every single aspect that concerns this movie! Inexpensive dialogue, no character development, no tension, lack of a story that would drag you in, no action except some really cheap scenes. They seemed to have tried some things on the scene and said to each other, "Hi, this looks pretty cool, why not put it there," after which the director apparently said, "Yeah ... this is a genius!" and returned to sniffing coke or something. As for acting, I think the only person who made the TRIED movie is Daan Schuurmans, but in the end it's all for nothing. Because this movie SUCKS !! 2/10
