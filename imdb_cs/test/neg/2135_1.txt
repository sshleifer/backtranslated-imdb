Never before had such a large cast of ugly people gathered to create the same ugly film. There's something huge and scary in the waters off the coast of Florida, something that lets half chew the bodies behind. his wake. Unshaven beer addicted Bob thinks he caught Thing's "bad voice" on tape. Bob's assistant, the incredibly uninteresting and painfully thin Stella, decides to get the help of a slimy lad, Peter, an electrician whose equipment can help them find a mysterious creature. But anyone who keeps his nose too far into the mystery will be killed, killed by a baboon facing a hit with poor permission. What is the horrible secret behind a sea killer? Ugly scientists have annoying issues, awkward cops and doctors dealing with the growing number of corpses, Stella and Peter are killed or chewed on the beach and the characters we don't care about. The Sea Killer, a strange combination of octopus, shark, and a pair of large dental prostheses never seems to be as terrible as it should. The plot behind the creation of the monster makes no sense at all. None of the characters are particularly likable and those who could be killed instantly. It is badly shot, badly dubbed, plot less of a mess. The whole thing is so pernicious and smelly, that it has long been bothering me in the hot bath. I had more terrifying sushi plates than this movie. Avoid this if it is not the MST3K version.
