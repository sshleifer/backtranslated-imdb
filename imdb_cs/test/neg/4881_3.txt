I saw Bogard when he was released in the 1970s. It was one of those pictures that received an X rating for violence. We slipped into our local grindhouse and we saw it anyway. Pretty good picture. Lots of blood from street fighting, although cheap sound effects for the firing pin something from it. And lots of sex. I remember one of the first scenes when Bogard meets this pretty brunette in the apartment he shows him. Without saying a word, he picks it up, puts it in the sill and nails it. From what I remember, the picture had been floating since then. So when I found out that Bogart was also called Black Fist and was available on VHS, I ordered it online. I was very disappointed. Black Fist is Bogard adapted for television. So many scenes I remembered were missing, I wondered if it was the same picture.
