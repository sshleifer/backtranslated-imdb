On the way back to the dawn of human civilizations, passers-by were sitting and making lame jokes, hitting their heads with what they could ever catch, and the women were never seen and apparently had tails. These cavemen lived in a geographically diverse area with a cockatoo, a camel, a monkey - but without women. This film tells of the "cheerful" misadventures of seven (or so) cavemen - having burned their land with a new discovery of fire - moving through the water to a new country where they find this woman with an extra pendant. On the way, we get such "great" moments of comedy, such as a tough cave man who swallows a frog that holds a crocodile in his stomach. Monkey throws stones on their heads. Man swallowing mice to get frog in stomach. Mandatory "gay" Caveman. The list could go on and on. This film is a very definition of film dreck. I was bored from the beginning and worse when the cavemen wandered around and made bad jokes, such as puns on the words beating each other and torturing the poor Setters Berger, who seemed to have lost a producer bet. to appear in this nonsense. It's really one of the two bright spots in this movie. She's not much of an actress so you have to guess why she is ass-et? Another "bright" point is music. As soon as I heard the score, I thought it sounded very good. I've never heard the real score, but the music was undoubtedly the Ennio Morricone. It's a nice score and the best thing in an otherwise rough, boring, obscene, unimaginable and ridiculous movie that's basically a group of Moes who first find a woman and want to eat her like an animal and learn what she could do. Awwwwh! I'm sorry, I suffocate yawning when I relive the plot! At the end of the film, she has about 100 or so mostly naked women on the screen with all the erotic feelings of pulling scabs from her knee. This film was painful to sit and offer nothing real. The fact that the continuation was born does not surprise me because it offers the one thing that attracts the viewer - the tail.
