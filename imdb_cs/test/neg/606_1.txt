There is no character in this situation comedy with any redeemable features. All are self-centering, unpleasant or two-dimensional. My husband is watching and says there's nothing else to do, but I wouldn't do anything. The only sitcom I think was worse was Yes, Dear. At least you didn't get 9 seasons. Being overweight doesn't mean comic genius and Kevin James doesn't have John Goodman's talent, Jackie Gleason or John Belushi. Leah Remini can have a talent, but if she is, she is useless to a smart woman. Jerry Stiller is convincing as an annoying old man. Maybe that's the reason. This is a perfect example of why sitcoms are mocked.
