"Catchfire" or "Backtrack" as it is sometimes called is not very good. It is bad. Jodie Foster has already won an Oscar. Why did she agree with that? I don't know. The hostage / kidnapper relationship is unbelievable, although it is a common psychological phenomenon in real life. The worst of all is this movie scene, where Hopper and Foster ride a boat under the Fremont Bridge (Seattle Bridge), which means they had to stop the traffic to open the bridge. I had to wait for the bridge to go many times, almost everyone on the bus. It's not a pleasant wait. This film has caused useless waiting for the bridge and the world is a worse place for it.
