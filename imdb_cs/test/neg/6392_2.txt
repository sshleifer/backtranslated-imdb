Michael Cain's character is in trouble. He is a simple, short-sighted, uncertain man in his mid-40s. He's married, but his wife doesn't love him anymore. He has a bad relationship with his only daughter. But his most common problem is that the tremendously beautiful young woman played by Michelle Johnson is haunting him too eagerly, kissing him, fumbling him and trying to initiate sex at every opportunity. What is the poor guy doing? This film should be removed from the Comedy section and placed under Science Fiction. A single intergalactic brain chip can explain the actions of Michelle Johnson's character. Let's see - 3 billion men in the world - can choose a great deal - with clumsy, aging losers. This goes beyond the medieval male fantasy to something so delusional, just hoping that everyone involved volunteered to therapy. There's nothing funny about it. There are some quick attempts to joke from Caine, who often seems to play Hawkeye Pierce more than a new character. Joseph Bologna is like nails on a blackboard. Michelle Johnson is not an actress - she has one weeping scene that would not be in high school - but she is beautiful and she takes off her clothes. So buy a DVD, skip to scenes 4 and 9 and forget the rest.
