I watched all three crazy max movies for the first time in a few days and was left bitterly disappointed with the third installment. It destroys the delicate work of the first two films with a weak and kitschy action, and a story that turns apocalyptic Australian wastes into a comical sandbox that could be expected in a children's adventure film. Character Max is unknowable from his dark and cynical personality seen in previous movies and turned into a predictable, uninteresting savior who left me feeling betrayed. if you haven't seen this movie yet, just don't. Let the story end with a warrior and save a very painful hour and a half. (warning spoiler) Another major problem I had with this movie, which really left a bitter taste in my mouth, was a flying man. we've seen him in a road warrior where he helped max and yet when he reappeared in a thunderstorm, it seemed they never met. whether it should be a different character or a relative of a road warrior I don't know. however it has not been explained and is a weak element in this overall weak film. 2 out of 10 won't get 1/10 due to thunderdome combat.
