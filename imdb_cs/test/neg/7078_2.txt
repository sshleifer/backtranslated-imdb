I saw the movie yesterday and stopped it in half because I felt it was a waste of time. The idea of ​​making a movie through the eyes of the director - one of the "bad guys" in most fantasy and medieval movies - is great and offers a lot of possibilities, but ... one of them couldn't capture. I didn't feel any of the characters, the plot was too predictable (to the point that I followed him), and the second jump of time in the scene left me. Those who expect a deep insight into the director's emotional situation in the Middle Ages, a social outcast until then, might be disappointed.
