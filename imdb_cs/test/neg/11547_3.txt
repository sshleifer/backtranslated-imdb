In fact, this movie is getting pretty interesting, but for my taste it has degenerated too fast into a boring and predictable melodrama. None of the shows are particularly interesting and working with the camera is just a standard TV movie, so there's no reason for anyone to see this movie unless it's as big as Jeff Bridges fans. Bridges plays Mike Olson, a young man who announces on a family picnic that he is leaving college to embark on a journey. His parents think he "just performs" and talks about how "he has no plan". He assures them that he has a plan and that he must discover his true self and his place in the world. So much in fact, he invites them to go with him and buy an antique bus, which he and his father fix in the true TV-father-son movie that connects fashion. Up to this point in the movie, I was a bit interested in the storyline and characters, and I wanted to see how his jammed mother (Vera Miles) would respond to life on the road. There's a funny scene early on where a father and son have to convince her to go on a trip with them. They show the inside of the bus and are more and more interested in it, finally leaving in the huff with some kind of talk about curtains and window blinds. Bridges wonder to his father (Carl Betz, equipped with a radio voice) that she changed her mind. Dad assures him that the "electric oven ... works every time!". But the movie goes downhill almost as soon as it hits the road. It turns out that Mike's only "plan" is to introduce them to some "friends" who have turned out to be random people they meet at a hippie rock festival. When I saw the rock festival, I was a little disappointed ... especially because it was clear that the rest of the film would be held at the festival camp and not really on the road. But at least I thought it might be a decent band, well, if they couldn't afford Hendrix or stones, they might at least have Canned Heat or Little Feat or something like that. No cube - apparently the only music at this festival is any horrible choral group with an orchestra that sounded like a poor imitation of the Fifth Dimension, along with an annoying announcer to be funny. We are also acquainted with a set of hippie festivals and their various medical melodramas. Kathy (Renne Jarrett) is a pretty blonde with existentialism and nature in mind who falls in love with Mike before revealing that she needs kidney dialysis to live and run to the festival to die. And two other campers are determined to have a child in their rough tent, representing a struggle between modern medicine and hippie ignorance (or something like that). All in all, the longer it goes, the more painful the movie is for anyone hoping for some element of surprise or real drama. Basically, this film is a waste of time, even though it would amuse everyone who really is in the 60's, early 70's and movies of that time. I'd be as happy if I hadn't seen it before.
