STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> Old Detroit's Back, With Giant Omni Consumer Corporation Continue Swallow everything in his way, as the construction of the new Delta City continues, and a new threat to fight in the shape of Kain, a cruel drug lord with delusions of similarities with Christ, selling deadly new addictive substance on the streets called Nuke. As he continues to struggle with the memories of his former life that haunts him, the tinplate hero sets off to bring this villain down - just to be chopped into pieces of scrap metal. Robocop of the action, a reckless OCP business woman proposes plans for her new android-stamping, snarling animal on a machine that needs the same ugly test of the power that-Cain fits perfectly. After a brief glitch in his system, Robo returns to bring justice to the streets and balance the score with Cain. The original Robocop is a movie that always manages to amaze you every time you look, not the number of times you've seen it, one of those movies that just can't be done again. That said, it's no wonder that the sequel was done - it's even less surprising that this sequel really turned pale compared to the original. Empire Strikes Director Irvin Kirschner has created an unpleasant, slightly discontinuous and overly long film that fails to capture the magic of the first film, no matter how hard it is. And certainly, the funny ads from the first movie run no stop, a corporate satire that is going to be so sharper and action roaring as fast and furious as ever, but with blood / gore even more important than the first movie. The first film earned a name for some ugly, blood-soaked violence (including male genitalia that was thrown away, and a man who was fired) but while it was more memorable, the violence / gore exposed here is more sadistic and unreasonable nature, with a very unpleasant and medium temperament to her. Overall, however, the film leaves a sense of general apathy - why do you watch it when you can watch instead of the original? **
