This movie has bad writing and bad editing. It's hard to see what's going on because nothing of the character makes sense. Any big calamity occurs every 30 seconds. As a result, none of the "action" sequences are interesting at all. The movie is two hours worth "blowing up" scenes that are only associated by sharing a common actor. This movie doesn't even have a good sense of humor to be a good "bad" movie.
