Eaten Alive plays as a bad test for the following year Cannibal Ferox. The characters are generally bland, the places are criminally underutilized, there is no attempt to create tension or tension, physical effects are either ridiculously bad or blatantly stolen from other films, and the ubiquitous scenes of tribal rape are barely worthy of PG- animals are much more boring than usual. The only slightly shocking scene involves the crazy Jonas, going a little Goldfinger, controlling the blood drenched dildo; a scene that is more bizarre than graphic. My beloved wife, she 'Romeo and Juliet Collector's Edition', watched this movie without as much as wince's disgust! And he calls himself a cannibal movie! All-in-all, quite a lame effort that thoroughly betrays cannibal traditions. Cannibal Ferox, Luci's sequel, is a far better example of this genre.
