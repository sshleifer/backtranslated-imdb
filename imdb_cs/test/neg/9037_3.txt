Another movie that makes The Beach Boys story worse than it is. I especially remember the scene when Brian says he should stop traveling and the others call him a traitor. This is how I did not, and just like the film at the beginning shows that some scenes are exaggerated. The Beach Boys movie doesn't have to be so, because a lot of things happened. Sadly, this film gives a bad picture of the boys to those who are not familiar with the group. Hard-core fans like me knew it wasn't the whole true story and that's why I gave it a low rating 3. However, it's the best movie about The Beach Boys I've seen so far that says pretty much about others movies. If you want the truth, I recommend the document Endless Harmony.
