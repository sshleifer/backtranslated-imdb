Kennan Ivory Wayans was so funny in Low Down Dirty Shame that I had to see it and it was one of the worst things he did, and Steven Seagal didn't help much. It starts with some strange religious murders that don't make much sense to Jim Campbell (Keenan). He is surprised to see a new partner waiting to work on his side to break the case, but Jack Cole doesn't seem to be the one who thinks he's up to the moment Jack's ex-wife is killed in one of those ritual murders that eventually ends. also a suspect. It's the same as all his other movies: Smoke the past, engage the CIA, and now he's trying to be a normal cop. Why does Steven dress like a western movie? And prayer is upstairs so things are a little confusing.
