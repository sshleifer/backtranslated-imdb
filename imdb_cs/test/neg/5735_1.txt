sdiner82 has not seen the film for decades and his memory is scary. His attempts to paint Mark Lester's shaving scene as a suspect are totally wrong, as are his incorrect comments that the evil man "sneaks peeking at the baby's body". Lester is dressed all the time as the man is in the room, and the man barely gives him a look. The scene is a rough attempt to show Lester an innocent curiosity about the human body. > <br /> Like everything in this movie, it's bad, but nothing more. Even the comments of sdiner82 about the character of Savalas, who "accidentally sent the German family to their death by hacking their reef trailer" is nonsense (she was a single woman, she was already dead, and was in the car) I suggest that the sdiner82 review tells far, far more about its own, far from liberal thinking, than it does about this worthless movie. <br /> <br /> The only reason I am bothered to look up, he was out of curiosity to see if it was done before or after kojaku. <br /> <br /> The movie's worthless piece of 70's garbage, but sdiner82's review is the worst kind of slander. A review of the pseudo-intellectual "facts" but the only fact is that he is plain wrong on almost every "factual" thing he discusses. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that sdiner82 has seen exactly what he was looking for , which is worrying, can now return to burning to of Catcher opium in Rye.
