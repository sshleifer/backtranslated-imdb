Larry Bishop is 60 years old, dirty and doesn't look good. In this film she is like a drug to women in her twenties. Many movies have been declared sexist, but if any movie deserves to be this one. I can't even count how many breasts were shown in this movie, probably more than an hour spent by Larry Bishop writing a script. The script is ridiculous, the bishop and his gang are arguing, cycling, partying, having sex, killing people and arguing the next day, cycling, having a party, having sex, killing people and the third day. I like ERIC BALFOUR and with regard to what he had to work with, he did quite well as Comanche. Unfortunately, this movie is about Larry Bishop's Pistoller, who is so one-dimensional that it's not even funny. It's such a horrible actor and apparently never wanted to lead himself, but everyone he asked said he didn't, what was he supposed to do? After realizing that he would lead himself, he obviously did a transcript of the script to touch more of the ladies. Although it is visually nice, at least the biker-scene and Eric Balfour is not half bad this movie is just a big mess. I hope to never see Larry Bishop again.
