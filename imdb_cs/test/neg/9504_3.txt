Mostly I prefer French films to American, explosion and car chases, but this film was very disappointing. There is no way to write a spoiler because nothing really happens. This French couple has been living in Lisbon for years and will return to Paris for a friend's wedding. He tells another friend that they have dinner with the fact that they will split up. Then nothing happens, they don't seem to know whether they want to separate or not. I do not necessarily think that their hesitation makes a bad movie, it is very human when it hesitates to make such a decision good, but it could be dealt with in an interesting way, giving some body their desires and their relationship, but that won't happen. Man gets out of the theater because he is not sure why these two have joined or want to split. The only thing I enjoyed was talking to a drunk. That was life.
