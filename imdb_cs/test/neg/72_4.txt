Oh my ... bad clothes, worse synthetic music and worst: David Hasselhoff. The 1980s are back with revenge in the US-Italian co-production of Witchery, produced by the infamous Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and director with a short career (thanks to heaven for little miracles) to director Fabrizio Laurenti. Trafficked as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead in Italy (which was called "La Casa"), witchcraft adds some modest gore foods and bad gambling. The combination of ghost story, possessions, and witchcraft, the film bounces the clueless from the scene to another without leaving some seriously wooden actors and a hilarious day and night mix-up slow progress to the expected end, topping some serious top WTF surprise. (I only love the look on her face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti managed to gather some tension and anger in a few very few scenes; The few flashes of the mild film spell unfortunately fall quickly and efficiently for him. The plus sides are experienced when they hit the fan. This department is very effective and entertaining in the classic Italo-gore style latex and red styles of the 80s, when things were made 100% by hand and were as shocking and lively as modest budgets allowed. I could only look with sadistic joy and a few laughs at all the best ways to crush and abuse the annoying characters (and actors) one by one. I'm only sorry about Linda Blair, who was apparently not asked to try other than the old obedient girl / woman role in her career, or so it looks like she looks at his filmography. Well, people - there's not much to say, and even less to say it home. Don't expect too much to spend some rainy afternoon on it, and you'll probably have at least some fun. It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the rhythm of 80 euros of horror. Speaking of hearts, every film Hasselhoff has, which slips into a huge metal object and bleeds heavily in the room and hallways, MUST have one in the right place. That's my truth - what is yours?
