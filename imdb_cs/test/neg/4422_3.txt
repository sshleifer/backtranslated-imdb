In fact, "Stealing Time" dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously called "Rennie's Landing". Which explains how director Marc Fusco was able to afford this cast of the now established television / movie actors in what seems to be extremely low budget production. About ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got into a theatrical release after making a film festival a few years ago. His recent Franchise Pictures distribution probably reflects the impression that the growing popularity of some members can be milked to restore some of the modest production costs. Although not a great addition to a resume, young actors did worse things when they desperately sought out all kinds of acting. early "Great Chill" reunion and comparing war stories about the failure of reality to measure their dreams. Unfortunately, nothing else will happen, absolutely nothing. Yes Alec (Facinelli) dreams of being an alcoholic beverage and a bank robbery, which is then "cheaply and deliciously" staged for utterly inappropriate music. This is the least strained banking business from W.C. Fields was the guard at "The Bank Dick". If anyone can point at any moment in "Stealing Time" where something "actually" happens, I'd like to know about it, because if I can say it, nothing happens in the whole movie. Perhaps Fusco, through constant visual reflections, tries to say something deep about how to take control of his life before it's too late. Just like the "St. Elmo's Fire", the film is dotted with every deep thought that a young adult who has left the ivory tower has ever spoken to experience the real world. I felt that Fusco goes for the kind of Howard Hawks Young Professionals in action "Only angels have wings" motif. Then I'm sure I read too much in the movie. After all, in fact, Howard Hawks movies have happened. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
