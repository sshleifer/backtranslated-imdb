Let's cut through everything in the first paragraph. "The Messengers," the latest film Pang Brothers (Danny and Oxide), as a horror movie, is deeply bad. And like film in general, it is a big disappointment. It is nothing more than an overheated "Sixth Sense", and while this image is still available, there is no reason to pay money on Earth to see this turkey. Recently, horror / slasher movies such as "Final Destination", "Wrong Turn", "Boogie Man", "The Ring 2" and "The Grudge" are becoming increasingly dependent on big shocks without reward (for example, something that jumps to a person on the Screen, raises the audience's breath, but turns out to be a cat or a crow or something.) Little goes into a frightening experience like "Sixth Sense" or "Sign "or some classic horror movies of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. "Messengers" rely on the same old, tired clich√©s as these newer, far worse movies, so they're old, tired and - to my surprise - ended up one of the most boring movies which I saw in a while. The plot has another stupid family led by Father Roy (Dylan McDermott, "The Practice"), Denise's mother (Penel ope Ann Miller, "Awakening," "Kindergarten Cop," TV series "Desperate Wives "), Big Sis Jess (Kristen Stewart," Zathura: A Space Adventure ") and Toddler Ben (Evan Turner) who move to North Dakota from Chicago. The reason for this movement is never outlined, but it has something to do with Dad's inability to find work and Jess's drunken escapades. We know that they will be in trouble immediately as they move into a large Gothic house in the middle of nowhere; a residence that looks like Munster's summer home. Oh, and the first five minutes of the movie show that something terrible has happened. Jess hates the place (hey, who could blame her), but an optimistic pop of hope to emerge from it. (despite the unusually large amount of wrinkles glittering around). But when he meets Burwell (John Corbet, "Raising Helen" and looking like Kevin Costner in "My Name Is Earl"), a wandering drift and a sunflower expert, things start to rise. But then strange things begin to happen; Jess is terrorized by a violent invisible force in the house (of course, no one but two years old Ben sees it, so it is tagged with a snowflake) and the crows still stick around. Ben is also able to uncover otherworld creatures, but because he is two, he cannot express it. The scene after the scene of the people who told the boy to tell them what he was seeing me wanted to scream at the screen: "He can't tell you! It's two - madmen" - years! "Yes, having a single protagonist who can solve all these things is a toddler mute, she's really clever. Anyway, we're left to think about the reason Jess; when and when Ben will always correctly describe the paranormal vision if Dad does sunflower work, if the high plane of the drifter is a good man or bad, what is the sense of the real estate agency of George Plimpton, how can the forks embedded in his back be wounds, what is the role of the mother in the family and where are they all crows. <br /> <br /> All while waiting and thinking about something - anything - to happen, the conclusion is lame, and again asks how a spirit that has no physical body can harm a living person. boring, nonsensical and the worst of all, the least scary. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of crows in this movie.
