Thirty percent of this film seems to be a prototype of the Map Channel. You see a giant map for about ten minutes, then launch a track of great time while drones (droning, getting it?) About radar. There seems to be a lot of radar stations in the far north that protect North American borders from deadly polar bear attacks. Bears never appear, but a giant Mantis. He was frozen on the ice for over a million years until he was released by an earthquake somewhere else in the world (yeah, right. He was released by global warming for my money). It is a huge prehistoric insect and needs a lot of food. Since there are no cows on the frozen north, it decides to throw in most of the Scottish creatures they can find there. I.E., human beings. He's starting to attack radar stations, probably because the buzzing of radar foods got on the nerves. <br /> <br /> Enter Col. Joe Parkman, resident smarm guy movie. He's investigating the plane that went down, and it's confused why there are no bodies in the ruins. All he finds is one of Mantis's claws. He seemed to have decided to trim his nails while it was snacking aboard the aircraft crew. Parkman takes the tip of his claw back with him to be analyzed by a thousand year old scientist. Grandfather scientist can't do claw heads or tails, mostly because of his shocks, so his mind isn't. t works too well. So he calls the pugontist played by the guy who was P.I. in Perry Mason. He and his friend, a transvestite photographer, flew north because he decided that the claw must come from the Mantis prayer. Just one of the size of the train. It's Luke's warm love at first sight when Col.Parkman sets his eyes on the photographer for the first time. The men at the base, apparently deprived of many years, thinks it's the hottest thing to do with Grandma Clampett. Smug Science Guy and Smarmy Soldier Guy Start Cooperating Watching the Way of Mantis, which devastated some stock footage of the Eskimo village. Coming to the base looking for dinner snacks, and crushing some cheap sets quite effectively. Then they fly south and disappear. Now comes a tense clock when civilian ground observers are asked to sweep the sky and look for something big flying overhead. I doubt they would actually be told they were looking for a giant flying mantis that ate human beings because it could cause panic. They were probably told to look for a giant 727 who was painted green and buzzing because his engine was tuned. Col. Parkman goes up in the plane to try to shoot Mantis and send the mission. Mantis will land in New York, probably because he wanted to attend a Broadway show or visit the Sex World in Times Square. The army wrapped her in a tunnel, and Parkman and his men made silly suits they borrowed from Orkin's man to get in and try to throw Mantis up. Success! Almost since Mantis is still insidious enough, he almost kills the lady's photographer Eva Arden. In the end there is a lukewarm love scene and the paleontologist takes a picture of a dead mantis because Colonel Hair Grease and Mrs. Gender Unspecified are busy. Such kind of rude end.
