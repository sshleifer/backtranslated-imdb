Real Gothic Horror Basket Classic! Uhm, actually it's a horrible movie. The best part is: Rosalba Neri built naked nipples. Intensely absorbent material. Sure, Rosalba Neri is one great lady. I've never heard of her before this movie, but he's a damn pretty lady. But honestly, it was her nipples that made it for me, in the last scene before the movie suddenly ended, all naked and erect ... Full dream nipples, man. Well, I'm sorry, a little out of there ... Basically, I got what I expected from LADY FRANKENSTEIN: It's a slimy and horrible movie with a big stupid, ugly looking Frankenstein monster and a couple of naked goats . And he has a castle there. So I wasn't really disappointed or nothing. In some places it was too much (the first resurrection of the creature continued forever, with Dad Frankenstein just experimenting, talking, trying something more). The original Frankenstein was, however, one fun, an imbecile homage: instead of throwing a little girl into the lake, the Mongoloid picked up Franky's naked chick and threw it into the river. I should have laughed. Some of my friends just went a bit more about this movie. Maybe I was expecting a little too much. But Rosalba's erect nipples are definitely worth ... (Aw shit, I really have to stop mentioning her nipples). I think I'll just end this user comment.
