Sure, this movie was slowed down. But you waited for the moment you looked at the box. It's a B movie and the T&A factor added this movie. In truth, it was more fun than expected. Although it was by no means the work of a comedy genius, such as "The Party Animal" or "Orgazmo," when it comes to B movies, it was worthwhile to be useful if you were in the same way. <br /> Christian and morally oriented parent groups, this is a soft-core entertainment for adults. If you don't want your children to watch sexual content and nudity, then you should have children out of this movie.
