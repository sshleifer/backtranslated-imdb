This was one of the worst movies I remembered when I saw it. I'm sure I saw worse, even though it eases me. Humor is not funny, there are silly stereotypical jokes that are not funny. I was in captivity on the plane and was watching this movie. It was a complete waste of time. Martin enjoyed in earlier movies, but not this. Same for Queen Latifah, she was excellent in Chicago and she was good in Set It Off, but that role was terrible. <br /> <br /> I usually attribute the failure of a bad script writing. I feel strongly that you cannot maintain a formal, indecent script with decent actors, this film as an example. Yet all participants should be wise enough not to participate in this film. I'm just impressed by the fact that something so bad can get green, produce, release theatrical and promote.
