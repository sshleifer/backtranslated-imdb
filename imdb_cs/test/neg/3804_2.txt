... but besides, this continuation of the original Poseidon Adventure has almost no redeemable social value. Where the hell are all the people of the original, including the rescue crew? Michael Caine has so far undergone his most humiliating performance (though he later rolls with Jaws 4 down the road). Slim Pickens is just embarrassing as stereotypical Texas, and in general you just have to think, "Why did they bother?" I think Irwin Allen's last stab at disaster pay.
