This movie is the worst thing people have ever created. Do you think manos is the worst movie ever? That wasn't even close to the garbage. I don't even know where to start. "Russian" commander and rebel chic are the worst "actors" who have ever appeared in the movie. They make Sister in Troll 2 look like Meryl Streep. The goofy face is elegant as she is in kung fu training to be seen to be believed. Then there is oompa music during a prison break, absolutely out of place of love scene, a silly song that plays during off scene love scenes, fake castro, the fact that everyone has either a headband and / or a scarf on some part of their body when they are filmed screaming scene, and the worst in the world. This film deserves to be more known among fans of bad movies. Definitely the worst movie ever made.
