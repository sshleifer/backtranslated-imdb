I hate movies that happen like this !!!! This 16mm disaster is full of clichés, stereotypical characters, generic, finished "fences" and terrible dialogues. In this "movie" we have an Aggressive Black Guy, The Black Guys Girlfriend, The Blonde Bitch, The Possible Lesbian "Hacker Chick", Pedophile Teachers ... Blah, Blah, Blah .... And then a pumpkin man. <br /> <br /> "Do you think someone takes the legend too far?" This question is asked at the end of the movie. Taking Scream 2 tagline too far. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ***** I usually don't go to the spoiler, but I have to behave… <br /> <br /> Dream? The whole thing was Dream !!!!! This is the most sissified way to end the movie. "I don't know how to explain it all, and we have no more money ... Let's do the whole thing with a dream." That's what the director / producer / actor / FX guy had to think about. Yes, the director is Mr. E's character. What does this have to do with film? Of course, the blacks are killed, the girl is killed, the teacher who has a history of sexual harassment with the students is killed (he is the main suspect) .... YUCK YUCK YUCK !!! This film gave me heartburn. Nonsensical, pointless and made with Visa and Mastercards parents (who tells me it's probably still paid off), this movie is stupid, boring and just plain stupid. ... <br /> <br /> All I liked was credits. The way they presented names, etc., at the beginning and at the end. She had a scary feeling for it. Too bad the movie wasn't! <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
