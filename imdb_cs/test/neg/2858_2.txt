I was really disappointed when I saw Pinocchio's Vengeance in the evening. I had a good tendency to be bad, but I didn't think it was as bad as it turned out. A wooden puppet of a murdered boy falls into the hands of an eight-year-old daughter attorney. From here it's a murderous way for anyone who gets between a puppet and a little girl. We've seen movies like this, that is, the Child's Play series, which is, by the way, much better. But it was good to see actors like James W. Quinn and Todd Allen. They both worked under Kevin Tenney before. In any case, I invite viewers to try "Night Of The Demons" and the original "Witchboard". These are titles that tend to bring the best in Kevin S. Tenney.
