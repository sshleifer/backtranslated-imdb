This is close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The writer starts with you on the side of Jasper (Josh Hartnett). When nothing went wrong, Sam (Leelee Sobiesky) left him for Kelley (Chris Klein) in a way that lets you get mad at Sam. You're not letting go of what he feels, so her feelings with Kelley are not real for you and their relationship is false. It attracts you in both directions and it is quite exhausting and unpleasant. The only good thing about this movie I saw was cast. <br /> <br />
