Simply put, I was overwhelmingly disappointed. I am a huge fan of Asian horror movies and I can watch unoriginality (I enjoyed "The Red Shoes" and "Phone"), but that was just bad. <br /> <br /> The film has a lot of elements that are very good: the photo is interesting, the visuals are cool, the direction is inspired, the acting is pretty good, the music is easy on the ears and CGI is incredible. But because it's a horror movie, we're expected to be scared, which just won't happen to this movie. As with most South Korean horrors, it is almost non-original from start to finish: there is a brand of long-haired, vengeful female ghosts, ominous clusters of dense, black hair and puddles of water and near the end, that is almost *, but not entirely meaningful (Twist is one of the best features). And to the viewer's irritation when the movie is not recycling (sometimes, so accurate it could be easily dubbed plagiarized) images from other movies, it's your jump. Many. And jumps, I don't mean things that jump out or anything, just very loud noises and whistles in the soundtrack to make the audience jump six feet in the air (there's also a few "made-you-jump" moments that are just angry ). And when it's not rip-off from other movies, it's boring and hard to sit. And it is a shame because "Ryeong" could be easy and was really good, and it has everything to do it is good, but its unpleasant overuse of completely predictable loud sounds and a leap of scare that ultimately destroy film. A perfect example of how well it could be: there is a moment when one of the characters looks at the corpse and looks back without sound. It's quite predictable, but the use of silence in this scene is brilliant. And unfortunately, that's how scary the movie got for me. It's true that "Ryeong" has some good features and even a few jumps that aren't as predictable and do the job. There is a very good and sad back-story used to explain the events, and the twist is quite unpredictable. These are the only things that separate the movie from other Asian spirits / horrors. The problem, though, is that, although they have been used, they were used earlier (J-Horror fans will realize that the great revelation was inspired by "The Story of Two Sisters"), and that's in a good story. fifty minutes to go. So finally, "Ryong" really looks like a missed opportunity. Tae-kyeong Kim hoped that conspiracy plots and other good features act as a distraction, so viewers are not aware of the huge drawbacks. But he failed and well ... We noticed everything. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10.
