From the director of Barbet Schroder (Reversal of Fortune), I think I saw it a bit in my Media Studies class, and I met the main actress, so I tried it despite the critic's rating. Essentially, the cool kid Richard Haywood (Ryan Gosling of Nelson) and Justin Pendleton (Michael Pitt of the Bully team) will team up to murder a random girl and be invited to join her without being found by the police. Murder Investigation is a murder detective of Cassie 'Hyena' Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with a new partner, Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is quite confused by the evidence found on the scene, such as unrelated hairs. It seems that the plan is not quite right, because Cassie and Sam have very fast Richard or Justin as suspects, it is just a question of whether they can avert them. Also starring Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. calls like Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. D.A. Al Swanson. I now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's rope with a challenge to challenge, but this movie does it very stupidly, and even a reasonably good Bullock can't save him from being boring and predictable. Sufficient!
