From terrible special effects, I was totally stupid about how someone could shoot. Let's do it this way, I have absolutely no directorial experience at all and for the first time when I watched the movie, I thought "I can do better than that!" while sitting and watching this pap. Playing in this movie was terrible, I suppose the Lawnmower Man boy was the best actor, but the French guy from Aliens3 was so wooden that I got first. The story was mediocre and I suppose that, like most movies, if the rest were done well, he would stand up. I usually do not write reviews here, but after seeing a few people that this movie has done a good review (must be occupied / crewed), I felt I had to say I wanted to save someone from accidentally hiring or wasting money to buy this item . cage.
