There is so much to be about this show is hard to know where to start. Unlikely characters, terrible conspiracy, horrible writing and horrible behavior. Don't let me start with unpleasant music on the subject. In addition, the show is beyond the reach of American viewers due to heavy Canadian links throughout its surroundings. "Oh, tell Derek, you go to Queens College in the fall! How are you beans? We should go." Granted that other shows are filmed in Canada for financial reasons, such as Stargate: Atlantis, but while these shows may have suffered some annoyance (like Rodney's call to ZPM and "Zed-PM") did not do Focus on life in Canada. MTV runs Degrassi (another show based on the experience of a Canadian teenager) during the daytime, when no one is watching to fill the time (most teens are in school when they broadcast). I bet it's for the same reason. Exhibitions that focus on life in adolescence in Canada do not translate well into the US audience. <br /> <br /> This show should be canceled and the remaining masters fired in the oven.
