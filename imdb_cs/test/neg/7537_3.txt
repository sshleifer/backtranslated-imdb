Two teenagers in the northeast of England are desperate to raise money and buy season tickets for their favorite football team. They go through a series of "comedic disasters" but they smile in the end. The trailer for this film sells it as a comedy and contains most of its light moments. But the tone is still somewhat grim and the end result is a depressing story addressed by familiar stereotypes. Two "heroes" have no problems with lying, cheating and theft. Their opponents are a heartless teacher, a pantomime father's thief, a psychotic skinhead, and a well-intentioned but incompetent social worker. Other female characters are a drug addict, a pregnant schoolgirl, and a battered woman who seems to be smoking herself. There are no sympathetic characters and the audience can only feel compassion or contempt. Local actors Tim Healy and Kevin Whateley both play as baddies, but the writing and direction of their characters are so one-dimensional that they have nothing but newness. Chris Beattie and Greg McLane are performing well in two young leaders. But they are wrong because they have a bad accent. For anyone in the northeast, it is clear that they are both from Sunderland / Durham, and yet we are expected to believe they are Newcastle native. As Geordie, I can assure you that the accents are by no means the same. Take the phrase "Let the poor man speak". We call "Let pooa lad speek" while they call "piwer lad spiek", with two distinctly different vowel sounds. This discrepancy creates an absurd double irony in the scene of the Sunderland football field, where two boys try to disguise the Newcastle accents they don't have and pretend to come from Sunderland - which they do. In mild comedy, this kind of criticism could be considered a nit-picking. However, the bleak tone of the film makes it clear that writer / director Mark Herman is striving for bold realism: that is, "close enough" is actually a journey away. In this film, I hoped for humor and optimism, and instead found a tired old cliche. Tyneside is not a gray wasteland inhabited only by losers, and when he tells us he is, Herman should have known he would cause insult. It is interesting to compare the film with the same director "Little Voice" - also largely positive and inhabited by one-dimensional characters, "Little Voice" has at least a talented heroine and is not used to the same extent in poverty. I heard "Belter" was placed next to this year's "Billy Elliot", but the movie is much more fun and life-confirming. By the way, maybe I'm too old, but I lived on Tyneside for 42 years, I've never heard anyone use the term "Purely Belter" outside this movie.
