This film sucked badly, I couldn't even watch the end. Milo's voice was too low and I couldn't understand what he said, as did some of Kendra's lines. Where did you get all these wedding dresses; it was very impractical. The film failed to elaborate on Milo's drowning and how it made people ridicule Dr. Jetera and his practice. Overall, I was disappointed that I was unable to give this movie a zero rating, because by classifying this film as one, I felt I was giving him an undeserved praise.
