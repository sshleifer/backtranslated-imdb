While the film's premise sounded unique and interesting after watching the first 5 minutes of the movie I could stop there, and continued my life. He has some interesting comments and reactions from his subjects, but not enough to add to the validity of the film. I also felt that she was going a little overboard with many things. If someone had said a dirty note, grabbed her, or made a disgusting gesture, I'd say I'm on it, bring him down, he's a pig. But what bothered me was that she would go in revealing clothes and be surprised if the boys were looking at her and giving them hell. I think she somehow forgot she was attracted to other people. human sexuality and much of who we are all. Boys will watch beautiful women, especially when they dress provocatively, just as women will look at men when they have a fixed tank or no shirt at all. Some women may hate me for it, but I hope not. I respect women very much. I was raised by one. I also come from a Spanish family and we are very matriarchal. My grandmother was the center of my family this year, but I don't really feel that it would help women's rights and some women offended her project from what she said.
