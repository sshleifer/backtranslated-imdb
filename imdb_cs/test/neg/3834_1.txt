I think it's two years ago I saw a movie and it's still the worst movie I've ever seen. All I thought after seeing this movie was that it was for some tax reason. So all the time I finally spilled my gut;) And now IMDb says I need to fill out 10 lines with comments: <br /> <br /> "Sorry, you must include at least 10 lines in your comment. (or use the BACK option if it's not a new window). <br /> <br /> Please don't say anything ... <br /> <br /> Sorry for some bad English.
