I don't want to mess it up. Although you might care less if it is spoiled (you'll know what I mean when you look at it). Movie quality with B. Typical horror situation - rare timing. I should know when trying to promote a lot of humbug or even "quotes" in their advertising. She just tells me the movie was bombing big time. And they're trying to pull everyone up so they can break into the cost of producing this bomb. I wish I took the time I spent watching. I was stupid and I thought there must be something big around the corner. But I let go. I usually don't waste time adding comments to a movie. In fact, it's my second place. I felt I could spare some of you to lose money on something that had a lot of hype on it.
