A dark but witty story involving a policeman who has first-hand experience with vampires and decides to leave his job to watch these evil beings. Most of the film contained controversial actions, conspiracies, props, and filming. Combat scenes were like hokey as a rendition of the Battle of World War II. The lines were spoken as if the actors were not motivated to be there. The props were bad because they didn't even look the least. Most of the movie seemed to be filmed in some basement (in some scenes you can see rafters in a scene that shouldn't look like a basement). The storyline had no incentive to move forward or backward, seemingly sometimes standing without any reason for some character actions. I felt at times that the sound effects were for this horror-type genre and more cartoon series. It is similar to Blade, in that it is an African American vampire hunter. However, this is where all the similarities end up, and the movie looks closer to Saturday Night Live spoof.
