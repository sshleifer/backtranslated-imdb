I saw this movie when it premiered in LA. I think I laughed two or three times. The rest of the time I was shocked how ridiculous / badly filmed and misspelled it was. In fact, Kirby is the only saving grace in the film. I was disappointed with the performance of Larry Bagby I usually enjoy. If you like watching your boyfriend's crappy home short movies that shot at their mom's 8mm camcorder then there's a little chance that you could enjoy this movie. Then again part of what makes these movies nice is that it's your buddies playing all the parts. You don't know these people, so you'd be as boring and stupid as I am. Dear Mr. Nelson, Go back to the film school, be a PA for a while, or get some low-level work to see how things are done in the movie. Then look at how long you need to find a photo director who knows what to stop funds, make sure he has an ND filter on his hand. Then try again. Repeat as many times as you need.
