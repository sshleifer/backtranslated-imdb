Altman is very proud of the fact that people talk to each other in their films because, as he says, people do it in life. Well, people also cough, stumble, go to the tangent, etc. The point is that because people are doing something, it's not a convincing cinema. That's one problem. The bigger the problem is that it just isn't very clever or direct or hitting or relevant satire, in 1988 or 2004. Garry Trudeau still lives in the sixties and thinks everyone except a small core of Republican elected officials is a 1960s hippie liberal. I mean, the kid still tears Zonker in his belt - a character who is a complete anachronism, but Trudeau still employs him, as if representing a large strip of American youth. <br /> <br /> wrong. I'm conservative, but I'm not saying it's bad because it has a liberal bend. It could go liberal and be funny and relevant, but it is not so. Above all, it is the vanity of a piece with a number of prominent liberals (including the ugly, repulsive Ron Reagan, Jr.). Sometimes it seems to be unencrypted, and the rest of the time has a snarled air of self-confidence and "we are not oh-so-smart?" - ness. Someone said this show insisted on having cult consequences. I think his cult status is more than real. I'm sure there are two or three people who have recorded all the original episodes in 1988 and still have them, but if it's standard, then every show that has been broadcast is to some extent a cult classic. If Tanner had no names for Altman and Trudeau, it would be another forgotten HBO production from the 1980s. Instead, it is presented as a tough, piercing political commentary from the guys who are at the top of their game. But the reality is as far away as possible. Presidential satire Pat Paulsen is more important than ever Tanner was, and he is dead for ten years.
