This film and the first AvP film both around the Strangers and predator franchises. These are horrible movies, poorly-designed, poorly written, and terribly directed. Some seem desperate to make money from the reputation of the original extraterrestrials and predator films, but instead of providing thoughtful and quality production, they have come up with a prediction. The original Alien / Aliens / Predator / Predator 2 movies were great, redefining the horror / thriller genre by inventing these crazy (and yet believable) creatures that stood up as the "serial killer" on difference from man. These movies are just milking the franchise and do nothing but darken its name. Aliens vs. Predator's comics were brilliant and had a great story. They were faithful to the mythology of Alien / Predator, did not confuse all the original stories, etc. Why didn't they make comics into a big movie? Because Hollywood is idiots, that's why.
