Oh, dear! That must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's incredibly repetitive; Every scene seems to consist of people who are shot, run screaming, or kicked in the face, which quickly becomes very boring. I wouldn't mind if the fight was good, but it's not; the main character Phillips shifts the various goons through with ridiculous ease, and no matter how often he stands in full view of the Tracker, he never gets hit, though extras and tiny characters are shot and blown around him. I have rarely seen a worse cast of actors (especially Don Wilson, if you can even say "actor"), but this is not really surprising given the dialogue he has to work with (sample line "Computers killed my brother!" is a sub-par ripoff of excellent Terminator; special effects are ridiculous.
