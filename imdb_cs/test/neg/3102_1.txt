I saw this movie some time ago because some of my friends wanted to rent it, and I voted down. I tried as best I could get the story because some moviemag said it would be a movie that would be for Rob Lowe, that Pulp Fiction was for John Travolta ... Well, we can all see that not only has he failed but I fell all the way down. This is actually the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
