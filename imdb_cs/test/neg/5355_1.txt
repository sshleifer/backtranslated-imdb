This is the worst kind of movie. The story is ridiculous, characters are unrealistic stereotypes that never seem to believe it themselves. Are white people such monsters to call two white child violent boys at the age of twenty, and to convince them that this could be a reason for provocation? Are Blacks Inspiring? Does the Ku Klux Klan really stand outside the courtroom where he shoots lawyers and no one interferes? Do the judges really think that a fair trial can be done when a jury can hear the crowd outside and shout "Kill him"? Are the Blacks really standing side by side with the Clan waiting to hear the verdict? Really does a wife really take months to realize that their husband could defend a man from an unfair suspension because he knew he could do the same? Indeed, the jury really does release people from the murder because they are sorry? Did lawyers really use the defense of reason to persuade people that their client was temporarily insane? The worst of all was that all these principles of this film were lost in the utterly exploitative and unjustified use of sexual crime, so that these viewers would titilize. Was he the subject of rape, let alone rape of gang children, really in competent hands? Is it really an object that belongs to Hollywood hands? And if so, why is it absolutely gratuitous kidnapping and undressing of Sandra Bullock? And absolutely unnecessary legal rape against one of the witnesses? It seems that the director did not feel that sex crime was of great interest to everyone. This was a great conspiracy To Kill Mockingbird and made it crack, shallow, tasteless. Shame on them.
