To avoid boredom during "Love and Sex", I initially tried to think of all the movies that were related to: "Breaking Up" with Russell Crow and Salma Hayek (although it had a more original ending), "About Last Night" with Rob Low and a lot of TV shows. "The second was to admire how beautiful Framke Janssen is, so I couldn't believe a nanosecond that she might have a problem getting the date. Roberts puts it for money, literally - and wasn't Julia in any movie with this conspiracy or other? The third tried to find out why the writer / director bothered to give Jon Favreau the character of Adam Levy's Jewish name, even admiringly admiring eating a ham sandwich. Fourthly, they tried to find out why some critics provided this good review and that's why I was in the theater. <br /> <br /> (9/2/2000)
