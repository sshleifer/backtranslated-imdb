This is another of those movies that I remember when I was a kid, and recently I managed to get it from eBay - 20 years, it's not nearly as good as I remember it is. The story is "vaguely" launched, "a cosmic event" (there's another crew member in credits for "weak story development") that makes collective ants super intelligent. The types of ants who fought together stopped competing and were now working together. The things I wanted to know were, TEMPORARY? You'll never find out what they want. Nigel Davenport and his sidekick travel to the desert, where the bizarre activity of ants has been recorded, and they are beginning to study ants from an impregnable igloo lab. Probably the coolest scene in my opinion was when two scientists visited a giant square in crops (like a square version of a circular pattern), which is the result of the ants who gave up. This movie wasn't very scary simply because you don't know whether to fear ants or like them. All you know is that ants want people to leave the area to get their hijinks - but you won't find out if they're really bad. It is not science fiction because the explanation of "cosmic event" is too vague to be properly taken into account. It's a more cooler deffo. TBH flares, daft hairstyles, tight shirts with big collars and Nigel Davenports unnaturally large facial hair-made me more than ants! Did you notice that only six players are listed in credits? Yeah, right - SIX, and you won't see any other human beings in this movie. Not in the distance! This is obviously a low-budget movie that is a bit observable because you probably haven't seen it. I can't think anyway. The filming of the ants is pretty good, they had to make months and months of shooting before they shot the movie. Can you say how ants do it? over and over, but it's pretty simple. You'll also notice that filmmakers have sacrificed millions of innocent ants to do the movie, so animal rights are watching STAY AWAY! Good for the novelty, but you don't have to look more than once.
