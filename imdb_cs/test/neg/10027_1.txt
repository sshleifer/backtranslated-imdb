Even the lowered standards of the 80s slasher movies, this stinks. The usual flock of oversized teenagers is heading for a "forbidden" part of the forest that burned out in the 1940s and apparently left a single angry survivor. Fast forward (in fact, you'll want fast-forward through much of this mess) to the present day, where a few campers are defeated; Teens follow in their wake, while the semi-rarity of the ranger park (sleepwalker Jackie Coogan) and his healthier cohorts (who revolves much of the time to tune his banjo) succeed partially in managing our attention from the run-of-the-foot cushions of natural tracks. Finally, more killings - but nothing you've seen before. If you want to see children who are defeated, make a decision for the SLEEPAWAY CAMP or the first FRIDAY 13TH.
