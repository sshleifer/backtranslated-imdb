OMG, another bad film by Larry Buchanan. The guy didn't learn to quit, did he? First of all, it gives us zero-budget sci-fi movies and lies about famous dead people and now uses the Loch Ness Monster as bad. The "storyline" is basically about some of the US residents pretending to be Scottish camping in Loch Ness. Unfortunately, out on the fishing holes, oops, I mean Loch Ness Lake, there's a killer inflatable monster that clams Nessie, going out of his way to kill people for no apparent reason. I'm surprised the MST3K crew never heard of this movie. Yes, it's too bad.
