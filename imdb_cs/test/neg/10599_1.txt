I heard people say, but I ignored them. Being rushed to the blockbuster I grabbed a copy of this movie and ran out. <br /> <br /> 45 minutes to fight I stayed awake. There is some attempt to keep the film interesting, but it was just bad. There's a chase of some kind, but it was long and pulled out - the perfect time for refreshments. At the time this movie was over, I didn't care how it ended, I just wanted it to end. Walk in and out of my room to check if it was over. The whole film is clich√©s, characters and their relationships. Plots are predictable as well as end. Actors made the best of really terrible roles. Everything can be said: their clothes were nice, but the movie was just bad.
