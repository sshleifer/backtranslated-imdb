The film started o.k. A couple of tourists on vacation in Mexico have a good time to decide that they should go on a trip. They reveal some hidden paths and end and this huge temple as a fortress. Angry villagers are emerging and trying to discourage them from climbing, but because of the language barrier, people are shot and tourists end up being stupid. It turned out that plants are bad blood-thirsty things that villagers won't go near, so protecting the temple so tourists can't get off. There's a couple of scares in this movie, but nothing really makes sense. I mean, they're PLANTS! Do not bother buying or renting d.v.d. Wait for the cable to come out.
