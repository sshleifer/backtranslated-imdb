Another Sam's son is definitely not an Oscar winner. It's technically terrible. Neither is the negotiations too good. But there's something that makes you watch more (like a car wreck). Ridiculous shots from the eyes of the murderers are more funny than anything else. If you're looking for fear ... this isn't a swing for you. It's very dark and almost impossible to find. I'm sure there's a reason for that. For a while it was called HOSTAGE. No matter what you say, it's still a bad choice for fun. This can be good for MST3000 party or something. Can you believe they would use that title as OTHER SON from SAM? If it's not exploited everywhere, I'm wearing a hat. I remember when it was shot in Belmont, NC. Many local personalities have been used as talent.
