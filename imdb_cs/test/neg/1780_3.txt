Some giant scorpions are on the submarine and kill everyone. Two months later, some Marines and scientists in charge of a scorpion project go to the workshop to get their cargo. After finding 200 dead bodies, the naval commander tells the doctor, "I need to know if there's something that could be dangerous to my men." Uh, gee ... yeah? He refuses to tell him what's down there with reference to "need to know". Yeah, that's pretty good. One of the scientists is probably an idiot savior - a real heavy idiot, a light on a savanna. He got the job of repairing the lights. He finds the control panel for lights, cuts the wire and shouts like a banshee. Then he does it again. Then he takes the hammer and breaks the control panel into pieces, causing all the lights on the submarine to work. And so it goes. Apparently it was in Sweden; I'm not sure if the Swedes really have a strange peculiar sense of humor or if they're really horrible filmmakers. I tend to think they're horrible filmmakers. If you thought there was a huge explosion at the end of the thing, we're sorry, but that's a need to know, so I can't tell you. <br /> <br /> If you absolutely see a giant scorpion movie, let me suggest Tail Sting, which is a cheesy and funny movie about scorpions on the plane, or Bugs, which is a fairly descending B movie about scorpions in the tunnel. Check out this movie as a last resort. Oh, it's trackable, it's hard to turn it off just because it's totally insane, but that's about it all going.
