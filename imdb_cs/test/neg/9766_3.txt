I don't care what anyone says, this movie is merry! It combines bleak gravity of Threads with an anarchic mix of alternative comedy, and the results are terribly dark, but incredibly humorous satires on the brinkmanship policy of both the Western and Eastern Bloc at the time. You must give the filmmakers credit for trying to overcome the real life of "Duck and Cover" or "Protect and Survive"! Imagine if someone shot a movie based on the song Dead Kennedys' Kinky Sex Makes a Round of the World, and you're close to Whoops! Apocalypse. Add Rik Mayall to the top form as a crazy OTT SAS commander and you have it exactly. Good side piece to Dr Strangelove and it says something.
