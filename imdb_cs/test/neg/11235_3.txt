So when Bob and Marion Boxletter see a guy in a hotel, Marion believes she is her long-lost brother Brian, but when she approaches him, she seems to be someone else with exactly the same face. Marion manages to get his fingerprints and takes them to the police and confirms that he was in fact her brother Brian, who goes to New York with Bob after tracking his whereabouts. Brian succeeds, but he still doesn't know what he is talking about, but all the husbands really want to know where Brian has Joey's eight-year-old son ... and even if he doesn't even know Joey. The story gets stronger and finds itself one day when they think they are someone else. Human experiments just make perfect killers still a question of why they would bother giving Bob and Marion in the same building as each other is behind me. Personally Gregory Harrison played his two parts great, but I have no idea what happened to other actors, they seemed bored and lost. 3 out of 10, a little tension yes, but that's it.
