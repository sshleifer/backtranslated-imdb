Over the years I've seen many movies and I'm a big comedy fan. But this so-called comedy has almost limited me to tears. This is undoubtedly the WORST movie I've ever witnessed, the worst. I remember hearing about this movie from a friend, and decided to look at it. If I could, I could go back. I will regret as long as I live, the time I spent watching this waste. The storyline is so crazy; It makes no sense at all and leaves you confused. There is a Scottish crowd and a German headhunter who are following Pestario 'Pest' Vargas (John Leguizamo), a Scottish crowd of $ 50,000 dollars and Germans over his head. Trying to escape Pest, he has many disguises. But in doing so, we are witnessing the worst, worst, insensitive behavior, dialogue and sounds in the cinema history. This film was so troubling for me; I was full of aggression by the end. I was so angry that I wasted so much time watching a movie that would certainly move people depressed to an almost certain suicide. I mean, how can hope be when a movie like this can be granted permission? I know people have their own opinions, but the most shocking thing they do about The Pest is that people like it. Why? What's funny about a man who is uncomfortable from the first second to the last? A man who cannot act? Who has an unpleasant voice and a confusing face? I sat by thinking that the movie would be better, it would be. No. You usually want to survive a good guy, but I wanted the Germans or the Scottish crowd to find and kill Pesta, which would take me out of my misery. There is nothing funny, interesting or normal that happens in this movie, it's just annoying and confusing. Jokes are dead before they are told. I'm sorry about the cameramen who don't talk about how the movie is made, but they have to shoot the movie. I would not be surprised if they were given advice. <br /> <br /> If you want to stay healthy and part of society, my advice is to never watch this movie. I'd rather lock up for 5 weeks in my room and have to go without food and water than watch this movie! I don't think I ever hate anything more than this.
