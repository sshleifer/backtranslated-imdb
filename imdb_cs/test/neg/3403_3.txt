The first movie I saw from these people was "Children of the Grave" and when I heard this one coming, I thought it would be good to watch mainly because Waverly is a real place to say it's scary. . This document / film was AWFUL! Producers, directors, cameramen were too false comments. Waverly was said to have been haunted for a long time, but if anyone doubts that this film is watching, they will no doubt start believing that every story about this place is fake like this documentary. Paranormal evidence was terrible and almost non-existent. I've heard better EVP from high school students with tape recorders in the bathroom! They were trying too hard to make frightening things and the end result was that nothing was scary. No stories, not blurry too dark to see anything video, not pictures, not recording tapes! Grave children were also bad, but at least it had some substance and a little creep factor. The only reason I give it is 3 because part of the show was very good and informative. Learning about how the hospital came into being, everyday life and how it ended was the only thing that was worth it in this 2-hour crap.
