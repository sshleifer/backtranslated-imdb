Here in Australia the night at Rodanthe is supported in the same class as the Notebook. Honestly, what a lot of rot. This film is similar to a recipe. We have all the right ingredients on paper ... Richard Gere is normally perfect in this genre, old favorite Diane Lane from "Under the Tuscan Sun" and "Unfaithful", an ocean side location, loneliness and yet angry movie. At the meeting we went to yesterday afternoon the women next to my wife fell asleep and in the middle of the movie they rose and left! The main problem is that, first and foremost, there is neither building nor trusting the relationship. And maybe there are too many long faces and overclocking if you like the stories Gere and Lane bring to the movie. There are hours of those who are aligned with maybe 5 minutes of what we can see ... romance! Gere's character is not warm, Lane looks terrible at the beginning of the movie, and they all wash out. So as a viewer, we can't really connect with characters. Others here say the book is great. Whether it is a script, a directing or a production that someone has created. It's like scenes and buildups are stacks of cards, except they're in the right order in which they were just thrown all over the place. Very unsatisfactory ... save money when it turns out on video stores and even then wait for a good deal when it goes to a weekly course.
