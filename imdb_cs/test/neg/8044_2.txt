Poorly executed political action. Poorly photographed, acted and directed. Each individual scene is backlit, including the very few that are taken during the day. No matter where it is. At the important White House conference, no lights are lit and the only available lighting is the grim blue that is filtered by several windows. First-class China is conducting a telephone conversation under the conditions of such an intense chiaroscura that it should consider Homer's bust in Rembrandt's painting. Honest. It is as if he had a small spotlight on his face and was otherwise in complete darkness. The death of slow motion is now mandatory in any poorly thought out movie. Roy Scheider and Maria Conchita Alonzo play their part, but Scheider is rarely on screen. Other performances are denied. There is a pretty oriental woman in a short tight skirt that totes a gun and is straight from the Bond movie, which is an accent indicating childhood spent in Basset, Nebraska, and who should remain a model that probably began as. Whoever plays a surviving intelligence agent on board the cruise ship was probably picked up for that part because he looked like Johnny Depp, not for some talent. Chinese villains, representing both Taiwan and mainland China, hiss and smile as they threaten heroes. The script is pretty awful, recycled from other, better movies. There's a lot of gunfire aboard, and virtually everybody is running down the ground. Two-thirds of the way, the ship explodes into the expected series of fireballs. Then the movie is divided into two related parts. First part, another shootout, this time in the waterfront warehouse. The second part, the exchange between the vice president, now president, and the greasy Chinese premiere, won both "Dr. Strangel" and "Fail Safe". We unknowingly launch rockets. They initiate their revenge. We can't convince them that our start was random, even though we offer to help them destroy their own missiles. There is even George C. Scott / Walter Matthau general who argues that their "nuclear" armory cannot match ours, so we should intervene them with everything we have. More fireballs. The end isn't too early.
