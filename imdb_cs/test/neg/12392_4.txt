Grosse Pointe Blank was indeed a below-average film. His hit person theme is very dry and is more like a romantic comedy than the hit man thriller. Behavior is very normal. The performances are very embarrassing at a time when many characters appear to be "eccentric" and that upset me. All reunion and "Wow, I haven't seen you in 10 years!" the element is extremely curvy and many scenes only drag on, especially closer to the end when they are at the actual reunion party and the characters go through each of their former classmates one by one greeting them. It all looked very cheap, unnecessary and wrong. The role of Dan Akroyd as a "rival" killer is very rare. It seems to appear only once at the very beginning and at the very end of the final show, which is tremendously praised but not at all. The soundtrack is also very average. Most of the songs that are in this movie are straight from the eighties and with the exception of two or three, they are very bad. Hearing duff songs through a pretty duff film just adds to the negativity that surrounds this movie. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on how small things were annoying and were very bad, like very few action sequences that came and went very fast, lack of character development and how bad the whole thing was built in this department, so that half of the time has forgotten that Cusaka's character is a human hit, because the element is so non-existent. Even comedy thinks it's funny; but it is not. I wasn't allowed to laugh during this film. Sure, maybe I sneered again and again, but my only REAL felt good when I realized that the movie was almost over! Don't waste your time with "Grosse Pointe Blank" despite the relatively high (but incorrectly) IMDb rating. I've seen movies that are better than this movie that have lower ratings on this site that will tell you that there are better movies out there. Don't worry about this.
