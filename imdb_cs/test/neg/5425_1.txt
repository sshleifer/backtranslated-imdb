I can't say I was surprised at this cruelty when I watched it a few months or weeks ago (I can't remember). I saw it as a two-part episode of Zoey 101 because that's how they showed it here in Canada. I was incredibly upset about the Makeover and Nerd thing, it's just an example of how unacceptable, invaluable, superficial, negative, biased and stereotyped people in the entertainment industry are, and frankly, I'm extremely persistent. It wasn't funny at all. Nerd is a stereotype and makes people very offended. Second, people in Zoey 101 don't have any real problems. Logan has a big house, has a famous father, has everything and Zoey is also rich. They will never have to deal with things that tweens and teens have to deal with, such as peer pressure and stereotypical problems. Also, the actors are scary. Jamie Lynn Spears doesn't deserve to be as successful in a TV show as Zoey 101 (what's wrong in the world?), Has no talent as an actor. In fact, she's worse than Britney! Chase and Zoey were incredibly predictable, I mean, how could a show go with Zoey and Chase? What other problems could they have? Except Chase doesn't get the girl she wants, everything is perfect! The absolute worse 48 minutes of my television are watching life. At all. 0/10 (and that is generous)
