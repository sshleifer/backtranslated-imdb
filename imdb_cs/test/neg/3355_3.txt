I really tried, but this movie didn't work for me. The action scenes were boring, the acting was surprisingly poor, and some of these characters were stereotyped to be even funny. Pam Grier is trying, but when you have nothing to do with her, even her considerable talent cannot prevent the disaster. Even according to the standards of this weak genre, this film is pretty bad.
