Undoubtedly, at least among the Spaghetti Westerns I have watched recently: basically the low-front tearing of Leone's GOOD, WONDERFUL AND UGLY (1966) with three disparate characters who have crossed each other (and sometimes created a shaky alliance) in search of hidden gold. Leonard Maltin rated him as a BOMB; While it is harmless, it is also absolutely routine, and the three main roles are stereotypes, ie, uninteresting: Eddie Byrnes is a bank employee with ideas about transporting a shipment by train; Gilbert Roland is a "legendary" but aging Mexican bandit (his frequent outages to Spanish when they are excited are quite sinister!), Which is still irresistible to women; George Hilton as a mysterious bounty hunter is trying to emulate too much Clint Eastwood's Man With No Name. Director Castellari - whom I saw in a retrospective of the Italian B-film, which took place during the Venice Film Festival in 2004, where he came as the most versatile representative of cult film directors! - shows little true feeling for the Western (on the strength of the two above-average efforts of Franco Nero in the genre, I ordered his collaboration with Castellari KEOMA [1976] ... now I keep my fingers crossed!) and the film's approach to language is equally passionate.
