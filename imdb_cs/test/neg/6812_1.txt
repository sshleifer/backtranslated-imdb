Have you ever had one of those nights when you couldn't sleep and just turned on the tube to see what was going on? So I ran through this trio. For myself, I would be better served throwing and rotating for 97 minutes I was wasting with this movie. In his attempt to "be real", this character film looks like such gangsta stereotypes that the story was supposed to be a prerequisite for the Wayan brothers' film. Dialogue? Please! It sounded like a white man trying to write this movie too. The edit was terrible. One of my "favorite" scenes included chasing down narrow streets. Cut to the characters who are being chased, and yet they are driving through the park with baseball fields in the background. <br /> <br /> When one of our "homies" appears in this film, it miraculously bleeds through clothes that have no holes, which is more than I can say about the conspiracy of this predictable load. India movies can be great even if they have low budget and effects, but still have some film integrity. If I could give 0, I would. If you look at it, I hope it's on the cable, because even the cheapest rental would be too valid. In fact, 97 minutes was too much to pay ...
