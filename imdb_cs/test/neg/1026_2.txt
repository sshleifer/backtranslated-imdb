Although there is very little conspiracy, and everything that exists is just improvisational, it was still a good start from a new director with no previous financial advances and a clever move from Andy Warhol to make his cimematical productions more marketable and audience friendly. Anyway, this story of a street cheater relies too much on Joe Buck naked (almost all the time!). And the creative use of the opulent edition really wears out after a hundred hours and the secession of the dialogue is really annoying. That would be much more fun, or even dramatic, if they were to create a documentary about a real male prostitute or cheater instead of letting the actors create some meaningless conspiracy and dialogue.
