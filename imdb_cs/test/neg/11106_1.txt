Horrible Script, which was apparently controlled ... nobody? Marines can not fend off a monster with machine guns, but it retreats when a 15 year old karate girl kicks the face several times. It's supposed to be a luxury steamer, but Fancy Dining Room looks like a hospital cafe. Looks like they rented high school for the summer and pulled out chairs and things to decorate the set. Eventually they are withdrawn from the water and into the ship, and for about 3 seconds later they are probably about two miles from the ship sinking. I think there may be someone in the movie these days. Aaron James, NYC
