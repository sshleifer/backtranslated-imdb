I had very high hopes for a walk in this movie. After all, Ocean's 11 was a really cool Hollywood product. His quick fire jokes, incredible star power, and a tight script made him one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. Of course, with all the money he did, the sequel was on the way and I was excited. Needless to say, I was completely blown away by this film. He blew away how bad things could go. This film had everything for him; the return of the entire original cast, same director, news about crazy on-and off-set antiquities. How could it be so bad? It starts immediately with one of the most unpleasant and unnecessary opening sequences and goes down the hill. After reasonably wacky short scenes between Pitt / Zeta-Jones and Clooney / Roberts, the film spent a few minutes watching Andy Garcia's waltz from the scene, telling every single member of the original eleventh edition of Danny Ocean that he wanted his money back. Believe me, when I say these scenes are here just to run Andy Garcia, because without these ridiculously unpleasant shots, his screen time would be WELL in five minutes. This leads me to another great qualification I had with this movie. Stimulation is so uneven that characters are completely dropped from the story and sometimes brought back. The character of Bernie Mac is dropped from the script and never returns, except for two short scenes without dialogue. Garcia appears for a few minutes and returns to an extremely short scene at the end. Roberts appears at the beginning for about 5 minutes and is not mentioned once until 20-25 minutes remain. Even Clooney himself spends a large piece of film in prison. That would be excusable if the movie was fun. At all. 90% of the jokes will fall completely and those who work will be at best laughing. "Storyline" is undeniably worthless and left me feeling cheating. At one point in the film, the team takes a job worth $ 2.5 million out of nearly $ 100 million they need to raise before Garcia's two-week deadline. Several characters even recognize how absurd to waste time on this job, but they do it anyway! More than 30 minutes of film revolve around this work that they shouldn't even do, and one feels that this part of the conspiracy has simply been added to run time. In addition, the equipment they use to pull this work off CLEARLY costs millions of millions to fund. Just wait until you see what they're doing to get this job out and realize it would cost much more than $ 2.5 million. Obviously, they have to pull a few jobs to make money. The beauty of the first film was one big con, and how sophisticated and complicated it was. There are so many jobs here in so many ways that all of them are in a hurry because they explain to them that it would make the movie a few hours long. there will be a big twist at the end. Thus, it is the character of the hood film. Turning at the end of the Twelve Oceans made me laugh; not because it was funny, but because I couldn't believe how cheated I was. I will not give up because I know that most of you will be stupid enough to throw away the money to see this movie anyway. <br /> <br /> What I say is that it does most of the 2 hours you sat down completely irrelevant. I was excited to see this movie, after the totally adoring Ocean's 11. I left the theatrical feeling that I was the victim of a really big account that I stretched out and the crew of this movie in trick me to think that this movie would actually be worth watching. I've never put 1 on a movie on IMDb.com, but there's a first time for everything. Consider that you warned .... 1/10
