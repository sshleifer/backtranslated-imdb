In addition to commenting on the technical advantages of production or its lack of action, the action is terrible. What is really scary about this movie is that I actually owned a copy, of course it was in the shop and was renamed "Dark Harvest 2", and after seeing it, I understand why it was in the bargain. - They should pay me for taking it out of their inventory. Most of the movie, if you want to call it, spends a frantic father running along the cornfield of a maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something will happen to them. I think the camera the girls played at the beginning of the movie was probably one of the production cameras for this fiasco. In the maze she plunges into the spirit of some children who are poorly made, and the film is terrifying to the south. I see why they renamed this movie, otherwise they would never get rid of them. Absolutely one of the worst movies I've ever had to sit on, and it's not worth the $ 2 I spent on it.
