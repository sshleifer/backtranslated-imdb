Few videos in recent history have been made so amateurly as this - at least none that such a reputable distributor would release. Each film of this film is plaguerism of better films of the past. The word 'clich√©' is given a new meaning by a talented writer / director who should set aside his imagination for minor masturbation efforts that do not threaten film viewers. Helping the Amateur Night 'Horror' Effort is a series of less than capable technicians who contribute poor cinematography and laughter makeup and special effects. Unfortunately, one or two of the amateur actors in the film show a hint of talent that will go unnoticed because of the rumor that it will produce this atrocity.
