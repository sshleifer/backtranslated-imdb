Anatomy was a German movie and subtitles. It was also too long and boring. If it was to be a horror movie, it failed miserably for me. Actors went through their steps to look more like they wanted to be somewhere else. the movie's work was fine, but more attention should be used to the terrible trivial script. \ tI didn't pay anything to see the video and still feel cheated.
