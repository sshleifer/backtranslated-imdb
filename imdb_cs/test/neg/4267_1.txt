I find the criticism of many IMDb users a bit cruel and in many cases I find that they criticize the film from a very professional point of view and not from who would like to sit back and watch something that GET AWAY should see. However, in this case, I must say that it was BAD. I'm a SciFi addict and there was nothing in this movie that caught me for another second. There was no proper story. I can be an idiot, but I still don't know where GOVERNMENT was so worried about these pieces. Poor attempt by the main character to put these 3 pieces together is scary. Half the time was already in place and he just had to add a third. A 3-year-old could put them together. This movie was BAD. Dominic
