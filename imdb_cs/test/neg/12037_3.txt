Some movies you watch and say, "Well, it didn't make sense." And you really don't. You say things were too complicated or slightly absurd. <br /> <br /> "Bread and Circus" makes no sense. And I mean it. And that's not because it's unreal. It's quite clear from the beginning that it's a weak excuse for spraying special effects. There is no scenario. There is no conspiracy. There is no story of any kind. One event does not lead to another - this is how crucial the bad writing is here. <br /> <br /> So what? I think there are TONY movies that fall into this category. They want to show you gore, they'll give you gore. Why talk about it? Because, in this case, "Bread and Circus" gave me hope. Okay, there are some surreal elements. Vagins in the country - people are climbing. Earth, in space, two legs on both sides. These pictures are wonderful, funny, weird, crazy. But the film doesn't do anything about them. Stuff is happening, the movie is over and it's all very unsatisfactory. I suspect the script was built in flight. Very bad. If there was any kind of story, it would be for a much more fun movie. <br /> <br /> The movie is very similar to a beautiful car you'd like to own. Then lift the hood and there is no engine. Just the little man who goes through the bike. GRR!
