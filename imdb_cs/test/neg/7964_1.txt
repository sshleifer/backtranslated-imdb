I don't like Cary Grant, but I noticed his performances that this is enough of the movies I noticed; this one, Arsenic & Old Lace and Bringing Baby. I don't like the northwest in the north, but the movie seems unbearably stupid. Besides, I found endless waving about Grant's tiring class. I have no idea what his class is doing to the audience who pass it on. That means nothing to me. Behind the scenes, which is part of this DVD, Patrcia Hitchcock says Grant was her favorite lead man; I think he was wrong. Jimmy Stewart was a better lead man in the Hitchcock chain of better films. With his ruined end, it's really half of the movie and it's not a discussion and can't support a high rating. Even if the movie ended intact, there's not much. Fontaine is absolutely unsympathetic crazy. They must remain insensitive, inactive, and reluctant to contact anyone other than Johnny for the whole film, whether at the end or for his tricks to work. There's not much work to do. Cary Grant begins every line with "Monkeyface ..." until I want to strangle him. It says about sixty times. It's a positive grate. The snag technique is shockingly shallow. The infinite sequence of rooms / files has a false skylight projected on the back wall as a web effect. And a bulb in a glass of milk can inspire fans, but it can't save a movie that was wrongly made. DVD. I think it's his whole career. As soon as I saw him, I thought it was an imitation that only he was impressed with. Instead, there were two! oh joy!
