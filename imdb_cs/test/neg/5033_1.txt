I turned it off within the first five minutes. It's very sick and disturbing, when I turned it off, it was when a beautiful white horse was released to the slaughterhouse and his skull was pierced by a small tubular instrument. This creature lay on the floor in a shocked state before she died. The narrator said the animal would die immediately, no. I disagree with graphic realism against animals, insects, or living creatures. I was very disappointed when I was just watching 'Eyes Without a Face', which was a great movie and this short movie was chained, which ruined my night - because I couldn't hurt the fly, I don't mind watching this wild documentary. /> <br /> Reading other reviews on this page, I noticed that they use words like aesthetics - it's not art or beauty. I can imagine the document being very articular and deep, but not aesthetic.
