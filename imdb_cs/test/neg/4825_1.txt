I think this program is a lot of waste. All they do is argue and walk over the face and say this acting?! These people are paid a lot of money for it and most of them can't even save lives. Also the story lines are horrible and after a few minutes I get bored. I like the way Harry Hill takes mickey from his TV show 'TV Burp', for example, a weak joke "Princess and Pea isn't exactly Shakespeare is it?" who had Sonia and Naomi in a stitch. I don't see how funny it is. I think it's a waste of money for everyone for their TV license, so it can be viewed 4/5 days a week. Isn't there anything better than this?
