The comments left for this show are much more fun than the show itself and are all accurate. I feel exactly the same way that I am very disappointed at how far Rick Mercer has fallen when he did some really great things at this hour he has 22 minutes, but now he is just a clown around, going to places and talking to people. He's doing some pieces in the studio about things that happen in the news, but they're not funny at all, just really sad and predictable jokes about headlines. Most of his shows are going to talk to people somewhere, for example this week he is going to rodeo and video pieces are all who make funny faces and are afraid of wild horses etc. He used to be funny, but since this hour has 22 minutes, this journey has become less fun and this show is no longer entertaining. Now that Air Farce is out of the air (finally thank God!) Mercer and this hour has 22 minutes to be next in line for an ax, just old tired predictable comedy that almost no one will find anything funny any more. It's really sad because Rick Mercer was the funniest man on Canadian TV!
