Most of the positive comments posted here are just like the movie! It takes long-lasting boredom to appreciate the daring and boring film. Some have only called the film "contemplative", meaning slow and plain plot, however, one Dutch reviewer came upon a nail on his head: this is an important event turned into a boring movie whose tone is set in the first scene. Here is a young couple showing an apartment realtor who, predictably, speaks non-stop and no matter what's happening. So every other character does it! The only silence in this picture is the dreams of a 1930s propagation of Soviet propaganda - and it's also the most interesting part of it. This will tell you something about how the rest of the movie is observable. <br /> <br /> The equipment for shooting most scenes in extreme detail - as if looking through the cracks in the blinds - aging fast.
