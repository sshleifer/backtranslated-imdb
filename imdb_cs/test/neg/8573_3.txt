I thought this movie would be completely different than just another teen-slasher. Well, I was absolutely wrong. The toilet is a liquid nun and something really special. I know Spanish culture is a bit different and their movies too, but I didn't expect to see a fake Hollywood movie. But certainly fake false. Why did they make a film without any new aspects? This is simply boring, and it was done absolutely without any imagination. <br /> <br /> I thought having a nun as bad in a movie would be something really original. It turned out to be a teen slasher. If it was ten years ago, that would be something new. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone but it certainly has some comedic value! It's like a horror parody on some points.
