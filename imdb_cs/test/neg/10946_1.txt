This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life! I lose time. I was looking at this movie completely as I took the penalty for me. I wonder how Suneel Darshan could make such a movie? it has no continuity. He feels that he just shoots the scenes and then joins them in some editing software !!! Of course, music is good, but the film doesn't need so many unwanted songs. Kangana Ranaut looks fake and I wonder what role Celina has in the movie? Bobby deol is good. at least he can act! Upen Patel needs to take a few game lessons to take off his shirts in almost every scene! The end was most pathetic! I watched Shakalaka Boom Boom after watching "300" (movie), you can really imagine what I felt about this bollywood movie. <br /> <br /> I really respect bollywood, but please directors and producers, get right, not everything is fantasy!
