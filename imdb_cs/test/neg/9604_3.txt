OK! Sci-fi / horror / action B-hybrid directed by Jim Wynorsky and in the final stages we will see a metal-headed cyborg killing more people! As with any other Wynorski-flick, it throws a number of crazy ideas and subplots that don't usually go anywhere. But "Storm Trooper" is more like two movies - at one price. On the one hand, we got a drama / thriller section (as such a movie opens) with Carol Alt killing her incredibly annoying & ungrateful husband (a plot that just leads to nothing). On the other hand, we got a "leaked cyborg" in a "furious" place. With Carol and Cyborg there are those who are trapped inside the house and a lot of special OPs / bounty hunters who play the role of zombies and try to break into the house. Needless to say, this film is not there with the biggest. Zach Galligan (from "Gremlins" -fame) is particularly painfully bad and Corey Feldman (in a small support role) is once again completely unnecessary on this movie. Wynorski even jerks one of his own movies here, because I'm 99% sure he used some of the footage of his previous movie "976 Evil II" (a scene with an exploding truck and a motorcycle). Yes, it's not that good and so fun. That's just for Wynorski fans. And I'm one of them, in case you don't know.
