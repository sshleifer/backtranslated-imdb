I watched this movie about six years ago and recently I did it again. If I remember correctly, I didn't like it at all and I appreciated it a little more the second time. This movie is probably on a big budget. The effects are mostly high-end (except for one or two "impacts") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show. First, who decided that Peter Stormare should act as a crazy Russian astronaut should be fired. Being a Swede and a fan of Peter, I'm sure he can play the Russian character well. But his performance in this case is simple stupid, both with regard to the uttered lines and with acting. So ... something must be against the script. I would rather see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut. Second, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it's almost unbearable to watch. It's a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes and has too few moments to catch your breath. In addition, the events that are developing are simply not credible. I would like to see a much more sensible and deprived version of this part of the film. And finally, scenes that include flying shuttles are too action-packed. Space shuttles maneuver as if it were several MIGs, at zero safety distance, while reflecting ice blocks like ping-pong balls. The director should watch Apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecraft like these. <br /> <br /> I like music scores because it's dramatic to the point of being very moving. The overall performance of the actors is great. In addition to the above, the story is interesting and easy to follow. With some minor changes, this would be 8/10 of the movie. I'm sorry, no!
