All the dogs go to heaven was an unpredictable, fun movie; With a good name, a talent that lent voices to adult familiarity with the caricature for children. It was interesting enough to be adults away from something good to look at. Unfortunately, ADGTH2 is an impeccable sequel trying to make a little cash on the first coat. Charlie Sheen is a viable replacement for Burt Reynolds in this second film and Sheena Easton's voice in several movies that are beautiful but unforgettable songs, making it a useful tip. Add Dom DeLuis from the first movie and you think it would be a decent mix to make this sequel at least quite decent compared to the first. Unfortunately, even with other good actors such as Bebe Neuwirth in the terrible role of Anabelle, this film cannot be saved from ominous production values ​​and animation skills (or lack) present all over this film. The terrible cuts, the syncronization of voices, and the space where the characters' mouths should be, should not be combined to make this film a college animation project instead of a decent sequel that might be. <br /> <Br /> All in all, if you weren't a big fan of the first movie I'd give this big PASS.
