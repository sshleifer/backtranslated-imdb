I never read the book. I don't want to. I had no idea what the movie was about when I walked into the theater. I still don't know what it meant, but I know that I have two hours left of my life. I will never return two rare hours. The story was so predictable, it's ridiculous. Werewolves ... or something ... a very conspiracy like Romeo and Juliet. Within five minutes, I predicted the movie. And I was right. Acting is not terrible. The only two cool characters in the film were a British cousin and a Rambo-graphic novel duder. Other characters are too ... dialogue is very weak and predictable. The absolute worst part of the film is the transformation between "people" and "wolves". If you want to kick something like Van Helsings, you'll be really upset. Imagine a ballerina, a bright light, then a wolf. Yeah ... that's about it. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Time. Especially when you read a book because you just want to beat kids.
