This film is a totally inaccurate representation of the true story of Noah's Ark, and the producers probably didn't even read the Bible. This is the worst movie I've ever seen! Noah's wife was never mentioned in the Bible by name, but the film's writers gave her the name Naamah. This film captures the destruction of Sodom for a good 1000 years before it happened, and what about Gamorrah? It was also destroyed at the same time Sodom was. (Perhaps the producers thought they did not include Gamorrah in the story and show the city "Sodom" as in you - you know what would raise more eyebrows.) This film is utterly filthy and taunts God and the Bible. It is a miracle that every true Christian would like to participate in the creation of this abysmal, hideous, falsified ridicule of the Bible.
