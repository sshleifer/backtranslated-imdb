Barney is the idiotic dinosaur who (unhappily) has not disappeared with other dinosaurs many years ago. Instead, he sings silly songs and has stupid morals about life that are 100% worthless and / or extremely dangerous: that is "STRANGERS ARE YOUR FRIENDS YOU ARE NOT METAT!". The reason I say he's bad? Well, on YouTube there is a video from the song Barney about toys. When it is played back, it assumes that "ALL I AM YOU HANG YOU! STAB THE KNOCKERS!". Do not believe me? You see it yourself! I also read for another review that are now reading PC folklore and fairy tales. Now it's just stupid with a big S! Really! Incidentally, I do not recommend letting your children watch this dirt because it contains stupid morals as foreigners are your friends (as mentioned earlier), there is never a reason to be sad and if you are sad to eat junk food, it is individual. Taboo, magic can solve all your problems and piles of other ridiculous crap.
