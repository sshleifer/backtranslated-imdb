Let's do one thing: I like a lot of Snipes work. Unlike his other contemporaries (Seagal and Van Damme), he can actually act. However, this film has little to do with his reputation; It is not exactly unnoticeable - but I am in no hurry to watch it again. In fact, if I had never seen it before, I wouldn't mind - there are plenty of better movies to waste on me! It's a shame, because with a little imagination and minor changes it could have been a useful film. Instead, the director decided to almost try his audience to undergo too much violence and very little characterization. The biggest problem is Snipes' co-star, Silvia Colloca. I regret that the producers of this film went into all the harassment of hiring a wonderful beautiful (for my money as well) and talented actresses like Miss Colloca and then give her such a pathetic one-dimensional character to play. If she was hired to add some "grace" to the movie, she wouldn't do it; there is no nudity in the movie and no sex scene worth mentioning. Really special. Given the amount of violence in this film, it confused me why manufacturers took such a conservative attitude towards sex and nudity. Do we live in 2007 or in 1957? What producers of this waste (and probably the actors, too) have forgotten is that the films are supposed to be fantasies. Like most people on this planet, my real life is very boring. I'd like to be persecuted by terrorists, I was able to handle myself as Mr. Snipes and connect with a beautiful young thing like Miss Colloca. This film doesn't suit any of these fantasies very well. Which is exactly why I'm such a bad review!
