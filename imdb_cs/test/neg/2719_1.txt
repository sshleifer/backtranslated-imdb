Radio is perhaps one of the best movies I've ever seen and one of the worst. That made me laugh in the places you were supposed to cry, and made me cringe when you were supposed to laugh. it lacked any kind of character development that is usually crucial to the sentimental movement that is it. Some questions why Ed Harris's character accepts the radio under his wing, it was not properly explained, and I'm sure their relationship (which is the main aspect of the film) is the most useless, if ever seen. Who still gives Cuba Gooding a junior job is a bullshit and should be heavily taunted until the next job starts. As real stories, it's not that interesting. The reason why I said it's one of the best movies I've ever seen is because, despite being a complete pap, I still enjoyed it. Laughing at the script, and most monologues who are really working either an idiot or someone very clever trying to show how easy it is to release a lousy movie about a retard that becomes everyones favorite joke. The fact is that the character of Cuba is a comedic feed for people watching football matches.
