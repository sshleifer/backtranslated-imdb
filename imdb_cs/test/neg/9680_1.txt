I think Hollywood should seriously consider never again making another "biblical" film if Noah's Ark is the norm. In addition to the horrific, totally uninitiated games of the entire cast (Voight and Steenburgen undoubtedly on the day they agreed to this film), the timeline was completely rearranged. I also missed a part in Genesis about a pirate fight aboard the Ark or a wandering merchant who came on his boat. Hi? Everyone else was dead, with the exception of Noah and his family. God stacked lumber and added plans to build the ark when Noah questioned how? I also do not remember that I am anything about how Noah's wife kept pestering him in 40 days, or Noah wandered through his glass eyes and constantly dazed. Apparently the screenwriter had very little knowledge of Genesis, or he just didn't care that his story's abomination was totally ridiculed.
