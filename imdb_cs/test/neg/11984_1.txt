Unfortunately, this film lives up to about 1% of the humbug that the game created in 2004 and leaves a very sour taste in the mouth. For video game enthusiasts, book worms and movie fans, there is nothing more than a disappointment that a film that is based on an original concept (whether on paper or a game console) that it does not deliver. And not only does it go well under the brand. The Far Cry video game released in 2004 created such a cult following that making a movie out of content should be easy and dozens of players flock to film. If you are a player who played Far Cry; don't watch this movie. Everyone who didn't play the game; It will still look like a B grade played / B grade driven movie. Uwe Boll, hang your head in shame ... this would be easy to make a blockbuster. The storyline was incredible (I think Jurassic Park will meet with Alien) and yet you managed to take it and form your own terrible recreation of instant classics. Video game companies should be warned - if Uwe Boll comes to knockin ', lock the door. Oh & Til Schweiger ... I look forward to coming up with Inglourious Basterds. What did you think you took? Sigh.
