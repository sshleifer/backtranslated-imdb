You got it from usenet, so I wasn't ready for a difficult (and I mean extremely difficult) religious theme. Not that I'm one of Satan's disciples or anything, but it was very hard. It could be because they had to get good little boys to play bad little boys, but it didn't work. <br /> <br /> There was some pretty cool filmmaking involved, so any fan of the director's style might want to check it's done, but you can be prepared using the fast forward buttons. The cut was a bit sloppy. In particular, the Black Mustang (probably a representation of Satan?) Squares off against a white 240Z. The wheel rotates, the camera changes, and knows that the white 240Z is transmograted into a white Civic. <br /> <br /> I gave up early so I can't guarantee her moral impact. However, I would like to point out that this kind of film preaching to the church is preaching. If the director / writer / producer tried to bring religion to unwashed masses of street pedaling, it went wrong. I think I'd rather watch a commercial adult diaper than listen to the angry Bible that would look at us. Yawning. <br /> <br />
