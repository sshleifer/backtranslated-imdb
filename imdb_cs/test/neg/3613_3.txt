I'm not going to vote this movie as terrible, mainly because I'm glad I was one of those summer days that I was so lame doing anything and decided to rent a movie in a silly part of the video story. Except I haven't slept at night and the movie woke me up ... Let's start the autopsy, OK, the movie has a strange story, the first is isolation, there's an expedition, the island's isolated because there's no gas on the ship, something like that on gaming part (not yet) is not the only convincing performance, the main problem begins after isolation, POV snake, then another, then another, then it changes, then a false specter, a lot of them, and when we think the movie goes on a good way to hold on to the tensions will not succeed, because after ten or eleven ghosts, we will not go away, one scene that completely reveals everything is the scene where we are seeing a drunk lesbian show watched by snakes who seem to dance after it is Not a horror adventure, but a comedy driven movie, the adventure part is also discarded. /> <br /> For me the problem in the film is the third act, it is just one section that just drives the movie for the already estimated conclusion, or if it does, we didn't notice it as a ninja smoke in our eyes, well .... Snake Island has a bad conclusion, it all comes down to "by the book" The end, with confrontation, persecution and escape sequence, it was predictable the moment I rented a copy of the dam. Another real problem is the concept, the concept is very important, it is why you believe that dinosaurs come to life or corpses full of stitches they want to live, the main concept of snakes who want revenge for decades of human torture. civilization, well ... hmmm, just no glue on the wall. One thing you will like (if you look at it with an open mind) is more sequences of bz, naked lesbian girls, some amateur camera angles, braindead with grass cutter, black dude doesn't die first and that's all ... If you want to see snakes, black dudes and comedies and prefer bigger budgets, go to "snakes on the plane". <br /> <br /> Hasta viewers
