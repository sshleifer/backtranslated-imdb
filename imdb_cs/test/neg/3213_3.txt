Clever marketeer is him, Jess Franco naturally also earned a huge temporary success of psychedelic spy movies, such as the sensational "Mario: Bava!" Franco is the ideal man to shoot a similar film because he could freely put as many sleaze, kitschy scenes and absurdly grotesque conspiracies as he wanted. And partly he understood it very well because the "Girl of Rio" revolves on a man-hating organization led by a funky-dressed lesbian trying to turn all people into obedient slaves! Unfortunately (at least for them), the devil's plans clash with the daily business of George Sanders, the dreaded chief of the crime syndicate. All the right ingredients are well presented, yet it is a surprisingly weak and unsatisfactory adventure film. The plot is rich in imagination, but apparently only on paper, because the action is pretty tame. The film is also very colorful ... but not very clear and especially shocking was the total lack of bad sex. A little nudity, certainly, but too little according to the normal Franco standards. All characters are sick in the head, so the least I expected (or hoped) were more perverted tones or crazy topics. Apparently, Franco had a larger budget than usual to work with, and I must say that he spends this money well on more convincing sets and gifted members. Especially veteran actor George Sanders ("Village of the Damned", "Psychomania") is one of the best players ever to appear in Franco's production. Too bad he can't save the "Rio girl" from a huge downturn. Legendary film director Euro-smut like Jess Franco could and should have done more with this concept. Shame, shame, shame ...
