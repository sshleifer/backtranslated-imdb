I'm in two minds about FOLLOWING, Christopher Nolan's film debut. Part admires me for costing $ 6,000, but some hate me for being too much an art house. In many ways, it reminds me of the iconic PI film, a film that I don't like, and I can't get my head around the central plot of a man who wants to be a writer around people. Wouldn't it be more logical if someone wanted to be a writer sitting in front of a keyboard and writing? Well, I think FOLLOWING gives indie filmmakers hope that just because they made no movie budget worth $ 6,000 over two thousand IMDB members will vote for it and more than five hundred members will comment, but I have to wonder if this movie would be so well-regarded if it wasn't created by director of MEMENTO?
