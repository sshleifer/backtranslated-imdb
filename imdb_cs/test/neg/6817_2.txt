PDQ Bach did it better. Much of "Bach" is the talking part of the letters written to various patrons complaining about the amount and speed of his payment. The diary of Anna Magdalena, mostly about the death of children and other family affairs, is more committed to iota. Music is disturbing: the chapels of 17th century orchestras and choirs producing the sound of the 20th century concert hall. The overall quality of production reminded me of a junior presentation. J S Bach was a great man whose music speaks for itself. This movie doesn't add anything. Netflix sent me 2 disks that wouldn't play, so I filmed the movie. Netflix was trying to tell me something.
