Have you ever tried some food your friend did, and then he said, "Wow, it wasn't a good mix"? This is how I felt after watching this movie. Many viewers will be very uncomfortable with this strange mix of crimes and very, very handy comedy. It's almost like watching Mr. Rogers play a ruthless gangster, very special. Some things just don't mix and this film clearly proves it. Here are some very good performances as Dean Stockwell, Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are excellent, but it doesn't do for lack of balance and symmetry in the movie. Jonathan Demme has done an excellent job in movies like Silence Lambs and Philadelphia, but he seems to be out of his element with this.
