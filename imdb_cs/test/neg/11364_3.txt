Obvious Cash-in on * Embed Monster Here * On Airplane Trick, Flight Of The Living Dead is about what you would expect it to be. The movie has little or no plot, which is what you would expect from a movie of this type. Although it's fun in the works, I have to say. The Zombie Action is especially fun. Once the film rises, it never stops; stimulation is fixed. Practical special effects are pretty good, but CGI is terrible and distracting. <br /> <br /> It seems that the end of the movie leaves the film open. Let's hope it doesn't come. <br /> <br /> If you're a zombie fan of sub-genre horror movies, I would recommend it to you; worth at least one watch. However, if you're just a passionate fan of the genre, leave it on the shelf. <br /> <br /> 3/10
