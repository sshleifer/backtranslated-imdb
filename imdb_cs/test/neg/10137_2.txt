My parents can look forward to this show, but I can't find humor in it. What is so funny that a dental husband impregnates his assistant hygienist and the eldest daughter who is impregnated by a high school football team captain? Absolutely nothing! Sometimes it is a shock that people think is humor nowadays. The blame for bringing the issue of sex to the forefront in the mid-1960s at shows like "The Dating Game" and "The Newlywed Game". Sure, the series has its moving moments, it's still not an excuse for content that otherwise went into this series. It's not like family days "I Love Lucy" about five decades before. The answer would have to be why this series plays on the Lifetime cable channel because brass thinks women can relate to Reba! I absolutely don't like the character of Reby Hart's daughter, Kyra. She is best described as a ditsy and bitter teenager! Funny, I wonder if the actress who played Kyra; As in real life, Scarlett Pomers is far from playing. Who's playing the former spy dentist, Christopher Rich, isn't much better. Barbara Jean, played by Melissa Peterman, is in herself! Van and Cheyenne are also very unpleasant. Something else that regrets me is why the dingbat-of-a-series creator, Allison M. Gibson, has decided to set up a series where I live 25 miles from; Houston, Texas! Reba McEntire isn't even out of this state, he's Oklahoman! Why is it during one season or more that they have decided that random music will sound like pig sniffing? What I mean is that we hear this baritone saxophone playing with the drums that accompany it, but the melodies are basically hopeless!
