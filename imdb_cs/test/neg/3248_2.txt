Well, I'd give it 1, but I'll give her two because I was laughing while watching this movie ... First, I can do a much better movie than this one ... in a week. The special effects of this film looked like a joke. One should not make such films with horrible special effects, because then people will not take it seriously. Behavior and direction were also terrible. The script had many conspiracies and the whole movie was not believable at all. It must be the worst Indian movie ever. The songs were also bad. Negotiations were wrong and artificial. I need to say more. Don't watch this movie unless you're wondering how bad it is. That's why I watched it. I'm going to the movie and I wanted to see how bad the film can get. Trust me, I've watched one of the worst movies in history, if not the worst movie.
