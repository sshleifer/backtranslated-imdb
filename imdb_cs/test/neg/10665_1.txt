Agree this movie is well shot, but it just doesn't make sense and no use when it comes to how 2 hours seem like 3 just through a little love story, it could be an episode of bold and beautiful or oc, in short, please do not look at this movie because there is a song every 5 minutes, just to wake you from sleep, I gave this movie 1/10 the cause that was the lowest and not it is not entirely based on a real story more than half of it is made up. I repeat the direction of the photo is 7 or 8 out of 10, but the movie is just a little too much, the actor's nasal voice just want me to go blow my nose. no no.
