I work in a video store, so I saw this for free thanksgiving, I paid for my review to be less forgiving. Well, the main idea of ​​the movie (weird) takes a bloody vengeance) it's not all original, there are several parallels to "carrie" (playing an average practical joke on a loser, except one pretty girl who is she is actually sorry for the tamaras and bears a bad family background). I still think it's a fun idea for a kitschy teen horror flick unfortunately didn't take the power to exploit the potentials that are here and rather emphasize all the bad things. what worked: I liked the actress who played tamar. She looked great (when she was hot) and her cat lines were fun ("Sean can't come to the phone. It's f ** king patrick!"). what didn't work: the whole thing wicca was stupid. In general, I prefer a rational explanation (she could take the whole thing with her teacher or one of the boys to avenge her). there was a lot of logical units and gore looked really bad (when the boy is cutting his ear and his tongue-please !!!) <br /> <br /> the whole idea wasn't tied to the Oscar buzz, but I think unnecessarily comic and thrilling the potential they had. it was bearable, but far from good!
