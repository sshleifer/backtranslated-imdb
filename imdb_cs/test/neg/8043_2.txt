Ugh. This film has so many incredible plot conspiracies that have done what might have been a good movie into a nasty mess. The story is one and a half times, but the holes in the plot make it literally ridiculous. We should believe that the secret service will go against all common sense and allow the President of the United States to be exposed to incredible risk. If this is a hint of what they thought was good judgment among the president's protectors, then we're all in trouble. Roy Scheider has shown himself in good performance as president, but is unfortunately compensated for by the really outrageous actions of Patrick Muldoon (who somehow gets a job in Hollywood just because of his good looks and his miraculous smile to grin at every opportunity, regardless of whether the script requires a smirk). Maybe someone will see it and be inspired to make a good movie out of the movie - or, maybe someone will see it and say, "Hey, if they can get this bad movie, maybe even me!"
