Shooting is perfect, acting is pretty good, but in virtually all other departments, the Greek tycoon is grim. The film is inspired by the real love affair of Jackie Kennedy and Aristotle Onassis and is a shiny but totally empty soap opera of this kind that is on TV all day. Viewers who accept the whole "celebrity magazine culture" (photos of paparazzi and slanderous stories about the rich and famous) will undoubtedly find many that could bring them appetite. But those who prefer films with a little essence and craft and unpredictability will find a 107-minute run with a blunt slogan. US President James Cassidy (James Franciscus) and his beautiful wife Liz (Jacqueline) Bisset are in Greece on official business. The ridiculously rich Greek ship magnate, Theo Tomasis (Anthony Quinn), catches a glance at Liz at a party in his elegant estate. Despite the fact that they are both married to someone else, there is an immediate attraction between them. Later, at a private party aboard his yacht, Tomasis makes his desires known to Liz. Some time later, President Cassidy is murdered while out walking on the beach. Liz is shocked and sad by his death, but it is not long before he seeks comfort in the arms of his Greek lover Tomasis. In the end, two of them are married and their love affair becomes a favorite place for speaking world newspapers, magazines, photographers and wagons. It is somewhat amusing to note the vigor with which the producers of this film have denied that it was the dramatization of Kennedy Onassis' story. They wanted the film to be seen as an original story rooted in fiction. But anyone with a brain sees where the film draws its inspiration. Even Aristotle Onassis himself knew that the Greek Tycoon was equal to his love life, which received Hollywood treatment (if rumors were to be believed, he was actually in the approval of Anthony Quinn for the role of Tomasis!). for this type of movie? is more suitable for action feeds like The Guns of Navarone and Ice Cold at Alexi? but negotiate with uninspired, professional adequacy. Quinn is very attentive as Tomasis; Bisset looks like the object of his desire; Franciscus uses his jagged smile and facade of integrity to make him a trustworthy politician. Their performances are good on the surface, but there are few actors to play at any deeper level. Tony Richmond's photographs give the film an elegant surface gloss as it moves from one exotic location to another, but the most beautiful scratches prove nothing behind the shiny exterior of the film.
