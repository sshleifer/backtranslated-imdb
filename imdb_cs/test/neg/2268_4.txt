The Shaws can have a good story, but the director is completely talentless. He doesn't know when to stop. When the story calls people to act confused, there are ten minutes of scenes of people mimicking the act of confusion. When the story calls for a small history history, there is a ten minute scene of Konkan Green. When the story calls for a boy who throws bouts of horror ... you get an idea. <br /> <br /> Not to mention extreme details so you can count people's nasal hair. There are movies that should be seen on the big screen, this movie should be seen on the 13 "TV. Also Amruta Subhash, who plays Asavari is the worst actress I've seen in quite a long time. years to accomplish what she does so effortlessly. <br /> <br /> I give it 4/10 just because the subject is different, and the story is not bad. The Oscars tell stories not about the state of Indian film, but about the state of Indian court commissions, the film is not good just because its subject is art.
