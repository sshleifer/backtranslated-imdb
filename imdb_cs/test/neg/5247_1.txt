"Beowulf" is like a very bad game: no characters, no story, no real dialogue, no bad fighting ... It's probably the worst movie in the history of the movie. It's a deadly boredom, a waste of time. I'm really sorry about Christophe Lambert, who obviously doesn't know how to choose a role. If someone suggests that you see "Beowulf", believe me: go crazy.
