Everything in this movie is bad, bad, bad. Take, for example, Mike Myers. He has reached the point where you realize that his shtick has not changed since his SNL days, more than ten years ago. He's doing the same jokes and the same voices. His cat is painfully indecent. He's trying hard. It's a strange A-type comic, not a great cat to be. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The kits are incredibly ugly - and clearly waste millions of dollars. (Cardboard cutouts for background buildings would be more meaningful than building a whole neighborhood and a main street.) Alec Balwin tries to make a funny big Santini impression, but in the end he looks and sounds incoherent. There is one more moment that is suitable for inns, with fake Paris Hilton celebrities - that keeps in mind simply because it is supposed to be the story of Dr. Seusse. Avoid this movie at all costs, people. It's not even an interesting train wreck. (I hope they will do Horton, who hears who is with Robin Williams. Then we will have a bad Seussian movie star-save-comedy trilogy.)
