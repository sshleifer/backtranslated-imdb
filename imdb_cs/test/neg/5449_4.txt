Congo is another multi-million adaptation of Crichton's works. Like Jurassic Park, The Lost World, Sphere, etc., the film has raped a book of true meaning and substance. I'll do it briefly and get to the point. The landscape is beautiful. Actors, well is the best they can do. Screenplay? Try overloading hundreds of pages in an hour and a half of a movie. Finally, you get a mess, but how nice the mess that counts and Congo falls somewhere below it. There were some silly moments why the murderer gorillas decided to jump into the lava? Amy, raised by people, surrounded by people, but can they scare dozens of monkey monsters around her? What is the distortion of common sense? Which brings me to that. If an unpleasant character has appeared in every movie, Amy belongs here. See, Amy is this naive little female ape who can talk to a special backpack and harness strapped to her. A pure idea, but after a while she hears her conversation. Congo is worth seeing and not a pitiful but definitely not a memorable movie.
