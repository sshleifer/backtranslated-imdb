"AfterLife" is about a somewhat arrogant, reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and takes care of her sister who has Down's syndrome. She can't bother with her and basically wants to get her out of her hands; He has better things to do. He finds out in one place that he has to take it by car (not like flying) across the country. <br /> <br /> If all the sounds you know are probably because you saw them. Rainman, 'a movie far better than his imitator, `AfterLife'. The fact that it copies the basic assumption (damn, nicknames several characters and even scenes) is not the basic problem of the film. The basic problem is that I didn't care about these characters. Brother, Kenny (Kevin McKidd) is a little groom. She has a girlfriend who comes and goes to the story and who learns as a Down Syndrome nurse (again taken from "Rainman"). He is a journalist and is trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal. When she finishes taking care of Sister Robert, she doesn't have much time for her and sometimes leaves her a little long. When he roams, he becomes even more angry with her. Am I going to spoil anything by saying that she will become a nicer, loving person by the end of the movie? Roberta is not committed to being "normal"; is "normal" and wants people to stop behaving differently. It is played by Paula Sage, an actress who has Down's Syndrome, and her performance is the best on the film; why did the screenwriter not explore her character more? Probably because it means that the characters get in the way of the story. When we definitely know the story, did the filmmakers not see the problem they created? For a movie about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter (my father is absent, I think he's dead, but I'm not sure), it's surprising how little the film has on the viewer's emotions. The scenes are done in a standard, blunt way, with such a standard, predictable dialogue that I find myself in the eyes. I have nothing against sentiment in movies, but it really works only when caring for characters. Here the characters are so uninteresting and two-dimensional that I didn't really think they should care much about them. "Rain Man" has an emotional climax, but it moved me because I took care of the characters. Speaking of peaks, this film has a stinking expression. At the end of the film there is a sequence that begins as an incredible situation and ends in an even worse territory; the audience is playing an incredibly cruel trick. The succession is designed to move the audience, but it ended with a terribly manipulative and insulting viewer's intelligence. Viewers are not stupid and know when the movie is cheating. What a cheap shot. There is no scene in this movie that has an impact. There are several sequences that are funny, yes, but when the characters talk to each other, I can practically see the script in front of me, move predictably and uninterestingly, I never feel anything touching my mind or heart. There are those false arguments that are specifically reserved for movies where the second character knows exactly what the answer is. Why do supposedly "realistic" films do not realize that in real life anger can be irrational, and sometimes people can't express their emotions and can say things that make no sense, or can't say anything at all? All actors in this film deserve better material. This film is not based on reality, but I think a documentary about a family with a Down syndrome member would be more interesting. So we could have the truth and the emotions. For some reason, the characters in this film think that emotion involves only a loud voice and a suitable facial expression. <br /> <br /> ** (of 5)
