This movie was highly recommended, but I'm not sure why. I'm not really a fan of Adam Sandler, unlike 50 First Dates, when he leaves the usual angry man's routine. Damon Wayans is a secret cop and Adam Sandler is the guy he pretended to be friends with him a year ago to break him. Naturally Sandler is rather angry with this betrayal. Cue screamed angrily and silly faces from the king's variety. They end up running and of course they become friends again after a great misunderstanding (including Sandler Shooting Wayans in the Head - he survives so he is Bulletproof). I have to go on? You'll figure out what happens when you watch it anyway. When our DVD player held a break (hey, it was $ 80 from the OK supermarket?) It was noted that the player knew the movie was boring and refused to play.
