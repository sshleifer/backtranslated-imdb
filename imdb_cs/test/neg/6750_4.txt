That was, of course, a low-budget movie. It shows in every scene. What is nice to see is where it was. Much of the film was shot in Columbia, CA, in the Sierra Nevada near Sonory, CA. Any film was also shot in Jamestown, CA, very near Columbia. There is a railway museum in Jamestown and they used some old trains in the picture. "High Noon" was also shot in Jamestown, as was "Back to the Future III".
