Slight spoilers below. The prospect of war was clearly on the horizon when TFW was filmed. From the opening scene of European refugees to the final prediction that Nazism will be the death of millions of Germans, this film is just as propagandistic as the movies after Pearl Harbor. There's not a lot of fun value, even though shots from a dust container are interesting to those of us who aren't old enough to remember. The rest of the land is pretty forgotten with Herr Docktor Coburn - with a pretty bad accent - and the daughter assimilated to America with Wayne's help. In addition to scenes with a dust bowl, the only memorable aspect of the film is one of the best views when looking back. Coburn's speech comparing Nazism with a malignancy worse than cancer and describing (at that time) achievements as a momentary burst of energy from a patient just before death was incredibly accurate and Dr. action. From a historical perspective, some aspects of TFW are interesting. If you look at it for fun outside of World War II, you must say that it is one of Wayne's less successful efforts.
