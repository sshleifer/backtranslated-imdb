Soultaker is basically an older form of Final Destination, in which several cars of wrecked cars have their souls separated from their bodies and have to cheat death that haunts them ... The film has its moments and concepts, the idea of ​​disoriented souls separated from their bodies is quite a clever idea ... If this movie has been reworked with some good actors / actresses and some amazing special effects might prove very awesome ... As for the real movie, I recommend watching MST3K version, the pure version might be too boring than to sit down if you don't love bad movies and staring at Brother Martin Sheen ...
