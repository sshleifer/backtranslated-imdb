A friend invited me to see it in theaters. After half an hour we went out and went to the next multiplex (yeah, we broke the rules) in time to get to the top Against All odds I remember too many great apes dancing around, "oog, oog." Very little about the characters or the introduction to the story was captured by one of us or was even unforgettable. It just went to the point of being painfully boring (and believe me, any excuse was good enough to spend time with this particular friend). Production values ​​were excellent, good photography and lighting, but it was a major studio release, and we came to see the movie, not the art gallery. Ralph Richardson and Andie McDowell seemed to be wasted in such a badly written movie. Maybe when you do the second lesson, there's something worth seeing. I don't have that much patience with my time. 4 out of 10.
