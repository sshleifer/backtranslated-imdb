It has some of the dullest scenes of all time. If I were a veteran of any war, I'd cry if I saw this movie, not because I remembered being in Vietnam, but because it's a bad representation of any war veteran. Even though the M16s are sold, this film is like nothing like Vietnam. Viet Cong even uniforms look like old remaining Japanese uniforms from the Second World War movie. This setting is probably some crappy Hollywood ass. The worst scene includes an American soldier fighting "hand to hand" as in a film about poor martial arts. After sending several enemy troops, he says, "Hey, come here and let your ass kick!" to the helicopter in the air. Then he is shot. This film is waste.
