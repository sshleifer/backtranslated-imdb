Joe Rogan's entire act is profanity laced bile. He is a smoker who entered the Fear Factor and thought it was a joke. He said he would make people eggs because he didn't know how stupid people would be. The producers of the show he explained continued to assume playing jokes on unsuspecting contestants to see how far they would go. The rate of evil is a little twisted. Mr. Rogan is peculiarly filled with the praise of someone who is too good for ordinary human beings. I found out that he was offensive and his talented comedians like Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock could hear things. Rogan even makes five minutes for word N. Overall, ignore this special.
