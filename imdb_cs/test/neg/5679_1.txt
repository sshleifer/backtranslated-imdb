You can't touch the NRFPTP! The new crop is just terrible. Jokes are not funny. Some of the band forces me to stop watching TV together. Lorne - You let your creation go to the bathroom. Guests are sometimes good, bands are mostly garbage. Weekend updates, Seth must tell the audience when they laugh ..... Seth would get the right reception at the Baghdad cafe though ... Make sure Andy goes with him ... The show has about 10 jokes in everyone and they She's just over and over again. Even segments that aren't obviously funny. The perpetrators become the name of the game, but they can't even do it. Just insulting. I'm so disappointed with what happened to the show, but now I also know it's safe to go out on Saturday night!
