this western / musical / comedy is not one of the best genres that i have seen.i found it too slow. simply stretched to the inevitable end.i also found it disjointed.i could not wait until it will be \ t headliner here, and Lloyd Bridges also stars.but for my money money Edgar Buchanan is the best of the bunch .Buchanan has appeared in many westerns in his day, many times providing comic relief as he does in this picture .i also liked Ann Dvorak as Rita .otherwise, though, I can't think of it much to recommend this movie. The film is based on the novel by Ernest Haycock, who also wrote the novel Stagecoach, which was crazy into the movie the same name in 1939, and reworked in 1966 and again in 1986. In 1939, the Stagecoach is in my mind, one of the best movies ever made.anyway.as for Abilene city, my vote is 3/10
