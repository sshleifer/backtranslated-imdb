First, I saw another reviewer that this movie is "fantastic". Well nothing can be further from the truth! This movie is a complete garbage !!! Moronic horror comedy that is not even a little funny !! Don't take that it's so bad that it's good because it's not. It's a total waste of time and money! <br /> <br /> Here's what I see in this DVD waste. A group of friends meet for a weekend, get drunk and then decide to make a video in the garden. They grab my mom and dad's camcorder and start to come on the scene. They all get a big kick from watching as they take a mug for the camera. They stand up if they think it's funny, then everyone will think it's funny. Well, they're wrong. This home video home is garbage. "Acting" and comedic gore effects are lousy, but I think this is to be expected because it is nothing more than a home video. gives hope to anyone who wants to make a film. If these people could make their movie and release it on DVD, then anyone can! <br /> <br /> 0/10 - Save your money.
