Unfortunately, this film is typical for watering a good movie with a series of sequels. Universal made several serial monster films in the 1940s, which were pale imitating the original. Imhotep, an intelligent Egyptologist, has been replaced by Frankenstein, who pulls his leg, into a mummy that shows no sign of intelligent life. This movie is entertaining in spots, but if you saw the Mummy (1932), you will be disappointed.
