OK, please believe me when I say it's a terrible, horrible, sci-fi movie. He has done so badly that most of the film takes place as unintentional surrealism and its 100% loss of time. Terrible, but somehow deeply rude. I looked at it as a dual function with "Recon 2020: The Caprini Massacre" and although "Battlespace" was an incredibly great movie, it doesn't say much. The story "Battlespace" is so completely convoluted that its impossible to follow. The narrative is mysterious, often absurd, seemingly endless and thoroughly exhausting. Virtually half of the film's duplicate scenes of female leadership that look like Brian Bosworth, walking through the desert. The movie actually starts pretty cool, but then nosedives into pooptown and somehow getting worse, one minute by minute. Absolutely terrible and truly absurdistic endurance test. Zero stars. --- | --- Review by Flak Magnet
