The trio of Bill Boyd, Robert Armstrong and James Gleason play the Coney Island carnys competing for the hand of Ginger Rogers, a worker who sells taffy salt water. With the outbreak of the First World War, the trio attended Ginger from a distance. The first half of RKO Pathe's production is tough, with three men leading a chewing scenery with crowded one-liners and an 'elegant' dialogue that quickly grows tedious. The other half focuses on action sequences, as the US Navy monitors both the German business cruiser and the U-boat. These sequences are vivid and well filmed, but overall this is a far too long and unsatisfactory flat-end comedy drama. Only for stars fans.
