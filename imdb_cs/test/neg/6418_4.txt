This unpredictable and traceable film is the story of a deceitful dentist who begins his mission or crusade to fight back caries in and out of his back. The main hero Fergus from Northern Ireland, through New Jersey, sees his crusade as a mission of mass significance and approaches him with all the enthusiasm, vitality, discipline and attention to detail he could expect from a trained dentist. Which contributes to the joy of his great plans falling apart and gradually falling apart as he moves from disaster to debacle in the Patagonian outback on the back of a modified motorcycle or his, mobile, dental unit. We'll never meet his wife or a rich philanthropist who sponsors an unfortunate mission, but we get a solid Lewis demonstration. Fans of his work will not be disappointed by his very believable performance as a deceived dentist who is gallantly adored by an innocent, but sexy, 18-year-old woman who is embarking on a journey * <br /> <br /> why it wasn't dressed. It's a low budget, sometimes a charming, always disarming, slightly entertaining and instantly forgotten movie that comes out with low expectations and almost succeeds.
