****************** SPOILER ******************** SPOILER ********** ********** This movie stunk. Let me now say that I totally agree with what carissaphillips had to say about it. What did Sam think? She was with the guy who told her that he loved her (three times altogether), was EXTREMELY HOT and stuck with her, even though she tried (Josh Hartnett). But she decided to break with him, no, to cheat on him with a snobbish, ugly, spoiled, rich brother who never said he loved her throughout the movie (oh, wait, wrote it on the wall, does it count?), And left it in her time needs because he was scared (Chris LOSER Klein). Who would you like to be? The only reason I was sitting around the movie was that Josh Hartnett was there, hoping he might die at the end. I wanted Jasper to get another girlfriend who was good to him. The whole thing "your mom" was funny. I enjoyed it. I hate it when people say it, but Kelley deserves it. Jasper should tell Sam anyway, she needed a good slap. As romance started, it's a mystery to me. They never said anything like that, so I don't understand how they got together. "I was thinking about the sandwich you gave me ... had mustard or mayonnaise or ..." "What's that." Probably romantic lines were so stupid. Plus it's sosososososososo UGLY! I have to admit I cried in this movie. Long, really hard. Not because she died, but because she broke Jasper's heart. He shouted so many times in this movie ... trying to smile at her, but couldn't stop tears. He shouted when 1) He told her he loved her 2) She got sick 3) Chris Klein came back and saw how happy she was with him 4) She died. I cried when he shouted because he loved her all her life, and told her, and yet she was so stupid she didn't care and didn't love a guy who left her when she needed her, and who are not CRY at the funeral. 1 1/2 stars just because I love JOSH HARTNETT! By the way, Chris Klein, YOUR MOM! -Wiley's sis
