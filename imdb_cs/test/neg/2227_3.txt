In addition to a few good moments of relatively raw violence, this painful film is most impressive with 68 minutes that look like two hours. It starts with an endlessly long introduction where the Leeds family is introduced, including two insufferable tykes and their adult brother and sister, completely clich√©s Pa and Ma, and an incredibly annoying grandfather (played by Charles "Chic" sales) . While sitting for dinner, the family is concerned about the sounds of fire and rushes to the window in time to see two men shot down by gangsters on the street. Gangsters are fleeing the family house, leaving them as witnesses to crime. The rest of the film is Walter Huston as the Crusader DA, sometimes interrupting long anti-corruption manifestations to try to make a half heart. trying to protect the family from the crowd. It all ends up in a predictable way. Good points about the film include a few decent shootings and a really nasty spanking, Nat Pendleton as one of the mafia and gorgeous Sue Blane small as Leeds daughter. If you want to watch Huston play his early trademark crusading lawyer, try the 1932 "Beast of the City." Avoid this, if at all possible.
