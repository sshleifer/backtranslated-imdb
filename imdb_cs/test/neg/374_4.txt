Although the story is good and the picture I was expecting from Sam Elliot my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems. The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the movement of the lips throughout the film. Therefore, I would be very careful when buying any DVD movie without checking the problem. I would also like to follow the recommended censor classifications, especially in relation to the use of languages ​​and drugs. This movie could become a silent classic cop and I can recommend it to potential viewers with the above warning notes.
