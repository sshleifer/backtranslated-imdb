I'm losing words. This movie is out of description. I don't believe there is a language on Earth that could describe how awful this film is. If you try to watch it, make sure to stick around the "surprising end". I only did it about three-quarters of the way through this piece of crap before I could take it. Fortunately (or unfortunately) a few of my friends stayed to the end. When they woke up from their coma and after a few weeks of therapy, they were able to fill me with what I missed. This film has no story, no storyline, horrible writing and even worse playing. If you like watching train wrecks or car crashes, then this movie is for you. I think my IQ has dropped about 30 points from watching it.
