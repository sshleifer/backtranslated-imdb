One of the worst things a film studio can do is use the tragedy of others, commercialize a "shock" or "gore" factor to sell tickets to buy a new Birch diamond necklace. Another worst thing is to totally misrepresent the true facts about the incredible sagas by devising events, dialogues and pictures to the director's own desires. Finally, one of the worst things a film studio can do is use the actors at the bottom and shoot at the soundstage that was rented for fifty cents a day. All these three ways the filmmakers will do are guilty. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen thousands. The score of "1" is too good for this celluloid waste. Not only should the creators be ashamed of doing so, they should be ashamed of the negative exploitation of the heroes of the story, the people who have experienced this tragedy firsthand, both living and dead.
