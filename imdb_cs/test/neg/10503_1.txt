OK, I'm normally fascinated with Z. Some actors, directors, writers, etc. They have pieces of talent in these movies. Unfortunately, they want to get the talent for them, they have to get in touch with miserable people to make their films. But some Z movies have at least one thing that can be remarkable about them. <br /> <br /> Not here. Once I saw it, I thought ... 'Wow, "Blade knock-off." Believe me, if this movie could live up to the label that would make it a better film. Instead, I was exposed to one of the worst games I've ever seen in my life. Master Kao was bad, so bad that I believe some of my neurons in my brain exploded and tried to understand his actions. I'm still trying to understand his explanation and why he would raise his voice by speaking certain words ... adding a dramatic effect I'm sure ... but there was no obvious reason. You just think it's overwhelming. Oh and then there's a black guy in a purple cape near the end of the movie. Purple cape guy struggles with the hero for about 30 seconds, but he's so bad he actually seemed afraid of fighting. The protagonist and the main villain did a decent job. The main character (Derek Washington) actually seemed to know martial arts.
