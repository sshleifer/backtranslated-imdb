My guess would be at least two parts, and at least a quarter longer, otherwise you might explain your confused, shortened storyline. I've never been completely lost, but I've often been partially lost and usually unclear about the motivation of the characters. The film feels as if the conspiracy points have been dropped to force them into their time slot. If it were longer, it might make more sense, but it would still not be very good. The film's most interesting idea is about the war between Zeus and Hera as a war between a man and a woman, but the film is dropping a ball on it, making Hera followers rather horrible without clearing what Zeus followers are doing or believing. The film is also interesting because you don't see gods and there is no real certainty that they exist. So it has a few interesting ideas, but it does nothing with them. Bad dialogue, cardboard figures and one interesting scene including Hercules and his three opponents. It is not unnoticeable, but it is also not worth watching.
