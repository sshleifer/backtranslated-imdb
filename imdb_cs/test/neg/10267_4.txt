When the word "gifts" finds its way into a title preceded by a famous name, the work is usually immediately refusable. For some reason, it seems that people who are able to create good art do not see it in others. But I was always willing to try the second installment of the Demons trilogy. For one thing, the soundtrack is absolutely dead. Most American directors would sacrifice small animals to build a kind of talent on Demon's soundtrack 2. For the next, two words: Asia Argento. (Of course, she was eleven when this film was made, and a few years since her apparent decision that her style after Helen Mirren had created: a steamy look and little clothes.) Lamberto Bava comes from one of the most beautiful Italian dynasties in this strange a horror sub-genre known as Giallo (he is the son of Maria Bava, who in the 1960s made a good genre). And the original Demons are an absolute must see fans of the 1980s B-horror movies. So how can it be, right? Well, bad. Demons continue to attack the Italian media because the film opens in a modern Italian high-rise house where people have television on their background. They all follow a sort of combined intelligence / mater video of some investigative reporters trying to obtain evidence of the events of the first film (which would not seem more than a few days after the first film). Thanks to the usual horror film extra inability to concentrate, reporters can bring a demon to life and he comes across the TV screen to re-launch the plague. Yeah. It's so bad. The only thing that can be said about the film is that the soundtrack (when you don't care about the delicacies of The Smiths, The Cult, Gene Loves Jezebel, etc.) is amazing. Comes from the keyboard of Simon Boswell, who began as part of the Argento dynasty and has since continued to shoot such films as The Lord of Illusions and Hackers. <br /> <br /> Creates half of the free rentals if you plan to drink heavily, but it's definitely nowhere near the original entertainment was. Cronenberg is a wonderfully funny high-rise-ugly-creature creature, Shivers (aka They've Come From Inside) is a lot better.
