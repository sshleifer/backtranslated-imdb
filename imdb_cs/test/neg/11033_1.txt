Avoid this movie if you're looking for fun. It is filled with wannabes trying to be something they are not, and Emraan is just wasting in the role of a guide who falls on a novice who needs to go to an acting school. Seriously, where do these people get from? Just because you don't quite mean that you can act or should be an actress. Asmit Patel needs to send an excuse letter to anyone who accidentally watches that makes a fool alone in this poor apology for the movie. He plays an insipid wannabe gangster who drug girls and makes them fall in love with him and sells them to the top bidder.
