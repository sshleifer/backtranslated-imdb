I got this movie for fifty cents for sale from the store. I want fifty cents back. Bad play, poor script writing, lousy direction, historically inaccurate, even the sound of the movie is terrible. It's not an object that offends. I am one of many who find exciting movies and real criminal movies very interesting. The topic could be treated more seriously, with much more attention to detail and accuracy, and the lack of respect for victims and their devastated friends and family is enough to attack someone. Also, little attention is paid to what might have caused someone to start bizarre behavior that Ed Gein portrayed in dealing with these terrible crimes. <br /> <br /> Save time and common sense. Don't look at this horrible movie. If you bought it, you have my compassion. But it's not a complete waste ... you can discard the disc and use the plastic case!
