I couldn't relate to this movie. I'm surprised that people praise it for being so realistic. How many people in your school were victims of incest? How many were there? How many silent people have you ever noticed committed suicide? Hmmm. OK, you wouldn't know if they were. But in reality, these are explosive problems that many of us never deal with. Yet there are so many teenagers with subtle problems that could be explored. But hey, where's "fun"? As for a girl who committed suicide, I found it exploitative. In fact, I think many high school people feel invisible, ignored, and unwanted at some point. But what does someone have to forcibly commit suicide for the next day, ignored and unnoticed? The creator decided that this girl would be suicide to make the film more provocative. And the graphic nature of suicide to make it even more provocative. I didn't buy it as a real life scenario. And the problems of other students that I did not apply to. Bullying is explored, but it was done by death, we all know that it goes on and it's really a matter of determination inside that person. Cabinet Homosexuality? Pfft, another cliché is rolling out. That's a thing really, too much cliché. I guessed the end at the beginning. Unless it makes sense, unpredictability was predictable. You have all these characters with explosive problems and one obviously none. And I thought, what is the meaning of this character if there is no unsuspecting suicide victim? And certainly enough .. <br /> <br /> One thing I say, and that is the salvation of the film's grace, is that it is not glamourise suicide. Suicide is very graphic and heartbreaking. It's a powerful scene (no matter how imaginative it is) and the one that rejects suicide as an easy option. But the film is really not very imaginative and used stereotypes. Not bad, but definitely not a breakthrough or worthy 17-minute ovation at Cannes ???
