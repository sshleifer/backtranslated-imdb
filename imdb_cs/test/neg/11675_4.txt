My wife and I met a professional production of "Merry Widow" in 1982, but with a direct translation. <br /> <br /> Only the basic skeleton of the original land is visible in this "edit". Most characters have been deleted along with the entire B chart and all but the remaining characters have been renamed. Most of the characters in the movie are not even in the operetta. The action was moved from Paris, first, Washington, DC, and then to the fictional country of Pontevedro, which renamed the movie "Marshovia", and only later to Paris. The net result is that we do not reach the beginning of the original game up to about 45 minutes. <br /> <br /> And the main source of voltage in the graph is also erased. and the heroine was very much in love, but his family refused to allow them to marry, because she was poor, it's his broken heart that made him a careless playboy. He loves, but his pride won't allow him to admit it to anyone, even himself, and she has to spend three actions she thinks. e in love with a rich woman for fear of what people will think that for decades after the "widow" of 1906, major lands of Viennese operettas were delivered. They have never met in this film, which will rip not only the heart of the whole thing, but almost all the comedy. Lamas does a pretty decent job. An interesting musical point is that we will hear a few times "Tr√©s Parisien", another song written (in English, despite the title) for the London premiere, which was not, as far as I know, usually found in American productions until the 1980s.
