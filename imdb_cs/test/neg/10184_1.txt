U.F.O. They are always a nice way to kill some time, so on a rainy Sunday night I picked up this movie, expecting what to expect from direct-to-DVD U.F.O. secret. Boy, I was wrong! Approximately in the middle of the film, it is very clear that U.F.O. the theme is just a deceptive way to attract unsuspecting viewers to this Christian propaganda. And it's not just a Christian movie from an average Christian. No, this is an extremist Christianity fundamentalist kind. A fearsome species. At the end of this film, unbelieving leadership is tricked by colleagues using a practical joke when they think that Rapture has started (which, according to Christians, is what's going on in life). at the end of time, when true believers go to heaven and the unbelievers remain behind. When the joke is explained, it is suggested that it is always better to become a true believer. in case Christians are right ‚Äù. Now it is the freest excuse that will become a Christian if you ask me! This film is still trying to translate the unbelievers with frightened tactics. "Believe in God, or you go to hell!" there is a message. Really really simple but pretty offensive. Especially because this film is sold as something completely different. Suppose you are a Christian fundamentalist yourself and you are not likely to be affected by the themes of this movie, is it a good movie? I'm afraid that's not the case. Not actually I'm lying: I'm GLAD, it's not! Acting is terrible, the pace is terrible, the storyline is terrible, especially the ending is ridiculously wrong. As soon as the movie starts, you immediately feel that it will be worse than you expected and you will be right. In the first half hour, they seem to at least try to set a clear UFO secret, but then suddenly bring a similar look to this Earl Dracula, which starts to babble about the devil. At first you just think that this dude is just a crazy maniac, but as it turns out, he actually represents the true views of the creators of this film. Once you realize it, you know how it will end. But in reality it will end up worse. <br /> <br /> Avoid.
