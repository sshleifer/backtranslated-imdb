Corny and some really bad gambling, but for the Golan-Globus movie about true steam. He saw this film in 1985 mostly because I liked sword and witch movies (what did I think?). Arnold is in it playing the High Lord trying to make sure that the ancient talisman is destroyed before being blown into the world. which cannot act in low budget films by B. Brigitte cheeses like Sonya and Arnold act as Lord Kalidor. There is also Sandahl Bergman (who was in the original Conan movie as Valeria) here she plays the evil Queen Gedren, an obvious camp to her Conan role. And then one of the most irritating child screen actors (ernie reyes) as Prince Tarn, who was to be hit hard and sent to bed. Some of the sword fighting is not too bad, but the music really sucks. The special effects are inexpensive and look very 70 years like the explosion of the evil queen's castle on top of the movie. Overall a very low vapor movie, but b movie movie enthusiasts can enjoy it for camping.
