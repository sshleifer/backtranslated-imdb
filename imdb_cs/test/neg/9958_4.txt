Fortunately, you don't need a bunch of "books learnin" to understand where this is happening ... Of course, the poverty line cash-in on Universal is a big hit WOLF MAN (which was made just a year earlier), it always finds -notable George Zucco in another of his the patented role of "mad doctor" as the brilliant, vengeful scientist Lorenzo Cameron. Cameron, who established a business deep in the marshy areas of what I suppose is Louisiana Bayou, is a revenge against four of his former peers who both humiliated him and forced him to withdraw from his previous job. You see, they taunted his claim that they were able to mix a man with a beast to create an unstoppable army of werewolf creatures that would be useful during the war. Fortunately, Cameron found the ideal test item for his wolf blood injections - a massive, childish half joke called Petro (Glenn Strange). Petro is pretty clueless about what's going on, doesn't ask too many questions and lets him send him to the table and shoot him with anything that happens in the syringe. This results in a change in time when a person becomes a werewolf. Cameron releases him from the house with a secret passage, so you basically get a big guy (Strange was 6'5 ") dressed in overalls with bushy beards, furry paws, and a set of oversized plastic teeth, after seeing the beast and being killed the little girl, the locals pick up their rifles and organize a break to catch him, Dr. Cameron, who can control the beast with a whip and also a handy antidote to reverse this effect, also pulls Petro into the big city to try to track down the professors who mocked his The original theories and destroyed his reputation in the process, and also hangs around the house of Cameron's daughter Lenora (Anne Nagel), as well as Lenory's curious reporter friend Tom (Johnny Downs) whose first inclination is to deal with the upright-walking prehistoric creation (!) Although typically chintzy PRC swipe in many ways, with unimaginable files, cinematography and ake-up as well as fairly lackluster supporting cast, it remains remarkable history through drama George Zucca. I have no idea why Downs got the highest billing; it turns out half an hour and doesn't really have a lot of work, nor is it so impressive. This is Zucc's show and he's a great bragging and waving, talking to himself while fantasizing about talking to his peers ("I don't care about your imbecile mouth!") And temporarily slide in and out of reason. Strange seems to have patterned his performance as a hilariously naive and slowing semi-retarded land bumpkin around the entire work of Lon Chaney Jr., from his turn as Lenny in OF MICE and Men, to his performance as the aforementioned WOLF MAN. In any case, Strange and Zucco are doing a pretty good job playing each other. My favorite part is when Zucco calls him "guinea pig" in front of his colleagues while Petro sits there and looks at the door handle. Some scenes from foggy swamps are also very atmospheric.
