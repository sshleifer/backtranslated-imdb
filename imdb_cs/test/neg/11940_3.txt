When I saw trailers for this movie, it looked like a good romantic comedy. I expected light fluffy fun. Instead, I was bored and a little depressed. Frankly, there was no chemistry between the leaders, and the film had little, if anything, fun. The little girl was delightful - when she cried, I cried - but I thought they might use someone a little younger in the role. In any case, the film was filled with long, boring silence or swelling of opera music. I'm not an anti-opera, but I'd rather give them the time to introduce us to characters that were all stiff and underdeveloped. <br /> <br /> I was really disappointed in this movie. All the while I was watching, I was still thinking about how much better it could be.
