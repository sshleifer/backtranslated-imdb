This video has a sound that is designed for someone who hears while sleeping. And the same can be said about video. Morgan and his wife pretend to do it for working on a minimum wage? Scroll with camera? And his little wifey-poo complained? Give me a break. They are both rich. They sit in their fake $ 350 / month apartment filming it with their $ 1,000 / month each video crew of 12. <br /> <br /> I once respected Morgan, but now his "30 days" experience is nothing but is trying to deceive all volunteer viewers who are willing to be fooled. C'mon Morgan, are you filming doing $ 6.00 per hour of work and are you paid naive employers who don't see those big cameras filming the whole thing? And we don't think they pay you under the table?
