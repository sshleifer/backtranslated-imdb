This movie is slow. This movie is cheap. This movie is on Friday the 13th to look like a candidate for the best picture. Negotiation is stupid. Special effects are bullshit. No one dies as long as 40 minutes and all people behave badly. The only thing that will save you is the ability to laugh at all your stupidity. The funniest part is watching the heroine "fight" with the attacker. She was supposed to be trained, but she fought like 70 years. They spend meaningless scenes on people who do not die, and on scenes on people who die, to the point that you do not even know why they die. I love slashers, but this is just stupid.
