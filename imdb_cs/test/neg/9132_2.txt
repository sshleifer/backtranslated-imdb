I was very disappointed in this film. The director showed some talent in his next effort, but it was just a fill. Perhaps it was of great significance, but it seems to me that it is nothing more than a director who has access to some toys. His next job I would highly recommend to people, but certainly not one. As I watched, I was still wondering that he would rise after the initial slow period, but he never did. At the end of the film, I was neither amusing nor moved, nor was I aware of anything. I could only say, "What was that?" There were several really striking parts of the movie, but not enough to make it justified again.
