This movie probably started with a good idea, but it was as far as it was possible. When I read the blockbuster cover, I thought it had a promise, but it was based on the overall idea of ​​the film. The film began to talk to the professor about how we will be able to see creatures from other dimensions in the future. There was no explanation of how this would happen, but that's okay, I thought it would have developed in the film. It was not. In the next scene we see two young men lying on tables with tubes on their heads. There are two attractive women beside each. Men are starting to ask "do you hear" or "do you see them". We conclude that he thinks he sees ghosts or other creatures that appear invisible or hallucinating. Women don't see these creatures. It was fine for the first five minutes, but THIS SCENE ARE FULL CLOCK. This is briefly interrupted by flashes that have no correlation to the so-called "plot" of the film. We are also introduced to men in the lab coat and what seems to be terrorists in the Middle East. What is it about? We never found out. Lightning back leads us to believe that terrorists are forcing men in lab coats to make evil experiments on these young people, but we never understood why. At the end of the film, do terrorists finally do what terrorists do? blow up a lab, but why? What's the point? We have no idea. This film contains so many detached thoughts and ideas that there are too many to name but one more remarkable is the fact that a man in lab coats and terrorist pop into and out of a room throughout the film and not once do young. men try to escape or even leave the tables they lie on, even if they are not attached! The filmmakers are also bringing cockroaches on several occasions, but we will never again know what it has to do with the story. We're sorry, but this movie was a waste of $ 4 and the time I spent in the car rental, and then I watched it. Take my advice. Don't borrow it.
