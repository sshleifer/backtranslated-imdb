... But they certainly deserve only 4/10 stars and nothing more. Moron's stupid father is a warrior who is shot down by some Arab country. They never mention the country in the film, it's really absurd, they just refer vaguely to an Arab nation. But Lamar from the Revenge of the Nerds is here, he's friends with the lead character Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives at the Air Force Base, is his father's Air Force pilot, but can't get to the Air Force Academy, counting the plot (with the help of his retarded friends) to steal two jets and fly. save your father. Yes, exactly - this is one of the biggest movies ever made !!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can say he basically wanted to blow up the entire Doug Masters. Anyway, you can guess how the plot ends, I can't believe they made 3 sequels of this movie.
