He's the one where the head of the short courses department at Columbia has his director's start, huh? Yeah, it's none other than Mr. Jules White, who is credited (or rather "exposed") as director of this entry in the MGM DOGVILLE series. Given co-credit as co-Director is one of Zion Myers; whose name is still unknown to us. Undoubtedly, Mr. Meyers was the guy who controlled a four-legged boy and was responsible for training and playing. In short, he had to be a dog trainer on the scene. The title of this short comedy is undoubtedly a MGM feature of the same year, a great house; who played Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and Star Cast in Support. As for this title, we must invoke ignorance; he didn't see it until this point. (Sorry, Schultz!) But there are many dog ​​gags that relate to what we've read about film *; not to mention some specific features specific to a particular character. For example, we observed a dog convict who st-stuttered and correctly inferred that the bow actor was imitating the Roscoe Ates comic. Later we made a cross check with the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and presto, his name is there! (Brilliant Deduction, One Suitable for Holmes and Watson!) <br /> <br /> THE PROCEDURE OF LIVING Popular features have already been tried and tested in the comedy short. This did not seem to raise any objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films; but rather enough contradictory accepted tassive pile. Imitation is thought to be a sincere form of flattery; besides, every producer would also welcome seemingly rude parody. ** HOW TO TRY THE WORLD IN THE WORLD in some kind of perverse way. When we saw so many "best friends of man" that they were so artificially animated into one, long and boring kind of anthropomorphic gag, it seemed very tiring for us who make up the audience. I mean, how many pooches were unnecessarily issued to achieve the illusion of "speaking"? When I'm ready for pets, or "animal companions", as the politically correct crowd prefers, we're quite eclectic; they prefer not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parrots. We do not like to see any animal exploited in such a non-fun, extended game format. 2 Reeler's production seemed to be not only in the field of finance; but in content. We never thought he was a producer-director for luminaires like 3 Stoogs, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who certainly saw better days like Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; it would be a step up kinematically. <br /> <br /> WHEN WE Haven't Worried yet; this is the panning. Let's take a look at our own risk. We warned you! NOTE * We have read the excellent reports of both Big House and Laurel & Hardy, PARDON US (Hal Roach / MGM, 1931) in both MR. LAUREL & MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and LAUREL & HARDY FILMS by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our enthusiasm. NOTE ** The prison image has become its own genre; everything owes a debt to a big house. In PARDON US, Laurel & Hardy, Hal Roach and his director made a first-rate spoof, the first of many; For Prison Comedy, it has become a required theme for so much funny person to come.
