I don't know where you were, but where I watched a movie in which we didn't have people who sang, as some said they had, we had people laughing, mostly in the camp, terrible dance sequences and singing of the Brosnan order. The only people in the audience who seemed to be fascinated with the film were people of the 1970s who were certainly the way they lived through the past with songs. I was a DJ in the 1970s and even went to an ABBA concert at the Northlands Coliseum in Edmonton in September 79, so I appreciated it and still doing it. But this film was supposed to go like their marriage and ended in divorce. The sequences were so badly staged, dubbed and edited absolutely horrible, and that must be Meryl's worst production. I can't believe the Academy winner would do so low he would. Save your money, wait for it to come out on DVD, and then maybe spend money on something better, like Cat Litter.
