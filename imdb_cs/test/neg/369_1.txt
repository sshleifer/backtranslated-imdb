I know Trey Parker and Matt Stone really hate celebrities and the spoof is in every single South Park episode (if they don't show them, then they mention them) and they love both fake and funny and make fun of themselves. It went too far. For one thing, the most common theme in "documentary" is that these are episodes that are nonsensical bits of bullshit that they only spend on money. Obviously, it's totally untrue if you even bother to watch any episode and constant "You know, I learned something today ..." the main heroes said at the end of almost every episode. The creators are also depicted as pompous, arrogant donkeys who only care about money, including the supposedly funny game, but it's not a scene involving Isaac Hayes, who delivers lines to the chef (by phone) and Trey Parker screams and yells for it and suspension. I think it should be funny, but the prejudice in it really did ... Cringe. The way interviews with employees working for Trey and Matt show a duo as tyrants who push their employees to the limit, all for money, eventually. Apparently completely untrue and all jokes, but it just isn't funny. It's worrying, even if it's just a joke.
