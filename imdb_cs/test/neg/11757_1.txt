Yes, why? Filmmakers that came out in the 1980s and 1990s include Gus Van Sant, one of my idols. There are more, a few. Steven Sodebergh, PT Anderson, Tim Hunter, Danny Boyle, Martin Donovan, Harmony Korine, Wes Anderson. Idiosyncratic, sometimes angry, but consistent, surprising, unpredictable. Their names make me turn on the TV, go to the video store or even buy a ticket and go to the movies. But Van Sant's "Psycho" gives me a break. Why? I wonder. A shot of a massacre shot of one of the permanent classics. The color was unpleasant, showing, terrible. What does Vince Vaughn do? Was it a parody? Bad joke? What the hell was that? Anne Heche as Janet Leigh? Who put her on? Viggo Mortensen with cowboy hat. Viggo is a great actor, but in this case he couldn't forget about John Gavin and if Julianne Moore was introduced to the world through this performance, there would be no "The Hours", "The Minutes" for her. So, here I am, bad mouth work of one of my idols. The remaining question remains: Why, Mr. Van Santi? Perhaps, according to President Clinton, because he could. I'm afraid it's not an excuse.
