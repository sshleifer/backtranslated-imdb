One of the dumbest movies in the history of the film. Wait, I'll take it back - this movie can't be classified in any category related to "cinema"; they belong to categories such as "waste", lawns or similar categories. Ironically, it's even about two garbagemen. The film is "Men at Work", a light comedy of criminals starring the Estevez (Sheen) brothers of 1990. He put off the asinin and the improbable plot line, misconduct, bad dialogue, poorly executed stunts and grotesque, continuity errors, and high rates. -name actors never to be seen again, all in fact it was quite a bad movie anyway (at its core, I think). It was the kind of movie that could be good for one thing: you can watch it about 200 times, learn every line, and repeat that way in public with friends * full * * * as the biggest dorks in your tenth classroom. <br /> <br /> To make it even worse, I actually submitted an IMDb trivia entry (along with this bad review) to a movie IMDb webpage only when I noticed a stupid little punk music joke that apparently nobody else noticed still (about Butthole Surfer statue). I'm so contradictory about why I should * waste * my time by giving what appears to be a supportive note when what I really want to do is blow up Emilia's acting career (no, wait, he's done it himself. , Dude!) I'm so glad I just lost my time, not real money. Can I have at least one tenth of my budget? Anyone other than this director (Emilio) could have made two or three much better films with what they had blown up the car, and carefully placed the bimbo in a bikini and beat the useless henchmen in the suits with the matrix. I would mention that Emilio wrote his credit, but it would be the so-called "writing" - it is rather a crayon-drawn cartoon idea. And Charlie Sheen, if you read it, I assume M.A.W. it had to be done during that part of your career in which you were a shocked Hollywood darling who hasn't grown up yet. (Sorry, sorry, I don't think that part of your life is over yet. Well soon, you "half man." Such a promising talent, so * wasted *?
