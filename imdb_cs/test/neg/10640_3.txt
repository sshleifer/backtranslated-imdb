*** SPOILERS! *** Sometimes I wonder what viewers think they have to explain (and thus destroy) the mystery behind iconic horror movies. The original "Hellraiser" of 1987 was an absolute masterpiece and probably one of the most scary films ever made. The 1988 "Hellbound" was also a fantastic Horror movie, although I personally didn't like the viewer getting basic information about the Cenobites, some of the oldest horror horror villains in the original. The third part, "Hell on Earth" (1992), was already quite a mess whose creators seemed to think it was necessary to add a dose of humor to the previously incomparably scary lead-cenobite of Pinhead (a typical stupidity of the 1990s) and therefore destroy most of them. its rarity. This fourth part of "Hellraiser: Bloodline" (1996) is a bit more atmospheric than the third, but it reduces this quality by inventing even more stupid and unnecessary "basic information" about cenobites and opening gates to hell. br /> <br /> Seriously - did we need to know how to make mysterious puzzles that open gates to hell? I don't think so, and that's not the only secret about the cenobity that is stupidly destroyed in this movie. The "Bloodline" setting goes back and forth at three different times. The film begins in a space station from the 22nd century, when Dr. The Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) attempts to forever close the gates to hell. When government troops disrupt his mission, he must explain his reasons. In the 18th century Paris, the merchant's ancestor was a toymaker assigned to build a puzzle box with an aristocrat possessed of occult. The evoked demon, the princess of hell, took over the body of the beautiful Angelique (Valentina Vargas). Given that the only person capable of destroying the gate to hell is the one who built it, the bloodline of the toymakers would be cursed, and his ancestors were infested with cenobits over the years ... The film that takes place in the 18th century, the present, and The 22nd century is really quite a mess. I admit that the 18th century part has a haunted atmosphere and is by far the best part of the film, but also its smallest part. Parts set in the present and in the future are relatively weak and filled with stupid and unworthy elements. Undoubtedly the strengths of the film are the amazing makeup and gore-effects, the totally devastating Valentina Varagas as she-demon, and Pinhead (Doug Bradley), who, despite losing some of his ghost, is still a terrible villain. It's an almost offensive idea for "Hellraiser" fans, but that Pinhead is to be defeated by a ridiculous light show. All in all, "Bloodline" is not a complete disaster, but it is certainly an unfortunate sequel to the series that started so brilliantly. Even director Kevin Yagher was obviously embarrassed because he preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee. Overall, it is only recommended for hardcore Pinhead fanatics, and most of them will probably be angry with further diminishing the haunting of their favorite demon. All others are advised to follow the brilliant first and excellent second part of "Hellraiser" and skip all others. The effects of makeup in "Bloodline" are scary as hell, but almost everything else is disappointing. My rating: 3.5 / 10
