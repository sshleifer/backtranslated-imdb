Spending your time in a different way, even housework is better than this movie. Jokes are not funny, fun rhymes that are dr. Seus, they're not there. A very miserable way to knit in the evening. My kids 4-16 laughed a little at the beginning, the younger ones bored with him and went off to play Barbies and the elders who went to play ps2 and surf the net. My wife left and made dishes. So I finished it myself. It was the worst movie I saw. If you want to watch a fun movie for kids, watch Shrek 2, the movie is fun for kids and their parents. Avoid this movie. It's not funny, it's not cute, cat makeup is all about the only good stuff in it and you can see it on the disc label.
