I like Ustinov's distinctive, literary story. And the photo is nice. We shot a movie for our 3.5 year old, who slipped a little in and out of the room. So for our first viewing we only saw about 1/3 of the movie and were pretty charming. When we looked again, we sat down for family time, we were all lost in situations of violence and life-threatening situations where the poor otter got. Approximately in the middle of the film there is a bunch of dead, bloody fur animals. Lots of blood, not just a little. Then at the end there is a wild game with the dog, then the blood will flood the water. Do you think that with G rating it is all you will see ... that IMPLY will one of the animals die. No way. They pull the corpse out of the water and point it several times to a few traumatic seconds. Personally, as an adult, I love horror movies and am fine with the violent films ala Scorsese, Cronenberg, Tarantino. Damn, I love the ultra violent battle of the Royale. But these movies are not children's films and as such are not advertisements. If you are deliberately raising your young to see the harsh reality of life for cute animals, then it's a movie for you. If you're like me and my wife, you might want to save your baby's nightmares and avoid this.
