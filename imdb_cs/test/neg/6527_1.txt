Let's get one thing straight; That was BAD! So Putrid doesn't even qualify to remember someone. An ever-repeating storyline (which recycles not only jokes, but also storylines and character appearances). ; Sue (mother) opens an episode citing how she loves her son, but smells awful (as if it didn't age! Har-de-bloody-har!), Some Australian quasi-nationalist "bogan" seems to say how he thinks that is amazing because it's ozzie, while everything / all the others who are not upset before they disappear for the rest of the episode. (little mercy) <br /> <br /> The rest of the plot revolves around his father (Gary), who gets into disagreement with Sue and he talks to his band members to tell him how to fix it. The phrase "words don't succeed" is old, but it's where it's the most likely thing. It's so incredibly BAD! So HORRIBLE that I want every trace of its existence sent to the lowest depths of the North Sea and life to continue. But I feel sad to see someone as good as Sally Bretton (a good actress, she likes) to be able to be quite funny about herself, Ardal O Hanlon (My Hero) - but not here - and Ben Elton, who has so many good things to do, will somehow come up with this ... then the comedy is in very serious trouble!
