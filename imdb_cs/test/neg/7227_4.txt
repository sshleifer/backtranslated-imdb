If Daphne Du Maurier set up REBECCA in San Francisco in 1950, it might well be reminiscent of this noble, very unusual noir by Robert Wise. Valentina Cortese survives a concentration camp that steals the dead woman's identity and instills into the life of Richard Basehart (who also becomes the guardian of a dead woman's son) ... it's ridiculous and over-the-top, but also fun. Cortese is amazing, slowly falling apart when she realizes the mistake she made. Basehart is fine when it's a little weak ... even though the lighting is coming to an end, it's terrible. Fay Baker is very good Mrs. Danvers as administrator. Wise is a great director and holds things that move on a nice, fast-paced clip. He also internships now classic out of car crash control with Cortese (or at least Cortese stunt) at the wheel.
