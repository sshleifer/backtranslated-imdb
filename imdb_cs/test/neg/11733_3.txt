Honestly, how hard can it be to make a good remake? Obviously hard enough! I was so excited to see it because I loved the original and my friends saw it and told me it really sucks. I finally see it and I was disappointed. Ok, the shower scene was more realistic ... that's why I gave it 3. Otherwise it was sucking. Vince Vaughn plays a terrible job for Norman, it's too dense or something. I don't know, it was just awful. I do not see it!
