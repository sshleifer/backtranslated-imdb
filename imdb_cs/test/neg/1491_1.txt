I had a hard time staying up for two hours opening the episode. To such an extent it was stupid, I doubt I learned one thing. The graphics were basic. Some small idea was repeated ad nauseum. Contrast that to the Cosmos series hosted by Carl Sagan. It had a good musical theme. There was no music coming out of these infernal 10-dimensional chains.
