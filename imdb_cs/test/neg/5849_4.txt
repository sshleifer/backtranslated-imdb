This film received a great record in the upcoming lure of Blockbusters', I was looking forward to the release date, 08/07/02. The story sounds reasonable, the cast should guarantee a side splitter, but there; Unlike 'off the wall betting events' it was pretty boring. This will never become a classic comedy, and I'm afraid he has not made any help to the good comedy of John Cleese's reputation. Rowan Atkinson, now quite funny, in some sort of Rowan Atkinson!
