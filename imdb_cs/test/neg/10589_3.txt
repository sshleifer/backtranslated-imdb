This is a bad attempt to spin the old yarn we've seen so many times before. In fact, it reminded me of the American series 'The Players', though not so well. Omar Epps is utterly unconvincing as a hard man bunch, as is Ribisi, who is trying to be a funny guy lost on the way. Although Danish performance was decent, you can see why it was cast in Terminator 4 from the show. Sometimes he takes it seriously, but at other times he tries to be funny, but unhappy. The film has to some extent half-finished feeling - as if it was stretched out on a 90-minute mark. <br /> <br /> You'll be disappointed.
