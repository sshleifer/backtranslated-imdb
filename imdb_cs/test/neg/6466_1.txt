Ladies and gentlemen, we can imagine the worst of all Disney remodeling. Although the name of this movie is "That Darn Cat", it was supposed to be "That Darn Teen" or "FBI Agent". Cat got no real good scenes, Ricci's character was more annoying than funny, Doug E. Doug didn't get any good lines, even Dean Jones's role couldn't save the movie! The only really good characters were just two car mechanics in the city, but their scenes were just short. Overall, if you're thinking about watching this movie, get something more intelligent than Barney's video.
