It is said that there are some people who really watch Monogram films. Well - and why not? The Monogram Studios lived on the Cost Plus principle; The cost, plus enough to pay the rent and buy a pizza and a bottle of robust muscatel once in a while. Sure, they're cheap. Let's face it: they are rude, fast, Philistine, vulgar, but exciting. They have no claims at all. They are designed to distract the audience an hour or so at the end of a double account. What if John Wayne goes along the wild west along a road-lined road? It's not art, it's fun. <br /> <br /> Take this movie "Flight to Mars". In the beginning, when we first met the characters, the man could suddenly introduce his female companion, avoiding any tedious softness: "Professor, this is my fiancée and assistant who is a rocket scientist and a beautiful woman." but he's still more impatient with me because I'm always wrapped up in my scientific work, maybe you could steal it, marry her, give her an infant and a home protected by the protester she desires. The way to see her dreams. It saves a lot of time for writing and filming, right? This is what people say when they say the story is "fast". (This one was shot in five days.) Why should we come across these things? What the hell is that, cheap sci-fi movie or Henry James? In fact, this is a particularly well-funded example of the movie Monogram. It's in color, for one thing. Accurate "Cinecolor". (You can say it's no other "color" you know.) And look at the cast. The female lead is ruled out, as is usual with the Monogram, but the male clues are certainly up on the list of B. Cameron Mitchell as a reporter, but despite having managed to go on the road as the male leader who came to it, he never did. And Arthur Franz as a smoking scientist, pride of Perth Amboy, New Jersey. And - for science fiction fans - how about this pair of aces: both Morris Ankrum and John Litel! There is not much in the plot description detail. Five crew members crash on Mars where they find an underground civilization inhabited by organisms whose evolution has been isomorphic with ours, up to their five digits and willow babes in short skirts. And pick up English from listening to our broadcasts. American broadcasting, judging by their speech. They are led by ominous calamari who are attempting to kidnap a spaceship, build many imitations, and colonize the earth. They are not successful. <br /> <br /> Special effects are not very special. Men walk around several spare kits, wearing black costumes with stylized lightning bolts and scarlet baskets that roll behind them. Their names consist exclusively of English phonemes - Alzar, Terris, Ikron. Crazy Martian, who falls on Arthur Franz, is called Alita, with an Indo-European tiny pendant, and she already knows what kissing is. but also boring. The story is some kind of Buck Rogers of the 1930s. Once the Earthlings and Martians meet and are proven to have a common language, and that the Martians have a sinister agenda, it is. In two hours, even an indifferent screenwriter could turn it into a story of Nazi spies in World War II. The plot is made by numbers, the dialogue has no spark, the actor is a walker. However, dedicated Monogram fans should enjoy it. After all, Jean-Luc Goddard, the controversial French egghead, donated the "Bout de Soufflé" Monogram, so they couldn't be so bad.
