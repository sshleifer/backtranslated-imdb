Hi! Grudge 2! How man is he? I have a friend I want you to meet. Grudge 2 Meets Johnny's Worst List 2006. Johnny's Worst 2006 Meets The Grudge 2. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? I was under the impression that it was supposed to be a sequel to The Grudge rather than a remake. If that's the case, why not do anything but fix the original? This float doesn't even feel like a film. It's just a 90-minute soundtrack of a strange chick that makes this annoying twisting sound. <br /> <br /> Sound that I would recommend you not to start with. It was kind of scary when I first heard it, but since 2004 I've heard it about 12,367 times, so it's pretty much its course. And it's even more annoying 20 people in the audience who thought it would be fun to emulate the sound whenever there was a quiet place in the movie. Sigh. People, NOT THE BEST, GO ARE SET! I promise you that every time a character walks slowly through an empty room (which is approximately 97% of the movie), someone in the audience starts it, "Uhhhhkkkkkkuuuuuhhhhhkkkkkk." but you get the main one. So then a dude in the viewer would chuckle and not be exaggerated to release his own rendition. I was very close to just passing through the audience and punching random people. <br /> <br /> I told you not to start me. <br /> <br /> About Grudge 2, which I can recommend. The whole film is not the only original fear or idea. There is no unforgettable acting performance. Are you a fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar? Welp, enjoy two minutes of screen and one dialogue. Are you a fan of Amber Tamblyn? I hope you can deal with not giving anything more than walking and looking like she was suffering from a tight nerve. Can you believe the story (if you can call it) is even worse than The Grudge? At least the original was quite creepy and boasted several effective jump scenes. I never jumped once during this period (yeah, I made the word, I solved it). That is right. Not even once. The "spooky" are so produced and are so extraordinarily telegraphed that there is absolutely no shock value when the "gotcha" moment is reached. Watching this movie is like playing a good game of chess - you're always four or five scenes ahead. There are also some strange scenes thrown in that no sense at all. One that immediately comes to mind is the scene where the girl drinks a liter of milk and then begins to return it back to the kettle. Huh? I say HUH?!?! The audience laughed. I shook my head and sighed. There was a lot during the movie. Laughing. Sighing. Shaking your head. Falling sleep (I did twice). The movie even makes a 1/5-heart twist attempt. Wow. It's so bad that I don't think we should dignify that we call it a twist. Does he really think anyone would be surprised to see himself hiding under the hood? Please. It was as shocking as Elton John came out of the closet. Of course, the end ends with a whole untouched "spectacle, maybe we'll have another sequel." As the credits rolled, the audience hesitated. Exactly. If viewers paid money for this burger, then it would most likely be violent, and I would like to lead the charges. We learned from The Grudge that there is a Japanese belief that if someone dies in a strong grip, then the curse will be left behind. Like Ben Affleck's movie, it is a "stain" that will forever be part of a place where death has occurred. Well, at The Grudge 2, we learned that when a horror movie covers its budget during its opening weekend, its sequel will be rushed out and more often than it will be, leaving a stain on every theater. film shows. GIST <br /> <br /> If you're a total werewolf and you've never seen The Grudge, then it can provide some cheap ghosts. But I strongly advise you to save money, otherwise there is a good chance that you will be leaving the theater with grief.
