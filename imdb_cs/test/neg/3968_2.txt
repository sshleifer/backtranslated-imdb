This film comes from my friends' mothers who worked in a charity store. She handed it to us with lots of unknown tapes. The film itself is a little waste. There are a few notable bits of laughing as a bit when his girlfriend gets her head drilled into, but generally the film is bland. Interstingly, when I saw the trailer for "The Island", I couldn't help but notice the similarities. Could Clonus be the inspiration for the movie? All in all do not bother watching this movie because it is boring and boring. We enjoyed it so much when we were 16, which we named after him as our band. Another sign that this movie is a bit crappy is the back side of the video that doesn't really appear in the movie? strange
