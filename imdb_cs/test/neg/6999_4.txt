Dare Rudd (John Wayne) and Sidekick Dink Hooley (Syd Saylor) are traveling cowboys who can't stay in one place for a long time. In "Helltown", the boys head for Montana, where they meet cousin Rudd Tom Fillmore (Johnny Mack Brown), who offers them a job. It's horrible to see the boy wearing aprons as they start with herd cooks, though Dare becomes confident when Miss Judith (Marsha Hunt) goes to camp. Judy is Tom's girl, but the attraction between her and Dare is obvious early. be on the task. Meanwhile, the bad guy Bart Hammond (Monte Blue) has eyes on Fillmore's cattle, but when his followers can't sew the herd, he finds it easier to win the money Dare paid at the end of the trail. Conning Dare to a rigged card game with his man Brady (James Craig), Dare's money begins to evaporate hand at hand. It is only when Dare does not appear at the Fillmore ranch that Tom is going to find his cousin. Exposing scammers, Tom, Dare and Dink high tail before bad boys can get their revenge. "Helltown", also known as "Born to the West", was released in 1937 by Favorite Films Corporation, a few years after Wayne's Western series for Lone Star Productions. Only slightly changes the Lone Star pattern; Wayne gets the girl at the end of the movie, but here he tried. There is a great scene of a runaway horse where Wayne rescues Marsha Hunt, in which Johnny Mack Brown's horse makes a complete escape. Syd Saylor does a nice job as a comic relief friend and does everything in his power to sell lightning rods to unsuspecting victims. He replaces the familiar faces of George "Gabby" Hayes and Yakima Canutt here, the core of Lone Stars films. John Wayne's Charisma is starting to develop here and preparing him to jump to the super star status he has finally achieved. "Helltown" was based on the novel by the legendary Western author Zane Gray. If you're looking for more movies based on Gray's stories, try "Fight Caravans" with Gary Cooper, "Light of the West Stars" with Victor Jory, "Drift Fence" with Buster Crabb, and "Desert Heritage" with Randolph Scott.
