In 1990 I saw Kathy Ireland personally - I was at UNT in Denton during the filming of "Necessary Roughness". Oddly enough, the voice he uses in this film is not too far from her true speaking voice. By the way, the plot looks like this: Kathy gets a letter telling her that her father fell into a bottomless pit in Africa. He goes and explores his father's death place, just to get into an underground world that is part of a dystopian nightmare that is part of a non-inspiring fantasy and inhabited by rejection of the plasma. This film really wastes Linda Kerridge's talent, which I think could be someone who gets the one big role that was right for her. The main character of the story, Gus, is the very lame Mark "Jacko" Jackson rip-off. The original is annoying enough to get started, but this guy is really watching torture. Finally, crazy Wanda comes out of her shell and ends up wearing a bikini top and a sarong at the end. If you have Kathy Ireland in a movie in modest clothes, it would be better to be a bikini. But the film was wrong all around and MST3K was right to avoid. <br /> <br /> Avoid this if possible.
