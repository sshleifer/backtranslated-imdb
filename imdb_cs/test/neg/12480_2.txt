Lucio Fulci was famous for his Italian splatter films, mostly his undead movies like Zombie or Beyond. Here he drove a black comedy, but there is only one problem: his nausea. I say this with the knowledge that I like City of Walking Dead (which is also gross, but not like that). A compulsive player gets money for his habit by romancing ugly and deformed rich women then murdering and stealing their money. The film makes this plan so easy. I think women were too ugly to go to the bank so they always had money per person. After the sixteenth murder, I began to suspect what I had always heard of Fulci: he hated women. Must have. In any case, this movie stinks, it's not funny, and Fulci was supposed to stay with giallo and supernatural zombie movies. Avoid this movie at all costs.
