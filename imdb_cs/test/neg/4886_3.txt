From late teens to the 1920s, Stan Laurel was a solo act in movies. During this time, Laurel is definitely NOT between the upper layers of talent and his humor is not as good as contemporaries like Lloyd or Keaton. However, he created a decent niche for second grade short comedies. As for the quality of the films, they differed wildly. Some, such as DR. PYCKLE AND MR. PRYDE was amazing while most of them were on average below average in quality. FROZEN FRIENDS are a special movie. Like many films he made for Hal Roach and distributed by Path√© during this period, the costumes were absolutely first-class and the film looked very nice. Despite this, and thanks to support from James Finlayson, one thing they forgot to include in this film was humor. None of the jokes seem to work, and the film looks almost like a drama, not a comedy. Only really silly intertitle cards betray the type of film to be. My advice is to try to see all his Laurel and Hardy movies and then see solo movies. Except DR. PYCKLE, try to see SOILERS and MUD AND SAND - two of his more tolerable solo shorts.
