Here's what's good at "Defeat Rule:" - Ryan Gosling, Clea Duvall and David Morse are doing great. Gosling is, as always, damn excellent. Locations are often breathtaking. Here's what's wrong with the "Kill Rule": <br /> <br /> - Everything else. The script is terribly confused. And while I certainly appreciate a movie that's not "good", this movie is just boring. Great performances can't make makeup for a movie with a silly premise and a scenario that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make sense. Just passing through the first hour became a chore. I got stuck with Gosling, but in the end I did a favor and changed the channel. Spoilers passed over here. I didn't miss much. Do yourself a favor - if you want a good Gosling movie, check out "The Believer". <br /> <br /> My score: 2 out of 10.
