Edward G. gives us a retro look at the world of criminal defense. At first, he is an overly ardent prosecutor who sends a bad man to a chair (playing passionately, though briefly DeForrest Kelly), then is so filled with remorse that his only consolation is a bottle. Throw in a tired romance, a really quick descent into the penury and no remorse about who's defending, and another thing you know - Shazam! Black Leg Lawyer (God I Love). He sees the light just in time to save his tired loved one from the chair. Yawning. But the courtroom action is purely melodrama. We'll see him delivering a witness, see him drink poison, see how he fights passionately as he slams a bullet hole in his chest. Be prepared for melodrama. The film's noise is Jayne Russell. With curves defying the laws of gravity and IQ approaching absolute zero, there is something he sees. He even sings a little.
