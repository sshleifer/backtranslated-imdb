absolutely nothing about this film is funny, interesting or relevant. besides the two characters who meet at the end, nothing is solved and there is no conspiracy. and by the way, what's with the DVD cover? it has a female ass in daisy duke shorts ... where was the scene in the movie? nobody in this movie wore dukes of daisies! Surprisingly enough, almost all of the acting in this movie are good and jack black plays a full song (it can be a tough d song ... though not) ... these are the only redemption values. overall, it's just a waste of time.
