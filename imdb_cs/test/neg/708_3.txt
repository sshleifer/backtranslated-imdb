This movie was hard for me to watch. Stan looked very old and sick compared to what I remembered, and Ollie was harder than I ever remembered in another movie. However, the most difficult were the gaps in the script / production where I wondered, "How did they get out of here?" It took almost half of the film before I could deal with dubbing non-US actors - which was also a distraction. Although I miss great actors like Laurel and Hardy - will there ever be great actors like those of the old studio era ??? - This film helps me understand why actors sometimes "hide" in their premiere.
