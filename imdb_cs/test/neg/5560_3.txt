That's a silly movie. Like many of these karate movies, it's poorly written, embarrassing, and sometimes just silly. The event really isn't all there and the movie overall leaves a lot to be desired. Everyone here is talking jive, doing bad karate and doing very bad acting work. Watch Scatman Crothers in a small role, he is generally too good for this movie. Jim Kelly is good at karate, but he's a terrible actor. Gloria Hendry is really bad. All of them are, it's so many parts of this movie that don't make sense. The supposed love / escape scene with Hendry and Kelly, what the hell was that? They destroyed the man's guitar for no reason! And then there were compulsory girls on trampolines !!! What it was? They were in the movie for five seconds, then you never heard of them again !!! Then there's the whole racially charged element of the movie that's cool and everything, but it's not going anywhere in this movie. As I said, once it's good for laughter, but don't look again.
