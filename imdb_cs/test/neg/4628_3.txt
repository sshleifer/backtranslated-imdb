I had a very difficult time in this movie. If you're really very pro-adultery and like to hear people ENDLESSLY talk about their sexual exploitation, I can't see how you could enjoy this movie. Geez - most of the main characters acted like a roaring weasel, and their ranting about their BEST infidelies grew weary. The only thing I appreciated was the scene where one character was urinating and the blood was splashing everywhere because he picked up STD --- BIG SURPRISE! Hmm. <br /> <br /> If you want a GOOD movie, watch the sequel, Barbarian Invasion. Despite the general nature of many characters, the sequel is VERY inclusive and more realistic - well worth your time.
