"The Return of Seven" has several good action scenes and Elmer Bernstein's score is as exciting as ever. However, it's a boring movie because it just can't emotionally engage us. McQueen's absence makes a really bad impression, and the fact that his character is played by another (little-known) actor is strange - the wrong way. The characters are not developed, so we don't associate with them - and we hardly care when some of them die. This continuation is clear, but the wrong imitation of the original.
