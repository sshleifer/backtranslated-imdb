In my opinion, the end is what completely destroyed the whole thing. The initial idea that someone suddenly realized they were the son of God, and the second coming was somewhat clever. People started to trust him and his friends became new students. People went necessarily, demons had people, all kinds of fun. Of course it all went wrong. It was bad enough to find it impossible to search for a "third testament" in five days in a vast number of writings, but then finally this ridiculous humanistic fantasy. I will not spoil it, but I will say it comes as if a teenager with a very limited knowledge of theology wrote it. I have heard that they are making an American feature-length version of this story, I just hope to change the eye rolling ending.
