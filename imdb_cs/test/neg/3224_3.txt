This movie may be o.k. if not for all the languages ​​in it. I think the story itself is not bad, but I would be too embarrassed to see a movie for my wife or children. I know that children will learn all the oaths on the way, that is true, but parents should not help them in the process by allowing them to see and hear things in the fun mask. I used to be Robert Loggia; He has a distinctive harsh quality with his coarse voice, but in the last few years I've seen that these are roles with lots of language in them. If we were worth the excessive use of the word F, it would have to be a candidate. Unfortunately, I think he lost me as a fan. When I see his name on movies in the future, I'll think twice about picking up that title. Look, I'm not the prude. Sometimes I use the language even in extreme circumstances, but when we look at the movie, it is because of what we hope will bring us joy and escape. I don't want to be alerted to what's happening in the streets of any big city these days, and it's hard to ask whether a movie is fine so my family can watch. <br /> <br /> I like Matt Modine, too, but it's a shame that he teamed up with a picture that left his image like that. Probably did o.k. working in a movie but I turned off about a quarter of the way after I had my ears attacked too often by others in the cast. Why can't these actors say no when these scripts ask to continue this language? Once enough actors (especially big names) are upset about it, writers stop putting in movies! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry but I can't recommend this picture. It's also a shame, because I think it would be okay if it were good enough to look at decent families! Thank goodness I only had $ 2.00 left for it!
