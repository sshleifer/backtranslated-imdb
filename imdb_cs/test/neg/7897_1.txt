This might be the worst movie ever made, in a league with films like "Howard the Duck", "Plan 9 From Outer Space" and "Ishtar". I don't understand why I decided to see this movie because it was a waste of my life. I also don't understand why this movie would like it, regardless of their sense of humor. Negotiations are among the worst I've ever seen, just like writing. The characters are stupid and there's no funny scene in the whole movie. Tom Arnold is perhaps the worst actor ever - this film proves it. There is nothing worthy of this film. Don't hire it, don't look at it, or say it looks interesting. It's bad enough to see it.
