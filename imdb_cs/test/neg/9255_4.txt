All right, finally look at this underrated flick. But you can't find a good copy, a terrible copy full of green drops, the cut is not synchronized, the sound sometimes has a terrible hiss and sometimes you can even hear the camera recording. Overall, it's too dark, you should say the passport of time, but it's not. It's a little slow, the first half of the movie is all it talks about and loves each other. It's still strange that girls in the 60's films never wear a bra. When she enters the bedroom, it is full of glory. By the way, banned in the UK since 84 and still on the list of video nasties. The reason is simple, it's a cruel time. It's really some nasty breakage and it's scary somehow because it's being shot by a camcorder. So every slide that moves, things that do these days with steadycam. Gastly Ones might be better if the quality of the film was better, but still better than other movies of the time, such as the Kindergarten in Chains.
