This film is the proverbial 80s that shows the viewer that if they try to do something, they can be better than professionals. The main character, Doug, showed off his flying skills on the Cessna plane, which in some way compared him to being able to fly a jet and be able to kill people. We all want to play with a few million dollars ... maybe we make a good investment, donate, buy a few things, but the directors of this movie have decided to make Iron Eagle ... not once ... not twice ... not three times; yes, four times. The thing that looks the most in this movie is a lot of "Hollywood endings." Just when you think the movie will end after the mocking end of the sequence, there's another mocking sequence. Then another. Certainly a movie that he has to watch to believe ... and maybe his own, just to remind himself of how awesome the 80s had to be.
