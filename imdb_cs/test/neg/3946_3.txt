This movie wasn't very good in my opinion. Although it is not a complete waste of an hour and a half (fortunately I didn't have to pay for it), it just wasn't very scary. There were parts where I jumped and a few minimally violent / cruel scenes, but overall, just someone scared would consider this movie scary. Characters have never evolved or grown up like humans. Even at the end, the man, no matter what his name was, didn't come out and had to be rescued from the fire at the last minute. The plot also had discrepancies. The policeman who was killed was not murdered in the same way he died in the game. October said that in order to kill an evil demon, you had to read something of the correct text. Funny how they never bothered to do it and still managed to escape. Malcolm-in-the-Middle child died in the game but didn't die "in real life." The game itself was also very weak. It would be okay for my brother's death to play them again. But you should play a video game and stay alive and 3 people will die before you play again ... why do you need a game? If you like movies like Ring and its scary and fun stuff, watch this movie. If you know someone like that, you can watch him laughing. If you like "horror" movies that make you laugh out loud and you have the opportunity to watch this movie for free, do it. Otherwise stay away.
