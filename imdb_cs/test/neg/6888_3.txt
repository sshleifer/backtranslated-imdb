I unsubscribed this video, which I like. I like it. I like foreign movies, I like beautiful cinematography, I know critics like this movie (including my favorite, Roger Ebert) and I don't mind "slow" movies. Well, it's beautiful. That's probably the best thing I can say. The plot is very thin, the shots are very long, the views are very meaningful, the actors are very honest and it looks like a very long movie. In the middle of the road I fell asleep, woke up, rewound the tape, tried again. It was a trial, but I did it by the end. I didn't like that.
