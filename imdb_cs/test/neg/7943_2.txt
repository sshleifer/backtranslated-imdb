This movie definitely laughed at me, but that doesn't mean it was totally funny. Well, then, me and my friends we had a lot of fun watching it. I doubt that there is something about this movie that hasn't been done at least twice, just like the plot itself. All characters are exaggerated roles of clich√©s that do not require acting skills; these skills are therefore not met. We have a corrupt cop, a ruthless murderer who claims to care for his men and their families, while he doesn't care about the people who shoot in the forehead on such a close range that his face shoots blood. We have a "worn-out cop on the edge", so nicely pointed to the discussion forums of this movie; we have an old one-day cop who almost everyone has to immediately identify himself as the most likely person on the inside because he should get the most out of it and not say a trusted word in the whole movie. Probably as translucent as a glass house on a sunny day. The big black gangster king was a copy of all the previous big black gangster kings in film history (they could just call him Marcellus Wallace), but just a little harder and reckless because something must emphasize that we also know Laurence Fishburne of the good movies. Then we finally have a highly educated doctor who can't think of anything wise to do once the situation differs from her normal life and who spends most of the movie sitting in the corner helplessly trying to figure out how to hold the weapon she got. DO NOT USE THIS. <br /> <br /> The whole story of the siege is not interesting, not original (which has been used twice before), and this film gives it nothing interesting. There is an initial probe, then a lay of siege, then an attack, then an escape attempt. Meanwhile, a bunch of tense, stressed, frightened cops and criminals will be able to detain a police assault team with technologically advanced equipment and quite an important advantage of VISION. Then again, in a deep night, with a power outage and a snowstorm overhead, there is definitely a lot of light coming in, so who really cares about night vision. But the best part comes at the end. In the first scenes showing 13, we can see that it is located in the outskirts of the industrial city; factories and office buildings surround it from all sides. From this moment, a besieged walk maybe a hundred meters in the sewer and where will it end? Some alleys ending right in the middle of the forest! FOREST! Where did the forest come from? Who decided to lay a pine forest in the middle of an industrial area? How is this forest, in the last scene, suddenly on a hill above the city, while FLAT ??? From here I leave the court and your common sense. Go and see this movie if you are looking for an unexpected good laugh, I can really recommend it.
