This film is a catastrophe in a catastrophic film. It is full of great action scenes that only make sense when you throw away all the sense of reality. Let's look at the word of the wise, the lava will burn you; steam will burn you. You can't stand next to lava. Redirecting the smaller lava flow is difficult, let alone significant. It scares me to think that some might believe what they saw in this movie. Worse is the considerable amount of talent that made this film. I think acting is actually very good. The effects are above average. It is hard to believe that anyone has read the script and allowed this talent to be wasted. I think my suggestion would be if this movie was going to start on TV ... look away! It's like a train wreck: it's so bad that once you know what's coming, you just have to watch. Take a look and dedicate your time to more meaningful content.
