Rocketship X-M should be seen by every serious movie enthusiast for the following reasons: 1) It's one of the first - and the few - movies that don't have a happy ending. The result was undoubtedly much deeper in America after World War II than it would be today, but the sad ending adds to the film's message. 2) It is also one of the first films to cosmic travel in a serious way, using space as a valid drama environment. Despite the lack of scientific background, the film stands on its own as a dramatic fare. It's not so much a cosmic drama as it is a drama set in space. 3) The Nuclear War Report is delivered in a serious way that is not lost in the Sfx including large locusts, men, or animals. The influence of the Martian society on nuclear devastation is strictly and sincerely presented. The fact that survivors from the expedition crash on the ground and as such are unable to preach the lessons of Mars adds another element of sadness to the tragic end. Sterno says he's going to go on Rocketship X-M.
