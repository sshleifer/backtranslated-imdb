Maybe it was an excess of Seagal's weight gain. Or maybe it was a terrible act of Wayans in action. Or was it a complete lack of chemistry between the two main characters? These and other considerations lead me to the conclusion that Seagal should never do this nightmare. True, the story was good. Yet, as a passionate supporter of Seagal's career and background, his physical appearance was contrary to his genre of pure, pure, healthy Zen Buddhist, especially in his discussion on the Wayans screen. (Then again his real affair with the "babysitter" was also inconsistent!) <br /> <br /> If Seagal wants to become a more diversified actor, then he should do what the common character did in "Kindergarten Cop". ... funny materials or scenario situations where the actor has no choice but to react comically. Otherwise, leave wise cracks and futile attempts to humor it while chasing a serial killer. Seagal is not a natural type of humor. It did not work. <br /> <br />
