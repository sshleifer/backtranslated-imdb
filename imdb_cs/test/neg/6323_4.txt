George Segal lives with his older and senile mother. There are many jokes about her dementia of Alzheimer's dementia, and most of them are not funny, though there have been some funny moments here and there (eg Naked Run through the Park Scene and Old People's Home). Segal first tries to kill his mother because it is hard to live and because he is a selfish guy. Making a film in some way like Wiley Coyote versus Roadrunner, where it is trying to kill this indestructible gal again and again, would be terrible - not too bad for the film. I appreciate Carl Reiner's effort to make a tasteless movie that should offend everyone. I have a special place in my hearts for movies like ED AND HIS CHILDREN'S MOTHER, RAOUL FOOD and HAPPINESS KATAKURIS - all movies about death that dare offend. But the problem is that it is POPPA? he has some funny moments, but he also has a lot of flat and the whole product is amazingly bland. Topics such as gay rape, incest, and the like are really hard to make funny. I read in "THE ROUGH GUIDE TO CULT MOVIES" that he is considered a cult film, even if I just don't see anyone wanting to see it more than once.
