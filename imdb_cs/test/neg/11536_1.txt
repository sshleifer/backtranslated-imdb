I know that when you buy used (oops, excuse me, previously viewed) DVDs for $ 5.99, you shouldn't have very high expectations, but even that was a steep price for this bad box disc. <br /> <br /> I will provide producers with credit for providing a comprehensive viewer challenge. . . Find out what's the worst, acting, scripting, camera work, special effects. . . All pretty much tie just plain horrible. Oh, it has an absolutely worst fake car crash ever used in film anywhere. Now this is all quite a bit of a mockery for a movie fan who proudly presents 'Police Academy', 'Naked Gun', 'National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon' and many other campy discs in his collection, but at least those people know that language should be firmly set in the face, PW cast, unfortunately they use their languages ​​in an effort to deliver inane And although it's almost out of my faith, movie characters seem to think they could actually do something worthwhile . I was lucky to have bought the worst video ever made at the same time. ... "Fraternity Demon" ... maybe the name should suggest that.
