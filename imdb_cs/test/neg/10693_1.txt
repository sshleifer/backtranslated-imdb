Odious Chuck Norris has decided to put one final nail <br /> <br /> into his coffin, which will include his film career before embarking on a safe world of CBS <br /> <br /> Saturday Night with this hysterically bad supernatural /> <br /> actioner. For this stupid movie, this thing is certainly a conspiracy. Norris is Chicago <br /> <br /> cop Frank Shatter. First, what surname is "Shatter"? Have you ever met any Shatters? Genforum.com has no entry for the <br /> <br /> Shatter surname that opens every semi-clever browser <br /> <br /> to replace "a" in Shatter "i." He and his partner, Calvin <br /> <br /> Jackson, do the same old friend's friend you saw <br /> <br /> before: make fun with pimps and make them captain mad. Jackson, looking like a theoretical love darling Whoopi Goldberg <br /> <br /> and Rick James, is fast on nerves with continual complaints and Eddie Murphy's patented facial expressions. Shatter and Calvin get involved with Satan's envoy, <br /> <br /> who we've put in too long opening scenes. Prosatano is a demon that is locked in the crypt of King Richard. The scepter of the demon from which he gets his strength is torn to nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of the world. In 1951, some grave robbers accidentally released Prosatano out and he begins to collect nine pieces. He <br /> <br /> disguises himself as a Lockley professor of antiques and <br /> <br /> always happens to be lecturing where a holy man is killed <br /> <br /> and we take a scepter. Norris in his "Walker: Texas Blunder" Sheree Wilson cohort, who plays Lockley's assistant. She helps Norris with his <br /> <br /> investigation, make goo goo eyes on each other, and our <br /> <br /> fearless investigators travel to Israel after being killed by a rabbi in <br /> <br Chicago. While in Israel, Calvin is given even more to complain about: warmth, lack of restaurant accommodation, miserable <br /> <br /> drivers, and the fact that he lacks the Chicago Bulls playoff <br /> <br /> Games. Norris can even work with a cute Israeli boy into this nightmare. He steals Calvin's wallet and hangs around the men, leading them around Israel and bringing no kind of <br /> <br /> suspicion. Finally Lockley (Prosatano) assembles all the scepters <br /> <br /> pieces, but needs the royal blood to complete the ceremony <br /> <br /> and call the devil. Where to find royal blood? Well, Sheree's <br /> <br /> Father's Duke! She has an American accent, but she is <br /> <br /> scriptwriters' convenient way to force this monstrosity <br /> <br /> towards his inevitable conclusion. Sure, this minion of Satan can <br /> <br /> kill countless hundreds over the years, but how is it <br /> <br /> going to do against a good old fashioned American kickin 'ass? After Prosatano was defeated, killed by his own scepter (I envious of him, he didn't have to look at Bezi to steal Calvin's wallet <br /> <br />), we're treated for horrible coda involving a bearded man <br /> <br /> who watched the shutter, I mean Shatter, and Calvin on <br /> <br /> their search. You see, it was predicted ... somewhere ... that the two <br /> <br /> Western fighters beat Prosatan. Silent <br /> <br /> The bearded man who was watching the couple was none other than Jesus ... I ... I can't make you. He is listed as a "prophet" in the final credits, but you and your pets will recognize the fine Christian <br /> <br /> references that filmmakers seek to display here. Br /> <br /> As in "I Use Walker: Texas Ranger", Norris is getting older and can't get too much in the battle scenes. He kicks a lot, and <br /> <br /> people fly through furniture in slow motion, and then Norris gives everyone <br /> <br /> his line of reading in his monotonous voice. Oh, what can be a real director of fashion! His brother, Aaron, <br /> <br /> who has also directed him to other films, has no sense of story <br /> <br /> or momentum. Scenes are thrown for good ego, not for <br /> <br /> entertainment. Scenes where a dynamic duo first meets Bezi, dragging <br /> <br /> on and on, and then Bezi is not so important to the rest of the movie <br /> <br />. The film was filmed on site in Israel, meaning that the Americans could personally insult the Israelis. There is no Israeli character. Israeli police captain is a jerk. The cop driver doesn't know English and Calvin convinces him that the word "sh * tty" is a compliment. Nothing more fun than <br /> <br /> to mock those silly aliens on their home lawn, especially when this racist humor comes from an American minority <br /> <br /> who would be more than offended if the tables were turned around <br /> <br /> and an Israeli cop mocked an African-American cop in Chicago. This film is poorly written, misbehaved and poorly managed. It doesn't work like an action, drama drama or even a horror movie. It just shows that <br /> <br /> the now defunct Cannon Studios were willing to throw their money <br /> <br /> into anything, no matter how badly planned it was. "Hellbound" is <br /> <br /> the most appropriate title. I didn't like this film intensely. <br /> <br /> This rating is rated (R) for physical violence, weapon violence, strong profanity, some sexual references, and some adult situations. > <br />
