It seems Brave One suggests that the main character is of course brave. I disagree. The more brave it is in a situation like that that happens to become brutally beaten along with her fianc√©e, who does not live the next day from her, to go after the criminals without resorting to a totally distorted view of society. Jodie Foster's character, Eric, is a radio personality who is a niche walking through the streets and recording what's going on. We had no real depth, except that she had someone she loved, died, the police didn't try, she got a gun, yada-yadu-yadu, she gets somewhat, but she doesn't actually take a lead detective. into the character, so they stayed with something left of past films: vigilante of justice, where power is taken over in their own hands. But we are never sure whether Erica is healthy or not if the filmmakers are interested in one way or another (that's the end, which is such a stupid message that it's just like a dog that is the predominant metaphor). Today's New York City, which has become significantly safer than, say, twenty years ago, seemed to succeed if you set out on the right aisle or just sitting alone on a subway car. There might even be a slightly better film at the center of it all - maybe just in the untouched undercover with detective Terence Howard, who is involved in some battle for a child who is not his and his wife, is not associated with a stepfather who, I don't know what except that own parking space and is a bad dude - but we are left on a script that is both ham-fisted and disjoined with logic. For example, it becomes ridiculous to see that initially Eric's logical side, who failed to shoot properly, as seen in her first shop shoot at the right moment of the wife's theft - and then retreated to the illogical cracking of her on a pimp who was driving her head on and killing him and nodding just in time to get away. This does not help that Jordon's style with the camera becomes a little more than unbearable: it is the so-called Stedi-cam because of *, not because he could join and leave. Ironically, Scenario and Direction are becoming very good, or rather they work best as they can under the circumstances: looking at a real battle under the bridge, captured between the video footage of one of the criminals by a regular movie in camera pace that is totally disorienting. And when Erica returns to the air for the first time on her radio show and freezes, she tries to make her old shtick and speaks "out of her heart" about how scared she is - this scene, from Foster's performance, Clear Direction and Scenario is Best scene in the movie. But besides, there are very many people in psychology that is fragile: is De Niro in Taxi Driver or Bronson in Death Wish? We have her stories about scenes, some of which she doesn't have to do with her radio show, watching her disgusted at going out at night, having nothing to do but her own task of cleaning the streets. But unlike the Death Wish movie, a film that held more ambiguity and never sustained an answer at the end of a revenge scenario, a journey of endless violence just attention to a message that wouldn't be new to anyone who saw the second Lifetime movie-of-the-week melodrama. Actors do with what is given, and eventually becomes much more frustrating trying to stay with the expected, hackneyed plot turns, and plain old inexplicable (plus unintentionally cheerful, like a few explosive Howard shouts after fired on one scene) and the temptation to go out grows stronger and stronger. It is a very problematic picture, just a few moments of real interest and clear bending of conventions.
