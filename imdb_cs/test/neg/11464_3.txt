This movie is called "Solomon Kane". Which is not. The main character wears a hat, but that's all it has to do with Robert Howard Solomon Kane, as is known from early magazines and a lot of publications since then. It's a fantasy movie, not so bad, and it could easily pass with a fairly good review - if it wasn't called Solomon Kane. The hero is a newly invented character who is definitely not SK. The story is not Robert Howard, nor. As a fantasy film, this is another film that follows the genre tradition: a simple story, a poor CGI, a poor actor, a bad director. Yet it may be fun, you know, "the cheaper they are, the better they are". But because it is called Solomon Kane, I cannot accept it. Imagine the film of the Lord of the Rings with the hero Bilbo, who fights the black wizard Saugalf with the help of his dwarf friend Aragorn and the beautiful heroine Shadowfax. And with the last battle, where three use a magic ring to kill an evil wizard who turned into a Gondor dragon. Imagine that. That's exactly what this movie did with Robert Howard Solomon Kane. If it was just another horror movie, I'd give it 4 stars, but since it's called Solomon Kane, I can only rate 3 stars.
