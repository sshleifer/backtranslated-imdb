It was appreciated that it was a fast-paced comedy with a screwdriver and the best German movie of the year, so I tried, even though I saw some Dani Levy movies - or at least some of them. I've got what I expected: no comedy at all if you think heart attacks are funny. It's a great example of sloppy on-screen writing, with an improbable plot and characters loaded with clich√©s that could be true, but they're certainly not even funny. The most unpleasant character is Zucker's wife, played by Hannelore Elsner. He must behave incredibly strangely to keep the plot moving. For example: There is no one thing about Judaism, but it seems to be most likely that she will play a charade that she and her family are Jewish laws that obey Jews for the family of her husband who really are, and very true and self-righteous varieties. To make it a bit more complicated, four of them invite them to stay in their city apartment because they come from Frankfurt, Berlin, without pre-booking their hotels, some 60 years old man, actually no adult German ever. This gives the viewer plenty to swallow, but still doesn't produce any jokes. Zucker and his brother Samuel have not seen each other for forty years, but his daughter - now a lesbian - and Samuel's son - now a militant orthodox - have been shown to be lovers and the father of his daughter. Samuel's daughter - a nymphomaniac - follows Zucker's homosexual son. Should it be a humorous parody of Jewish incestuous tendencies? It's probably just a mindless way to add some "love action turbulence" to every comic need. And of course, he doesn't produce any jokes. The praise of this film is purely political. Therefore, only people who like movies to be "politically important" will be able to enjoy - even if "Alles auf Zucker!" it clearly has no meaning of any kind. <br /> <br /> For everyone else: Don't look at it without "Fast forward". I really missed it.
