Part of the low film rating is the emphasis on unemployment and suffering that we must endure. Although it is good for drama, comedy, we know the pain that is not to be emphasized. As a result of Fun with Dick and Jane is not a good title and I was just disappointed when I saw no fun with Dick and Jane. It is true that this is a copy of the film of the same name, but fails to execute and the title was not suitable for the story line. But if the film was forwarded to "The Art of the Steal" and the emphasis on bungling grotesque comedy takes more theft and plans for theft (stupidly of course) would give the film significant support. While at the same time the film should show to the CEO at least in the beginning to become a cheater, it will be easier to project pain to someone who will be responsible at the beginning. The film suffers from a problem and in view of this, comedy cannot work unless the aspect is properly done. Scheming the husband's character that is Wile E. Coyote on the Runner Road would be more funny, including slapstick comedy. But in this case, instead of capturing a bird with complicated contraptive cases, it would be extremely funny. I think you can do a lot of them and put them in the movie. But because the point of view was wrong, the robbery had to be limited. You'll enjoy the movie for the first 15 minutes (during Jim Carrey's big rise), but the problems they faced. to be comical, because it's a comedy, that's the part that needs a major overhaul. This may be more fun if the problems encountered during the fall were more of John Travolta's civilian action. The movie was serious, but the problems they faced were somewhat comical.
