I totally agree that reenactments will kill what might otherwise be a great show. I admit that I saw 1 or 2 episodes last season and I wasn't sure that it was all remedied. But when I recently caught one episode, BIG TIME suddenly jumped on me and immediately lost interest. Then I noticed the exclusion at the beginning before the episode that followed. Someone was watching something like that to tell me, in fact they are doing "acting" and reenacting parts in a more deliberate way, or I haven't noticed before. I'm usually pretty good at feeling it, but the recent episode was so obviously artificial that I practically tripped it. Now I have no interest in watching and giving up completely. It just has no real value if it's all written and acted. And at least lately, he seems to be very poorly written and acting. Note above that says who cares if it's all reenactments, me. Without visual truth, it's just a bunch of "you know what happened this time this guy" heresay. It's better in the book.
