Riggs and Murtough are back, but the spell of the first movie has broken down. The story is just awful! Indeed, South African diplomats are smuggling the mythical Krugerrandy to the US It's just painful! And the accents are absolutely bleak! Nobody can get the Afrikaans South African accent right? Or will we hear forever how the British or Americans sound like drunk Hollanders? The only one who has the Afrikaans accent was Tim Robbins in Catch A Fire. Another thing about this movie that I didn't like was when Danny Glover undoubtedly describes the Afrikaans accent as crazy! I mean, what's the slap in Afrikaans. There is also enough hypocrisy in this film to vomit me. I think the character of Mel Gibson is as such against diplomats, but then sleeps with their P.A. type! Don't waste your time watching this pointless movie. If you want to see a movie that totally offends the cultural group then rent out Die Hard 2.
