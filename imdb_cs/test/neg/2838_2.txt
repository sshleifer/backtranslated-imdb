Let me see if I have this right, crazy murderer of murderers killing real estate agents .... well ... what's wrong with the script, I can live with it. <br /> <br /> What's next, slasher with tax inspectors defeated? Traffic guards cut to death? Should we feel sympathy for people with empty heads and shallow money? No ... <br /> <br /> Sadly, fun aside, it's not just a very well made movie with bad acting and rough effects, the climate scene is particularly stupid. You can almost see a director shouting, 'action' to a stuntman when he flops through a glass window. As another reviewer, he quite rightly said, after starring in 'The Fog', Adrienne Barbeau's career. That's why I was glad to light him up again by becoming Catwoman's voice in the Batman animated series while watching the extras on Catwoman's live movie. By the way, it's not quite a scary movie. But this is a bad movie, I think the bad episode 'Kojak' or 'Streets of San Francisco', and you get an idea of ​​what's on offer.
