This movie is ridiculous. He's trying to be a comedy, but the script is terrible. The whole movie is done in low light and you can't understand it's a comedy. It's really bad cinema. You have to really sit there and see how you realize that here and there are some jokes that are happening, but in any case they are all inside jokes with each other. It's more like a drama that went wrong. It's really a pointless movie. Their expressions reveal nothing but the horror and catastrophe that shows up anyway. If you don't want to get bored from your ass, I suggest that you don't stay away from this movie gag.
