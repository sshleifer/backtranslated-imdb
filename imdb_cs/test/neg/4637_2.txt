This film has been advertised in Greece for more than three months as the greatest Greek production ever. It could be, but ... When you hear about big production, you expect something new, something else. You are watching the film here for no reason. George Corraface does not seem to have used this film. His actions are so simplistic that he looks almost amateurish. Sound, especially when some Turkish actors speak English (dubbed?), Is full of hiss. Fortunately, a few special effects showing Istanbul and Athens in the late 1950s and early 1970s are digital images rather than computer graphics. Finally, we see the same boy from 1959 (5 years) to 1968 (14 years old), but miraculously he becomes a teenager five years later. So much for the "greatest Greek productions." At the very least, one would think there would be some interesting scenario that would qualify for such a costly production. -years who meet again 40 years later There's also a political party A few ironic remarks about the Greek "junta" of '67 -'74, so childish, which seem almost forced. <br /> <br Of course, there are some good things in the movie: most of the actors are great, especially Ieroklis Michaelidis, very good scenery and the beautiful music of Evanthi Remboutsik, but they are so little on such expensive production. The truth is, I don't know, I only know that in no way does it justify its huge budget (for Greek standards).
