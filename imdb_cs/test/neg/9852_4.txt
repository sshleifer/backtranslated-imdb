The TV show was slow and "unusual" characters were sometimes irritating. Only through the rapid shift miracle was I able to do it for the first two hours. The record suggests it's a comedy / secret, but I haven't seen much. <br /> <br /> If it really starts after the first 2 hours, please let me know because I doubt I will follow the rest without a recommendation. <br /> <br /> This rating is supposed to be without a spoiler, so I will continue in a vague, non-spoiler fashion. I found two main characters uninteresting and unsympathetic. I found myself asking, "Would a normal adult do that?" The man with the carved fence looking out the window teased, and when the male leader worked with him, he looked woeful. Could a normal adult give someone as exciting as he was?
