Why would Burt Lancaster play a poor schnook, which is ultimately undermined by the femme fatale Anna Dundee, played by Yvonne DeCarlo in 'Criss Cross'? The same reason why Robert Mitchum allows himself to be cast as another loser who falls on the femme fatale Faith Domergue in the 1950's noir, "where danger lives". Perhaps they both felt that it was a good way to show that they had a "range" as actors who play against the type, the usual "hard guy" they were known for, and thus strengthen their image as actors who could play any role. The problem, however, was that roles like Steve Thompson, a pathetic love valentine who had acted in "Criss Cross", did nothing to improve Lancaster's career. Not only is Lancaster misunderstood as Thompson in one remark, but there is something that is primarily impossible (and I may say, pathetic) about the film's protagonist. 'Criss Cross' is an infinitely slow moving movie. Among the many unnecessary scenes in the film is the beginning: a retrospective that captures Thompson's confrontation with Dundee Dan Durye in a nightclub. Everything that appears in this initial flash is explained later in the picture: an unlawful affair between Steve and Anna, Steve's tense relationship with Martinez, a cop and his bad blood with Dundee. If director Siodmark felt compelled to start a flashback movie, why not leave it under three minutes? I think it would be more effective. It takes a long time for 'Criss Cross' before the protagonist commits himself and exits the "ordinary" world of One. This is the scene in which she "misses" and "runs to" Anna in the nightclub and notices how Siodmak spends so much time between Anna dancing and watching Steve. Spend a lot of time focusing on Esy Morales and his Rhumba Band before moving the story along. Until the Law Crisis Two, the story of the frus along with Thompson with various dissatisfied encounters with Anna and then on Wednesday of the Second Law he learns that Anna ran away and got married to Dundee, at this point she is getting clearer that one of the main weaknesses of the movie is that Dundee is never on screen. During this time there are no confrontations between Thompson and Dundee, and we are left with somewhat insincere machinations between the two lovebirds. And as it turns out (and Anna 'explains later Steve), the reason she left was not just because he disappeared eight months, but she also felt the pressure from Steve's mother as well as the direct threat from Martinez, a policeman who indicated that he would make sure she would end up in a women's prison. Anna returns to Steve because she realizes she and Dundee made a big mistake. It turns out she beats her and now she's afraid of him. One of the stupid choruses voiced by more than one person in Criss Cross is that you can never kidnap an armored car. But everyone is so surprised when Steve points out that it can be if it is "internal work"! You'd think Dundee would know about Steve's "profession" as an armored car driver and suggested it in advance. But Steve, of course, has to make a suggestion for Dundee not to kill him after discovering his relationship with Anna (if he is so afraid of catching up, why Steve and Anna meet in their apartment where Dundee is so easy to find)? I really got a kick from Finchley (played by Alan Napier), 'brains' operation. Dundee is so stupid that he has to hire this former alcoholic professor who maps a robbery on the map. There's a question of procuring raw materials for the construction of gas bombs used for robbery, and of course Finchley is good at that too! <br /> <br /> The only really well done scene in the whole movie is an armored car robbery. The cut was pretty good because it depicted a growing robbery action that was bad. As gas bombs go out, gang brutality is shown in high relief when Dundee assassinates an innocent armored car guard. <br /> <br /> The top of the movie is stretched just like the rest of the movie. Why does it take so long for one of Dundee's goons to kidnap Thompson? There's a sister, then a goon outside, then she comes and pretends to be a friend, Steve falls asleep and finally after waking up Goon kidnaps him. When Steve finally meets Anna in the house, we wondered how Anna got her hands on cash. Did he somehow steal him from Dundee after a robbery when he went to dinner? It is never explained. Worse yet, Anna suddenly becomes an evil femme fatale from heaven. Previously, her selfishness and attraction to Dundee can be explained by her perceived rejection by Steve and Martinez. Returning to Steve because he is afraid of Dundee, he inexplicably turns to him when he is most vulnerable. Like "instant coffee" you have an "instant femme fatale". <br /> <br /> In "Film Noir" The Encyclopedia of American Style "by Silver and Ward, the authors call 'Criss by The Cross is" one of the most tragic and compelling films of noir. I dare to disagree. To have a tragedy, you need characters that have a great depth and need a story that is credible to be convincing. Criss Cross doesn't. It's an overrated "B Movie" that somehow found itself in the pantheon of artistic noir. Again, the herd mentality triumphed in the evaluation of images from ancient times.
