I was really amazed to find out that someone would need so much time to judge such a bad movie. The beginning (film) was right about it. The "AF" guerrilla was launched in 1943, when two Communist pilots from the Croatian Ustashi AF left together with their observers at Breguet 19 and Potez 33, respectively. The plane saw some action in strafing and hand-bombing, but did not last long. One crew was killed and the other survived, the pilot was killed later while flying the Spitfire Vc. Real guerrilla squadrons were founded when the RAF separated two of its (Yugoslav) squadron Spitfire Vc and Hurricane IIc, respectively, occupied by Ex Yugoslav Royal Airforce pilots, and assigned them to Tito's forces on the island of Vis. Even those were never involved in air-to-air activities, but strictly for ground support. So the film was one huge cow dung, to say the least, the lowest point of his, otherwise not bad, director. By some joke of fate, I was present at the filming of the last film sequence, when dozens of German aircraft (Yugoslav 522 trainers who were also used in flying sequences) were destroyed at Mostar military airport. The pyrotechnics were impressive and the Scottish delicacy served the film crew even better. Otherwise, the film was a shameful lie and was often joked by the current viewer.
