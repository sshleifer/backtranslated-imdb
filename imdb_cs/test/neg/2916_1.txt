Possible Spoiler record, though there is not much spoil about this movie. I saw Project A Part II that didn't see the first movie. I don't think I missed a lot. Project A's second part is not only the worst movie of Jackie Chan I have seen today (yes worse than "Fantasy Mission Force"), this film is one of the most unnoticeable movies the world has ever seen. It's right there with Plan 9 From Outer Space on a sleep-inducing scale. The plot is twisted up and bound as a 50 foot ball of yarn with which the cat played and eventually went to the dead. "Humor", if you could call it, seems to have been written by an annoying high school high schoolman who, despite many people telling him he is not funny, is determined to get his lame humor no matter how painful he is. film. And this film is painfully bad. The plot includes Jackie Chan as a Navy officer recruited by police forces to round up all known criminals. In the first half hour of the film, they round them up and pray for the quick end that I didn't get. Why does the film worry from now on, I have no idea. The film goes on and on and without any purpose, without conspiracy and humor attempts that fail so unhappy that Carrot Top looks like a comedic genius. Kung Fu in this movie is lame and forgotten. There's Kung Fu about three Ninja kids in the movie. Part II is neither an action film nor a kung-fu movie, but it is a complete waste of Jackie Chan and Maggie Cheung's talents who have made films world-class. As Jackie Chan repeatedly escapes some death, I enter Blair Witch, who asks (and wishes) to die NOW, so the movie can end? An example of how ridiculous this movie is: Jackie Chan is tied to another man. Pirates' gang (who looks like pirates) throws on Jackie's axes, grabs Jackie one of the directional axes and breaks the chain on handcuffs? if you have a friend who laughs at everything, I suggest you watch this movie with him and watch the movie get rid of laughter. This movie is sure to make you sleep .Do not use heavy machines while watching Plan A part II .Possible side effects include headache, retina strain, and boredom death.
