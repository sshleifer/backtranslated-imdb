It's funny how instinct warns you about something. For example, once the company read Nu Image, I knew instinctively that I had seen some stupid things somewhere in front of them, but I didn't remember where. But I knew that JUDGE AND JURY would be bullshit and it was. Maybe I'm psychic? <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! Opening is somewhat violent because several people are blown away for nothing more than being in the wrong place at the wrong time. I do not know about you, but nowadays I am a little disgusted by exploitative violence and bad language, especially if it is interpreted as badly by the actor as in this movie. The plot revolves around a bad dude who is executed and returns to the revenge of a man who shot his wife. Did I mention the wrong dude and his wife murdered a few people on their wedding night? Yeah, it's a serious horrible mofo. In fact, he is so bad (and I don't mean acting - I'm going to do that in the moment), that it is impossible to take it seriously, and that is before he is executed to come back as Elton John, Elvis, a French chef, etc. me if Keith David paid for it? because it looks lke that he has so much fun on the screen that he's the only reason he plays a role. Too bad this reviewer had no fun watching JUDGE AND JURY. Hey, maybe the producers could send me Keith's fee? Gawd only knows I deserve it. I didn't really like this movie as if you didn't think and my main beef is not with a stupid plot or cheap production value but with an attitude towards violence. If you like me had a wine bottle cracked over your head or you were several times dug into the ribs, you will know that violence is an obscene painful thing, but JUDGE AND JURY will believe you if you toss a window, crash over some bannisters and fall twenty The odd feet on the table will not only be undamaged, but you will be able to overtake a few angry devil dogs. Of course, it could be argued that any film that plays Sly, Arnie, or Bruce also suffers from this dishonest manifestation of violence, but with JUDGE and JURY who tore off my chain
