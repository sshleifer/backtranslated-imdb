Even my five-year-old was bored. <br /> <br /> Very predictable and redesigned. This film couldn't figure out whether it was a slapstick or comment on the state of pee-wee sports. The characters were underdeveloped, their father and son could be more interconnected, both coming from a children's home. He didn't like the link on the goalkeeper to slip through the laxative to his teammate ... that's a very lively movie for kids. The typical "mafia" behavior was boring and stereotypical. But the dog was so damn cute !!!!
