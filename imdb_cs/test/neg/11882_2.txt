When it comes to historical accuracy, it's the absolute worst Roman movie I've ever seen. A list of not only mistakes but also ideas that are impossible could run longer than a three-hour movie, but just to give you the idea ... Democrats, taking the "people" side against "nobles". This is absolutely absurd. Caesars was as noble as you could. Their interest was in consolidating power and stabilizing a country that was destroyed by 150 years of civil war. There were reformers, especially the Gracchi brothers who lived 100 years earlier, and to some extent advocated the rights of ordinary citizens. <br /> <br /> There are several scenes that are absolutely ridiculous if you know something about the season. "Cleopatra", with Richard Burton, will give you a much better idea of ​​how events are developing, they are fantastic, even if it is. <br /> <br /> Historical accuracy is one thing. Negotiations and dialogue are different, and here the film is dangerously coming to be a bad junior high school. I laughed several times, especially when Julia, the daughter of Augustus, met a lover. He clings passionately when he breathes: "My father ..." "Oh, your father, your father ... your father wouldn't agree." Peter O'Toole is in his worst place, forcing him to bite very pompous and stupid lines. The actor who plays Augusto as a young man is such a fool - and the character is written as such - it is impossible to imagine him as a cunning, crafty, machiavellian politician who created the Roman Empire. Here's just a fool who has to be told what to do most of the time. Charlotte Rampling emerges from the dignified role of Livia, August's wife. If she could play a fuller role, she could save this production from absurdity. Oddly, this was done for British television (and seems to be a British-Italian co-production) but is marked with "R" rating. <br /> <br /> The DVD image is excellent and the Dolby digital soundtrack is very nice, even if you only notice it during a few action sequences, because the movie is mostly talk. Almost every Roman film, even "Cleopatra" or "The Fall of the Roman Empire", has more historicity - not to say anything about a convincing drama - than about this bizarre adaptation of Classics Illustrated, Jr.. This gives a new meaning to the abused phrase "Based on a real story." In this case, they could say, "They suggested real events."
