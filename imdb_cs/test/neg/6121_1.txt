This movie was a waste of time. It looks nice, nice settings, nice dealings, looks serious and seems to be running somewhere, so you stay tuned and wait for a meaningful reward. It will not happen. I was surprised that so much effort could be put into the movie, it was clearly very professionally done, and the result that seems nothing less than b-movie. Save your precious time and watch a good French movie like Les Visiteurs (funny), Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring. I can't remember the Europa Europa language, but that's another great movie - hard, but worth seeing. It seems that this movie promises a lot, but it doesn't mean anything.
