When I listen to my parents, watch it (after giving up 10 minutes of the movie), they have no idea what's going on. When "Charles Dickens" stared at the camera, I half expected him to become a demon (yes, he looked like one). Unfortunately, it didn't happen. This movie had different reasons why I didn't finish it: one, it was unbearably slow. Seriously, it was SLOWW. You can only understand 10% of what is said, and characters have been misrepresented. If you have an English accent and you like LOTTT speaking, no action, terrible play, cheesy laughter and the same music / sound effects that have been played over and over again, this is the movie for you ... /> <br /> 1/10 - absolutely awful. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost.
