I can't believe the number of people referring to leading characters like 'cow boys' !! there is no such thing people !!!! There are cows and bulls, and all the bovine males are bulls and have no udders !!!! There was even a real bull, but it was as if it were a different kind of animal completely! my god this is like drawing human ears on a cat, breasts on superman, or mickey mouse with blond shirley temple curls - even in animation it just doesn't work! giving human qualities to animals is nothing new and can be expected, but changing their real bodies to basically a transsexual figure is bizarre for a family caricature - how many people - editors, writers, producers, animators have seen it and knew no better or said nothing - it's totally stunning! I'm not a snob and I luv animation- simpsons, beavis & butthead, the southern park, even the ice age and all the other new ones - over the hedge was great - but these are nuts - absolutely nuts- I couldn't accept that many people are that ignorant and I was hoping that the reason for the udder in the movie - an explanation - no one came - and in the end, when holding this little newborn calf and half his belly is udder and pronounced 'his and boy' I almost choked !!!! please writer / creator give us a joke!
