It certainly doesn't cost either money or time. It is a total conspiracy of a guy and a girl's meeting and falling in love. But this is with a western touch. However, it fails either in describing a love story or giving it a western touch. We never think a hero and heroin are in love. None of their characters have any depth. Probably, with better cast, some justice could be brought to the characters. Finally, it is a movie without fun, without playing, without a theme, without a plot, without a comedy, without action, without excitement, without romance (I combine romance with something more passionate). Definitely not a movie you would like to go with your family. Overall, if you're looking for a movie with some content, it's definitely not an option. I'll be waiting for the day when Bollywood movies are something I can wait to see, and I can refer to my friends as a "must watch" movie.
