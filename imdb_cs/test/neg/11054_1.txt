Jeff Leroy wanted to make fun of Scientology, so he put the horror around a cult like it. The twist is that instead of the fragile old L. Ron Hubbard as a cult leader, there is a centuries-old space monster that turns its followers into vampires. Our hero is a dirty living college student who does occult research. His landlord is an attractive blonde who tries to help him clean his life with the help of a cult. It doesn't take long for him to figure out that he has only one thing: his blood. "Screaming" was filmed very cheap on video and I'm just ugly. The space monster (which looks like a giant winged cat that looks constantly insane and has no skin) is alternately miniature clay and a large animatronic puppet, both of which look terrible. Playing and writing are horrible and the director doesn't even try to disguise the fact that this movie was made for nothing. Avoid this scary, pitiful apology.
