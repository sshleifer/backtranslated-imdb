Boring, mocking and stupid "submerged" is a waste of time. Shootouts were a joke, real people not only stand out in the open door without any covers, hoping to be shot first! So many things wrong or wrong, not worth it, except one big mistake. At 500 mph for 20 minutes = about 166 kilometers west of L.A. and the water is 100 feet deep ??? Even in this case, none of the people would have survived decompression since exposure to water pressure of 100 feet for more than 20 hours when they were brought up. Just awful.
