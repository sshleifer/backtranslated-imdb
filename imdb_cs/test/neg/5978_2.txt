This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie stretches and turns on and I almost turned it off, but I did. I expected something big, but I expected it to be more than that. Good thing I'm working on a video store and saw it for free because I would'nt spend one dime on this movie. I'm this movie 2 just because I saw worse. If I were from you, I'd stay far.
