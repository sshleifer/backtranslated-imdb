Why is it that every time I mention this movie to someone I have to hear about it for 10 minutes of praise. I came to the conclusion that every movie that has a twist on a twist is considered a "genius" to watch it. Is it really a movie? Or is it that whenever someone says "Wow, that's so cool", everyone has to agree with them and has no opinion? As this film has a rating of 7.5, it is a shame for the film industry in general. It also became another movie that "needs" two sequels for it, so I'll have to hear about this terrible franchise for quite a while longer. <br /> <br /> Now to the movie and why it's so bad. In fact, the original concept is not so bad because in a moment there was no good serial killer. Writing for this film is horrible, just like execution. OK, so his low budget movie, but it shouldn't change story or writing. Actors could not be worse in their attempt to make us fear of this killer or just fear of this movie. So they go out and get a big name in Danny Glover, but his talent (whatever it is) is unnecessary because HIS CHARACTER IS THE BEST. Why was he even in this movie? What was his overall struggle at the end turned out to be unnecessary and misleading for what viewers believe. This is, of course, the intention of the filmmakers, but we couldn't do it better without watching us. And then comes the "big" twist (that was the third or fourth?) And the whole audience is shocked and leaves the theater like this is a masterpiece. Sure movie gets people talking about the story and what not, but it wasn't the only mistake in this movie. The direction was trying to be too creative with what he was working on, and flashback sequences were only used as a shock effect. <br /> <br /> After watching this movie, even if you enjoyed it, go back to read the movie and you'll soon understand why it's not worthy of the praise it accepts. For an amazing serial killer movie look at Se7en if you haven't. That's what this movie wanted to be. I have come to more arguments about this film than probably about others and will continue to argue against it. Please do not support this license not only for your good but also for me and everyone else. Hollywood needs to find a good horror movie, rather than a 1000 remake, sequel, and "shock" factor movie (like this). Oh yeah, I saw that line 2 saw really promising: "Oh yes, it will be blood." Yaaayyyy !!!! Sweet!! blood, must that mean his good law? Give me a break. I'm sorry everyone who loves this movie, but bad writing, flashy direction and bad play doesn't make a good movie.
