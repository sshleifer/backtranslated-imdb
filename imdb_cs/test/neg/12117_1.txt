Any evening with Jonathan Ross means to me his joke in the first confusion and excitement with carefully selected words, the phone of a 78-year-old man, and then suggest that he and Russell Brand have a house-break and masturbate while he slept as a way to say sorry for his obscene phone calls. Kinky! And illegal. For a really big laugh maybe next time he should try it on someone he knows well, like his boss? Or follower of Abu Hamza? Could he have fun if someone had done one of his daughters? During all my years, I may have seen less than 30 minutes of the BBC Star Man Ross show because I see it as displeasure, some of the guests I've seen were all right - probably most of them they appeared, was fine for all I know. As a chat sample it seems pretty poor when? What is so stupid about Tory describing David Cameron on this TV program, whether he has ever masturbated to Margaret Thatcher's photos? He talked to Gwyneth Paltrow by simply asking her if she wanted him. However, Ross's yob mentality was finally completely revealed with the above-mentioned revelations, and I thought I would take the opportunity to warn a few decent people around the world who might not know how disgusting this man was and avoid him. - if you think all comedy should be "nervous", ie obscene / empty. We are not all the same yet, although the BBC and Channel 4 are launching all standards. In October 2008, Ross and colleagues, Russell Brand, made a series of biased sex obscene phone calls to Andrew Sachs, a responsible phone (Manuel of Fawlty Towers), to be broadcast as intended on the BBC's national radio against Sachs' request. and then he tried to get Sachs' granddaughter to burn the evidence if they were prosecuted. A significant number of people here (probably most of them without BBC license fees) found it cheerful and / or that the national scandal was overcrowded, but many people probably still knew it was wrong, and 42,851 eventually complained about the BBC about incident. . Many unjust media fools and others have never scratched these 42 851s, never heard a radio program (and never wanted to) - using their argument they probably also consider the Holocaust event justified because relatively few people complained about the media and none of us here should be horrified by the fact that we were not there. Two BBC producers who were initially involved in broadcasting believed it was a "very funny and brilliant" comedy, and only 2 people complained at that time about the Brand radio program - which in my opinion is just its moral level 400,000 listeners per week. with the expertise of the BBC. The highly moral BBC has tried and has not done so in a later investigation by OFCOM. Throw yourself at Aristotle, tell Lord Reith news! Agent Sachs complained to the BBC but was ignored until the story caught up in the national newspaper. Sanctioning for the usual rollover would normally be a sacking and prosecution, maybe even a prison, but while Brand and Head of BBC Radio 2 were finally ordered to resign from the multi-millionaire, Ross was given 12 weeks of leave BBC's Boss (I assume he first asked Ross's approval, though he could pay Ross's £ 1,500,000 reward to prevent him from suing) to return to this program in 2009 before his contract expires. All the while he remembered another sadness and / or more offensive ruthlessness for his 4,000,000 viewers who would admire - but at least he could still spout his way to the bank as usual to keep his spirits. Some people think that his position will be unsustainable and will not continue. I think his skin is so dense that it is so high that it returns unbent and recharged with energy. (Update 23.01.09: I just watched the first 5 minutes of his new series - "The Biggest Rooster") - To Use His Reference Phrase - Continues Allowing This Ugly Meritorious Legislator To Take Public Money But Who Knows: Maybe In The Future After The Slimy British The film and television industry has comforted him for a 42.851 moral stance and showered him with rewards that become Sir for his perversion perversion services. Government. At least I hope that this pair of nervous deviants will subscribe to other perverted commercial TV and radio stations and stay there, so in the future I will not pay for their violations of the law and the outpouring of illegal obscurity. In 2009, OFCOM fined British TV license fee payers £ 150,000 for this "apology" affair - Thanks Ross for the offer to pay! No. To apologists: Get life / a sense of humor / sense of proportion! It's not the end of the world with a pair of talented perverted heroes, and in this world it is more important to worry, like the price of real cheese! Summing up a family man Drossa: a brilliant comedy to millions of people (especially himself), just an ugly obscene phone caller who gets an obscene pay package from an obscene multimedia company to others. So much for our society of political correctness and respect! How you should guess does not apply to the rich and glorious and will never, but only to the poor. To summarize the BBC: Stumble blindly from Huttongate, Campbellgate, Dykegate, Springergate, Crowngate, Rosson's Phonegate Hope his next crisis will be Abolitiongate. I also hope that anyone who thinks comedy should always be a challenge and a shifting of boundaries, ie Insult, is not questioned or offended by my opinion on this particular code, its perverted programs, and its current perverse employers.
