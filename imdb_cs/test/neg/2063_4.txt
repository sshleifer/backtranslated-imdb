There are those who think this is not the opera, but then they do not hide with the film CABARET, which was not even an original show. All movies of musicals / operas are and must be "adaptations" or not working. CABARET took more freedom with the original show before he made PORGY AND BESS and yet retained his original integrity, reworked the material and rated it as an artistic achievement. The same is true for PORGY AND BESS - he has redesigned the opera into a dialogue / libretto song because viewers loved musicals at the time, but stayed away from those few film operas. For Preminger, it would be a cost-effective suicide creation of an opera movie - for Goldwyn Studios it would lose its fortune. <br /> <br /> This means it's a good finish. Acting is excellent, Oscar winning Andre Previn is wonderful, as well as choral singing and individual voice achievements are incredible. Robert McFerrin (popular musician dad Bobby McFerrin) dubbed Porgy and Adele Addison dubbed Bess. While Sammy Davis Jr sang his own songs in the movie, his recording contract would not allow his voice to be heard on the audio backing album, so Cab Calloway recorded his numbers (spektakularly) for that release. Brock Peters's bass / baritone is extraordinary and Pearl Bailey is her own unique self. Diahann Carroll, although a singer of fine note, has a small role of Clara which required a high soprano, so old reliable Marni Nixon dubbed her singing. Gershwin's property hates the film and refuses to grant it. music rights, although dramatic rights are publicly available. This kind of hate rumor has lifted the CAROUSEL video release for almost fifteen years (although in this case it was a dramatic right that was in lawsuits) and is currently being prevented by both PORGY AND BESS and ANNIE YOUR GUN from getting on the video. <br /> <br /> All of the theatrical productions featured in film versions are these two films, which are the only video. Only the Gershwin Estate letter campaign in New York could release a reserve.
