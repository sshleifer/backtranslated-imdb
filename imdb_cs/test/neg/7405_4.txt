Being a fan of hospital and medical programs, I found this one fixture and sometimes a funny one (especially the scene with Dr. Whitman) that brings some light relief. However, I was looking forward to the last episode because I expected the evil ones to be punished and the good ones to come back. Instead, the hospital management makes more and more fools incredible, and it gets worse and worse for the good ones. Can't you think what the unions are doing, or Rob, Donna and Maria don't know what unions are there? In addition, never seeing outside, trees, grass, sunlight is a little repressive. Whoever understood what the last words were? ie the answer Rob Lake gave the children a question from Mrs. Strawberry: "Why are you telling us all this?" It was very frustrating when I couldn't understand it.
