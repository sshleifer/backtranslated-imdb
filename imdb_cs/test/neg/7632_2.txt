Sorry that I couldn't be more pronounced in my summary, but these two words seemed to perfectly describe the film. This is not just a bad movie, but a bad movie with bad acting and conspiracy that will be meaningless to most observers. Just look at him for Rebecca De Mornay's naked chain-link fence and moaning with ecstasy; allegedly "erotic" but actually cheerful. <br /> <br />
