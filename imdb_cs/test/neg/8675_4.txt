Oh dear! The BBC is not to be eliminated from the pedestal to absorb period dramas. I agree that this Jane Austens novel is difficult to describe primarily to modern audiences, the heroine is hardly Elizabeth Bennet, not even Edmund does not expect to cause a woman's heart to skip. However, I must say that I was hoping for improvements recently and I was unfortunately disappointed. The basic story was preserved, but the dialogue was so altered that everything that was Jane Jane Austen's tone, in a way, feeling, wit, depth, was diluted, if not lost. If some of the past adaptations can be considered dated by the weakness of this must be that it is too modern ('his life is one long side' ?????) Cast was generally sufficient, but I think Billie Piper was a bad choice, he needed someone more restrained, no impression of hidden depths beneath the submissive exterior, was more like a little girl. I see I have to wait for the BBC to re-engage its magic.
