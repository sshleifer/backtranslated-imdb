Wow, this movie is bad. You mean "Flashdance" with ninjas. The worst thing is when the sword is supposed to float in the air, but you can see the strings. Or perhaps the worst part is a gigantic eye patch (which looks like a track) worn by a ninja. Actually, there are so many bad parts, I can't think of my mind that is the worst. I can't believe anyone actually put money in to do it. The only redeeming value is that it is good to laugh.
