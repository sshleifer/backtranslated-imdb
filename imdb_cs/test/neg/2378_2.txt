I think it's the first time I go to the theater and I'm so disappointed. There were two reasons why I went to see "Astérix et les Vikings": the first as a movie enthusiast, and the second big fan of Asterix. Finally, the movie doesn't meet any requirement. It's just a big animated mess and proves that the Astérix series goes from bad to worse. In fact, it was the death of the first screenwriter René Goscinny in 1977. His loyal collaborator, illustrator Albert Uderzo took his place, but the following books apparently lacked the quality that was present during the Goscinna years. "Astérix et les Vikings" is based on the book "Astérix et les Normands", which was published during the reign of Goscinna. The basic story is the same: Goudurix, Abraracourcix's "nephew" comes to the village, and Astérix and Obélix have to turn him into a real man, while the Vikings come to Gaul to find out what fear is because fear seems to give wings. The similarities end here. What follows in the book is a continuous series of laughter, gags and cheerful dialogue with the result that the Vikings discover fear and flee Gaul. The movie is stupid, unreal, fast-paced, corny ... Well, just the default name and has good chances to use ... <br /> <br /> The difference between a book and a movie can be more acceptable if the movie was good. But new ideas simply fall into the bottomless pit. Even the older films of Astérix as "Astérix le Gaulois", which almost completely transformed the lines one by one without changing them, are easily improved. The animation has the quality of other 21st century films, but it has its mistakes and every film beginner could find mistakes. The biggest example is the continuity error, where the day follows the night after a fraction of a second, in the same order. <br /> <br /> Imagine. They have taken animation studios from many countries and still cannot get adequate filmmaking. The changes to the original story are simply unbearable. And it could still be, even if there was no original story. Goudurix, in the film, has a pet pigeon named SMS and who act as his cell phone (!). Grossebaf, the chief of the Vikings, has a rebellious teenage daughter named Abba (!) And constantly defies his father's authority. There's also a stupid Viking guide, his caricature stupid and muscular son, the loyal bride Grossebaf, who is obsessed with adornment (her name is Vikea!) And ... I can't stand that long. We are far from the original gags from the original book. The biggest problem is the difficulty in transferring images to the big screen, mainly because the greatest laughter in the books comes from verbal jokes and visual gags that don't have the same attraction on the theater screen. I recall that the greatest moments in the book were Obélix laughing with the names of the invaders (which all ended up in 'af') and Goudurix was trying to scare them in ridiculous ways. And if it wasn't enough, someone in public relations decided to write on the film poster that there was an existing Céline Dion song that would be included in the final credits. If it was a new song, I could understand. But using an old song is just another proof that the film is so bad that they are ready to do anything to attract movie visitors. The only good point for this movie is that it's so stupid and the end is so bad that we just can't go out of the theater without being cool. In the summer, it just can't hurt ... The only other acceptable point in the film is how Goudurix becomes bold. His psychological transformation in the book is too spontaneous and not trustworthy, while in the film it is better and the motivation point is more believable. So if you haven't seen a movie yet, waste your money on it. Instead, take a book. Oh René, why did you leave us?
