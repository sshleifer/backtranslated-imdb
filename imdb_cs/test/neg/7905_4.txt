This movie wasn't too funny. It wasn't even horrible. Just a fun ride aboard the Soul Plane. It is a black flight service with a kick-ass disco, a beautiful bar and gas administrators. The storyline takes you through the whole idea of ​​a black (not racial or colored but "stylish") airplane that has the same black humor style. Sometimes there are some great rare scenes like the main character using a "normal" toilet in the "normal" plane. Look at that. However, there is peace and I consider it the most in the character who played the Soul Pilot. Watch who it is. All in all, it's a fun movie. Tom Arnold contributes to the fun with his 'cracker' attitude. This is one movie you can watch when you play poker when you're drunk or just vegging.
