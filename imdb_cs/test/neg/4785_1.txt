My name is Earl (2005) <br /> <br /> Review: ...... For this I saw. <br /> <br /> This is different. First, how high is it rated? I do not understand that. This "show" is filled to the top with either annoying people, stupid people, or simply plain unlikely. "Gags" are outrageous. I saw one episode where Earl's brother's wife wrapped up and washed with dead fish. No fun. It wasn't funny, that's repulsive. Then she and Earl are very stupid brother (and I think stupid) then had sex. I almost fired it. It must be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in the long run. Jason Lee is a talented actor, but in this terrible "comedy" he is trapped in a helpless role. Earl is now in jail for this current season. Hopefully he'll get a chair just to get this show out of poverty. The Last Word: This show would be fun for people who think Larry Cable is fun. The rest of the world, NO CHANCE. Avoid the plague.
