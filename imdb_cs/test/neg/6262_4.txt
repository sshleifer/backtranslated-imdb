I've never expected too much of a tricky movie director B-movie Jim Wynorski: a stupid premise, some lion effects and a little nudity from some busty babes, and I'm usually quite happy. Well, the cheerleader massacre brings to the first and definitely second, but unfortunately it's tad light when it comes to splatter. And when the movie has the word "massacre" in the title, and scratching gore, then Houston, we have a problem. Wynorski's film centers on a cheerleader group, who, along with their teacher, a mini bus driver and a couple of guys, got stuck in the mountains during a snowstorm. They walk to an abandoned mountain retreat to find food and shelter. And a crazy killer who wants all dead! From the very beginning, good old Jim ensures that his film contains a lot of T&A loaded scenes, and includes a mandatory shower scene, along with numerous other moments in which tasty women get a kkid (including a erotic erotic sex spot and very gratuitous three). -babes-in-a-hot-tub scene). None of the women looks young enough to be cheerleaders (and they are never even seen in their clothes), but who cares for such details when they are too willing to get rid of the name in the name of art? However, I care about the numerous untidy deaths of the movie. With such an immensely clear title, I hoped that some ingenious carnage would go with all the burns, bushes and breasts; instead, virtually all killing occurs off-screen or not present. Only a stupid post-decapitation scene (achieved with cheap CGI chips) comes anywhere close to the delivery of goods. Still, if you feel in the mood for some titration, or a little slasher silliness minus grue, then, for 82 minutes, at least the Cheerleader Massacre won't be too much time wasted.
