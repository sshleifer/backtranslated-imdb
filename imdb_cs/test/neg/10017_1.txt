The New York family is the last in their neighborhood to get a television that almost destroys David Niven's marriage to Mitzi Gaynor. A comedy bedroom that rarely goes to the bedroom (and nothing sexy happens anyway). Gaynor as an actress is about as large as an oven - turns on, shuts off. The film's only compensation is the supportive performance of Patty Duke, the pre-"Miracle Worker" as Niven's daughter. She is gorgeous; "Happy Anniversary" is not. * of ****
