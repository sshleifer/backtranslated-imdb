That's what this movie really takes. Big piece of cheeze. This film is about Bonnie's sister and brother, and a Clyde duo that creates their own party to attract their victims and kill them. But for what reason? Just for fun, how to get it? Here comes Richard Hatch, who comes as a wise male lady. Real version of the lady. And he will be involved in finding out who is behind all the murders across LA. Finally, he meets a teenager to help him find the killer and rest for your entertainment and fun. But there are parts in this movie that get me like a scene with Lief Garret dressed in a wedding dress of mothers who act like sissy in front of her sister and tell her she needs her and can't live without her and watch her killing him over the face dominates. I can't believe it was Lief !!! Well, I think I could. But it's worth watching, but just see one of Garrets's worst movies ever made.
