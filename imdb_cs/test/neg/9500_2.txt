Yeah. I know. It has the name "Sinatra" in the title, so how bad can it be? Well, it's bad, believe me! I rented this thought that it was a movie I missed in theaters. It is not. It's some sort of "trash" movie that people created in Showtime. Geez, these cable stations are making a few bucks they think they can do anything they want garbage! That's not good. I'm just as big a Sinatra fan as any sensible person, but this movie was just stupid. Boring. Blunt. Unfunny. Uninteresting. The only redeeming quality is that (assuming they kept the facts) you'll learn about what happened to prisoner Frank Jr. Otherwise, it's just a stupid movie.
