I rented this movie the next day b / c I love romantic stories, but this must be the worst I've ever seen in my life. It's hard for me to believe that Sam would fall in love with Kelley after saying they can't say more than two words to her when she has a long-time friend. I thought Kelley was a total jerk in the movie and never changed. The only good thing about the movie was Josh Hartnett. I thought he did great acting and start watching his other movies.
