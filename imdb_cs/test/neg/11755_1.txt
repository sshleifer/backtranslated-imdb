I know curiosity killed a cat, but I just had to see a psycho remake, especially after I was on Hitchcok's journey recently and I knew about his work. I watched the original psycho when I was a child, but I knew how to respect it and not only that, it was a great movie! In fact, it's one of the best! The first thing I said when I learned about the remake was "How to Make a Perfection?" I stuck to it anyway, but I think I have a more open mind now and figured it was a way to introduce Psycho to a new generation. But that turned into a total insult and smack of the face of the original Psycho. I know it was said, but I watched how this movie was made, and the director was like "Oh, I just want to update him and shoot every scene shot like the original" ... what is a friggin "point?! OK, but I want to judge this movie on its own, despite being an offensive strike of the original, I mean, the acting wasn't up to par, but honestly, the actors seemed to be watching the original and remembering the lines from there and making them theirs lousy own. <br /> <br /> Watching this movie, I wanted to slap Anne Hasch, said, "I've never seen the original, I just wanted to work with Gus." Ooh, that made me angry because, frankly, it's not just that in this role as Marian, she really wasn't convincing, not to mention that her shower scene was really awful, Vince Vaughn didn't ... let's do it this way, the movie was terribly wrong. , it was vl It was too much and destroyed what might have been a new generation of a new generation. But leave Gus a film that makes one who KNOWS WHAT IT DOES! <br /> <br /> 1/10
