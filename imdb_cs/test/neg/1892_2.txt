I'm not picky with movies, oh I've seen so much bullshit I could watch something. Maybe it was the reason I watched this until the end. I great fan of RPG games, but this movie, its shame for all self-respecting RPGer there is. The camera camera shots from the security camera should be more realistic than this movie. Lines, cuts, sound, everything is bad. In some scenes you can see that it was filmed in some photo when !!!!! (spoilers forward) !!!!! people running around do not disturb people sitting at computers. Would you like to continue your work if you had ninjas around you? oh and jokes about pirates, that's the worst still in the movies !!!!! (spoilers end) !!!!! At least the first felt like a document, now it looks like some home video experiment. You can find better movies on youtube. Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this, it's as bad as it comes.
