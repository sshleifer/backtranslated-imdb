This film was not only disappointing for a horror / tension lover, but was disappointing for anyone who sees it. Wow. I thought this movie could be fun because this guy with a huge head. However, it was full of long and pulled out an interview that was not needed. It was so much sex that I hate women and men now. This film was not only boring but there was no substance. Wow. Wow. From all this, every scene looks like a light from one light bulb and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers, a restaurant and an airport. This movie is not for a movie-lover who loves bad movies because it seems like time is wasted. Watch the movie! <br /> <br /> -party
