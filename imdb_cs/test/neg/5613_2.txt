This film was made because the concept is well reflected in two sentence phrases that can be used to attract investors. This means that the assumption is interesting and marketable. I rented it on a synopsis basis. The problem is that there is nothing beyond the initial concept. There is no continuous plot, no full-fledged characters, no real comedy, no interesting scenery, no surprises and no good performances (except Jon Herder, doing something with very little). It is as though people who have set the green light on this thing have never read the script but only the synopsis. And if there were enough, it could even make money. <br /> <br /> For a prospective viewer: don't waste time, there's nothing fun or interesting to see here. For filmmakers: hey, you got your movie, so what if it's not that great. Most people never see themselves on the screen or on their screen.
