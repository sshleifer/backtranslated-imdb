I saw a movie in the movie gallery that I had to see. It looked like a fun, low-budget horror / action / western I could get into. Yeah, I knew it would suck, but I still rented it, I hope to laugh. Only a few laughs were found. That was a very stupid movie. It starts with a bounty hunter, our protagonist, who is perhaps the weakest leading figure in film history. He looks like Chuck Norris, but he can't. His dialogue also sucks. Anyway, he goes to the village, shoots some zombies. You could say they were trying to do this longer by reloading or watching some zombies in these boring scenes, which last 3-5 minutes. At least the zombies look good. Anyway, some people were shooting, some zombies are dying, and finally all are dead except our main character, who was supposed to die when he was shot down by four people.
