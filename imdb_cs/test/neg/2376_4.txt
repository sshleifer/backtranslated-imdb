This Asterix is ​​very similar to modern Disney cartoons. No soul, technically good and usual adult jokes. Maybe it's because it's the first cartoon I watched after Laputa: Castle in the Sky, but it was pretty disappointing. The story is fanciful and forgotten, but includes Asterix and Obelix in the Viking area. to save a corrupt teenager who then learns humility and finds love. Oh and they don't get away at first, but after facing adversity, they all share a deep relationship of friendship ... yadda yadda. <br /> <br /> It's best to watch out for little jokes. Vikings get the best. As Vikea (wife of the Vikings boss) she gives a list of furniture and skulls to come back from the next raid. Or the Vikings do not know the meaning of mercy (literally). Oh, and Olaf's dumbest Viking is actually hilarious (so much for a voice acting as a dialogue). For example, aboard the Viking: (After Abba, captain's daughter) Olaf Who's the new guy? Captain: That's my daughter, cod-brain! Olaf: Your ... daughter ... man?
