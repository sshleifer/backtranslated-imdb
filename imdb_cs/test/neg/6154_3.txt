Yeeee-Ha! I saw it argued that most American movies are cowboy movies in disguise; that Hollywood is so in love that it is a truly original work that rediscovers a cowboy myth. I'm not sure I bought this argument completely, but Slipstream is a proof that supports this theory; it's a cowboy movie with airplanes. Actually, it's a little better than that. It's a Spagetti Western with planes! Replacing planes with horses, making the android a priest and this film would be indistinguishable from any of a dozen Italian Spanish semi-art "shoot-'em-ups" of the 1970s. The film is not like BAD because I was led to believe some of the reviews I read, but it certainly wasn't good.
