No way out 2007 was really bad and if it's the way to wrestlemania they choose the wrong way. Chris Benoit & Perennial Boys Def MVP & Minn: In my opinion, it was the best night match for some good match, but not much. 7/10 <br /> <br /> Cruiser Championship Open (which Chavo Guerrero won): Terrible, no high flying at all, really fast and boring. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Little Bastard and Finlay Def Little Bogeyman and Bogeyman: This was more of a comedy than a match, some laughing. 5/10 <br /> <br /> Kane Def King Booker: A decent effort of the two, but they could do better. Wwe Tag Team Championship Paul London & Brian Kendrick Def Deuce & Domino: Another boring match, no high flying champs. 4/10 <br /> <br /> World Title Mr. Kennedy Def Bobby Lashley (Disqualification): In my mind the worst night match. Really awful.i thought eww was no rules, i was wrong 2/10 john prize and shawn Michaels def batista & graveyard: okay wrestling but could be a heck of a lot better. 6/10 <br /> <br /> In general, they were bulls
