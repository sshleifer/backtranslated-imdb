I lost 35 minutes of my life on this turkey before I gave up. The main character is absolutely helpless and incredibly unsympathetic, but his wandering has no humor. When it comes to Germany, the screenwriter pulls out the old "in the hotel's only one room, you'll have to share a room with a beautiful girl" sensation. Come on, at least you could let them develop their relationship. Watch "It happened one night" to see how to do it right - or any of the thousands of movies ever since. Acting is consistently the third level, and the improvised dialogue should be left on the floor of the cutting room. They are headed without a plan, despite the fact that the film telegraphs the relationship from the moment Greta is introduced. <br /> <br /> The first song in the meeting room is slightly amusing but badly sung. The rest of the songs (well, to be fair, I heard only those in the first half hour) is just useless and terrible. Most singers are painfully tuned, but not in a purposeful way.
