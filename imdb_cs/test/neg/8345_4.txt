The volcano is set in Los Angeles, where a minor earthquake struck, allowing the boss O.E.M. Mike Roark (Tommy Lee Jones) decides to reduce his short vacation and go inside when he sees everything is well, but then he goes to the epicenter of the earthquake where seven underground workers were killed. fire or intense heat of some kind. Mike is not sure what to think, so he will bring the geologist Dr. Amy Barnes (Anne Heche), to try and explain things, unfortunately the huge underground river of molten lava was released after the earthquake and outbreak in La Brea Tar Pits. lava pours into the city streets and engulfs everything and everything that touches the flames. Mike, his men and the emergency services have their work cut out and try to stop the lava river and save as many lives as possible ... Directed by Mick Jackson Turning around the idea of ​​an exploding volcano in 1997 with Dante Peak (1997) ), which was released just two months or less before Volcano & while Dante's peak is barely a masterpiece, it is at least a bit better and more plausible than a volcano. The script here is total nonsense and is not based in fact at all, underground river lava that appear to appear and then disappear just as quickly, different figures stand inches from the lava river, but are not affected by heat (when the guy is in the train metal seats around him) they start to melt but remain perfectly fine if I am aware that human skin is not as heat resistant as metal is it?) and it is constantly happening, flying helicopters are clouds of ash (in reality it would be impossible), one a simple blockade at the end of the street stops the flowing lava (what is it with other streets and other directions?), will be able to blow the perfect ditch on the street and then blow up a huge building up to make a massive dam & when Kelly sees the lava heading towards her car gets out as well as anyone else, but then for some reason just standing there and watching two firefighters are burned to death and waiting for their father to save her though this stage eats her leg it rang, despite the fact that all the concrete blocks that were placed together to form a barrier in less than twenty minutes make a man of such a great job that not a single piece of molten lava can leak and load more than the massive building, who still fell on Tommy Lee and his daughter then both are fine. The character is terrible, though not as cliché as usual, when there was no romance between Tommy Lee and Anne Heche and the minimal city clerk who wanted to try to close Tommy Lee and Anne Heche before the event that marked them as scarecrows. There are a few badly written and sometimes embarrassing moral moments when Los Angeles pulls together, a black man and the semi racist cop who warm up each other and at the end wishing each other well and the little boy at the end, when they say: they all look the same It's a cringe worthy & is certainly a ham-fisted attempt and trying to say what color we're still human beings & we can all together in times of crisis as it brings people together. I say that I think Volcano is one of those who are so bad that it's a good movie, entertaining and moving at a decent pace, but don't expect anything based on reality or any human drama. I suppose a movie like Volcano could be considered an update of a film about the 70's disaster as Poseidon Adventure (1972) or an earthquake (1974), but on a huge budget with modern effects. Speaking of the effects that are fine, but none excels that many and set-pieces are also surprisingly forgotten, there are certainly several impressive explosions and several OK River lava flowing through the effects of Los Angeles, but little else. Generally, Volcano is simply not very exciting and at the same time sometimes unintentionally funny and absolutely ridiculous that it does not really work as intended by the creators. <br /> <br /> With a budget of around $ 90,000,000, this program was open for a small amount. $ 15,000,000 at the box office, it looks good and there's a lot of fire, but nothing excels and the volcano is quite a forgotten film overall. I think most of the places that appeared here were filmed in Los Angeles and filmed in places of their real life. Cast pass moves with some horrible dialogue & ridiculous set-pieces to fight, Tommy Lee Jones deserves better than this. The volcano is a bit of a catastrophe in both senses, it's a disaster-themed movie that ended up a bit of a disaster itself. It's worth a couple of unintentional laughter and ridiculous things, but it's nothing big and I doubt I ever want to see it again.
