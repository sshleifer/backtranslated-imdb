I think a lot of friends of the people who acted on this thing had to come and evaluate it because I tell you it's just awful. Acting is worse than soapopera bad, effects are like something you would see from the 1970 Doctor Doctor episode, the story is, there's no story. And they still use the same 2-minute song over and over again. And a werewolf? It's like the muppets they used in Wing Commander, giant cats, remember how bad they looked? The werewolf is so bad. Seriously, the one who drove this thing is terrible and should never get to anything else, except maybe his son's school play, but he should still pay the audience to see him. Ghostwolf is nothing but a bad joke.
