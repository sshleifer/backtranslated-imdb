There is something strange about antisocial sentiment that you can find in some Cheech and Chong material. One of the songs in Up In Smoke, well, I often wish these days to start more songs. But in this video excuse, stoner duo shows us videos for four songs from their album, also called Get Out Of My Room. You hear the voice during the opening titles, in which an anonymous producer describes the record as a newspaper record that will only occupy space in the charts. Unfortunately, this opening voice hits the nail directly on the head. Most RIAA-approved music recordings seem to be in line with the rule to list the best material at the beginning of the album. Often, when one gets through the first song, he notices the discerning listeners that the record has little, if anything, to keep their attention. Bands that defied the mainstream convention, on the other hand, often deposited their best material at the last place, or at least evenly distributed all over the disc. In this case, Cheech and Chong seem to have decided to secure their bets. The opening song, Get Out of My Room, is a cheerfully-themed song with an incredibly bad video. Many music video viewers of the 1980s find a somewhat nostalgic direction. Cheech's concept of British punk is also incredibly funny. Where everything goes downhill is the second number, I'm not home right now. Nothing cares about a song like repetition, and it's hard to get more repetitions than this auditory turd. Frankly, one feels the urge to slap Cheech into the face and tell him that we have the idea that he is not at home now, so please continue. Another song, the theme of love, which is a strange thing, is the absolute rock bottom not only for this collection, but for Cheech and Chong in general. It's almost as if this song was made for the sole purpose of emptying the album's runtime. Fortunately, the Stoner Duo saved the best at last, but it is also interesting to note that Chong is completely missing in this cut. Born in Eastern L.A. is a simple number based on Bruce Springsteen's old number, which ridicules Reagan's view of multiculturalism. When one is encouraged by Cheech's story, he must wonder how many poor blinds who could not speak Spanish were deported to Mexico simply because their skin was not white. Racism was an integral part of American culture in 1985 and remains to this day. If something happens, it's worse, so you have to wonder what Born In East LA would be if it was written at the moment. Unfortunately, two cuts don't make the album, especially when there is so much boring stuff between them. Interviews, for example, before they get out of my room, are pretty funny. They are not as rich as many of Up In Smoke, but funny enough to justify their existence. Unfortunately, both middle songs are reflected in their footage. Boring song makes boring filler. If you cut a medium half hour of material from this video, you would have something much better. I gave Get Out Of My Room three out of ten. They get them first and last video. I'm pretty sure the stars are looking at material like this today and wonder what they think.
