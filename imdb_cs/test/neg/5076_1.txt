Chaos named Gleick's pop explanation of chaos theory. What has the book or anything related to the content of the book regarding the plot of the film "Chaos"? Nothing. The filmmakers seem to have switched the book (apparently without understanding the matter) and sought a "theme" that would unite a series of secular action sequences that overcome the feeble chain of events in the film. In this regard, the film "Choas" resembles a Canadian effort "cube," in which prime numbers function as a device to mystify the audience so that the conspiracy of the plot will not be noticed: in "cube" a bunch of prime numbers are thrown so that viewers will ascribe their Lack of understanding of lack of prime knowledge: the same approach is taken in "Chaos": disconnected excerpts from Gleick's books are thrown to make a bad guy in the movie seem tremendously clever. This, of course, is an offensive condescension to the audience, and every reader of the viewer "Chaos", who can stand to sit with the film, will be confused. How could the film be so bad? The story in "Chaos", which was rewritten as a novel, would probably not even exceed the secretary's desk of a literary agent. How could (at least) hundreds of thousands (and probably millions) of dollars be thrown away for what can be considered a waste of time for everyone, except for those who took the money home from the film? As for what's in the movie, every performance is called. Except for technical defects, it would be amazing if more than one shot was used for one scene. The story is uniformly pointless: when I last saw a story that was disconnected, it was the production of a literal eight-year-old. Other massive shortcomings include: A bad person leaves advice to be followed by the police. He has no reason to leave such advice. Police don't wear or use radio. Evil guy Dupes has no reason to act in harmony with the bad guy. Let me strongly recommend that no one should watch this film. If there is any other movie you like (or even hate), watch it instead.
