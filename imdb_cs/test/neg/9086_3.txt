Originally, spiders were planned as a four-series series, and it shows. I don't like serials; they are typically ridiculous, intricate and banal. This exception is no exception. In the first part of the spiders, "The Golden Lake," a wealthy adventurer thwarts the gang of criminals - spiders - to steal the Inca gold. There's a stupid love triangle with some Cowboys and Indians. Sensationalism and exoticism didn't interest me. One can legitimately watch topics from this two-part series at Lang's later, much better job. And filmmaking is better than in other series I've seen since, including "Les Vampires" (1915). In spiders, the camera is not so static and fortunately this movie is fast. Toning and lighting are also sufficient. But none of this is remarkable. It's almost unnoticed, but how closely this series resembles Louis Feuillade's series; The criminal gang dresses and behaves like you in 'Les Vampires' - just names and to a lesser extent changed. <br /> <br /> For more comments on The Spiders, visit the site.
