This is a really horrible, weakest attempt at a comic book adaptation ever made. Every possible thing about this movie that might be bad is. Music, acting, lighting, sets, "special" effects ... about the only positives I can find is that Sue looks cute in blue stockings and Thing makeup is almost clear (face only). And it is done. Zipper. Don't bother watching a copy of this bootleg copy; It really is not worth your time. Even the aborted film "Captain America" ​​from the early 1990s is much less unbearable than trying to withstand this mess.
