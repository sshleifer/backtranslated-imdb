I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't. It had the potential to be a really cool, hip remake of a cool show, but that's where it broke up. It was too hip, too cold. Firstly, all the cool lines and scenes were presented in demonstrations that I have seen many times. And the cut was very disjointed, so the scenes didn't seem to come out together and they all seemed to be in place. Claire Danes, whom I love as an actress, has not been able to break her breakthrough beyond the gaming roles of high school. The only bright spot was Giovanni Ribisi as Pete. His slightly stupid but in fact clever style was fun and refreshing. But overall, I would only recommend watching previews instead of seeing the movie and wishing it was more.
