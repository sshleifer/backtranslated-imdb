I rarely laughed so strongly in the movie. Note that I laughed at the AT Iron Eagle, not that, because it's probably the dumbest movie I've ever seen (with the obvious exception of the sci-fi monster CyberTracker). You should also remember that this movie is not a comedy! While looking at the absurd conspiracy (the idea that a 16-year-old could go to the US Air Force base, stole the F-16, fly to the Middle East and kill about a thousand people without noticing, that is out of faith), the film is full of ridiculous action scenes that make little or no sense. For example, at various points, Doug Masters uses a machine gun on his plane to shoot a steel beam, control tower, and tent. All these things explode in a massive fireball. Why? The enemy plane also explodes in a strange way resembling a paper plane that is blown up by fireworks. On the plus side, I really enjoyed this movie. It is true that this is not how the creators would like it to be, but I still laughed at it and later bought the DVD. It is also improved by the amazing presence of David Suchet as an evil terrorist leader (maybe you will remember him as a Muslim Belgian detective Poirot?) Overall, the film is a laugh and a cheerful alternative to a more serious fighter. movies like Top Gun. Although it is just as gently homo-erotic (look at the hug between Doug and Chappy. Something is happening between them!)
