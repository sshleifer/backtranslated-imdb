Even with my hateful love for the first two franchise movies and sweeping any biases I might have for a Max character, I can't bring myself on average to evaluate this space waste that would almost land before it. Gone is the harsh ugly streak that brought the sensation of Mad Max Rockatansky, away is the falling feeling of despair in the apocalyptic world, and more importantly, away is director George Miller's passion for permission. The terrible score corresponds to the cartoon cartoon of the movie, it seems that the creators did not know what to do with the amount of money that was given to perform this third installment. Sure, stunts are the place to be expected, and of course Miller will manage to paint a barren desert landscape with a clean lift from what he did before. Yet he was clearly trying for new ideas, because The Road Warrior crowns the glory of the gasoline tanker chase here, only using the train instead! It's just a very bad show that may have appeared as an ambitious turn of events in the mid-1980s; but now looking at three movies, Thunderdome is just about to see the director lose his nervous attitude, while unfortunately he gets caught up in a mix of comedy and fantasy action. And the truth is, neither of these sloping genres would work in this series anyway. Image 3/10 is purely for one really good Thunderdome fight while stunt men deserve at least some credit. But this is the third time I have tried to love this movie, and as impatience for punishment, as I am undoubtedly, I will never try again.
