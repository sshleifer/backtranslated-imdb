The worst movie I've seen in the last 12 months. The storyline was uninteresting, the film ended when gingesh khan became, I always thought something really interesting had happened. I knew that Mongolia and all the areas where the film was playing have beautiful landscapes, but the film did not. Jokes where they are really poor. The narrator, gingesh himself, could say a little more about Mongolian history, traditions, etc. My co-founder didn't know anything about it, so he was a little lost. I was looking forward to this movie, but in the end I was really disappointed. It was one of 3 movies I have ever seen in a movie theater where I wanted to leave before the end.
