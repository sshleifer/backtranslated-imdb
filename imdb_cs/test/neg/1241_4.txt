This show is like watching someone who's in training to one day host a show. There are some good comedy ideas and tons of average. It does not seem that writers know the difference between what is funny and what is strange or gross. <br /> <br /> He has his moments. When Spike hung up a neighbor who repeatedly left his dog on the ground, he hit the top. But the merry moments are too few and there are too many experimental comedy pieces that lack the brand. The show is better than, say, watching a test pattern or QVC network, but it needs some better writers. Reading the bright positive IMDb comments on this show, I believe most of them were written by show workers and relatives and personal friends Spike. <br /> <br /> Not much of the time most of the time.
