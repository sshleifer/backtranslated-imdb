When traveling by train, a woman (Stéphane Excoffier) ​​accidentally exits the remote station when the train stops in the middle of the night. Previously, he finds that the strange lonely bayonet (Jim van der Woude), who does not speak his language, is the only person in the area and that it was the last train in the track. The man puts her in his house and develops an unusual expressionless relationship between them. "De Wisselwachter" is an overestimated boredom, with a different but uninteresting story that goes nowhere. I like movies outside of Hollywood, but this story is too absurd and has no message at the end. The sexual tension between the two leading characters is funny at the moment, but too repetitive. I saw this movie in old VHS and the picture is too dark; I don't know if there will be a better quality picture on the DVD. Finally, I was completely disappointed with this feature. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Homem da Linha" ("Line Man")
