Why can't I write in French? Very Kitch! This road in the center of the country is a despicable technical option, although in 1976 these great Casimir monsters are absolutely ridiculous! The film deserves a "remake" as well as "KING KONG" (the last one) with a slightly more supplied script. Professor is similar to Professor Calculus and is rather funny. David (character) is quite inconsistent but crosses (spends) with people from below under a good message "you will unite and overcome you!" Overall, we would say a movie shot in the 1940s. Now that I have said all (or almost) the evil I thought, we can say that if we have a brain tired or something to see on the other, then the thing (thing) is even more fun. Hugh! This is my opinion! (translation with French "Reverso": sorry for possible mistakes!)
