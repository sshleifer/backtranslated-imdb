There is nothing special or interesting about this mill running low budget sci-fi movie. Regardless of his pedigree (the film is loosely based on Leo Tolstoy's novel), the storyline and overall themes of this film are by no means remarkable or original, science is at best weak and the film unfortunately cannot cope. They include convincing action sequences. The story begins with a manned flight to Mars, and although the main plot is not really moving until the ship is in, most of the most interesting scenes appear on the road. Unfortunately, once our interplanetary passengers touch, their previously interesting interpersonal relationships, speculation about cosmology and the meaning of life, and all the interesting about the film, all will go back to a single, far-flung conspiracy about Martian revolutionaries, environmental problems and not. very convincing belts of fraud. <br /> <br /> Nothing is remarkable about the quality of film production. It's clear. And most of the acting is, though slow, OK. Cameron Mitchell is actually pretty good and plays a nice character. I think the best quality of this movie is from my perspective its fashion sense. Martians have very nice clothes! If this movie made any sense, it might have been more interesting. Oh, good.
