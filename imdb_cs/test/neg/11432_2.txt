The filmmakers have come out of the way to find ONLY the following demographic data: Palestinians who seem to be loving, seeking goodwill seeking solutions, Palestinians (especially older women and families) who are particularly concerned about security. and the Israelis who do not believe in the security fence strongly sympathize with its alleged effect on the Palestinians and regard it as unnecessarily dividing and / or wasting money. Oh yes, they are doing a member of the Israeli government that supports the fence, but they do what they can to portray it as inhuman and uninteresting, and ask them the very main questions that are really statements (eg, "The Wall is Bad for the Living the environment ... destroys everything "). <br /> <br /> I have no problem with what is being presented in the movie. Although I disagree with the people they talk to, their views are valid for the document. there are at least two sides to the issue of the Israeli security fence, despite the fact that the vast majority of Israelis (and many others) support fence construction and believe it has an overall positive impact, this "documentary" does not represent the opinion of either such person. they go so far as to have an interview with an Israeli Jew who claims that "all Israelis support the fence" and are so mad, and then stubbornly reject with one such "mad" Israeli, and to overcome this, they set the tone of the film by talking to several young Israeli children (really exceptions to the rule - I was there) laughing about their Arab neighbors from around the world " document "is a film that examines the problem and presents a variety of facts, opinions and views. Unfortunately, this is not a documentary. This is a blank PROPAGANDA FILM that very clearly, very sharply offers a battery of support to only one side of a highly controversial, emotionally and politically charged issue. It's nothing but a documentary, say, Fahrenheit 9/11.
