**** SPOILER ALERT **** My friend, some friends, and we rented this movie as part of a really bad movie marathon. We knew what we were getting into. Lack of conspiracy, direction and special effects actually let us hope for a great (or passable) battle scene between the two main characters ... poorly drawn cobra swimming and a super violent giant commodo (who ate people like ice cream) ... this is how we finally get it , but did we have to be shortened because of possible budgetary or time constraints? Its only quality is that it is sadly bad, with many distinctive details highlighted by other readers. I recommend this movie if your do cutting onions to make yourself cry.
