If this movie was just incredibly poor, it would be okay, the problem is that many take it seriously. To make it short, a few points: <br /> <br /> - There's no story, no focus, no head start, and all the questions asked won't answer. Overall, the film is extremely repetitive and boring (several times I was in war-torn African countries and found all the persistent trouble on the local misery and hopelessness to watch very painfully, but still makes no sense). The questions raised are pure manipulation, and the truth is, there are no questions but a statement. - I am no film director, but what is the reason to raise, for example, the issue of smuggling weapons, if the only element that gets the audience is the statement of the local reporter? The director does not even bother to show us at least the sequence where he would be waiting near the airport, trying to point the heavily loaded wagons leaving the area just after landing. The fish story takes less than $ 5 million and is supported only by a sequence where the director shoots a documentary that is presented at a local conference. Did the guy do any work at all ???? Absolute Poverty is constantly displayed in endless sequences, but where is the reason? One can go almost anywhere in Africa with a hand cam and shoot the same pictures unfortunately. Where is the big news? Shooting prostitutes watching and crying over the images of their murdered friend and prostitute is worth the worst emotional manipulation that can be seen in thrash and real TV these days. The coincidence between a famine devastating country with more than two million starving and exporting fish is totally useless, dishonest, and makes no sense, but manipulating viewers in typically anti-globalization and anti-Western feelings. There is an interesting debate in France after the academic has published a very detailed commentary on the film, which has brought many journalists working in Africa for decades to explore further details. It turns out that: <br /> <br /> - Fish waste that appears in the sun and is collected by some local people is not meant to be consumed by anyone, but is collected to be exported for reasonably good money feeding animals. I think I'm not the only one who had the impression that the director suggested the exact opposite. Arms smuggling is a reality (but again, where is the big news?), but not this film explains the problem. If the empty aircraft landing in Mwanza are involved in smuggling, they actually unload their shipment to another place in Africa, then go to Mwanza to collect the fish so that the road is not empty (which means they actually land in empty space). Mwanza ...). People eat fish locally, as opposed to what the film suggests (approximately 40-60% of what is removed from the lake) and thousands of people make a living. Good for them! It is a private business of this kind that one day takes African countries out of poverty and not Western moans and endless foreign aid. I can't say how shocked I see the success of this movie!
