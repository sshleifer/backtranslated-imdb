Finally, I managed to go through the whole episode of this show. I was very, very tired. Clearly. I had to turn it off before, because I thought it was so bad. Watching a full episode convinces me that it's really so bad. I couldn't even tell you what happened, but I clearly remember not laughing. For people who think it's new to the family or married to children ... have you ever watched these shows? They are well written and act well and most importantly, funny! This show is not fun. Maybe you think it's the first sitcom you've ever watched. I don't see who else would. I've noticed all the feelings about the arrested development so far, etc. It's probably my own fault for being frustrated with television and not watching it, allowing stupid people to dictate what's going to stay in the air.
