This movie is cheerful, what is better than watching two creatures fighting each other? GIANT cgi versions of these beasts that fight! However, I need one of the weapons used in the film. Because they probably use cheaters. Calculate the number of shots you use before you have to ... oh expect it to be true that they will never have to reload. Regardless of the number of shots ... it's funny. <br /> <br /> The sound effects used in the film for Komodo vary from tiger to elephant. And I forgot to mention that these GIANT Komodo dragons are stealing like hell? Because somehow, even when the actors look in the direction the beast comes from, they are surprised when they appear. Whenever somebody dies, you can say that he comes because everyone is joining him, up in the air and saving them ... he never works. The last gem is that these writers brains are just glands full of 'knowledge. With "facts" such as these two creatures are amphibious comments, such as "helpless animals", they are simply full of fun facts.
