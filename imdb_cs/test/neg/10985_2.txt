A few years ago I saw The Scent of Green Papayas from the same director. My feelings for both movies are in fact the same: beautifully shot, but terribly slow and boring. I saw this movie in Sneak Preview and left after half an hour. It couldn't. How can a person make an interesting film about people who are constantly saying how happy they are and how their lives are perfect .........? I had the fantasy of a forgotten American G.I, still wandering in a Vietnamese jungle that was not aware that the war was over. How would he suddenly appear in the movie and start emptying the M16 on the characters in the movie. Their red blood would contrast beautifully with all the green plants in the film ... So the movie didn't catch me! Time to go!
