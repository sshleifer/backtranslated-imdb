Some savers plot ahead. Nashville's network of so-called rebirth as "The First Network for Men" is a complete disappointment as well as its block of adult cartoons. New Ren and Stimpy were just terrible, "Gary the Rat" average at best, and "Stripperella" quite unnoticeable. This cartoon is mostly boring; if "Ren and Stimpy" suffered from a rough-out overkill, "Stripperella" lacked any respectable shock gags, humorous gags, clever gags, or gags, seasons. The Beginning of the Concept Is Wrong: Pamela Anderson, a stripper-superhero, saves the "city" from a range of goofy supervillains. This cartoon looks like a tribute to superior shocking superhero spoofs, such as "Darkwing Duck" and "The Tick", but without the jokes of these cartoons and good writing - or even a good storyboard. "Agent 0069" is trying to cleanse herself from being goofy and sexy, but she's not, and this caricature couldn't make one or the other into this series. <br /> <br /> Watch your recorded "The Tick" episodes and find out what a really superhero spoof cartoon is.
