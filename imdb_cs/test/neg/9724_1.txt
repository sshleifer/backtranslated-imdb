Anyone who evaluates this movie over 3 has a very distorted view of movies, anyone who rated this piece of sh! T 7 or higher, I have absolutely no respect for their movie tastes and I doubt they ever saw a good movie. I am always for giving some movie shot and I am with this, I tried to pay attention, I tried not to let my money go 2 waste but 15 minutes in my friends laughs at me because I was listenin 2 my iPod 25 minutes later I couldn't even watch the excessive movement that appeared in the movie, so I was awake and left, I never came out of the movie, until this waste, Anyone who said it enjoyed is a liar or should be banned from this site. I'm getting so angry when I see it's 8 people when the overall Godfathers rating is 9.1, that says the movie was close to what it isn't.
