I can say for sure that this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I usually love foreign movies. The film is nothing but poorly made violent pornography. If you decide to see it, get ready for endless sexism, gratuitous nudity shots, and silly sensational rape scenes that I'm sure is a major challenge for people who love film. In addition, the graph curls aimlessly and none of the characters is sympathetic. Many scenes are filmed from the forests surrounding the river, where girls make a constant sense of being chased, which was a pathetic attempt to compensate for the lack of a story. <br /> <br /> Maybe If I was accurately described in the reviews, I wouldn't want to waste time seeing the movie.
