I bought this movie on a blockbuster for $ 3.00 because it sounded interesting (a little Ranma-esque, with the idea of ​​someone stretching around the skeleton) because there was a cute girl in a miniskirt on her back, and because there was a sticker on it with limited view. I thought it would be a sweet or at least honest coming of an age story with a strange india. I was 100% bad. When I watched him, I have to wonder how he got on a limited label because there is almost no language, little violence and the closest thing to nudity (honestly! not usually go around hoping for it!) is When a girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties (you see her panties a lot in this movie because no matter what she's wearing a miniskirt of some sort). Even anti-religious humor is tame (and lame, caricature, insincere, derived, unoriginal, and the worst of all is not funny in the least - it would be better to just listen to Ray Stevens) "Would Jesus be on the Rolex TV Show"). barely qualified as PG-13 (it is unrated), but Blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of 17 rent this - as if it was pornographic.A little child there could go and rent a modified version of the Requiem for a dream, but insist that Zack and Reba are worse. <br /> <br /> It's, but not in this way. <br /> <Br /> In a way, it worries me - the only thing that could offend people is the idea of ​​suicide on If somebody needs to see movies with sincerely portrayed suicides (not this one, but better, like virgin suicides), she's a teenage girl. or turn a story that I wrote in PG-13 (the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve). Suicide is one of the first three major causes of death among teenagers (I think it's number 2), so most teenagers are likely to be affected or affected. , though. 2/10.
