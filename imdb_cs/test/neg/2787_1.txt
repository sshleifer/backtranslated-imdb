Some teenagers go to an old abandoned farmhouse, which one of them left their dead grandfather without knowing that there were several murders a few decades earlier because their grandfather made a contract with the devil for a good harvest - the guy couldn't think of something better to sell their souls? The man's grandson and his friends are ready to be another victim, for reasons that are never explained. The stereotypical teenage son and his girlfriend, a black man with a white girlfriend and two lesbians, have to fight three scarecrows of murderers - but don't be fooled like me, it's not nearly as fun as it sounds. . Mostly it is just a lot of chit chat about kicking a ball, smoking a drug and a leading player complaining that he never knows about his parents. Working with the camera is appalling and shaky, perhaps on a video camera that is in hand, in some scenes, which is perhaps a good thing because the scarecrows look like they came from some children's birthday party, and apparently could hire only two people, scarecrows! Some of the best movies I've seen were these low budgets, independent horror movies, but this is just pathetic. The cast and crew seem to have consisted of a lot of people who knew each other, had never acted before, and had no intention of behaving again and had several thousand dollars (I can't believe this film costs $ 130,000 to make) and the weekend Free Time in Your Hands - Even a lesbian skinny submersible scene is lame. <br /> <br /> I think it's so fun that since this writing is a sequel to this movie that isn't one of them even bothered by adding it to IMDb. <br /> <br /> * from ****, and I rate it very hard because it is a somewhat skinny scene, no matter how lame it may be.
