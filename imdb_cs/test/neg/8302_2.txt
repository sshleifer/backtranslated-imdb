Well, anyone who wants to see a great work of art should not watch this movie. A sophisticated film connoisseur will no doubt be concerned about the horrific production values ​​and the look at the outstanding actor (Josef Cotten), who is frightened of the buck. Mr. Cotten either had to really need the money, or he was too senile to realize that the movie was crap. The same phenomenon appeared with Dana Andrews, who appeared in her career in a camp and a terrible cloudy rain. I know Mr. Andrews was in the throat of alcoholism, but why did Cotten do that?! <br /> <br /> As for the storyline, it's a reworking of Frankenstein's plot. The first half of the film looked like they were doing a serious but seriously wrong version of the original Frankenstein story. Then they inexplicably introduced their daughter. It wasn't a bad thing ... until then, from heaven, they decided to stop making a horror movie, but make a soft-core pornographic movie! The change was dramatic and bizarre. It was almost as if they were saying "well, Mr. Cotten is done with his scenes and went home, now ladies, ... STRIP!". The problem is that every level movie is just awful besides monster makeup. While it's not great, it's still pretty cool to see. But bad writing, gaming and a budget of $ 17.46 conspired to make this drab and horrible movie - one so bad that throwing in some nudity for pervs out there shouldn't be enough to lure anyone to see.
