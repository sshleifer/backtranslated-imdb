Normally, I wouldn't go into trouble commenting on a horror sequel because it is usually assumed to be BAD, and if you look at them with disrespect, they can be fun and fun to ridicule. However, this chapter of the ongoing Halloween Saga approached the fact that everything that the original original meant was approaching. In the first film, Dr. Loomis said (very sharply I could add) that Michael Myers was bad, and he was trying to explain why (to do the bad job I could add). In my opinion, he was much more frightening when he was just a bloody hungry madman. The whole goth / cult thing was an unnecessary and desperate attempt to throw a new curve into the Halloween equation. The result was a boring, predictable movie that wasn't scary and not bad enough to be funny.
