I usually like watching Laurel and Hardy, but that's obviously one of the movies they did while they were on their way to becoming a successful comedy team. The storyline is very simple and mainly based on one joke; both strange kilts and scots are. And that's all. Okay, there are other jokes, but I didn't consider them funny at all; they are outdated and I think they weren't fun when the movie was first released. Still, the film has two of the most beautiful faces in history, and they do the best of the annoying story (which I expected to be filmed without a proper script) and the scenery is a nice view. In my opinion, this is just interesting for Laurel and Hardy fans, and others should stay away from it.
