I agree in many parts with a rather thorough review, which has already been published on the subject of miniseries, and I agree that it has its pros, not only its disadvantages. For example, the original film manages to shorten much of the mid and final parts of the novel into a single montage, including the discovery of Gurney Halleck and the love affair of Paul Atreides and Chani, which, on reading the novel, is travesty, probably born in the shenanigens cutting studio which other reviewer writes . This was one of the great shortcomings of the original film, and the miniseries, to his credit, include many original plot lines that were cut out of the Lynch film due to the expansive nature of the Herbert novel. However, this in itself is a double edged sword. Rather than completing the transfer of the novel from text to celluloid, the miniseries creators were tempted to create their own conspiracy that was missing from the original novel. Similarly, although this is certainly a "fuller" story of the Dune story, it is also a break from the original heart and soul and the main vision - that of prophecy. Where are the internal monologues that characterize Herbert's writing and show what many different characters think, without suddenly switching their minds, or expanding in word or unnecessary and angry spoken monologues? Away. So much of Paul's original agony of choice to choose jihad or death, the possibility of fulfilling prophecy or departing from it, surely the most interesting aspect of the novel itself (and the one who attracts people who are far away from science fiction fans) is missing. What is the meaning of Dune, without prophecy? It's just a more educated and learned version of Farscape or Andromeda. How sad it is all that is provided to us. Lynch's film was wrong, yes. However, a defective film could lead to a remedy by another filmmaker, taking some of Lynch's finest points and rejecting some of the more crowded aspects of this style in the revival of the story. Now this story will probably never be translated into a movie, and I like it.
