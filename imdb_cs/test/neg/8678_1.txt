I watched for 40 minutes and couldn't stand it? TV turned off and I returned to some light reading "Lobotomy for Beginners". It was hard to say what aspect of this production was the worst - a dialogue made entirely of sound bytes or acting. by numbers.

Other bright things had make-up and costumes more suitable for the 21st century fancy party - a faded blonde Fanny, Billie Piper was the least trusted figure. British commercial television apparently believes that breasts are rising, pouting lips and a deep, sensual look make a good story. Fortunately, Jane Austen had other ideas. <br /> <br /> To find the story of Mansfield Park, you can buy a 1983 mini-DVD.
