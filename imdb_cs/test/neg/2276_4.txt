This four-hour miniseries production is two hours longer than necessary, especially since the creators had no clear idea of ​​how to adapt the novel to the screen. They did not seem to know what should be maintained and what could be safely omitted. The film opens with Sir Walter from Peerage, his primary consolation in his troubles. This represents a family - all that we will meet intimately over the next four hours but serve a different purpose. Similarly, the scenes where the musgrove laments "poor Richard" serve no purpose, but they pull the story down. Any Austen's current dialogue is assigned to different characters, and some of her narration is recycled as a dialogue that falls embarrassingly from the languages ​​of the characters. There is also some filler dialogue, and it is uniformly awful. A scene where Charles Hayter bores Henrietta with his fears of getting dr. as a scene in this staging, it's annoying Scene on Cobb when Louisa falls and is "taken without life!" is completely unnecessary, and I wondered if Wentworth's line "Nobody can help me?" It can be directed to writers as well as other actors. This production often looks and feels like a game that was filmed, rather than a real movie, and that is most evident in acting, which is the opposite of fine: flourishing line delivery, exaggerated gestures and actors who they have no idea what to do with their hands, feet or faces when they do not speak with their lines. Charles Musgrove stands in his drawing room, shoulder width apart, and seems to project onto the balcony (if he was there) while talking to him in the room. Louise Musgrove's face seems to be confused when she is not actively contented or giggling. Louisa is a dizzying, ugly, ditzy creature, and I didn't believe for a moment that Wentworth was interested in her. Costumes are a mixed bunch, but mostly scary, and Anne Elliot's green tartan dresses are quite possibly the scariest alleged period costume ever invented. We give dates at the beginning of the exhibition - it's the end of 1790 or maybe very early 1800s - and yet many of the costumes seem to be Victorian design, and so about 60 years too soon! The hair is so bad I didn't even mention it. Except I won't mention it. :-) <br /> <br /> This production does some things right. Mrs Smith has her meaning and history with Mr Elliot, his dispersion and his intrigues are fully addressed. I was also pleased to see the "reconciliation" scenes with Anne and Frederick appearing at the end, which are a rare reward for the reader, but overlaid in 1995. <br /> <br /> If you love the book Persuasion, and even vaguely as a 1995 movie, it's not losing a moment (or a penny) on that production; You will find it really wants.
