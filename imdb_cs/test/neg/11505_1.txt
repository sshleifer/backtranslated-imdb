Naturally, Sadie is by far the worst example I've ever seen, it's such a sh ** and loaded with a complete bullsh **. I didn't find any of the gags to be funny or clever, it was all terrible jokes. Acting sucks, many characters sucked on acting, Charlotte Arnold (Sadie) is such a horrible actor, other characters also suck (Magaret, Rain, Hal). The storyline is not unique and creative and show is so predictable. This is one of the worst performances of all time, it shouldn't have been done, the idiots who are responsible for writing this waste should be fired (if they haven't already). The season was just a disaster, it's too hard to watch this show, that's out of the ordinary.
