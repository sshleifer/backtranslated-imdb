It beats me as someone can rate this movie very high. It is no understatement to call it a very attractive one. As the guy was able to build a wooden maze of underground rooms in such a short period of time, he was rather ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter of Jesus. Obese Sheriff played Hoyt Axton looked like a fugitive from the Jerry Springer show and I found that a blonde woman leads Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain. Here's the expression in U.K. 'mutton that was made like lamb' that suits it perfectly. It wasn't all bad, but I enjoyed it immensely when the final credit started and 'The End' came up, it was so brilliant for this hot TV movie movie. at discount stores in no time at all.
