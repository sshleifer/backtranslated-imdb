In Japan and elsewhere in Europe, new technology allows filmmakers to bypass a closed Hollywood mainstream store and avoid Ed Wood, such as the visible low production values ​​that produce compelling films. What a pity that in the UK we can find examples such as "Avatar" (the name of many video games) where dead brain attempts are imitated to mimic so many movies - and console games that are popular as girlfriends that are in themselves cheap photocopy clichés abound as testosterone powered by kangaroos. Look at some of the synopsis: <br /> <br /> "Set in a futuristic London, 2024, tells the story of Virtual Reality Outminators Virtual Reality who face the ultimate internet virus." Go back and read the quote again - avoid quarrels - and try to find one original idea. This should seem to be a tired, sad concept in 1993, regardless of that in 2003. Ah, but there is more - the "ultimate virus" has already caused an aircraft crash, an assault on the air traffic control center, and so on. "And manifests itself as incredibly clad, athletic, breast jiggig discount imitators Lara Croft, who makes a great line in snarling and martial arts cod moves directly from the pitch - a live teen fantasy product. Oh, and she is accompanied by 'Predator' as sound effects to emphasize her remarkable powers. The whole thing has a 'futuristic' vision of stunning originality - the Lloyds building filtered with AfterEffects looking somewhat green. The budget really shows - which it should not have today. On the whole, nonsensical mess of cheese, ham and cliché that Roger Corman would leave on the floor in the cutting room in his shameless, desperate moments. It is a pity that such alleged work of love gave nine minutes of unnecessary cellulose. <br /> <br />
