Grudge 2 ... Let's see. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a Japanese horror movie or horror or horror. I loved the first and original Ju-On. I feel that much more justice has been done for this. Aubrey only existed to fill in what was needed to be 'discovered' in the end, (if you have already seen Ju-On before, you already know the whole movie), it was really a complete remake of Ju-On, more accurately followed than The Grudge. Although everyone might think it was coming to America, it was a little interesting, it was expected that burning the house at the end of The Grudge left the second hunger for a new conspiracy. <br /> <br /> Save $ 6.50 and wait for it to DVD, rent it, watch it, then decide if you want to buy it. This movie is good for falling asleep in 2 in the morning movie. But overall, I would say 4 out of 10. Sorry Grudge fans, it's just ... They just failed at the moment.
