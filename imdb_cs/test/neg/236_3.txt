Like a lot of movies that include small children, it starts with "real cute" and sympathetic ... and then, after about half an hour, it becomes the opposite direction. This is certainly the case here this story of traveling time (which I usually love) where an adult meets a child who is really at the age of eight! A great prerequisite and a great main actor in Bruce Willis, but ..... <br /> <br /> Boy "Rusty" is a clever and cheerful brother and Willis Rusty grew up now as "Russell" gets abrasive with constant screaming. This is fun? No, thanks. Young Breslin has become a very good child actor who has been involved in a number of films, including "The Cat In The Hat" opposite the more famous child actor: Dakota Fanning. Overall, an unsatisfactory film, especially with all the good prints that this film got when it was released.
