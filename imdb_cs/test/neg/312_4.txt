On Halloween, the city is terrorized by a madman with a big pumpkin on his head. Bad behavior, which was threatened predominantly by local talent and ridiculous special effects, makes baaaaad. B-movie queen Linnea Quigley looks embarrassed to be part of this film, and even her distinctive charm, which has helped so many of her other films, can't help it. Check out this cheesy movie if you are looking for a good Halloween horror movie and rent a "Night of Demons" which also stars Mrs. Quigley.
