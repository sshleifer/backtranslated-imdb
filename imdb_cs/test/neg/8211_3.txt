This strange movie from Texas is about Fallon, a artsy rich boy in the late 1800s (though he looks like a 1960s singer C&W with greasy hair and sideburns) whose shipwrecks on an island owned by Count DeSade (pronounced de-sayd) with his captain. The Count is afraid of pirates and tortures a young girl who was once a pirate hostage and also tortured the captain. Meanwhile, the spooky former sister of Cassandra tells Fallon the secret of the castle. The Countess has leprosy and is mad! Fallon is imprisoned, but he brings supplies. The captain is killed by a slave of racist cartoons. Fallon is thrown into a leper dungeon who always thinks it's her wedding day. The leper bride is horny, Bu Cassandra kills her. Fallon and Cassandra escape from the castle, but the Earl and his slave are chasing dogs. DeSade kills the slave and Fallon kills DeSade. Fallon and Cassandra fall in love next year, but when the supply ship arrives, the crew refuses to take our lover because they're both lepers now. They've been living in the castle for years ... Fallon's hair turns gray and Cassandra melts. Fallon puts her in the dungeon. Our story of love and leprosy ends. So bizarre it's awake, and you can feel the car-popcorn.
