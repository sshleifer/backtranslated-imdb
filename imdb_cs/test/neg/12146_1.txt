That's a joke, right? Can't be a real movie? Isn't that a real video? Give every Harvey Milk High School baby a video camera and they could make a better movie than that. The filmmaker can't be serious ... right? Is it satire? Comedy? The drama is terribly wrong? The scenario is that it's as clear and boring as possible. Ten monkeys locked in a laptop room could come up with a better scenario. Dialogue is not a cliché. The Clichéd dialogue could encourage this holiday mess to do something like camp entertainment - but it is not and is not. Worst of the worst - the owner goes to a dramatic scene in a private apartment, dressed in a bathrobe carrying a pan like something from the "Honeymooners" episode. Whaaa ??? I saw better acting from high school drama clubs. One of the leaders is attractive, the other is not. They can't even handle a convincing kiss. So much for romance. Supporting players are jumping over the tip. Everything is underlined by a curious soundtrack, and the sound seems to be recorded in the toilet room. Most dialogue is (mercifully) incomprehensible. This dilapidated movie cake is not even worthy to be another ROCKY HORROR or a gay holiday by MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000. Anyway. SUGARPLUMS will not dance in your head - they will tread your expectations. Having an eggnog and staring at the light-hearted neighbor's holiday of light - this will be a better time.
