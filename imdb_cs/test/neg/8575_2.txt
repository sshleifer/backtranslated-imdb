I usually don't like to comment on acting in a movie because it's the only thing that goes to people who have a movie against the program. I'll make an exception in this movie. Playing in this movie is below average everywhere. I mean halfway to the movie, I wonder how the hell with the producer and / or the director they dressed up to a group of people who can't act. Although the value of the production was good, the badly written story only got worse over the poor performance of the actors and even the half-hearted attempts to twist the end of the movie, which ends pretty confusing. Are all Spanish horror movies disappointing?
