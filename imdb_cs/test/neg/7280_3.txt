The infamous horror movies seldom measure the hype that surrounds them, and I haven't hit a worse offender than Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes. After many years, I watched it and I was really pleased when I got it for Christmas and waited for the evening when my girlfriend went to settle down and watch - because she knew her extreme resistance to something really scary. I didn't have to bother. After a promising - if known - launch, which firmly sets the film in the world of survival horror "Desolution of the USA", things quickly start when the protagonists and adversaries become in a deserted wilderness. It looks like it was shot on a $ 5 budget, with cannibal clan costumes hired from a risky fashion store that specializes in faux caveman and red indian clothing, a story followed by an annoying pile of unsympathetic WASP who take on a trip to California, looking for a silver mine in the nuclear testing zone (!). When they disintegrate, they are determined by the local family of athletes and must fight for survival. While I hope for the next Deliverance, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Wrong Turn or Devil's Rejects, I really realized I stumbled across something that should remain dusty and uncovered in the backstage video store. With gallons of tomato ketchup for blood and a couple of horrible shots from the wound, I can do something Look at how 18 Certificate (in the United Kingdom) justified, but with those close shots it would look like it looked like a Saturday afternoon thriller on ITV. The entire Silver Mine / Nuclear Test Site subplot is just McGuffin to justify pitching a 'civilized' family against primitives, but given how easily savages get their asses whipped it stretches credibility to think they survived for generation of prey on passers-by. And then there is the end ... or its lack. The hills seem to have eyes, either the third or at least a satisfying denouement. Instead, I was just wondering: "Yeah, and ...?"
