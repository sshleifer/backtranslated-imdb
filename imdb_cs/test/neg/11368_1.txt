That was the worst TV movie I've ever seen. The visuals were so terribly jerky that it made me dizzy. I hated constant zooming and frequent switching between black and white and color. I also thought the Story didn't make any sense of what had ever happened, and that was another action movie clich√©, with the hero a bad guy and a few hostages. Could I do a better film than my own camera, why? I can keep it, something the director couldn't do. Despite all the worst I've ever seen, did Disney think he was bad? I didn't even bother to look at the whole thing because I'm sure I could guess the result, and the visual was the worst thing I've ever seen.
