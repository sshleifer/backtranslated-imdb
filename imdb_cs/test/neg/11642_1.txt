If you're in bad movies for fun witnessing bad movies, bad acting, bad productions, etc. and the Mystery Science Theater 3000 quality .... you'll love Pacific Inferno. Jim Brown will be forever remembered as one of the biggest football players ever to play the game ... as an actor he will be forever remembered as one of the biggest football players ever to play the game ... I'm not sure who Rolf Bayer was ... but I hope he was 15 or 16 years old when he ordered it, maybe it was another Spielberg in production ... because if he was an adult man driving it ... 16 years he could do better. or the storyline of the film may have had some historical merit, and perhaps truthfully accurate ... but the real movie may be one of the worst films made in American film history ... I waited for Lee Marvin, William Holden, or Charles Bronson to save themselves anything that remained of this movie. I'd like to be on the red carpet, the black tie haberdashery to open Hollywood when this movie looked ... because this movie had to have a lot of viewers who laughed and crouched under the breath ... it's on the DVD DVD shelves now .... look for fun value ... this movie is so bad it is too good to do it ...
