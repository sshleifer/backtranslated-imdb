"The House of the Dead 2: Dead Target" (2005) is a sequel, though you don't really need to see the first "House of the Dead" to get this movie. This means the production value is definitely here, with great zombie effects and it's customized pretty nicely, with a very effective sound design. However, it said it was all that was good here. The story and the script are terrible. . . there are reckless holes everywhere. It's also funny how soldiers don't mind when they get blood on their faces (as opposed to 28 days later when blood infects you in any part of your body). Also realistic as there are few orders with soldiers here as opposed to the usual American military discipline. <br /> <br /> A 4 of 10.
