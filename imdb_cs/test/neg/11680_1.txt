This is by far one of the most challenging movies I've ever seen. it is a tight slap on the face of some Indians who speak English and look at the mirror. disgusting. version of chewing gum policy in the 1970s North Indian plains. the message - an educated English-speaking Indian tried to save the poor beggars of India in all seriousness. it ignores the fact that poor beggars are also able to save themselves. <br /> <br /> as a love story is fine. The problem is that the love story and character development is based on a totally fraudulent policy version.
