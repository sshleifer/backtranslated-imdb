So I turned to HBO, which I just thought it would have some quality movies and I saw it. Carrot Top is so rude that it's nausea to watch. I've seen unreal movies before, but I think I found that this is so impossible to watch because Carrot Top seems to be cheerful. Watching this movie is really like watching a movie designed for a 5 year old with crazy over top spilling full of ultra silly jokes that only 4 years old would appreciate. <br /> <br /> What is amazing is how some of the other talented actors, such as Larry Miller and M Emmet Walsh, were involved in this project. If you've ever seen Carrot Top is a totally awful MCI ad (or what they were) then it's more the same, just worse. It's a grotesque celebration that is a waste of a high budget that could do something to save the homeless ... nothing but this. I'm not sure it's in the lower half of all time, but it's a shame for $ 10 million.
