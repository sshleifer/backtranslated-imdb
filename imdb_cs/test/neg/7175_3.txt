It is the bottom of a B-type barrel film from one of the studios with poverty, the Monogram, in the mid-1940s, which filled a double bill. The only reason I watched was to see what JACKIE MORAN is in the lead role as a boy in a radio station trying to solve a murder. Phil Meade played in GONE WITH WIND just two years earlier and that was one of his last roles in the teens. It's not Mickey Rooney. <br /> <br /> The scenario is as unfortunate as the production values ​​and is full of clichés that have taken place in situations where individuals are not united. WANDA McKAY is a girl who is "discovered" by a radio producer and SIDNEY MILLER is a stupid friend of the hero who is afraid of his own shadow. is resolved after rounding off all suspects. Terribly overworked, the only silent performance of any interest is given by JON GILBREATH as Tex, a cowboy, but he bites the dust after too short a look. There are several songs, but all of them are forgotten as well as lame jokes and dialogue.
