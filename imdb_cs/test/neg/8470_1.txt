Forget what I said about Emeril. Rachael Ray is the most exciting personality in the food network and throughout television. If you have never seen 30 minutes of food, then you cannot begin to understand how uncomfortable it is. I really really thought you couldn't even start it until you see the show once or twice, and even all the words and intelligent thoughts will fail you. The problem is usually with her mannerisms, as you may have guessed. Ray has a goofy mouth and often mimics a parrot. If you love something or think it's "amazing" (a word that uses about 87 times on TV), say it. And constantly using horrible, rude phrases like "EVOO" (extra virgin olive oil!). SHUT UP! What's worse, Ray has two more shows on the net! I think this is some complicated plot of terrorists who will drive us crazy. Give me more Tyler Florence! Ray is lame.
