This film is a shameful result of what happens when: <br /> <br /> A) It is written, directed and produced by an idiot. and / or B) It was rushed in production to feed poker / Stu Ungar craze. <br /> <br /> The story is uneven. Vidmer spends too much time on Ungara's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary stories - such as card counting, his blackjack escapades, the role of money as id. It also mentions other poker players such as chip reese, brunson, etc. The film is a mess from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want to have a more complete and accurate account, read One of a kind. If you thought the movie was good, read the book and change your mind.
