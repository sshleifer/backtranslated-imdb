No one will be wrong SQUALL for a good movie, but it's definitely unforgettable. Once you take the performance of Myrna Loy as Nubi, a hot bloody gypsy girl, you probably won't forget the experience. When this film was made exotic beautiful Miss Loy was still to be cast as foreign foxes, often Asian and usually sinister. I'm sure she's attentive here. Her skin seems to have darkened and her hair curled. In most scenes she is barefoot and wearing a little more than a skirt and a loose saddle, while on one scene she has nothing but a patterned towel. I suppose I'm focusing on Miss Loy's appearance because it's the best, if not the only, reason to tune in and watch this wrinkled antique. Certainly the dialogue will not attract you, which is hopeless. In one typical passage, Nubi looks out the window at the departing caravan and the wax poetics: "Always gypsies, sing. Strange and sad. When the great sun has a breath of fire that burns, and when the pale moon looks from behind the cloud and breathe air like death, they sing. "Poetic or what? Purple prose lovers will have a field day. But I can't help it, but if in her later years Miss Loy didn't want to remember her involvement in this project. <br /> <br /> Like so many early Lectures, this was an adaptation of recent Broadway success. The stage version was opened at the 48th Street Theater in November 1926 and ran for more than a year, provoking a famous episode including humorist and theater critic Robert Benchley, who was known to have resistance to characters, who spoke in a thick dialect or pidgin English, according to a very repeated anecdote, Mr. Benchley shuddered in the opening part of this show, where the Spanish village setting (moved to a Hungarian village for film, for some reason) gave the actor the freedom to train their accents with changing The degree of success, but Benchley's patience reached its limit when, during the family dinner In sequence, the door cracked open and the actress dressed as a gypsy girl slipped into the room and shouted, "Help! Help! Then she threw herself on the legs of the lover's house and shouted, "I Nubi! I'm a good girl! I'll stay here!" At this point, Mr. Benchley got up and told his companion, "I Bobby. I am a bad boy. I am going now," and left the theater. The movie version offers many examples of unintended humor, but never approaches Benchley's level of joke. The Melodramatic Plot relates to Lajos Family: Father Joseph, Mother Maria, and Son Paul, a student at a nearby college. We regard this prosperous family as a "higher middle class" because they are the owners of land with servants and all the comforts of life, but their comfortable existence is suddenly thrown into riots when a Gypsy caravan arrives in the village and their home is attacked, yes, Nubi, cheerful Gypsy girl. He comes to his door during the name storm - symbolizing stormy emotions. The girl runs away from an offensive relationship and asks for a sanctuary. After considering the matter, the Lajos family agrees to hide it from her angry lover who appears shortly afterwards but is averted. Nubi becomes a household servant. Kindness motivates the family's decision to take her, but soon that Nubi enjoyed little good for nothing, paid them to seduce every capable man in the neighborhood, starting with Lajos's servant Peter, then going up. son of Paul. Nubi divides Paul's relationship with his fiancé Irma (played by Loretta Young, still a teenager), causes him to break out of school, and then asks him to buy jewelry by stealing the savings of his maid Lena (ZaSu Pitts). Lena still mourns from her side the loss of her own fiancé, Peter, seduced and threw Nubi as she turned to Paul. Nubi is finally focusing on the floors of the familias Joseph, and I suppose if the run were longer, she would also go to Uncle Dani, Mary, a village priest, and God knows who else. I think it goes without saying that a scenario like this is easy to parody, but during its first half, SQUALL still draws an undeniable fascination with daily soap: we watch, hypnotize how Bad Girl works on the spells of men. - shares and causes the trigger as an irresistible force of nature (almost like-- a storm! Ah-haa, another metaphor!). But as the plot of machinations on campy fun disappears. During the later scenes of Nubi's de-stressed and focus switches to the dysfunctional dynamics of Lajos family, and after a while these people become real resistance. The son behaves primarily as an absolute heel, but his parents never recognize it, nor do they meet their own shortcomings; All we've been told is Nubi's fault, it's a no-good hiker. The cast men are boring. Aside from Miss Loy, the only actress who can handle the interviews, ZaSu Pitts, is amazing as usual. The mother of Lajos's household is played by Alice Joyce, a long silent star who was out of her role with speaking roles and who soon retired. Loretta Young's fresh premonition provides a nice contrast to Nubi's dark grace, but her line reading is so embarrassing that it's kind of pleasure. No, there's only one reason to watch this movie, and that's Nubi herself. I can't think of another actress who could play this stupid role and managed to leave halfway through. However, I am not an objective observer. I have a desperate commotion on Myrna Loy and will look at her in anything, even SQUALL.
