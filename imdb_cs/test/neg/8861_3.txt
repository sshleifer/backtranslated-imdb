... when this movie was on. <br /> <br /> What's boring. Trying to humor, but he didn't really pull him out. Several good ideas were busy and the make-up of the actors and the wardrobe were fine. <br /> <br /> I expected a lot more, unfortunately I couldn't sit any more, I switched off halfway through the video and pulled out the tape, went to the rental office to get my money back
