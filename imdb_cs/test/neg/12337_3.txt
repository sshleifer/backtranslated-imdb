The real one released, the novel is so brilliant stomach swirling the way into madness, but that for the TV movie nonsense nonsense is turgid and painfully slow. Stay with Mike Hammer. I find it difficult to believe that no body has made a brilliant version of this book, Kubrick is creeping over her cover, taking the reins. Stacey Keach is too fleeting as Lou Ford, and the whole thing has the same production values ​​as the 1970s that took place, the Planet of the Apes. I strongly recommend that you go out and buy a lot of Jim Thompson's novels, actually The Grifters is not doing too bad, that's one of his, Jon Cusak plays the lead role.
