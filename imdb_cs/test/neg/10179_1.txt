Probably a magazine magazine that broadcasts journalists to explore UFO news, one of them being more or less tolerant or agnostic about the whole affair, and the other Aussie, a stiff skeptic who laughs at the UFO nonsense. It's all that is happening, some kind of money to make rockets. It turned out that this film is actually a delusion, and a trap that actually declares Christian teachings and a Christian explanation of the UFOs I've heard before. . This is an ad hoc explanation, which in itself is not at all biblical, but invented by some modern theologians who enter everything and everything into mythology. Paranormal? It is real, only demonic, if it does not happen in the Christian context, then of course it is from God. Simple, if it's not from God, it's a devil, stupid! I suppose Beethoven's 9th Symphony was not inspired by God but had to be written under demonic influence. Or logic would lead to absurdity. We are informed that since the Bible does not say about life on other planets in the universe, there is no (Ad Ignorantium error version) and that God created the universe so vast, so great that it will show us its all-powerful power. I think of Carl Sagan's remark that if God created such a huge universe and stuck life only on Earth, it would be a huge amount of space. <br /> <br /> What are UFOs? They are demonic activities and concern the early Christian event that is about to become an earthquake ... Rapture. Before the trouble, true Christians will disappear from the earth's surface, causing mass panic, confusion, car and plane to fall ... anything. Satan because it knows that he is sending his demons to basically create the illusion of extraterrestrial spacecraft and extraterrestrial abductions that can then be used to explain this otherwise unexplained event. All the part of Satan's plan that will, of course, prevent people from looking at God or Jesus and falling down on AntiChrist's lies. This ad hoc explanation also explains the theological mishmash by explaining one mystery to another, in opposition to the scientific method of explaining the unknown, strange and mysterious to the greatest extent possible, first known, if not only known. It's like jumping straight to a stranger's kidnapping whenever a child is missing and missing. I think I would first look at a secular explanation, such as a child who ran away, was lost or kidnapped for ransom or kidnapped by a predatory pedophile before attacking aliens, supernatural or satanic or some of them. This kind of fundamentalist fraud or trap is nothing new because young people are often attracted to Free Rock concerts that can start with something harmless and then suddenly turn into overt Christian music, followed by preaching and preaching . call the altar. This kind of obvious fraud one might think would be a more Satanic ball game. But perhaps because the Christian faith will soon be in her deadly horrors, these guys feel that something is going on, any scam or deception or terrible tactic is acceptable to try to keep alive the faith that faces serious opposition from both secularists and by secularists. competitive beliefs such as Islam, the fastest growing religion in the world that can replace Christianity well, because Islam is much more coherent and united and more logical than Christian fundamentalism. Although it would only offer a small advantage to mankind, it would replace one intolerant system of ideas with others. Of course, the film ends with more or less Pascal. The atheistic Aussie, who is skeptical about almost everything, is told. Well, if you are right that there is no afterlife and death is nothing but rotting in the grave, feel free ... but what if you are wrong? In essence, statements that suggest reality is going to adapt to anything but an atheistic view or Christian fantasy is a false dilemma or illusion of black and white. Even if the atheists were wrong, it would not necessarily lead to the right Christianity, even if it turned out that Christianity in its theology is full of holes, that materialistic atheists are, by default, administrative. For all Native American spirituality, it could prove to be the best description of the ultimate reality, and we could all wish that we would treat Earth and its creations a little better. <br /> <br /> This movie should be stamped right on the box: Attention: It contains religious propaganda and is not intended for informative or entertaining purposes.
