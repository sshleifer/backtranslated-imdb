This plot had more holes in it than Alibi Simpson OJ! I've noticed two Star Trek links in the movie, and yet, ironically, we have the lead character played by Andy Garcia <br /> who is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy, "<br /> The needs of many outweigh the few or one needs. Let's say that while trying to save his son from cancer, he gives most of the rest of San Francisco an incredible risk. Michael Keaton's character is almost as unrealistic <br /> <br />. He neglects to kill at many occasions and yet he is angry when Garcia foil his <br /> <br /> attempt to kill a lot of cops at once. The pediatrician remains in charge of his faculty even after he has been held hostage several times in a short period of time, but he has placed it on a wide 5-floor walkway and she is losing. Andy Garc√≠a's child is something like anathema in this movie. He is the most sympathetic and real character, one of the film's bright spots. He further pronounces the line, that had to be the result of serendipity, regarding the fight against cancer that parallels Keaton's motivation to escape. All in all, the movie was not a complete scrap (see From Twilight to Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money <br /> <br /> for it) but disappointing due to the talent on the side.
