This is perhaps the worst document I've ever seen. It looked so amateurish. Chris Hegedus was one of The War Room's directors, which was a great movie (albeit a little one-sided), but it looked beautiful. Startup.com seemed to be shot in a basement. The quality was so woeful that I couldn't stand it. I saw about 30 minutes or so and I had to take it back to stunt and get something else. I can't understand how something so amateur from someone like Chris Hegedus. How the hell did it win any prizes that start ??? The war room definitely deserved awards, as did another large documentary called Ameragosa (both awarded). This document looked like it was done by Uncle Joe, who also does weekends weddings. Shaky, dimly lit, unflattering lighting, bad sound, 10 years old could make a better film than that guy.
