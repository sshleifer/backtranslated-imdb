Bad basketball movie. In the 1960s, a mid-school gruff coach with a dubious background arrives at a small Indiana basketball team and trains the boys to victory by first dividing them and then building them. object. Photo OK. But the plot is completely predictable. No real parcels. Nothing was added to make the movie exciting. You know what happens from the beginning. Suitable for 4th graders.
