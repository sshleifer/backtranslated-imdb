The Untold ... It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story seems to be original, but it was wrong on the screen. Lance Henriksen, a good actor, ended up in this crap. But, hey he made a lot of low budget movies ... you have to pay the bills, you know? Kidding. Lance is a great actor, but he ended up with a lot of stupid actors. Seriously, Andrea Roth was there just to have a nudity scene, and other actors ... well they were there. The adjustments have disappeared, and that makes me sick! That was the worst move that is still coming and really angry. It was also very predictable, boring and slow. It has a bizarre pace that just goes ... wrong. I can't say more ... don't rent it or buy it. You can watch TV.
