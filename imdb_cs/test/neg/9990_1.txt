I saw this movie at the age of 18 with a group of friends. Her reputation preceded him, and although all my friends were also of legal age, I myself had the courage to enter the video store and actually rent it. We gathered in a house where parents left town for the weekend. Although we were sitting in close proximity, we did not even speak or recognize our presence. As it turned out, the film deserves and does not deserve the premature shame we felt. Unmistakable when it comes to utter gratuitous content but disappointed in any other way. Caligula tries to overcome the genres by combining a historic epic with a rough porn movie. It fails miserably in its ambitions, subjecting the audience to the worst of both worlds. The film's obvious selling point is its pornographic aspect, and it really provides much more than its share of real, graphic sex. But in setting this sex in the context of Caligula's spoiled reign, it dignizes the act even less than the average film for adults. Contextless sex could at least be physically pleasing to the adult adults involved, but the pleasure and perhaps the consent are largely absent from the Caligula world. In it, sex at best serves as idle entertainment and, at worst, as a tool of sadistic domination. Nowadays it is rather common to hear words like "sin" and "corruption" that are used with confidence to describe acts that are pleasant and yet considered taboos by certain moral or religious considerations. Caligula takes the viewer across borders by showing real corruption and demonstrating that no joy or pleasure comes out of it. Not only do the historical parts not mean meaningful contextualization of sex, but they also can't entertain, enlighten, intrigue, or attract the viewer in any way. They only provide lengthy sections of hardy tedia. Rarely did the film prove so boring. Sex after the initial shock and amazement disappears, it only contributes to the overall monotony of the image. It is rarely a film about his violence. While many more violent films than Caligula have been produced, few of them can compete with it for the shock value of its violence. The relentless barbarism and hyper-corrupt sexuality seem to characterize Caligula's empire. Violence is even less for a weak heart than sex. A review like this will probably generate as much curiosity as it quells. I understand why someone would like to see this movie; After all, I myself succumbed to the same curiosity. I just hope that my review by clearly describing its lack of redeeming value will provide potential viewers with at least knowledgeable information to decide whether to see it or not. My high-school criminal teacher described police work as "a bored clock interrupted by moments of utter terror." This statement perfectly describes Caligula. You were warned.
