Eaten Alive follows a young woman (Janet Agren) who is looking for her lost sister. It turned out that her sister had joined a sect that had disappeared in the jungles of Borneo. With a Vietnamese veteran Mark on her side, she sets out to find her sister. According to the usual behavior, acting is not of the highest quality, but you get a cannibal flick poster girl Me Me Lai spends most of the time on the bare screen, female management Janet Agren covered with gold and abused with a dildo dipped in snake blood. Now it must count something! But I have to say it's hard for me to recommend this title. If you're a fan of this genre, you'll most likely recognize all the gore scenes in the movie bar to pick a pair. And I mean it literally. Lots of gore scenes are picked up directly from other Cannibal films such as MAN Z DEEP RIVER and LAST CANNIBAL WORLD. There is probably more movies stuck there. Finally, this is one for dying fans to check their list. If you haven't seen any Italian jungle movies, you should be better watching CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and if you're an avid fan, you've seen most gore scenes in other movies.
