The following "review" is one of the wrong side of the song, which means two things: You won't hear anything but praise coming from me and don't be fooled by my rating. I could also tell you that this review doesn't contain spoilers, but technically ... that's a lie. <br /> <br /> Well ... Screw the review. I'm just going to hang out a little. It's been a long time since I've had so much fun with such a bad movie. And if you can't enjoy this piece of sheer drivel, then you just don't have a sense of humor. First, this movie was supposed to be taken seriously, and this is the main aspect was the fun coming. Story? The doctor is terminally ill. Daddy-Doctor decides that hart-transplantation must be the only way to save his son. So, in real madness, he decides that the gorilla's heart will do the trick. Of course, the gorilla's heart is "too powerful for a man," so the sonny-boy transforms into this hideous Ape-Man, who breaks instantly and continues to kill and rape (because that's just what some horny beast did ?). The makeup of our Ape-Man is cheerful. It's just no other way to give it: The face of guys looks like turd! I'm talking about human excrement here, about the hard brown! Beautiful! Gore is also fabulous in this movie: In addition to the real shots of an open-heart operation, we also have incredibly false (but quite ugly) looking effects on blood and gore: decapitation, gouging, throat bursting, scalping one's skull, ... and indeed it is incomprehensible why the NIGHT OF BLOODY APES got into the notorious British Video-Nasties list because all the nasty things portrayed in this movie are just too ridiculous to be taken seriously. By the way, there is only one bloody monkey running. Needless to say, LA HORRIPILANTE BESTIA HUMANA is a much more accurate title for this terrifying and compelling story of science that is terribly bad. When you are not trying to shock the depiction of female nudity with poorly staged acts of bloody violence or accidental violence, this film can be very entertaining with ingredients such as absurd dialogues, cheap cardboard sets, conspiracy of stupidity and incredibly bad acting. Maybe just a few random examples? About Sets: One can clearly see that set-designers have just used the same walls, doors, windows (etc.) Again and again to build different sets of interiors (eg: One side of a hospital room - the side of the window - where the unconscious wrestler lies, looks suspiciously similar to the basement lab window, where Ape-Man escapes, the designers also took one of the lab side windows, made it a little bigger and just placed it in the hospital conference room, all the walls in each building the same gray , ...). Then there's a park setting. Clearly shot in the studio, you can see (on several occasions) that the grass is free. Whenever fighting / fighting / rape happens, the grass shifts and shuffles and you can see gray concrete from the floor of the studio underneath. Just a few random lines coming out of the actors mouth: <br /> <br /> - In a conference room where all doctors are discussing the disappearance of Unconscious Wrestling Girl (a disappearance that would obviously mean bad publicity) for the hospital), Dad-Doctor intelligently pronounces "We are in a difficult situation". During the same debate, a fellow-doctor cleverly remarks that "A sleepwalker! Every deputy gets up." Disappearance Unconscious Wrestling Girl. - After our investigative detective, thanks to the amazing process of his own logical deduction, closes and tells his supervisor that the killer must be half a man / half beast, his superior replies that it is absurd, adds a line "It's more likely to be late, more." and more, you watch many of those horror photos on TV ... ... truly one of the best lines of the movie. Another sources of laughter: <br /> Two scenes were daddy-doctor and his Igor-like assistant kidnapped the gorilla from the zoo and the unconscious wrestler from the hospital - these thoughtful abduction acts are like taking candy from child. - Daddy-Doctor talks to God a lot, right? Sonny-boy calls Daddy-Doctor "Papa" on more than one occasion. Old lady shouts "Aaargh !!! Dead man! Dead man! Dead man !! CHILD MAN !!!". The story stops regularly so that it can move in the scenes of female wrestling, only to resume and do nothing about this concept. Sure, Daddy-Doctor replaces Sonny- Boy's gorilla-heart for the second time with Unconscious Match Girl, but do you think something spectacular happens to be after that? Like Ape-Turd-Man growing breasts or something, trying to rape men this time? Our leading life game of beauty (Norma Lazareno) doesn't even go into matches with a climate match with Ape-Turd-Man near the film finale ... But Ape-Turd-Man starts showing some maternal love near the end ... almost (and I say) almost ") in the true KING KONG style (ie, at the top of the building and people on the ground who showed and shouting). Well, I think that's enough now. Vomitron's rational rating for this slim piece Happy T-Shirts: 2/10 Vomitron's Rating From Bad Side Songs: 8/10.
