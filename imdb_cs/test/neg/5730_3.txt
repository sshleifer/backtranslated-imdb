Red Sonja is wrong for Arnold Schwarzenegger. After making a couple of sword "n" witch movies (like Conan), he made some more serious acting roles in films such as The Terminator and Commando, just to make a mystifying return to the "n" sword genre for this debacle in 1985. It's hard to see why he bothered because it is weaker than both Conan films in every conceivable separation. Reportedly it was supposed to be Conan's third film, but for one reason or another, the emphasis was shifted to the leading female character, the titular red head, leaving poor old Arnold to play an incredibly boring supporting role. Director Richard Fleischer also thought, giving world classics such as 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Fantastic Cruise, The Boston Strangler and 10 Rillington Place. In this - his penultimate movie - Fleischer also took a huge career step backwards. The Bad Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman) wants to rule the world and needs an invaluable and powerful talisman. She and her brutal army attack the inhabited priestesses and steal the talisman, massacre the helpless priestesses as they go. One of the dead priestesses has a sister named Sonja (Brigitte Nielsen), a fiery red-headed warrior who, on hearing of her sister's death, swears revenge on the evil Gedren. Sonja is driving through the ground looking for Gedren's lair. Along the way rises companions in the shape of a prince boy, Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard Falkon (Paul Smith). She also meets the muscular warrior Conan - sorry, I mean, Kalidor (!) - who joins her in her quest. Initially, Sonja does not want to help Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), instead of proving that he can confront and defeat his enemies himself, but finally warms up and receives his help. Red Sonja It's an incredibly poor movie, all the more so when you think it was made in 1985 when the 'n' witchcraft genre was near its end. It seems so simplistic and amateur that he can easily memorize it for an early example of his kind. The whole performance is poor, from Bergman's embarrassed OTT villain to Reyes' incredibly irritating dirty brat to Schwarzenegger's wooden and enthusiastic hero. Nielsen is a little better than a heroine - probably full of enthusiasm to think she is in her first lead - but is very poorly released by the stupidity of Clive Exton and George MacDonald Fraser's screenplay. The film is riddled with stupidity, including a scene where Schwarzenegger is seen in the detailed hacking of cowards, but in a long shot in the same sequence, the corpse is not in sight. Technically it is also very awkward, with non-standard special effects and scary mechanical monsters. There are few compensations, such as Ennio Morricone's pleasant music (Morricone spent much of the '80s providing good music for terrible movies, eg Island, Treasure of Four Crowns and Hundra). Another compensation is that Giuseppe Rotunno is the lens of places - in fact it is very nice to look at the beautiful scenery than the actors in the foreground! There were very few sword 'n' witch movies after Red Sonja, so in some ways it might go down in history as a film that destroyed its own genre.
