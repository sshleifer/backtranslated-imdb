I just wanted to say that I was very disappointed after watching this movie! I was expecting a biblical story that was visualized with a big special fx, etc., but during the movie I found it to be a total disaster ... it wasn't biblical at all ... only the ship and the animals were similar to the ship story ... you want If the visual "translation" of the biblical version of Noah, do not take this film!
