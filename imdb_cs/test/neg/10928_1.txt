It seems that the people involved in this film stuff up ballot boxes to increase their ranking. Good news that only 18 people saw it. I suppose it makes me 19. I have no part in the film and I don't know who did it, and I'm a longtime IMDb user (check my record of voting and reviews over the past seven years), so I promise to be honest and impartial. He comes to you from a thirty-year-old horror fan who has also appeared in several low budget movies himself. boring and technically flawless. It was apparently shot in silent action, and the sound then dubbed in; most of them sound as if they are loaded with a can and a piece of string. More than three quarters of the dialogue is inaudible. I watched it from start to finish and I have no idea what the story was, or even if it existed. The director seems to be particularly impressed by the long shots of the table corners and the dead black spaces that will do nothing but fall into the film. That would be a problem if he actually developed a conspiracy and made a film that had a sense of stimulation. However, the rule does not apply in this case. No matter how scenes are shot, they don't add a story. Watching this video is a futility exercise at every level. Whether the people who worked on it write and try to influence the rating here on IMDb, it's just bad, boring stuff. This is a true truth. If you're thinking of spending money or time on this, think again. It is easy to find something better, because you will not find much worse. And that's a true truth.
