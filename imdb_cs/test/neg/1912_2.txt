One can always tell if I like the movie by how many times I ran my legs, switch positions, mild rustling sounds, etc., etc. Smaller = the better. In this film, I have moved so many times that I managed to flip my buddy giant bath of popcorn and get into a huge thigh booster workout. She never screamed her daughter, "she promised her saucer talent, she played badly in a badly written part." Depressing fact number one. Number Two: Chris Klein was in it. Depressing fact number three: Chris Klein had lines. Number Four: Chris Klein played valedictorian. Woah. Rich Family Dummies Will Unite! Worse still, he's actually trying to act, but he only succeeds in sounding like a mentally handicapped overreader in an ever more satisfied independent version of Cecille B. DeMille. Go back to hurrying your American colleagues. This film was terrible in almost every sense, saved Josh Hartnett's slightly cute performance as LeeLee's stiff friend Jasper. Fortunately, he refrains from having too many "moments", unlike all the other characters. Of course, that is why it is much better than the rest, and in fact shows some tricks. If you like Josh or think you're throwing a baby who knows a few things, he's your man. Hartnett is a sharp actor, but the rest doesn't need more lambering. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 10 (for poor Hartnett in this horrible movie) <br /> <br />
