STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Missing Mark *** That Little Piece Between ** Lagging Behind * Pits <br /> <br /> Based on Stephen King's other long news, this takes place in the sleepy little town of New England at Castle Rock (also the name of the film production company!), where a new antique shop, the titular Needful Things, was opened. The owner and owner of Leland Gaunt (Max Von Sydow) hides, maybe you say, a devilish secret. There is an item in his shop that everyone in a small town wishes - you must first pay a small cash price before a much more expensive price is required. As suspicion, hatred and madness tears the city apart, it falls to police chief Alan Pangborn (Ed Harris) to restore order and save the city from the scary end ... I read the Needful Things novel earlier this year, And was eager to watch the movie adaptation again to compare them (as it will be some competition!) But it was removed on video and DVD and I couldn't find anywhere to rent from. So I was happy when I finally found a flea market while on a shopping trip ... <br /> <br /> It's one of the cruelest irony that King novels are generally the best to read, but when they fit the screen nine times out of Ten are complete junk, as in this case. The material that makes his book great simply does not translate into a movie script very well, for some reason. And I suppose there's always a question: why bother when I could read a book instead? <br /> <br /> I appreciate that some of them are just too lengthy (ie, a Stand) to be done in a full screen with all the situations and characters, but there is no reason why this content could not be included. all material from the book. As a result, many key characters from the book (ie Ace Merrill) are not included at all and we have some horrible character development, which means that we don't care about the characters involved because they are so deprived of depth and Motivation - for example, we have one character from the book, Danforth Keaton, who murdered her wife to the end, but we were not shown that for some reason she wouldn't have come across her or hate her and so she has it. No impact when it happens, unlike a book where a lot of depth has been invested and you were really interested in finding out what happened to the characters involved. All the material in the script to fill the cracks, if you like, is really stupid and curly and typically goofy stuff that gets into King adaptations like this. Most of the film's problems are that it deviates so far from the book, but there's also some horrible action from the cast that apparently can't feel for the daft material that they are asked to perform. In the 1990s, a lot of King's work began to jump over the cinema and just made it into the made-for-TV / video territory. Such waste must certainly indicate why. **
