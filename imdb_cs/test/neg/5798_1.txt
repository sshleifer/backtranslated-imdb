I can only laugh at anything, but unfortunately there is not the only one in this stinking bomb !!!! I honestly watched this movie from start to finish, and I didn't even smile. I am shocked that Sandler, Schneider, Spade etc. would give their names to this piece of crap. Worse than the worst that ever came from the worst that ever came from former SNL players. What more can I say? How could such a tasteless, extremely unfair drivel come from such apparent talent! Maybe I lost my sense of humor (it's not likely), but I can't remember a movie that I haven't noticed for a long time. What waste in 2 hours I will never return.
