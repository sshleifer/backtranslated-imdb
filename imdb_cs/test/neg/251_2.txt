This film should be billed as three film summaries linked together to create a feature film (including many footage of people who slowly walk through dark corridors and streets). BE WARNING! The first hour of this movie is simply a re-hash of the first two Aztec films, as the main character said. The real movie won't start until the thing is almost over. I have to say that Batu's overclocking is pretty fun. <br /> <br /> As for the robot, I thought the robot was a mechanical device that might or may not be human. The bat's robot consists of a radioactive reanimated dead body enclosed in the main body of the robot. As Tom Servo said, "She's not so impressive, she doesn't even have her knees!" And it takes about an hour for the robot to turn over the room. But once you get caught, WATCH OUT! He will break you down with a touch (powered by radio? Plow-easy!). This is a great movie when Joel and Bots accompany him. Otherwise, you're just gutting for abuse.
