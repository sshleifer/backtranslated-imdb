This is one of the movies you watch with a group of people. You'll have the best time. It's really, really bad, just like Showgirls bad, but without the quality of Showgirls. You have the best combination of bad actors, bad director and bad script. Everything that can be bad that he can do for a fun evening, you have here. The first is "a group of teenagers ..." These people are just like "grandma" like my grandmother. <br /> <br /> The director has no sense of tension or tension. 30 year old "teenagers" stand around and "monster" comes out and attacks, and to a large extent, happens throughout the movie when monsters are revealed. There is no tension to this or this surprise. It's more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just as you went. And when I use the word "monsters", I'm exaggerating. More like a couple of guys in Halloween masks bought in .99 cent store. There is no doubt that this script was started in a few days, no transcripts and I just imagine how bad and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur without a clue. It's another example of one of the bad things about this day and age: anyone can make a movie. But of course the best bad thing about this movie is acting. It's as bad as you can get. There is no person in this person who has the slightest ability to act and leadership is the absolute worst. It adds every line in this monotonous way without any expression, and you have to wonder how such a bad guy could get a role in any movie, no matter who knows. When he had to "scream" when his girlfriend was killed, it was one of the most fun scenes I've ever seen in the movie. Watching these people who are performing some of the terrible dialogues is very fun. But when the black man said, "Tell her ... tell her ... I love her ..." before his deadly scene, there was a huge laugh among our group. Funny, funny things. My only hope is that this film gets a bad rating to take its place, including: in the IMDb 100 lowest rated movies. We can do it, people! <br /> <br /> PS. It is some surprise that one "big" commentary that this movie got was from someone in Virginia (who has one comment, only on this movie and nothing else). And guess where the movie was made? Virginia. I said it before and I will say it again: people who work on film should not be able to comment on it.
