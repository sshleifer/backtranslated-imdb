Wow! This movie is too bad for words. Obviously the writers wanted to somehow link this to the Ghoulies franchise, so they got Pete Liapis from the first one to reprise his role as Jonathan ... only now, he is a cop and has no similar character traits as he did in the first one. . The ghouls in this are not ghouls of the last. Cheap-looking puppets were replaced by even cheaper costumed little people. Instead of being a major adversary or being evil, they are more like comic book characters who have never appeared. <br /> <br /> The first time I saw this movie, it looked like I was seeing it before. Why was that? Because everything in this was stolen from another movie. All the cheesy cop lines and action scenes were from Lethal Weapon. The ghouls were almost like Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck, except they weren't funny at all. Even the scenes from the original film Ghoulies were sprinkled with this film. I think the target audience was supposed to be an adult, but a mixture of black magic, cartoon slapstick, drama drama and bad work play. I hope they won't make Ghoulies V because I don't want their movie studio losing money. <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 78 minutes. R for violence.
