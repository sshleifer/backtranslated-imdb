Mr. Accident is a deliberate series of non-stop catastrophes and near death experiences reminiscent of Saturday morning Warner Brothers cartoons. Just as a coyote who falls off a cliff 5 times per episode, "leading man" (more than adult kid's) can always postpone his meeting with Grimm Reaper. This Australian surprise "is insultingly unfair and sometimes even depressing." 2 (out of ten) are for stunt stunts (some have never tried Daffy Duck) and use vivid colors (like those high-level commercials). can be an age group where this "comedy" finds the following. I'm sure I passed this age long ago. Calling all preteens: Here is "ha-ha" for ya!
