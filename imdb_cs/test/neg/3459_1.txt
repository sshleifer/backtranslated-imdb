I also made a mistake when I thought I was going to see the 2003 swimming stream with Geoffry Rus. That was worse than many student films I saw. The script was forced, acting was subordinate and editing unpleasant. It was so slow that I could make myself stay. But I always give the film a chance, so I suffered to the very end. A note probably appeared about this film because I and I were the only ones in the theater. Why didn't someone send me this note?!?! That's why I'm posting as a warning to others who are thinking of shelling good money to see it. I just hope you got to this page and didn't fall into the trap as if I looked at the bad "Swimming upstream". P.S. I'm sorry to cast and crew if you read this. I know you worked hard. I know what's going on in the movie ... keep trying!
