It starts to look like it might go somewhere, then quickly leads the main characters into a three-circle circus of remarkable stupidity that permanently destroys any character's liking. I'm a huge stoner movie collector, but I wouldn't consider this a valid addition. Bong Water is the waste from the deepest areas of the bin and I wouldn't be caught on my field with it. I am actually convinced that this film was created by the Drug Free Partnership for America. If you are a Jack Black fan then I would say that you can think that 5 minutes of movies is fine because Jack Black continues his song of retard singing. I really can't say enough bad stuff about this movie.
