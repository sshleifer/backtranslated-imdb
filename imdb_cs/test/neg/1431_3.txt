What starts quite well (and quite disturbing) quickly plunges into an unpleasant mess. Dee Snider (out of Twisted Sister's shame) has apparently written the script out of her own idea, and while the idea of ​​cyber stalking pierce freak has the potential, it really blows it out for uneven stimulation, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest endless endings, you will ever see. Despite some inanimate performances, the director manages a really haunted first reel. It really looks like it will be a good low-budget effort. No such luck. The plot goes all over the map, and Snider's character tirelessly spits out the tedious psychotic fortune that is to undergo a meaningful dialogue. Worse yet, the support casts hardly register and the only charming dialogue comes from a young girl who helps the detective to browse the internet. <br /> <br /> What a waste of a great idea. And if you don't care, there's a new twisted sister.
