Uncle Fred Olen Ray gives us a bit of his "goodness" Retromedia in the form of this soft-core Cinemax non-classical. A pair of numb-nuts look at the stones when a "black hole", through the swirling vortex, is placed over the swirling vortex. Soon, an attractive time cave of a million years ago will become a timeline and she will set out for the future. Soon, her second half was studying her way to the future anyway and swimming her way through the beds in the future. Ray again brings a clear (but hardly) smut-fest that has terrible acting but some decent skin. Yeah, that's hardly titillating, but heh! If worse, insomnia cures you. <br /> <br /> S10 rating: 1/5 or 3/10
