With an interesting assumption (in the conflicts between Europeans and indigenous peoples sometimes the battle lines were not so clear), it was supposed to be a good movie. However, the story is captured by a director superior to his own cleverness with a very bad scenario. Yes, the natural environment is beautiful and yes, the film is authentic to the historical setting of the 19th century. The film director, however, breaks up the lily over and over again and adds a layer to the top of the musical accompaniment, not to mention the totally unnecessary voice accompaniment of the soundtrack, which eventually overwhelmed the viewer and, by pointing out for yourself, take the story. For me it was clear that the director, with his microscopic footage and the endless repetition of the musical theme "Danny Boy" (of all things!), tried to make the New Zealand version of the epic series Sergio Leone, something that was fine once in the West. But given the seriousness of the story (most of the Leonian westerns were a linguistic face), not to mention the fact that it wasn't 1968, he could make a parody of one. Too bad.
