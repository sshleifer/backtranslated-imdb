After his father's widower dies in a traffic accident, young Tom Burlinson (like Jim Craig) is left to drive his Australian Snowy River farm, and only Kirk Douglas, a curious prospect (like Spur), has helped him. Times are tough, so Mr. Burlinson goes to work for rich Mr. Douglas, the rancher's silver brother, Mr. Harrison (also played by Kirk Douglas). When big work comes, silvery hair (older?) Douglas feels Burlinson is too young and inexperienced to go on; thus, Burlinson remains behind, and falls in love with the boss's daughter, Sigrid Thornton (as Jessica Harrison). The least satisfying aspect of director George Miller "The Man from the Snowy River" is a weak storyline. For example, follow the sequence of events "Jessica is lost". The lady gets lost in one of those "crazy" storms when she runs away. Her worried father rounds up the drunken men's possessions to find her after predicting bad weather. Damsel "Jessica" rolls to the edge of a comfortably emerging cliff. Father and suddenly sober men don't control Burlinson's farm. Burlinson Hero Unveils Miss. After building a fire, he decides to kiss her. "Romance" is played too innocently for both an obvious attractive man and a woman like Burlinson and Mrs. Thornton. To make matters worse, the Douglas brothers have a "dark history" that is revealed before a mystery is created. The main attraction is the Australian scenery.
