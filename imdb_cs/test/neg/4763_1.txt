The film starts promising, using images and simple short clips to tell a bigger story that would normally need a significantly higher budget than the one here. However it started to worry me as it went on, combined with another too husky Max Payne type of voice over the movie began to look not so good. I was hoping it was just an introduction to the story. The story is what really caught me and took me to this movie. An interesting scientific idea was that the research scientist had created a virus that actually protects the cells he infects from another infection. Then that the subjects that had the most bizarre disturbance looking for a scientist and offered to be his human experiments, I think it might be one very good little movie. However, the performance was not good. The pace seemed to change as the film turned to recorded interviews with the four main characters in the film, the subjects tested. Although acting was not excellent, there seemed to be many possibilities for character development in the film, and the recordings were done quite well with a varied mix of characters. But these films disappeared in the film. After a few short clips they did not re-use and I felt that there was a missed opportunity to provide some great character development by bouncing back to them, but it shouldn't have been. <br /> <br /> Images are increasingly disconnected from the story, often repeated to represent something that is still happening. This disconnection and repetition is reflected in the unpleasant and disturbing comments. He starts to recite words one by one. Short, meaningless sentences and reciting too relevant or interesting scientific ramblings. If something were to be described, four or five words would be used, it was too long, repetitive, circular, repetitive, ... you get an idea. Now it could be to reflect the confusion and character, slowly catching in his own thoughts, sharply due to lack of food and water. What it really was was that I completely turned off my voice and in the final stages of the movie I found out I wasn't listening to some ramblings. Several times that the event occurs, the camera displays all the characters one by one for their response, which seems to be somewhere between confused and thoughtful. The escape from the same scene is repeated to the same scene, for example, the character that sleeps is lost to black. Look, we know the character is asleep, we know the time has passed, please. Overall, there are just too many atmospheric cuts and long, hanging shots to fill the time. Acting was not bad and the characters were fine, but they were not exploited and developed. There were really real moments when they were interacting. For example, when one of them asks if he's hungry, the camera looks at each of them and returns to the group snapshot, pauses, looks at each other, turns back to the camera, and says "No" slowly. She picked up a giggle or two. Their dialogue was slow, shiny, and either it was missing altogether, or totally unnecessary, there seemed to be no middle space where dialogue would appear on the ground. However, there were some good scenes but they were really hard to find if you saw them in isolation and that's what it looks like to happen with this movie. The film was viewed as a series of scenes and not as a complete story. Nowhere is it more visible than in the main story. The characters are infected with the virus that killed the animals, the one that was created for them. We said that it is gradually developing into something dramatic, and that is what we expect. What we get is that the characters eat together the burden, they all throw together, the water flows from their mouths into unconvincing currents, then they all fall asleep, these are the stages that really happen in the film really. Then they all say "Okay" when they ask how they are and that's it. That's the virus, nothing else will happen. <br /> <br /> There could be a lot more work with this movie, much more developed with the virus and protecting it from all kinds of damage. It could have explored a serious change in these characters because they had infected and taken over them, could develop these characters, show them that they were making decisions and doing things that connect with their character displayed in the flashbacks to talk. <br /> <The end is not confusing, interesting or provocative. It just shows something that happens, and that is, though in a long, stretched style with an irritating voice over it. I really struggled with this film and watched as many of the Press members came out (including one famous television critic who walks away in the first twenty minutes), but I regretted the lost time.
