"Ordinary Decent Crime" is sad because it obviously tries to succeed, and apparently does not have a chance in hell to make it apparently due to the absence of a clear sense of purpose. A abysmal failure in a droll Irish comedy with Spacey as a thief who likes to outwit the cops and his competition becoming a folk hero in his own mind, this film manages to be slightly amusing when it tries to be humorous, somewhat more than boring when Be interesting and forget about sentimental or insulting or loving, though it shots on these qualities as well. "Ordinary Decent Crime" has a clumsy script, naive direction, a pilgrim's execution, a slim story, bad casting, mediocre acting, and eventually becomes lost in itself and sinks into the mud of hopeless mediocrity. Pass this. (D)
