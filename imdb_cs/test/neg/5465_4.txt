The Book of Revelation begins very well. Daniel, an Egyptian dancer, is kidnapped, abused and sexually raped by three masked women. Then nothing else happens. There is some hint of rediscovery but the film gives neither explanation nor real ending. Daniel's reaction to abuse is very basic. She ends up dancing, has sex with every woman around, and finally begins a relationship with a very simple and ordinary woman. I've seen a good proportion of art-house movies, but there's something missing. br /> <br /> The main wires are fine; but some characters are not fully defined.
