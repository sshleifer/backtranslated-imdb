After opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint splattered on it, oh OK I'll be generous and say it starfield, we are witnessing a alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on the ground. The creepy-looking model of a spacecraft will land on a terrible model. Three close campers are investigating. From the burning spacecraft, the reptile, as if it looked like an alien, discovered 'Nightbeast', OK, so I lied that it was a guy in a mask with a rubber monster and a silver suit. Campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast laser gun that shoots horrible special effects on humans. She is informed by Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith). She warns her deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and collects men together to investigate. Meanwhile, Nightbeast killed an unfortunate motorist who stopped at the side of the road to escape. His two annoying children run for help. They approach the house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says "some running towards the house". The guy gets up to look and was attacked and gutted by Nightbeast, just as he kills the girl. Then he manages to kill two children with his laser, perhaps a nightmare is not so bad. Once the sheriff and his men arrive on the scene, they have a weapon / laser battle with Nightbeast. After perhaps the most exclusive fight in film history, only the sheriff, his deputy and local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) will survive. But Nightbeast is still alive, the bullets seem to have no effect on it. The next day the sheriff visits the mayor of the city, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) get permission to evacuate everyone in the city. He refuses to say that the party he holds for Governor (Richard Ruxton) cannot be canceled and that he does not want to create a panic situation. Yet the Sheriff evacuates the city. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they manage to scare the Nightbeast and survive. Together with his sheriff's deputy and Jamie, they decide to stay and fight the aliens. Written and directed by Don Dohler it must be an amateur movie, made with family and friends, check out credits and see how much Dohler is involved. For this reason, I should probably shorten it, but it will not stop it, nor does it apologize for the very horrible film in every department. Does it have no story or purpose; things just waste their time, what does Drago (Don Leifert) strangle his ex-girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many other scenes don't add anything to the movie. Even the script has no logic, why is Nightbeast supposedly evacuating around the city? The special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect that Nightbeast shoots someone with their laser, a computer effect that the 80th spectrum will be ashamed of. There is not much blood in it, nor does it contain blood, torn open stomach, separate shoulder and decapitation, but they all seem predictably wrong. Credits where it should be, a nightmare looks largely good. There is a sex scene between the sheriff and his deputy who must be seen to be believed to have music that even porn would be embarrassed and two really nasty naked people make it hard to watch. Less than stellar gaming, photography, music, lighting, and editing make it a real job. And what's worse about the movie? It commits a deadly sin that is boring and not entertaining in the least. I'm sorry, Don buddy, but don't give up your work! Definitely avoid it.
