I like underground movies when they have something to say or show. I tried as "Trash". I tried to see some artistic success or some interesting representation of life in New York in the early 1970s. Or was it fun at least? But the film stinks and cannot be called neither art nor entertainment. "Trash" is basically an excuse for uncovering Joe Dallesandra's naked body for 2 hours while he meets other uninteresting, unpleasant characters (I agree, that's a wonderful body, but no excuse for film about it?). Holly Woodlawn, like Joe's girlfriend, at the end of some good laughs, but then it's too late to save those useless hours. Lou Reed's classic "Walk on the Wild Side" is a better view of those people and that time, even if it's fascinating than they really were. 1.5 / 10.
