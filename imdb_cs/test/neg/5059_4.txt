Mr. I'm Shocked by the Number of Positive Views on Gamble Gamble on IMDb. Because for me ... well, it was extremely disappointing for me. I enjoy Mr. Moto and I love Charlie Chan, but I can't say I cared about this mish-mash of both. For those who are unfamiliar with the story of Mr. Moto's Gamble, he was originally intended as a film by Charlie Chan. But when Warner Oland retreated, some scenes and events were rewritten for Peter Lorre and Mr. Moto. As I suggested, the final result left me overwhelmed. Mr. Moto is not Chan. It is more mysterious, more athletic and more exotic. So trying to put Moto in Chan's movie is like trying to fit a square pin into a round hole - it doesn't work. And listening to Lorre / Moto tries to deliver one of Chan's euphemisms, which ends up being silly. Add to this the fact that almost 10 minutes of a short 72-minute run consists of boxing scenes (something I never think) and you end up with a movie I couldn't help but dislike. If I have to say something positive, I point to Key Luke's performance. But even he is not close enough to save Gamble in my eyes. Sorry, 4/10 is the best I can give to this.
