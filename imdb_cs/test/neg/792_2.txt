I thought I was going to check this movie, as I am currently making a film about a mysterious box, so it would be great to see how this film took and developed the idea of ​​a mysterious and unexpected boxing. Before I went to the movies, I had the high expectations of this movie. with actresses like Cameron diaz, you expect acting, especially her, to be great. acting was a kind of wasteland for the film, the accent signs changed during the movie, so it was incredible. the whole idea of ​​a strange boxing that can make your dreams come true, but to destroy others is such a brilliant story, but I feel the director left it, this film had the potential that it could be much better than that it was. This film had no center. it was too confusing and required a stable storyline. No one wants to go to the cinema and come out of thinking what I've just watched I didn't get it, sometimes it can be exciting and people want to watch it again, but this movie made people never want to hear the movie again. During the observation I noticed that half of the audience left before the end. I feel that every person has been released to watch this movie for high expectations and how slow the film was. <br /> <br /> allows you to place bad points on one side ... I like the scene where the son is in the bathroom at the end. it was unexpected, it reminded me of the horror, and the way he was put together presented me and how devastating and frightening it would be to be in that position. The light and its effects looked great, the scene looked a bit more than the 1990s before the film seems to be. This movie was confusing because there were so many different pieces on it. The parts you would expect to be summed up at the end, where everything will be clear, but not, was totally at odds with the audience's expectations, even though he left the film on a cliff hanger without giving viewers a reason why things could happen . work really well, but this not, it was creative, another unusual movie that I thought had the potential could be better, disappointed that he didn't enjoy it, wouldn't buy it on DVD to be honest.
