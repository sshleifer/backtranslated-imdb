I can't believe how stupid this movie is. The storyline (written by the mother of Keira Knightley) is what the film destroys to the extreme. it is straight dull, absurd and doesn't make any sense at all ... this movie has lagged so bad for most of them, especially at the beginning. the story keeps going on about their daily flirting, often it seems to be a trio. In this movie, you have annoying deadbeat couple (poet and his wife) who are complete total drunk from the start. the wife sleeps with the other men to meet them while the poet is a pervert who thrives on cheap boos and women. A wife who waaayyyyyy too quickly becomes friends with her former childhood lover (played by Keira) suddenly becomes jealous because they know well that they are both lovers because they were children. something doesn't seem here ... i mean, come on ... come with the lady program! what you expected. the bottom line is: ex-lovers are reuniting with a new woman who hugs her, then becomes jealous, then the ex-lover married and her husband jealous, bombs a crazy drunk couple at home, crazy husband calls the police and they end up going to court for a man's attempted murder. this is summarized in a nutshell ... <br /> <br /> this movie had moments like quality and good playing cillian murphy but other than that, i can't believe i watched it ... i complained about it during the movie and some family members watched with me asleep. I decided to give him a chance and I should have kept my first instincts.
