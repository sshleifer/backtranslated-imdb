So I was wondering when I was watching this movie so that the producers of this movie would save money on Sandra Bullock's wardrobe by pulling clothes "out" from Miss Congeniality? Did Mrs. Bullock also get into roles through the role of "before" Gracie Hart? As many reviewers have noted, the film is very formal. Add to this deja vu viewer experience with the character of Cassie Maywether as a somewhat darker Gracie Hart with a more back story and it quickly became a snooze fest. Two bad boy serial killers were made before (and better) in other movies. As he has "a good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite proof" the character was seen earlier. In fact, none of the characters in the film ever got beyond two dimensions, nor was it trying to be anything but rubbing stereotypes. <br /> <br /> One last peeve - using the term serial killer is a fake ad. Killing one person - even if it is a predetermined murder - doesn't make you a serial killer of you. You may have the potential to become a serial killer, but you are not a serial killer or even a killer spree.
