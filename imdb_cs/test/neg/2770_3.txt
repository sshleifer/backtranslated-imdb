My question is, what was the worst element of this movie? Was it acting? directing? script?. Maybe it was Alan Ladd and Jack LaRue. LaRue and especially Ladd are able to bring extreme sin into the role. In this movie it was hard to tell who was the bad guy. It is true that Ladd played a secret good guy, but even in his good roles he could be very cool. Thus, the net result was a potentially good film without any conflict.
