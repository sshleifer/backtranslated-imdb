Like me, I respect firefighters for what they do. I was tired and bored with this film. Acting was fine, but Joaquin Phoenix was a bad choice, which he said at least. What worried me most about this movie was Celtic music that turns on and off at the worst possible time. film. Direction and continuity was also pretty bad! <br /> <br /> ** SPOILER ** For example, when a Phoenix character falls into several stories and is severely injured, he can barely move to talk to his captain on the radio. Then miraculously, he manages to crawl through a huge space covered with rubble and fire to punch a man-sized hole in a double-walled brick wall, using only a few stop-bars? And top it all off then it gets ultra weak and busted-up again. Someone also noticed that throughout the movie, whenever you see Joaquin shots fighting against fires and rescuing people, there is little or no smoke in the buildings. I think the smoke should be strong enough in the flame of a flooded building. I'm also tired of hearing that the search and rescue team is screaming "I need some equipment here !!!". I really thought I'd enjoy this movie, but I found it a weak attempt to represent the real life of a firefighter. The intention was there, but honestly I think this movie could have been much better. I couldn't help but think the producer was trying to keep up with this movie and had to dive into theaters. More time should be devoted to adjustments and to ensure good film flow. Special effects were impressive in some scenes, but in others they were disappointing and almost ridiculous. Something like Jerry Bruckheimer's movie. <br /> <br /> Call me critically, but I can't see what's so great about this movie. At least it wasn't as bad as "The Whole Ten Yards", which is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in recent months. <br /> <br /> I really hope there's no creation in 50!
