The couple moved to their dream home without knowing that it was with their neighbors built on a previously used cemetery. The film is said to be based on a true story, though as much of it is to be true is not revealed. The story is hardly unique - see Spielberg's "Poltergeist" (1982). Within a short period of time, they will experience various supernatural phenomena: from disturbing - mysterious shadows, serious daughter illnesses - to sincerely absurd - toilets that are constantly purged, and garage doors that are out of control. The story is low: once it is found that the land has been used as a cemetery, we will learn nothing more. Looks like the land is not developing. The characters are not particularly well drawn, nor in any way unforgettable, nor is the atmosphere special. The film might be disturbing for some viewers. There is no feeling of catharsis or any positive message from it.
