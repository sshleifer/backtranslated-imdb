My first impression when I read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it would be very, very different from the book. The movie trailer said the film should take place when Vivian is 19 years after her parents were killed in a fire in America. He meets Aiden, an aspiring graphic designer. During the day he has to work in a chocolate shop and must agree that he will never be normal because every full moon becomes a loup-garou - a mythical being who can be closely compared to a werewolf. Most minor changes didn't sound too bad to me, even though I'm a fan of Annette Curtis Klaus. I knew it would be different, but I wanted to see it to support this book, I thought that changing the age, changing settings, and a few minor changes to the job wouldn't affect the story as a whole that would make me tear my eyes out of their drawers and letting myself bleed on the ground of the cinema. The movie unnecessarily killed many important characters, one was Esme, Vivan's mother, right on the bat in the fire, who was supposed to have killed her father. I pushed it aside and went out into the film, tired and a little angry. Running through Romania, camera angles were decent, the scenery was beautiful and the music was ... interesting ... but it left me with the impression: "Why does Vivian look like this and why is she wearing a sweatshirt? "Jump into later parts of the film, I must say that I am surprised that the writers seem to have supported incest in the way and rather than sticking to the sign relationship from Vivian to Raf, the leader of The Five became her aunt Astrid, who was bitter and hated in the novel rival Vivan's mother, and I can add that none of them apply to any of them. <br /> <br /> Up From the disruption of character, Gabriel somehow became the leader of the parcel and obsessed with Vivian, who was his friend to fulfill Some non-existent prophecies Not only did his physical appearance take the complete 180 of the book's description, he was probably also Rafe's father, yes, that's right, it's a nice little incestuous wolf-node knot that's okay. <br /> <br The little things that annoyed me were scenes like forest hunting, a red head protruding from the rest of the crowd that "kissed its enemy" before their prey was released to allow Why was she there? Why did she look like Astrid? I think my mind is not big enough to understand why such a character must have existed in the film without any explanation why it existed other than kissing a nice victim. I loved how Amoeba was totally cut out of the movie. I loved how legally intertwined Aiden's past was, what between the supposedly dramatic scene where he told Vivian about how his father wanted him to learn self-defense, and then defeated his father in "self-defense" to make him seem like that as a tragic character. The 180s character is a lot of fun when it's totally useless. At the end of the movie, I felt like a person had crossed the novel, scribbled half the names of names, drawn a pair of links back and forth, mentioned that Gabriel was a little jerk, Vivian fell in love with Aiden, he was afraid to find out that he is a loup-garou of legend, and "someone" is "killed by a silver bullet" and there is some happy ending, because Vivian finally feels accepted by someone who loves her for who she is. I gave this movie 2/10 because the camera shots were fairly decent, and casting could be worse, but as far as directing goes, why loup-garous jump in the air as if they wanted fly (with arched back and hobby to jump from high places), glitter briefly and then fall to the ground like wolves? The only aspects of this film that even watched me into a very filthy, excused ending were wolves, beautiful scenery, and boys with eye candy. All together, I must say that in order to enjoy this movie at all, one must be prepared for misconceptions, strange events that are not always explained, incestuous innuendo, and either do not like books or read book.
