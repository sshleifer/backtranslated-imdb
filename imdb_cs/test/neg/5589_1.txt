I'm sorry, but I have to say that the movie was the worst I've ever seen. I thought it would be a good 8mm film. WHAT TO BUY !!! There was nothing interesting about it except the beautiful Hungarian women. Everything can be known in advance. It's a miracle. I don't understand how you could leave it!
