Boy Oh Boy, this movie stinks. This film is one of the worst pieces I've ever seen in my whole life. Please, even if your life is addicted to it, DO NOT USE, and I repeat: DO NOT under any circumstances this terrible piece of waste. Watch this thing only when it appears as an MST 3000 episode. That was the only way I could sit the whole thing. If I had to watch it without the show, I'd stop watching it before it was over. Has one use: Cure for Insomniacs !!!!!
