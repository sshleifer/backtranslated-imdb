Now I understand that it took two months. Really? I'm pretty sure my crew would do it in less than a week. This movie was so bad that I couldn't even pay much attention. Just another proof that breast-bearing women can't always save themselves from horrible writing, acting and driving. Now I understand that this was no budget effort, but there is no continuity and no real reason why they should not turn it off and watch infomercials or foreign messages in a language you don't understand. There are a few decent looking females showing the goods. Still, there are not enough sexy women to watch this film industry wander. One of the longest 80 minutes of my life. But with the help of his old friend Jim Beam, I pulled him out. Do yourself a favor and get your gun ready cuz you want to use it after this hack job. Finally, the individual (moron) who left a comment before my thought it was a great movie and LOVED it. Just another proof that siblings shouldn't pro-create. Ow, BURN !!! - Captain J
