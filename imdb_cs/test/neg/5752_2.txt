I've been looking forward to this release for many months. The previews looked good, the early news on the net were encouraging, and the golden eye and Timesplitters were excellent shooters (the same people). It turns out that I was very deceived! Haze had the potential to be there with Call of Duty 4 and other shooters of the next gene, however it looks, plays and feels like something from 5 years or so earlier. I played Haze on 1080 TV and I was initially disappointed that game developers limited the graphics to 720. The Universe Haze lacks detail and atmosphere, the feeling "must really dive to finish" is always there. > <br /> Control is slow and cumbersome and I haven't found the x / y axis sensitivity setting yet. There are many parts of the single player game that are very dark (visually) to the point where you can't really see where you're going. Why not add a torch function like in Halo? or even better night vision? Using the drug to increase the performance of "nectar" is interesting, but just as you get used to it, you switch sides and don't use it again! why bother? I could go on with many more glitches, but instead I say no! wait for killzone 2 or play call 4 and try to unlock gold AK!
