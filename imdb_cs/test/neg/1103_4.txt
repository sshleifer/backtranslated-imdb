Child death and horror movies will always remain a sensitive and controversial combination, and so my personal opinion is that every film that shows the courage to turn to this subject should receive special attention from horror fans. Of course, as with "Wicked Little Things", controversial topics do not always guarantee a good movie. Despite the potentially interesting plot, atmospheric environment and involvement of director J.S. Cardone ("The Slayer") is an uninspired and cliché-ridden film that could not offer a single fear or shock. After losing her husband and father, the remaining women of Tunny (mother Karen and her daughters Sarah and Emma) move to the small and remote mountain town of Pennsylvania, where they inherited an old, shabby castle. Their new home is dangerously close to old ruins, where dozens of innocent children lost their lives in 1913. The locals seem to keep secrets from Karen and her daughters. It quickly turns out that undead children are still leaving their mine graves at night to seek revenge on the descendants of Mr. Carlton's mine owner who was responsible for their deaths. "Wicked Little Things" is rather tame and extremely predictable. The scenario shamefully serves one terrible cliché after another, such as car wheels stuck in mud at critical times, broken batteries and terribly broken dolls. There is very little tension, even less gore, and makeup effects are unsatisfactorily weak. Zombified children don't look terrible at all. In fact, they look like miniature versions of Marilyn Manson, with black clothes, pale faces, and dark eyes. The excitement finale is stupid and just as derivative as the rest of this pointless production. Lori Heuring is in her lead role as a thoroughly unimpressive mother, but Scout Taylor-Compton (currently a big star thanks to the "Halloween" remake) and young Chloe Moretz are adequate as daughters.
