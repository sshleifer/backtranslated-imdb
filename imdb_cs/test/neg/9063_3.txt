I was seriously disappointed in this film as a serious marathon. His target group is clearly those who never run a marathon or start marathons. Following the stories of the first two marathon runners, one senior, one injured runner and two elites who are preparing for the Chicago Marathon, the film devotes most of its attention to a beginning woman whose story is for lack of a better word. , boring. Although I enjoyed a brief look at Deena Kastor's training, a brief history of the Boston Marathon and the marathon in general, let me emphasize: It was short !! Watching some Joe Runners are preparing for a Saturday run with their water bottles and chatting about how they see the marathon is not inspiring, and the nonstop clich√©s about the success and feel of a good smile runners want you to make the movie shorter. If you are a marathoner for the first time, this movie may give you the feeling "I can do it." Run away for no one else.
