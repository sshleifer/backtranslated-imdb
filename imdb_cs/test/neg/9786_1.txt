Nine of the nine people who watched it declared themselves psychically scarred for life. No one should ever see this abomination. The English language is poorly equipped to express how awful this "movie" is. It's really not worth the plastic that is made. The human race in all history of creation was not committed by any major crime; it is never likely to be worse. It was unanimously agreed that the scene on which Tommy's head is fed and the young girl's blouse is incredibly ill and twisted; In fact, many of us have not yet recovered from suffering and are currently sitting in the corner of a room swinging, sucking our thumbs and whining. But the basic question on each person's lips must be "Why ???". How is it possible for someone to create such a monster and then submit it to so many innocent people? After seeing the trailer we thought this movie could be laughing: how bad we were. Please, please sign a petition to rid the world of "Shrunken Heads" so that no one else is exposed to it. . Please for the sake of humanity.
