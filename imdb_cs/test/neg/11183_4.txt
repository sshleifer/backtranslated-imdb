Fred Astaire is one year after his big hit for Columbia, "You'll Never Rich". That was the movie that Hayworth put on a Hollywood map, but her performance in this romantic romantic musical barely gives a suggestion why she was so popular. Down Buenos Aires, the tyrannical owner of the hotel demands that his four daughters get married by age; One can think the film takes place in the 18th century, but no, it is modern-1942. Astaire is an ex-hoofer-turned-gambler who goes back to dance to earn some money, mixing in impersonating a letter-letter admirer. the beauty of Hayworth's Stone Cold. Fred looks at Rita with a fraternal smile, but she is so similar to a mannequin (lip-synthesizing her songs like a wide-eyed doll) that all the romantic sparks burst. They dance together quite comfortably, however, and Jerome Kern's score is unmistakable, but not too bad. ** of ****
