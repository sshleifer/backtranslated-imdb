This movie is all but the true story of Phoolan Devi. Shekhar Kapoor's claims are being questioned by filming the entire film without meeting Phoolan Devi, whose life should be based on this film! An excuse that meeting a woman would disrupt the director's conception of the story! The film wastes the possibility of sensitizing society from the difficult women's caste in Indian society and ends up as a stereotype depicting Phoolan Devi as an angry woman whose only motivation is revenge. No wonder this movie, Shekhar Kapoor, was successful in the West because of their non-Bollywood taste!
