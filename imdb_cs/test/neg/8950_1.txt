This series is formal and boring. The episodes are the same every week, simply with slightly different settings. Any purely evil character makes any dastardly deed, Walker goes after him, and it ends in a Karate match. Demons are super-cliché super-stereotypical evil villains, good guys are all clean, sincere and saints, and story lines are simplistic and unreal. After about 2 episodes, the show becomes completely unatchable by all but the least demanding fans. It's certainly not the best Norris work. His next job may be a cliché, but he usually doesn't spend weeks. If you like wording, boring, repetitive clichés, then it's for you.
