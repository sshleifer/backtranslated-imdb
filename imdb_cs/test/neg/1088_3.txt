An American tourist on a trip to Asia suffering from a recent death decides to break the law: 1 Ignoring the curfew; 2 Connection with the Revolutionary Army; 3 Ownership and use of illegal weapons ..... etc. What is to be a political and educational statement about the so-called atrocities of the military dictatorship in Asia will end up as a "guide" for disillusioned Americans. .. especially those who want to protest that the water in the hotel is not working .... Unfortunately, the authors of this silly yarn have no idea about Asia ... nor does it seem to be in the writing of a reasonable dialogue ... an example: .. your human rights heroine desperately looking for drugs at the furthest distances of the Asian jungle miles from anywhere, she hit the peasant and asks, "Excuse me - does this city have a pharmacy?" The script really ... Believe me, I was recently in the Thai jungle and the American asked me .... "Excuse me ... do you know where MacDonalds is?" "This film is supposed to be a serious drama, but ends up as a parody and burst of all those" killing fields "films that have to confirm the Asian stereotype that holds many Western" civilizations "and re-inforced from Hollywood Fantasies like this. The basic message of this image is: "We Americans ... coming from worlds only true democracy has the divine right to go to all other nations ... and give them the truth ..." ... to unscrew their environment .... and teach them about freedom ..... "(see eg Beach ...... at least Leo did it with a little bigger style) .... Of course Vietnam is another story .... And ..... educated Asians they may ask why Yankie Gungh-Ho's position on Asia should come from a nation whose main asset to mankind was to help spread cancer ... AIDS .. Gun carrying kiddies and Jerry Springer ...... et al .. At the end In this picture, a cynical viewer can cheer the Burmese army ... 3 out of 1 0. <br /> <br />
