This film is the same as the cannibal holocaust. If it wasn't for useless killing of animals in the name of "shock" ("Ooh looks at us, we're hard, we've added real death to our movies"), these movies would get on my dusty shelf classics - I'm a huge fan of cannibal movies and zombies . But as it stands, this is another example of the shock of horror that clung to the last straw of the pile in a desperate attempt to make the poor movie more humorous. To sum up, the crunching gore flick with limited appeal. A 70-year-old fan should try it, but anyone with modern ethics and tastes should choose something that would be better for their popcorn-fest.
