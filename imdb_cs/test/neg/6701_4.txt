Last night I attended a Badland screening with my cousin. We were a little excited when we got there that the director / writer, producer (his wife) and several casts took part, and that there would be discussions and questions after the film. But as soon as the movie was over and the credits started to roll (and the movie wasn't really well modified and too long), my cousin and I, without consultation, immediately stood up and left. We found out, once we started talking outside, that we both felt so angry that we didn't want to stay in the discussion, we couldn't even look at the cast and crew who stood near the exit and who we were. the truth as we left. I found out that the roots of my anger were set during a scene in which Jerry cut the palm of his daughter Celina with a big knife, so her blood could be used to leave. false path. It was necessary in my mind to associate with the physical pain he had caused on his body by the emotional pain he had caused to his spirit by murdering his mother and two brothers in her presence, saving her and taking with him when he had fled. I used to cut my palm (randomly); Even a superficial cut is incredibly painful because the palm is so sensitive and very slow to heal if you do not hold it still because you are still opening it and trying to live. But after a very short period of time, when only a narrow ribbon of fabric and one scene with a large aid were touching the palm of her hand, it seemed as if she had never cut it. My anger has reached its peak - I will not make you this moment - in the final stage of Celina. I was angry because Celina is by far the most likeable character of the movie it's good); I was ?? and you can't tell me that a good screenwriter doesn't know it's immersed in a sense of physical and emotional pain; and the screenwriter, when she treated the cellin emotional pain so cavalier and with such disrespect, she also treated me, the viewer member, the cavalry, and total disrespect. some dialogue that tells us he's hurting somewhere. But at this time, the audience felt so manipulated that we turned off. Handling begins very early in this film when Jerry's family dialogue explains to the audience that Jerry has psychiatric problems. Rule One, Screenwriters: Give Your Audience Some Credit. Let them make a good piece of creative work on their own. Tell the story; do not explain to us what we should think and feel. We don't like it. My cousin also knew he had problems with the movie soon, dialogue-wise when Jerry and his wife had little to say to themselves except f *** this, f *** it, f * ** you. Some couples really find themselves in relationships so bad that f-bombs end up like any other word in the mouth. But it's like watching comedians who curse a lot. Some of them are really funny; the curse is secondary. But some of them are replacing the curse for humor, and this screenwriter is not Chris Rock to be a metaphor for her conclusion. This man and wife courageously decided to deal with a terribly complicated story with a terribly complex story. characters. However, they do not seem to realize that the meaning of the story, especially the complexity, will vary for every member of the audience. Successful narration requires paying attention to important factual details, desperate to interpret the meaning of the story for the entire audience. For five years I worked with Vietnamese veterans, I heard more stories than most, and I always enjoy seeing movies that bring their stories to a wider audience. At all levels, it is important that we hear them. But I am less than excited that this narrator decided that the film had started what Jerry's story meant and continued to explain it to us with a very heavy hand. Next time pay more attention to details.
