Some movies are not for everyone. This is precisely what Igmar Bergaman Skammen (Shame) describes. At only 18, I still have what I think you could call a smaller form of ADD and well, I watch movies to have fun. Shame was a film with a very interesting assumption, trying to convey the effect of war on ordinary people, but I could not achieve it. I don't know if it was headlines, black and white, length of film, or the fact that it took two hours of my studio for a huge chemical test, but I didn't like it. I understand that he is considered a great film and very important in the history of cinematography, but I think how my teacher emphasized that not everyone likes or likes it. I think I just want her to finish all her side plots. Maybe the translation lost something, but I felt there were endless little shoots that never met any conclusion. You meet characters and you'll never see them again, or you really understand why they were included in the movie. My overall recommendation for this movie is that it's worth seeing, but just creating your own opinion on it. Whether you like it or not, you need to respect the point you are trying to convey.
