While writing was horrible, the deal was terrible, the only thing that saved this "peat bog" was breast counting, but that wasn't enough to watch it again. They all said and I was actually stupid about watching this movie. It was a new minimum for Tromo. Lloyd Kaufman started the film wearing a garbage bag and making ass sounds should make me realize what I got into. This was by far the worst that the Troma team ever gave. The best place to show this movie would be for the disabled to feel they can't get up to change the channel. In conclusion, it's not a quick recommendation to watch this movie just for breasts.
