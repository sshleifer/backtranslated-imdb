John Travolta reprises his role as Chili Palmer, a Hollywood gangster who now turns his eye on music business. Using her "negotiating skills", she attempts to run an independent recording company with the wife of a murdered friend, played by Uma Thurman, and tries to get her young singer (Christina Milian) to a hit record. Before I saw this sequel, I heard it was a horrible movie. However, Be Cool is still a nice comedy, though it's not as good as the original. The film focuses on the music industry this time instead of the film industry. The music business is very poor in the film and uses a lot of lame stereotypes. I can't tell if it was the intention or not because Get Shorty did a nice job of spoofing the film industry. The same cannot be said for continuation and attempts just lazy. The impressive cast is what saves the film from sinking. The best performance is given by The Rock and it is nice to see it in another type of role. Vince Vaughn also gives a funny performance, though he began to bother before the end. Surprisingly, Uma Thurman gives average performance and I expected more from her. John Travolta returns as Chili and does a good job. But his performance is a bit boring. Christina Milian is making a terrible performance and he's not such a good singer. The Cedric Entertainer gives good performance, even if it's not too long in the movie. There are also bunch of portraits, including Steven Tyler and James Wood. F. Gary Gray manages and does a bad job. The movie just can't handle it and the movie is kind of a mess. There was also a ton of product placement and it bothered after a while. Also for 118 minutes the movie is too long and there are plenty of slow spots. The film had to be poorly edited and clearly it wasn't. Fortunately for the movie, the actors are able to rise above the weak direction and script and provide some funny scenes. Sometimes the film tried too hard, sometimes it was quite funny. Compared to the original, the sequel does not measure well. However, Be Cool is a relatively harmless and forgotten comedy. Finally, Be Cool is worth hiring and it is. Rating 6/10
