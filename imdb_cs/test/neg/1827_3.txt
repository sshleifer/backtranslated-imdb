This is a pretty lousy picture.It offers nothing unique or original or even interesting. A medical student discovers that a secret society at her university is dealing with macarous medical experiments. solving strange deaths at school.This film began promising with some cool special effects in which one is partially dissected while alive and trying to get away after they wake up, but then even sparkling and the rest of the special effects are quite routine plastic models The human body and that unreal looking blood that these second rate horror movies always seem to have. And as if routine conspiracy and lousy acting were not enough this movie had subtitles that many times disagreed with dubbed English that you hear talking about, and then add that to move in the mouth that doesn't match dubbing. Let's say we're trying to coordinate everything in your head that's not worth the average movie. I was at least counted into some skin in this movie and this movie did not even release it except for a little during the opening credits. This is a boring routine running horror mill / gore movie --- short on horror and gore.Skip this movie if "Ernest goes to camp" is the only rental left.
