I'm surprised that so many comments on this movie are positive. After reading the book several times (and all the other historical novels of Mike Waltari), there is no way to say much good in this movie. If I forgot the origin of the story, I might consider it a reasonably good epic. Of course, to make such a big brick a big screen, it's a task that doesn't stop us from envy, but it could be with the class. I don't understand why it was necessary to shorten the name of Nefernefernefer to Nefer. I love Peter Ustinov, because Kaptah and Marlon Brando would probably make a better Sinuhe, but the overall attitude is too Hollywood to push through the book. Keep in mind that Mika Waltari left the film's premiere in the middle of the show. How much he liked it.
