This extremely low-budget monster is centered around a group of mining inspectors exploring an abandoned gold mine to see if it's reopening. They get trapped in the cave and find out that they are at the mercy of a strange, slimy creature who seemed to knock them down one by one. The word I thought when I watched this movie was desperate. The screenplay and acting is terrible, the effects of stop-motion monsters were inadvertently funny, and since most of the film takes place in underground lighting, the sets seemed convincingly like a logistic nightmare. However, for some reason, I believed that this film failed from lack of effort, but perhaps from lack of budget, experience, and / or lack of creative inspiration. The whole thing came out as if it were either a college project or the first movie made by amateurs, I have a certain amount of affection for movies like this, even if the brand is completely missing. I think what I say is that I gave him B for the effort and D- for the real results, not insultingly bad, as some low budget monster movies I've seen, but still not worth seeing if you don't have LOT free time on your hands . Hlasuji 4.
