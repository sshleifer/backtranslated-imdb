Me and my friend rented this movie that day. At first glance, it seemed like another teen movie, which was also what we were hoping to be simple horror and comedy fans. It seems the movie is designed to disappoint the viewer as much as possible. This will quickly accelerate to something that has great potential. Unfortunately, they never leave the ground. We looked at something that seemed to be 1 hour when I finally, half asleep, managed to say, "Dude, this movie is a shit" It was actually just 35 minutes ... Dude agreed. The problem is that the movie is not just funny. It was undoubtedly funny, but it failed. I couldn't make it that I was sad. It reminds me. I had the potential to be anything I wanted, and instead I ended up watching cheap horror / funny movies all the time. I'm sorry for the creators of this movie from the bottom of my heart. It's very sad. All this potential ... and nothing.
