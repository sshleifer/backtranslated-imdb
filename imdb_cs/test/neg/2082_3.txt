The Greek site for parts of the movie was very beautiful and the photos got all my voices and that's about the extent of my brag in this movie. I have found that all characters are narcissistic archetypes that are so often found in American culture and are shallow and uninteresting. Susan Sarandon and Gena Rowlands look easy, but I found their characters very narcissistic and unlikely for many other reasons. When Gena Rowlands sings at a party, I wondered how this woman might think of herself as a competent stage star. I was tempted to press the MUTE button until she finished singing. Molly Ringwald was alone, and the character of Raul Julie was so exuberant that he was downright scary. The movie was too long for me to love it, and I couldn't sit it again even when I had a gun.
