I just finished watching this movie, and for me .... it takes ages to end because it's so boring ..... and the storyline is very bad. <br /> <br /> now ... where should I start .... About .... the film is called "sinking of Japan" .... yeah yeah ... it shows that Japan is actually a sinking, but the action part is very bad. Compared to "day after tomorrow", I would rate him at least 8/10. "The Sinking of Japan" does not point too much to the catastrophe that actually takes place right in front of our eyes. there is not much excitement at all ... boring ... all I can say ... <br /> <br /> one more point ... I would recommend this movie to have a better title ... maybe something like "romance sinking" Japan "because this movie has a lot of conversations (a waste of time ... talk nonsense) & a love story is extremely boring and stretches too long ... honestly .. almost get frustrated. Overall ... this movie doesn't show enough details about disasters, eg many people run like hell to avoid death .. the story part of the story was extremely unaffected by enough for me. but hey ... there's one thing we should appreciate about this movie though. has good songs!
