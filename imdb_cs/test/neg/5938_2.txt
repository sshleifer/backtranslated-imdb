Perhaps being a government bureaucrat is not a charming way to live, but it is still a way to make a living. However, after watching this movie, one can come off to believe that every government bureaucrat is a lazy, bloated, cocky, paper pusher who lives exclusively to attend his next lunch break. Not quite a nice picture, but this is an image that viewers have to endure while watching what is nothing more than another boring, noisy, overclocking action movie. What the doctor ordered ... right? How many more of these movies has Hollywood? Thousand? Two thousand? The formula for producing these films is thus drawn into the dust, which should now be completely unrecognizable. The locations are changing, but the lands remain the same and with the same shallow development of characters and as shallow as the trained artists are asked to turn into pseudo-cartoon characters and act accordingly. This movie seemed to be constantly running. "When will the movie end?" I repeatedly thought of myself. Leonardo DiCaprio was absolutely incredible as a CIA operator, but what must be one of the great gaffs of miscasting, overweight Russell Crowe plays the CIA bureaucracy. Please note that in this film the operative is "slim and average" while his table jockey supervisor is fat. This is called stereotyping. What did the casting director think? Why is Jack Nicholson not an overweight official? Or Nicole Kidman plays a shop assistant in a department store? And the story was so fantastic that no literary license could afford it. Apparently a non-Arab American (Mr. DiCaprio) is trying to pass as an Arabic ... he speaks fluent Arabic ... inventing all kinds of hair brain programs that are doomed to failure ... trying to think and overcome real Arabs who are absolutely clueless to his ridiculous Arabic masquerade ... he tries to romance with a Palestinian woman while they are in the middle of a highly sensitive and complex spy mission ... etc. Now you got it. Next time try to build a real Arab in the role. Even the naive film viewer can't believe it. There should be a balance between the protagonist and the antagonist. In this film, the protagonist is so transparent and incompetent that he leaves the story in ruins. Another stop for this movie - DVD country and oblivion. And one more thing. Don't let this film discourage you from working for the government. Salary doesn't have to be big, but marginal benefits are excellent, a critical fact that this movie neglects.
