Ugh. Stephen Baldwin. I never noticed until I got a DVD at home and saw his name in credits. Double ugh. What's worse is NAME in this low budget, mindless, wandering, likes to shoot. Where did they find this guy who would write this waste? Driving a caterpillar in LA City Dump, hoping to get into a movie game? The whole plot is a ridiculous situation accumulated on a ridiculous assumption. Baldwin is as convincing as a poster boy for American Gothic, sans pitchfork. His entire play repertoire looks like he needs a potty and then he looks like he found it. So, there you have people: a bad script, a bad acting non-actor, a low budget setting and a hero who is just as convincing as a Girl Scout looking for a customer cookie as a hero action. It's too late to get the money back on a DVD, but you can save yourself - if you're not one of those who like to watch dogs laughing ... honestly, this is too boring to make it happen. funny.
