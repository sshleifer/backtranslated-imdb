Tom Stern and Jeremy Slate are rocking boys planning to kidnap the casino, ala "Ocean 11", and pin it on the angels of hell. Bad move. This film is surprisingly tame for the film with the inscriptions Angels of Hell and number 69 and representing the true hell angels. The Angels of Hell deserve a better film to focus on. Not this snoorefest. Fortunately, it's one of the DVDs that includes Joe Bob Briggs's commentary, so the pain of having to sit down is greatly reduced. If you follow it differently, let me recommend something. No! <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> DVD Accessories: Joe Bob Brigga; Conny Van Dyke's message to her fans (has more than one?); PHOTOGALLERY; Theatrical Trailer; and trailers for "Blood Shack", "Hell High", "Samurai Cop" and "The Hollywood Strangler"
