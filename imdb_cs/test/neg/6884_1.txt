I watched this movie (movie?) Randomly and I never stop watching it because it's so ridiculous every dog ​​can play this act and be better than actors (actors?) This bad remake of Fatal Attraction is not overhead, no gaming, just an unfortunate copy Adrian Lyne, if you have any doubts about suicide, watch this and you can choose ... for "yes" <br /> <br /> I can't imagine people who went to the cinema to see this waste; maybe someone who had an empty afternoon and chose the first movie theater to stay with some others for 2 hours to forget the problems, but it's hard to go home relaxed
