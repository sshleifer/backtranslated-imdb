I caught this movie a few years ago one night and was one of the most fun movies I've ever seen. However, because it is supposed to be an action movie, I can't give him more stars because humor was unintentional. Chuck Norris plays a truck driver coming home from the road to see his family, and in the first five minutes a conflict arises that leads Chuck to seek revenge for the rest of the film. Good thing too, 'cause the sub-par negotiations of all involved started to age very quickly. Actually, the judge was pretty good, but I can't really describe what makes him work, you have to check it yourself. And the custom van Chuck Norris drives is awfully classic!
