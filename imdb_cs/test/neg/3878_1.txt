That was a Hindu film. Hindi = Terrible. Reasons: Cheap Dialogues, Cheap Special Effects, Cheap Routing + Shooting 2 Hours Max Movie within 3 Hours. <br /> <br />% ^^^^^^ spoiler ... a little bit %%%%%%%% <br /> <br /> Specifically for this movie: 1. dialogues are not funny. they are cheesy and cheap. Although akshay tried his best acting, for which I admire him, comedy wasn't funny at all! I just laughed three times during this movie. The first half of the film was useless to the story of the second half. the other half was a real story / movie. the first half was a time break / building. 3. Characters are not properly developed. paresh rawal is clever in the first half, idiot in the 2nd half / rest of the movie. in fact, we do not make any feelings or care about akshay and govinda. their characters are nothing stupid. they do not seem to be having difficulty. Jokes are funny, but they are not funny in a very serious scene. Gang characters and drug smugglers are cheese and used in the last 20 films. there is nothing new about these characters. Again, it turns out they're stupid to be funny. however, stupid = humorous when stupid is the norm in the whole film. the only character that made sense was the dutch lara with a true story. 4. Special effects were crap. at the end, ppl r fell from the ladder of the fire truck. you will notice that they are not really on the ladder in the air. Second, ppl begin to fly when the ladder starts to move. ppl can't fly out of the ladder as she moves ... they fall directly to the ground for something called gravity. 5. The entire movie was dubbed. all dialogs were recorded after the film. The actors' lips were barely synchronized to the dialogues. There are probably many other reasons why this movie was bullshit, but I can't remember it. Check out this masterpiece of miserable Indian movies with an unintelligent, even stupid director, and you will agree with my rating. ppl who like hindi movies, please increase your expectations for decent quality in hindi movies. Allow me to say that not all Hindu films are bad. I like something. I didn't like this. 1.5 / 10 (1.5 for akshay and lara efforts)
