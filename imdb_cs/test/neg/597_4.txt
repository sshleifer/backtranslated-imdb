I gave this movie a four-star rating for several reasons. At first I felt that this movie was definitely preaching and I hate it. Yet it is my fault for first watching a Christian film. <br /> <br /> My friend and I rented this movie because it sounded interesting. The back of the locker said something in the spirit of a spiritual battle, someone opened a line that left the demons in our world and so on. Something I'm really interested in. This film almost hit the target. It was rather on the edge of the goal, more than the goal itself ... <br /> <br /> The basic graph of this movie is that two couples are kidnapped by a group of terrorists to become victims. experiments. However, since their experimental serum is derived from research by a scientist who claimed to be able to bridge the gap between the physical and spiritual realms, the men of the pairs are now able to feel, feel, hear and see the demons of the spiritual world. In this order. There seems to be no sense of taste in this area. This film is very clich√©. They took the title seriously, as men, while strapped to their beds, demand that their women look behind them because there is something. Although it is a good effort to do what it was, I think special effects could have been done much better. The demon who scratched the woman was a cheerful one word. My wife was uncomfortable as hell, and everyone in the room was really happy when she died. We all hoped another woman with her chair would beat her. This message is one that I don't care to comment on before I think Christian filmmakers should have found a better medium for it. So I give him four stars because it's not a movie error, I'm not a Christian and I don't like this type of message and I got a kick. comments. My friend and I watched this movie, which resembled an episode of MST3K.
