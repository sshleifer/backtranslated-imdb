I just watched this movie and I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was so boring that I found myself approaching X2 and finished in less than 30 minutes. I was not just disappointed but angry that I had wasted my money. They are among the top five movies I've ever seen and I've seen thousands of movies! The story was very confusing. If I didn't read the DVD sleeve cover before lending it, I'd be completely lost in this movie. I wouldn't think Tim Robbins, after making such good movies as "Shawshank Redemption," would agree to appear in this movie.
