For a truly wonderful movie, you can also try to see a film about Saint Francis of Assisi - good for all audiences. The best thing I liked about this movie was the landscape of Mexico, and it gets the movie up to 2. I was surprised that these actors didn't have a terrible sunburn, they were the desert inhabitants. And Moses is said to have a talking obstacle, but certainly not here. Even the "miraculous" scenes were invented and unbelievable. And what is the point when you can believe something in a TV story? I talked about how it collapses, I thought this Hallmark movie was pathetic and I see why others hate Hollywood. I don't, just some of these corporate profits. You do not need to be any kind of religion to benefit from "Jesus of Nazareth," but for this celluloid waste you need to be bored without doing anything stupid and religious. And for a real movie experience, try "Short Cut to Nirvana", a highly rated movie.
