This is the type of film I was wondering why anyone would consider it from the beginning. This is the kind of film I can't understand how people put money into it, how a rental store can put DVDs on their shelves. That's the kind of movie I blamed for renting it. <br /> <br /> There are good class B movies and I don't reject this genre. When they are good, interested in action, the characters have written well enough to act well, so you can take care of them. The effects in some of these films support the film in many cases and you can love them for originality. Almost nothing is true in Coronado. The subject and the script are cheap comics - just clich√©s. The effects are cheap - and I don't care that a movie is a low budget - you can do a lot with a low budget, but you need some talent. There are so many continuity and other overhead mistakes, as in ten other films. You don't care about characters, you can't, and at the end of the movie you were wondering if the parody was intentional or not. The only quality I have found is the scenery, there are some good sites that are worth a much better film. <br /> <br /> 2/10 on my personal level. So far the worst movie of the year.
