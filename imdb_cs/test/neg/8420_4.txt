A dry, disrespectful, but unjustly, unfair satire of detective films, with the stone-faced Michael Caine playing the British author of the cruel stories of crimes traveling to the Mediterranean to help write gangster memoirs that he likes. he soon realizes that he is being watched and his life is in danger. Caine tells the talks with considerable crafty wit and low key sarcasm, but his actual performance is without energy (Caine's fierce flashes of anger or frustration seem to come out of nowhere and connect with anyone on screen). Other cast members (especially Mickey Rooney, silver-haired Lionel Stander, and Lizabeth Scott) do very well in a color-wise role, although Al Lettieri has an insulting part as an overt cross-dressing gay (Lettieri gets offended without being able to defend himself). alone, unenviable position). Writer-director Mike Hodges has the idea of ​​a good idea (satirizing 1940s detective films without compromising hard conversation and environment), but he doesn't have a sharp sense of humor. When Bogart is a lookalike - with the question of a falcon - the best joke, what follows is really anemic. ** of ****
