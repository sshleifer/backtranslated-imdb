Like many Western history lovers, I was really looking forward to this very great PBS program that was made by Pittsburgh's WQED. However, I must say that I was somewhat disappointed. I think positively that overall this film has done a fair job by explaining the main issues and describing the events of the so-called French and Indian Wars. Especially his presentation of the Indian view was somewhat new and quite interesting, although it was certainly over-time. Also on the positive side, the mix of narrative and action scenes was well done and somewhat better than many of these typical documentary films that consisted of "expert" and image photography interviews (eg Ken Burns). On the negative side, many battles had a somewhat "staged" perspective, and many important aspects of war were disregarded. Most of all, I was very disappointed and frustrated by how little significance was given to Forbes' successful campaign of 1758 against Fort Duquesne compared to earlier failures in 1754 by Washington and 1755 by Braddock. In particular, I was somewhat distrustful that there was no mention of Colonel Henry Bouquet, a Swiss mercenary in the British service, who was most responsible for the success of Forbes. Finally, I couldn't believe the complete omission of the 1763 battle for a bushy run that began as a defeat of Braddock's defeat, but ended as a victory that decided the outcome of Pontiac's war through the intrigue of the same Colonel Bouquet, who must surely be one of Britain's most successful commanders.
