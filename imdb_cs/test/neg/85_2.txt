I have no idea how this movie can give this movie high marks. I didn't want to think it was another great horror movie, another great horror spoof, or another great low budget horror movie. Obviously, this is not meant to scare, but one fatal mistake with production has completely lost the enjoyment of viewing experience. Sound editing was terrible. I had to work to control the whole movie. You can imagine how difficult it is to get into something - even a low frequency spoof - if you either increase or decrease the volume or try to predict the next time. Regular dialogue is very low and all screams, sounds, etc. are very loud. We're not talking about switching between 5 and 7 on volume control, finding a happy medium at 6. We're talking about switching between 2 and 9 on a volume where it's virtually impossible to leave the volume alone. Again, this movie can be a decent example of what it should be, but you'll spend so much time adjusting the volume control that you will never have a chance to enjoy it.
