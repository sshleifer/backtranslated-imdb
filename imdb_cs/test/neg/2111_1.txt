I can start by saying I'm a fan of bad movies. And this is a really bad movie. He lists 100 passengers, 3000 snakes on the front, but I think it's more accurate to say 12 passengers and about 20 snakes. Snakes do nothing particularly interesting, the whole movie is just wrong. Although sometimes there is a big shot of pulsing arms and green goo puke (bad movies must have green goo, right?). But the end comes together and you literally hit you sitting in hysteria. and for giving this film support for up to 2 * ratings. <br /> <br /> There are some movies about the world that you want to show to your friends, just so you can watch there reactions when a certain event happens in them. For example, Coming a "big man" to "Keldy's" trapped in a '' LINE '' closet in 'Shark Attack 3' Almost every scene 'Troll 2' Ends 'Dracula 3000' (just for total mistrust and confusion) and the end of this movie proudly sits in this category. It's just worth it because of that. So get drunk, stoned, whatever your poison is, and watch this movie with some friends. <br /> <br /> Quite simply, if you like bad movies, keep it, but don't be fooled with 'Snakes Plane' ... there's no relationship. And you won't pay more for it than just divers.
