I admit it now. This is one of the most famous films ever made. But in the defense of Mr. Sj√∂gren, "Not really" - the scene wasn't all bad! And you have to love trying to go all the way to Sweden, just to find a sweet Swedish 15-year-old blonde, let her speak Swedish acting as Henry's Jewish mother (dennis hopper). What makes this scene so perfect is that Father Henrys answers the blonde Swedish-speaking girl in German ... <br /> <br /> The best actor / actress All the film must be a nun who cares for Henrys's mother, a woman who has no acting experience, but still puts the most compelling performance of all! <br /> <br /> Everyone and everyone, all Flick is nostalgia for me personally, it's just what gave me the broadcast on IMDb: s.: D <br /> <br /> // Feel like a movie star *
