OK, when I was little (and I think like 2 or 3, not 6 and 7) Barney was one of my favorite concerts. Then I grew up and threw away all the old Barney tapes. One day, when I go through the channels, I see that now Barney is playing in the caboose and I thought it was the right show? As soon as I realized it was, I was angry. Why did they change the show settings from school to CABOOSE? Since then, the show has been absolutely awful, and the only reason I gave it 2 is a) because I'm nice, b) because of Riff, and c) because in the old days the show was acceptable. I just hate it now. HATE IT. <br /> <br /> 2/10
