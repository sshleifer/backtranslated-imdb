**** Includes spoilers **** <br /> <br /> As a Rachael Leigh Cook fan, I watched this show finally come to see her. I was recording it so I could watch it several times, and there's something about this show that really bothered me! I admit it was a TV movie. Not only that, but it was created for Lifetime, a channel I despise. Because it was made for television, I can ignore the huge holes. I can ignore the massive lack of character development in Ally Sheedy's character. I can overlook the fact that George C. Scott and Rachael Leigh Cook, both of whom are very talented actors, certainly did not achieve their best abilities. I can see that the character of Don Diamont was so clich√© that you knew when you saw him that he was a villain. I can even pass an obvious mistake in the timeline (raped it during the winter break and then a year later have a baby from her.) <br /> <br /> The main thing I can't get over is this: child. In the first test, the custody is given to the child's father because he is "better educated, has a university degree and has a full-time job." Ineligible mother and custody should not be taken from the primary administrator and given to someone who has no previous child interaction. The problem is this: Nowhere in the course of these trials is the fact that a thirty-year-old man raped a 15-year-old girl and took it into account during pregnancy! Whether it was rape or not, he had sex with a minor! Wouldn't this be taken into account when the judge picks him up for custody because he's "an adult?" Older adults don't have sex with minors! <br /> <br /> It's not the worst cable film you've ever seen, but it's not even a great show. ** outside ****
