I believe it was supposed to be shocking or something. This movie is so poorly made that parts that "should" shock and rebellion come across at best as ridiculous. The characters are so lame and 2 .... wait .... 1 dimensional that I applauded every sick death ..... except that the POOR GOAT. <br /> <br />
