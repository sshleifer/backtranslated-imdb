This movie starts with kids telling each other urban legends like poodle in the microwave and get something extra for the chicken instead. Unfortunately, he turns to your basic movie. The first being about the administrator with a little secret. This one is fine at best. Then it gets worse because the next story about this boy, obsessed with dead flies, is on and on and on and on. It's a journey of how long and not so interesting to start. Then you get a typical shock scene and end. You need more than this in anthological film. You need at least three stories and one should not be so long that it becomes so uninteresting, especially considering how you see it ending miles away.
