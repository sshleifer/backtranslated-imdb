This movie is cash. Funds are dependent on a floating theme tune created for earlier classics. Yul Brynner has long jumped on the ship and has most of the production values. Lee Van Cleef takes the lead role of Chris. I can't think of any actor who looks less than Brynner than Van Cleef. Hey, he could at least shave his hair and lose his mustache just for continuity. Some correctional centers show this film to punish the perpetrator. One Step from a Row and the Magnificent Ride Seven! it is brought to the foreground and coated. They didn't even bother to make this movie look like a TV movie! Abysmal.
