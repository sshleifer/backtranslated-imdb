I did my best to follow this two-hour fiasco. It combined the terrible special effects and the plot of the original "Blob," with enforceable boost (excellent in the original) scenario of "Runaway Train". The only explanation for this film is that someone needed to take a huge tax deduction and found that they would combine it with a shot on the couch. What is Incredible Stinky! Lou Diamond Phillips is trying to show us why he'll take any part, no matter how bad. Barry Corbin continues his career as a mold, a US Senator from Texas, playing well. He should further make a leading role in the story of Trent Lott or Jesse Helms. Women in this film seem to have their roles as consolation prizes at the Fay Wray Memorial screaming contest. Special effects are incredibly bad. H.S. kids in the North Dakota movie class could do a better job. The writers had to pull the robbery at the clich√© of the bank to accumulate it. I couldn't keep looking without being in the Orange Watch. I have no idea how it ended, except apparently, 119 minutes late. Ugh! Invisible Impactor.
