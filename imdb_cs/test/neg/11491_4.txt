FREDDY FORSYTH came up with a story that suits the West's mood on Putin's Russia. Forsyth installs an ugly guy like President Ruski who wants to return the country - not so much to Stalin's communism but to Hitler's fascism. In fact, his Political Manifesto could come out of Mein Kampf rather than Marx. A loon has the latest weapons of biological destruction to achieve the ethnically pure pogrom of the Russian Federation. American mercenaries will contact the Russian president to realize his fanatical, genocidal dream, but then enter Pat Swayze's Dirty Dancing ... and yeah, things get down and dirty. It's a former US operative-turned-drifter, Jason Monk, who is disrupted by the British government to see what the Russians are up to. Swayze's character, who is not Monk (!), As a coral sidebar, has begotten the Russian beauty of Elena (played by the beautiful Marta Konda) on her previous missions to the former state of Commie. Hardman Swayze is doing a passable job of trying to defeat the evil Russians. But young unknown actress Marta Kondova steals the film as her renowned 18-year-old Russian daughter Elena, who helps her father to eradicate the terror that threatens her beloved mother Russia.
