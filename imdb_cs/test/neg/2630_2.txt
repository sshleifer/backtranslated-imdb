This is one of the worst movies I've seen in many years. I started to watch the movie not expecting too much and that's exactly what he added .... not much! In fact, it ended up delivering even less than I expected. My first reaction, when I saw the opening parts of the movie, was that I would probably finish it with "4". I thought it seemed to have a reasonably good photograph and a terrible atmosphere. be initially stupid and tasteless when it is stupid and disgusting at the end. By the time the movie was over, I was willing to rate it no more than "1". Don't waste your time or money on this.
