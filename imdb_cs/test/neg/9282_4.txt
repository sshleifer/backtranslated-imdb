I watched this movie with great expectations. The paleness on the back showed that it would be ugly. But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfactory. Violence was nothing I haven't seen a thousand times before, the gore level was only average (he thought there was probably more than what was seen in Hollywood in the past 5 years - maybe more), and I wasn't even at any stage I feel uncomfortable, scared. Again CAT 3 movie with big wraps, did not live up to his hype. Certainly hire this movie but don't expect any expectations. I'm so excited to get into the whole Asian horror scene, but I'm always disappointed. I loved Ichi, and Audition, but then again Miike stands alone at the moment. Please inspire me ..... there is a big group of tired genres of fans who are hungry for quality horror!
