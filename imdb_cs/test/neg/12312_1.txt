When my own child begged me to leave the introduction of this film, I know it's bad. I wanted to pull my eyes. I wanted to get across the screen and hit Mike Myers for sacrificing the last bit of dignity he had. This is one of the few movies in my life I watched and wished I wouldn't "want" if it were possible. The other films are 'Troll 2' and 'Fast and Furious', both of which are better than the one in the hat. I can drink to sleep tonight in a vain attempt to forget that I have ever witnessed this blasphemy in the good name of Seuss. Mike Myers says I'm sticking to Austin or even resurrecting Waynes' world. Just because he worked for Jim Carrey doesn't mean Seuss is a success for all Canadians. <br /> <br />
