this is the worst movie I've seen in the long run, it doesn't matter that there are so many useful things on this island, "how comfortable !!!!", acting is bad from the beginning, its a similar thing to those really scripted soft porn movies on channel 5, a complete waste of time, and I can't remember the main actors name, but I can't believe he's still getting a job! I've never seen him act "I've seen him in a lot of movies ... But I've never seen him act. Here are some obvious errors, apparently gasoline lighters still work, even if they've been soaked in seawater !!! You can walk into the naked sea, but come out wearing a bikini bottoms (I guess the cameraman and the editor were students) There are plenty of other bugs, but I brag now, except for his as many bugs as the cast script and the entire movie to avoid at all costs
