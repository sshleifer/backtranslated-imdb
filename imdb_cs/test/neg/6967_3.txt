As many know, it is Edward D. Wood Jr.'s feature debut. as a writer / producer / director / actor. I've been a fan of Ed Wood for several years now. Although I do not like it, as well as some of his other films, it was probably the greatest view that the film public gets out of wood during their lives. Everyone knows he was a transvestite. This film is about sex change and how transvestite can be a conflict in relationships with loved ones. This film is the way ahead of its time in dealing with this subject and its solution. However, the film still contains Wood's usual pitfalls of bad dialogue, senseless footage, and hockey special effects. Throwing Wood is the usual overdose of Bela Lugosi's hamming it and you have Wood's first attempt to be a director. The reason is that the police inspector goes to the doctor after he discovers the body of a transvestite who committed suicide in terms of advice on how to avoid further problems in this context. The doctor tells him a story about Glen, who is also a transvestite. Glen wants to marry Barbara, but she can't tell her about her secret. He also tells the inspector about Alan, who is undergoing a change of sex because he is really more fit to being a woman. Bela Lugosi plays a scientist who seems to add some kind of running commentary to what's going on (Lugosi's part is not really well defined and proves it's probably a vehicle for Wood to have a star in his film and Lugosi to get something cash). All in all, the film shows the characteristics of Wood's career. It was apparently shot on a very low budget and has quite a few things thrown in rather randomly. He certainly has "it's so bad, it's good". However, I must applaud Ed to his gradual thinking of making this film. Transvestitism and sexual changes were not extremely open subjects in the early 1950s. Wood was at great risk in creating a film that portrays transvestites as people who are not sexual deviants and give more human faces to cross-dressing.
