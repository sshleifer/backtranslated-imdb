I understand that people have different expectations regarding low budget movies in the arthouse. I also know that John Sayles is wearing a kind of flash, the earthy, intellectual anti-Hollywood vibration, la Tim Robbins, Coen brothers, and Atom Egoyan, making him a darling with get-go critics. But this is not a good movie. I'm sorry, it's just not. It's meanders. It has too many characters. His tone is uneven, his view is confused, acting is everywhere, from naturalism to the top. It takes long moments with smaller characters that we don't care about, and only removes tense scenes when things are going well. <br /> <br /> Missing tag. The worst mistake in the movie is that the two closest things to the protagonist, Edie Falco's Marly and Angela Bassett's Desiree, are straight-clad in characters who have no drive. Marly is an apathetic drunk, immersed in his own life inertia. Desiree is a woman trapped in her own suppressed pain. When your views of the two main characters are summed up with the phrases "I don't care about them" and "I want to leave here", why should viewers give a rat patothy? It will be clear: Sayles writes a funny dialogue. He is very adept at creating the scene. The problem is that these scenes don't go anywhere. There is no backbone to the film. No drive. The film does not create interest in any of the characters. In my opinion, she is also too prophetic about the big bad corporate America that has swallowed up the little boy. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a quality "little" movie, look at "Straight Story" by David Lynch. Pass it on.
