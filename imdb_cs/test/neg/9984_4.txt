Although his plot is taken from the history of ancient Rome, 'Caligula' is not made in the style of sword-and-sandal epics like 'Spartacus' or 'Gladiator'. (That filming style-making was out of favor in the late 1970s). Rather, it resembles a cross between soft-core porn film and ugly video. At least a shorter version of 150 minutes. I have never seen a full 210 minute version, but judging by the description on this site, it would seem to be closer to the cross between the hard-core porn movie and the ugly video. As would be expected from a movie released by Penthouse publisher, there are many naked bodies that can be seen, and the film lovingly catalogs Caligula's sexual perversions, including his incest affair with his sister Drusilla. What might be unexpected from a magazine publisher so closely associated with a heterosexual masculine lifestyle is that there are so many masculine flesh as females and markedly homoerotic overtones of many scenes. Sex obsession is balanced by the same obsession with violence as if Bob Guccione, Gore Vidal, and Tinto Brass were trying to kill two single-stone taboos. (It is a remarkable coincidence that the director of such a rough film should be called "Brass" and the screenwriter of such cruelty should be called "Gore"). The characters are killed or maimed by various sadistic ways and there is a charming scene of homosexual rape. Emperor Caligula and his predecessor Tiberius were certainly known for their agitated lifestyle, so the concentration of film on sex and violence is not necessarily historically inaccurate. However, I ask whether such concentration is necessary to help us understand this period in Roman history. Both "the fall of the Roman Empire" and the "Gladiator" were established during the reign of Commodus, the emperor quite cruel and malevolent as Caligula. In no way did the filmmakers consider it necessary to turn their film into a mixture of 'Up Pompeii!', 'Emmanuelle' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', and both of these films are artistically much better than 'Caligula'. The action in the film is not particularly bad, with a few exceptions, such as the terribly wooden Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla. Malcolm McDowell makes a suitably mad Caligula. (Good, that's in the context of this movie. The real Caligula was no doubt cruel and eccentric, but historians have debated whether he's really mentally ill). The big secret is exactly why so many major British actors should agree to participate in such cruel production. In the case of Helena Mirren (the only Dame of the British Empire with a past as a porn star), it was probably associated with her rather regrettable tendency between highbrow and sleazy, but the sky itself knows what Peter O'Toole and John Gielgud thought they were doing. Unlike other famous actors, such as Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton, Gielgud did not always look at home in the cinema, but here he dignifiedly interprets the role of Nerva, a decent and old school senator. Unfortunately, in connection with this movie any attempt at dignity is just like a place like a pearl at dunghill. Guccione has clearly succeeded in his ambition to make this movie a cult classic of decadence. (Whether Brass and Vidal had the same ambition for film, it is a question). However, the film will not succeed at any other level, either as an art cinema or as a study of dictatorship policy. Even eroticism is secondary. 4/10
