So bad, it's fun, especially during the cocktail hour, and believe me, you'll need beer, drink, or anything that can get through this turkey. Where do they get financial support for such "horror" movies? Entertainment in this movie predicts which characters will eat and in what order, and trashing so-called "uniforms" "military" jokers wear. By the way, predators are not the same predators we have met in "Jurassic Park" but a kind of cousins. (Sorry, you won't have to watch any spoilers here to find out for yourself.) Don't expect the conspiracy to make sense, it's easy, just go on the road. You could make it a game ... every time you hear a sound ... or better, every time someone gets a dragon "predator". With a bit of luck, you don't even remember that you saw this "C-grade" movie for TV!
