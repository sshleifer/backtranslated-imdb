This year has three more weeks to go, but if there is not really a terrible turkey before then, Passion Of the Mind can be the winner of my favorite film competition of the year. Interesting idea poorly executed. And that's why it's wrong. Demi Moore is very good at stretching her lips and smoking cigarettes, but is she all she does? And why so many cigarettes. Ligitt and Myers or one of the other bad nicotine boys had some of their illegal profits invested in this production. It is confusing, stupid and moves in the frantic past of arthritic earthworms. I gave it to 3. It should be 2! <br /> <br />
