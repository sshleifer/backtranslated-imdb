I saw just this movie and all I can say is where the units are in these days. It seems to be a great second feature on the disc in 1977 (maybe playing with one of those Joan Collins movies), but it's only worth looking at when you feel nostalgic for the 1970s. A silly plot that is full of holes but resembles one of the era in which it was made. Interesting to see Melanie Griffith so young and Anne Lockhart is quite an attractive, though not much actress. In fact, there is not much in this film at all. It's a kind of adventure of Dukes of Hazzard without a fuss or in 1969 a Dodge charger jumping over things in the woods. But there's Mecrury Comet who is jumping over the garbage dump!
