Thank God for DVR and fast forward. Even with that I couldn't sit in any more of this pleasure. When they encountered an old Indian who had asked for beans, I gave up and deleted it. Is it the best SciFi Channel can come on Saturday night? And what about some old classics instead? The idea of ​​a Special Forces unit was bad enough. Looks like they wanted to save money by filming everything in the woods. What more can I say? It was so bad that I didn't think I could come up with enough lines to look at it. But it looks like he'll do one more line. Save your time, let alone your money on this dog movie.
