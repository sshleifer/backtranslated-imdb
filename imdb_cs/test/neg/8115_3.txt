Even though it's dated, I have to insist ... PLEASE NOT YOU! Frankly, it just doesn't help, because nothing that could be added or changed in the current way to make it better film. The novel on which this novel is based was atmospheric, well-written, true scary work, but on film, it just doesn't translate. Most royal masterpieces cannot translate the film. I'm not sure why this is the case, but when you look at it, if you look at it, you will probably see what I mean. <br /> <br /> Book? That's beautiful. It's not a masterpiece, but it's more than just fun. <br /> <br /> Film? Do something else. You can thank me later. <br /> <br /> Heading 3.1 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
