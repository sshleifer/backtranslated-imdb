I'm a huge fan of zombie movies, and that's just a poor attempt at one. I consider the best features of zombie flicks a sense of solidarity and the need to survive. This film focused more on the "let's do it" look. The movie was full of bad games and even worse special effects. When the zombies emerge from the floor and take the guy down, blood spills out of the hole. I didn't know the holes in the plane floors bleed so hard. And the original zombie lady, Kelly or something, showed the worst acting I've ever seen when she woke up and started feeling bad. When I died, I laughed quite a bit. He deserved it in every way. I was a little confused as to why Dr. Kelly could talk after what became a zombie, but then there was nothing to say more zombies because of annoying shouts and screams. And they seemed to kill the zombies quite effectively by shooting them in the belly, but when Dr. Bennett expelled from the plane and into the engine, removing most of his lower half, he is still able to live at the end. Br /> <br /> It seemed to me that they changed things to create a "good" scene. When one of those unpleasant friends (I did not learn the time to learn their names, played a pointless role) was in the bathroom, she was attacked by a zombie behind the mirror. Was it a two-way mirror to watch Mile-High Clubbers? I've never been an unbroken mirror on an airplane (bad luck and all this), but I doubt there is so much space behind it, with an insanely limited space truly bathroom and all. Nutritional properties were too late, unfortunately. One thing the movie had was smoking hot flight attendants, but they felt the need to kill all but one. And I admit that I laughed pretty damn when an old lady chompala on Frank's arm and he says, "She dies of me to die" or something like that. Honestly, I was sadly wasting my nine dollars on this movie. The fact that I bought her a minor will redeem her, but still ... That failed on many levels. Hold on to dawn dead and 28 days later.
