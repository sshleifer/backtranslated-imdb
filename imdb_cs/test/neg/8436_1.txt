One of the biggest lessons I've ever had about watching a movie has been this: <br /> <br /> I've worked at Roger Corman's offices as well as many other wanabees before and since then, I've interned and tried to find out how it all worked and how to become indispensable (hah!). One afternoon, Julie Corman, Roger Corman's wife and producer, asked me to load the tape. I'm not sure why she wanted to watch it. I think it's a student film or a reel, something like that, a business card. Regardless of the reasons she had to see, the only free video machine in the office in the room I was working in was the closest person on the machine. I started the tape. Fade in: On the screen sat a figure at the table facing the camera. Behind him, the screen to the left, was the door that opened to the room. There was a coat rack against the far wall. A second figure entered through the door and began to speak. The first character, the guy at the table, turned to answer (that's all one, static camera, there are no pans or dolly shots). The other figure turned to hang the coat on the coat rack and put out another line. Julie Corman said, "I've seen enough." and left the room. What she saw in ten seconds of footage she watched was that the director was an idiot. Opening with two characters who immediately turned their backs to the camera that issues the lines? No sorry. Other! You've been that long. Ten seconds. Shoot it in the opening shot and you're dead. I remembered that moment as I watched the opening of this piece of crap. After an endlessly long jungle travelogue, we see that several monkeys apparently plunge into cages. The man with the gun laughs. The jet steamer lands and we see the taxi all the way to the terminal. God is boring! Cut to airport interior. Two men meet. Oh! Something is happening! They shake hands. Cut to a different angle for both men - <br /> <br /> - and the director crosses the line. <br /> <br /> The first two movies that have any spatial relationship with each other and the guy got up. 'Not Crossing The Line' is one of the basic rules of film grammar that keeps characters from side to side jumping on the screen and confuses the audience. Viewers don't want to be confused. Mystified? Helpless? Confused and biased? Yes. Viewers love all those. Confused? No. You'll lose them. They come out. "Crossing the Line" is one of those things that throw you at the film school or they should. These are basic things. It is not an inviolable rule (there are no inviolable rules) directors constantly violate it - but not on the first real movie cut. I thought, "I saw enough". And off.
