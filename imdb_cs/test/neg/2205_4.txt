I am a huge fan of Randolph Scott, so I was surprised and disappointed when I found it hardly in this movie! The film really belongs to Robert Ryan, who is a jam hero, and one who is involved in a love triangle. Good sadness, Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr. Scott in this movie !! For many viewers, this is not a problem, but I am from the school of sidekick Walter Brennan, not Gabby Hayes ... even though I say his lines were somewhat funnier than this in many of his films. with Randolph Scott and John Wayne. Personally, I found out that the movie is very slow, with an intricate plot that has been confused by even more useless romance subplot. According to the convoluted, I don't think impossible to understand or find out, I just think too messy for his own good. The direction is uninspired, and the two main bad guys have the most disappointing to come by. at the end. The whole film comes as a fake, unrealistic and badly filmed. Just because you can't find anything good ... <br /> <br /> plus a side, Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her all-too-brief part of this movie. Not sure if it's actually her singing or someone else, but the one who had it had a very nice voice. Mrs. Jeffreys also had some nice game moments. The script needed either much more or to completely remove its character. As it was, her pretty few moments were not enough to help the film. Finally, Mr. Scott. It looks fantastic in this movie and it's a nonsensical legislator to set things right. Some people complain that his characters before 1950 were too good, perfect, but that never bothered me. I'll take it well-well before 1950, or brave and violent after 1950 ... either Randolph Scott was a real western hero. I'm sad to say that but I would recommend that you pass this film if you are not a dying fan ... there are so many better Scott movies that will not be missed.
