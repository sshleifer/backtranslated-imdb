This is just that the worst waste I've ever had was dissatisfied with the fact that I was sitting. The story was embarrassingly amateur, the graphics were horrible, and acting ... I've never seen worse playing throughout my life. The kindergarten class could come up with a more frightening, better written and more fun concept than this. Too bad everyone who loses time on this movie, as well as actors who agreed to work. It was obvious that they were not given the right direction. Writers had to spend their time at the film school in the "back room" playing peaknuckle. A lot of professors spent a lot of time unnecessarily on these two. It would be really embarrassing to admit that I knew them.
