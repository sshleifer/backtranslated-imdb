I was 19 in 1970 when it came out and when I heard how funny it was when it came out and read reviews, I finally rented and watched it. I didn't laugh once - a very free movie - and I usually love Reiner. I can't stand me for life, why it's considered funny. I didn't have one laugh. And I love comedy! Well, at least now I know what it was all about. Not my idea of ​​comedy. Go rent The Navigator or The Love Nest Buster Keaton - now they're comic classics! If you rent this - you have a backup rental, so the whole evening is not a loss. Score 3 out of 10
