This is the price that made me lose all my respect for the Hugos. If such a "distinguishing" panel doesn't see or care about the obvious stories that tell the story of Battlestar Galactica, then what's worth is their appreciation? Answer: Not much. The award-winning shows should be examples of creativity and perfection, none of which is in BG in this episode or in others I have seen. > <br /> Shooting in a drab video is not "artistic", it's just cheap. Shaking the camera is not "creative", it is vomiting and lazy as it can be. <br /> <br /> All BGs have shown how the corruption of most "academies" that provide prizes is really and how easy it is to get prizes with lots of PR money.
