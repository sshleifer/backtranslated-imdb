But at least this movie got what it deserved - to be sent to a satellite of love, to be ridiculed by Mike, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot of Pearl Forrester at "Mystery Science Theater 3000!" "Soultaker" is one of those long lost, forgotten movies that are so bad that you will be sure to have nightmares or depression later in life. Although the film is not so old, it is still a very forgotten type of film. If it had never been for the intelligent mind in the "Mystery Science Theater 3000", the film would not only look like it had never been done, but the movie would not be very enjoyable for viewers. <br /> <br /> In real life: this movie is really bad. In the love satellite: this movie is excellent!
