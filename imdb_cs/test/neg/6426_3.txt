The movie starts pretty well. It is a really frightening scene when a few refugees on the run by law break a innocent family living in a remote country cottage by killing their mother and father. The young daughter can only escape through a mysterious ghost who kills two aggressors while covering the lower case. Then we catch up with it fifteen years later, when a student examining a supernatural student studies supernatural, lives with his promiscuous aunt and cares for a mysterious redhead. She has no real friends, she was almost raped at a party and has a bizarre vision that no one else can see. Okay, life is big. Things get a lot more enjoyable when she and her mother's sister, who is later found dead in a bath under suspicious circumstances, threw herself into the forehead. Hmm, I wonder who's going to be the main police suspect? He is quickly followed by more deaths, all related to their relationship with our heroine, who was with them before the wrong end. Could it be the culprit, or could it be something more ethereal in nature? Key: If you think first, you picked up the wrong movie from the blockbuster. Go back and get the right, short-sighted gimp. As I said, I was ready to prepare for good parts, safe, knowing I was missing. nothing but an average tensioning pot. But the first ten minutes caught me and I decided to give him a chance. I was quite pleasantly surprised: it was definitely not a masterpiece, but the acting was good enough and the script was still throwing in interesting situations I was looking forward to finding a solution to. Unfortunately, 45 minutes, I realized that my attention was beginning to wander in the long run when the main character walks around the library and does nothing. Then we get a cheap fear, followed by a quarter-hour goddess of paranormal between her and her new friend. Things just got worse because a promising start is thrown out of the window when we get to one unconvincing plot after another, followed by an end as anti-climatic as we promised the moon and ended up with a miserable meteorite instead. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> If it was wrong all the way, it would be much easier to swallow. The fact that he starts on a canter and hardly ends with a cough is not just disappointing, it is heartbreaking. How can something that started so promising end up so formally? I don't know, and I don't care. I just give the writer and the director some advice for the next time: They don't spend 5 weeks writing the first part of their script, then 5 minutes to the end. You tend to notice these things in the final product when you treat your project as carelessly as you are here ... 3/10
