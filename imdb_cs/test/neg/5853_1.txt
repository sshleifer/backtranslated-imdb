Michael Allred's comic stories, especially his work on Madman, are usually great fun. "Astroesque," Allred is a no-budget indy movie, the opposite of entertainment. The worst playing ever in conjunction with a really horrible dialogue makes a brutal cinematic experience. Pretty sure Allred understands that WTF is happening, but he's the only one. Dare you to watch the whole mess is not enough ... defy you to watch the whole mess is more at your destination. "Astroesque" is some kind of movie tie on Allred "Red Rocket 7" comic book, which is paradoxically mostly unreadable. I'm sorry Allred, who was totally out of his depth of trying to make a movie, I'm also sorry about what an incredible waste of my time and money is. now available on eBay.
