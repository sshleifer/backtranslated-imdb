Nightkill plays Robert Mitchum as a world-tired private eye that explores the case of missing industrialist (Mike Connors). He is hired by Jaclyn Smith, an anxious wife of a missing man. What Jaclyn does not know is that she knows where her husband is. After all, she was the one who helped her lover James Franciscus dispose of her wealthy hubby. What more could one expect from a rotten slasher movie with Robert Mitchum? Mannix goes west, monkeys are abused, models leaning on classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until the giallo style wrap-up brings all the regret to the bitter end. This is BAD cinema. And this movie is bad. Looks like Halloween mixes with Trick or Treats. Avoid it. Rating R for Graphic Violence, Nudity and Sexual Situation.
