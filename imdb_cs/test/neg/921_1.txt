How did I deserve to watch this crap ??? Worst ever. Behavior was horrible when I read that it was a comedy I was expecting, at least to smile, once - or twice, but .... If you're going to lose an hour and a half, it's the right movie. I recommend just looking into the wall or something else than watching this "movie". Yoy can even watch a documentary (if you're a guy) about pregnant women, guarantee that it will be more fun :) The actor in this (I forgot his name) is not so bad, and I am surprised how I accepted the role. Anyway, "I want someone to eat cheese" is the right movie if you want to punish someone.
