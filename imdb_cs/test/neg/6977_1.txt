The only Bela Lugosi, who was sitting in a large wing chair with a huge book in his lap, was looking at the camera and in a terrible vocal sound that sounded like scoffing Shakespeare's reading, intones sloooow-ly: the constant groping of unknown things drawing on endless times time, brings to the light many surprising things, (snicker), surprising? because they seem new (Lugosi's eyes are now bulging, with raised eyebrows and a grin of mouth, continues), most of them are not new, signs of ages "(visual visualization lightening, accompanied by the sound of thunder, which then continues in horror for an incredible 86 seconds). And so what begins is probably the worst movie ever made. This "film" almost defies the description. He said in a semi-docudrama style with an invisible narrator explaining a conspiracy ... like this ... the story revolves around the uncertainty of a man named Glen (Ed Wood, Jr.) who dresses; therefore a link to Glend. The film has no real structure. Instead, it mostly consists of a random assortment of medallions that may ... or may not ... relate to Glen or the cross motif. One long sequence consists of an unknown woman who squirms on a sofa, followed by a man who whips a woman in what we call S&M today. Then, at strange moments, Bela reappears, for no apparent reason, and babbling more in dialogue, like: "when he is wrong because he is doing the truth, and when he is right, because he is doing wrong; pull the string, dance to it. ‚ÄùHuh? Approximately twenty percent of visual movies consist of footage, accompanied by a VO, which relates to the theme of the story, but not to the visuals. That's why we see footage from: busy streets, highway traffic, stormy buffalo herds and a playground. But it's worse. In the cross-dressing movie, we have 58 consecutive seconds of foundry furnace, which produces hot steel, and 84 consecutive seconds of World War II battle scenes. <br /> <br /> Even the simplest items are spoiled. In one scene we see a newspaper headline that reads "Man Nabbed dressed as a girl". Under the headline that has been stuck or stuck clearly, there is an article on ... taxes. In one of my favorite scenes, a woman jumps off the screen: "Aircraft, why it's against the creator's will", a voice that sounds like she was just breathing helium. <br /> <br /> In addition to the performance of Lyle Talbot, acting is uniformly horrible. The construction of the production is cheap and drab; (but you have to love that sticky wallpaper). Editing is negligent. Most background music is only suitable for lifts in 1950. B&W cinema has too much contrast. And the costumes look like something that comes from the savings bank. This movie is so bad that it makes "Plan 9 From Outer Space" like "Citizen Kane". I just don't know how to do anything worse than Ed Wood's "Glen Or Glenda". But fortunately, Bela Lugosi is in it. Every time he opened his mouth and looked into the camera with those big, bulging eyes, I laughed to the ground.
