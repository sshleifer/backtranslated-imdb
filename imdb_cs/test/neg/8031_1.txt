Maybe I'm just a simple person, but I prefer films that somehow interest me in the people in them. I didn't care about anyone in this movie. Should it be a comedy? Maybe humor was too gentle for me (at nano level). The thing is that he lacked so many things. There were characters that could be funny, but they weren't. There were characters you liked but not. For example, the guy who thought the Beatles tore songs. There was so much potential, but all he did was talk like a Beatle and complain about how he was torn. Ha-Ha. And the previous poster spoke of "I'm a walrus" scene, as if it were strange. What? He played 'I'm Walrus' on the old piano and I sang. Is there an inner joke? I'm sure he's stuck. This film seems to me that movie people say they like it because it sounds "intellectual" or "hip" to tell you that you like the entire metaphysical art / garbage report that the artist expresses. If you want to be fun, stay away.
