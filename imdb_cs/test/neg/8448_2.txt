That's just one of those movies that can't justify most of what's going on. These people go for a trek: a young girl wants to photograph animals. There are no Piranhas, but I think the psychotic hunter is a real piranha. Anyway, there's a lot of animals and there's a lot of driving. There is considerable anti-gun talk, but we all know where it goes. Towards the end, there is a lot of action and rape thrown in. Someone has to pay, and they do. It would be nice to have a few piranhas to fill something. There were a lot of monkeys. If you move fast through blunt areas, you have five minutes.
