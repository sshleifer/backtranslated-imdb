Can u trust a college professor doing this movie ????? Same Man Who Made DHOOP <br /> <br /> The film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes sometimes <br /> <br /> The main message is nice but poorly presented <br /> <br /> The film looks like a collage of amateur scenes, miscasts.etc and poor performance <br /> <br /> Direction and everything is poor <br /> <br /> Music is fine <br /> <br Emraan's naughty lane works and does well Tusshar's bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh sorry when he looks at the mirror
