I had more boring sections in my life for 80 minutes, but nobody cares about it now. Hell Ride is based on the retro cult of the 70th theme that Tarantino has brought back, and done right, in movies like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The problem with Hell Ride is, unlike PF and RD, the story of garbage and so is the development of characters. How many movies does Bishop think he can steal from them? A Brief Case in Pulp Fiction, Air Gun in No Country, etc. Speaking of the Bishop, what the hell is he doing in this movie? I couldn't help but laugh at the scenes where he stood with the doll she believed, trying desperately to look like a stiff biker. Nothing in this movie is believable. And why Dennis Hopper? Did they really need the theme of Easy Rider? I blame Larry Bishop for his terrible plot and dialogue, not to mention his unsuccessful leadership attempt. Don't bother watching this movie, it's a waste of time.
