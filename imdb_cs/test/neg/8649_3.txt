If it's a film noir, then noir must be French for glacial slow. Take the cast of totally unlikely characters, don't give them anything to say, break the whole thing down with unreasonable ultra-violence and you have a formula for an appealing Dash. Could be the subtitle "Sleazy Hollywood types trying to make money from a Chinese rip-off". One minute of Bruce Dern is much better than anything else in this movie. By the way, I didn't like the movie.
