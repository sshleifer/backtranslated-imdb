Don't get me wrong, I like the Lords League TV series. It was funny, twisted and completely inspired. I was looking forward to the film, the assumption was interesting and I was looking forward to seeing what they did with the characters and where the bizarre story would take them. <br /> <br /> It was a total disappointment for beginners. the three weakest characters in the series were leading and it only included bit bits for other characters (why not select mickey and Pauline, papa Lazaro or baths and Edward for the main parts!?). It was unreal, half-baked gags and bad humor. The real clinician was a simple absurd period of drama / comedy (and I will freely use the word comedy). He was distracted from the main story and felt embarrassed, not to mention the painfully rude. The direction of the film is terrifying, and often feels that the lines have been delivered by characters within one take. He was in a hurry. Then - three Plasticine-esquire headers. What the hell was that about? absolutely ridiculous, it seemed as if the League of Lords had marked him at the end. Overall, I watched myself looking at my watch and sighing from my movie experience. Once a terrific TV series, they were tainted by a terribly unbearable film. <br /> <br /> If I could give it 0 out of 10 i. Don't waste your money seeing it.
