2/3 of this movie is a recycled record from previous movies, which is the fact that it is unfortunately obvious, even to someone like me who has not seen the original movies. And it kind of looks like I've seen it. It's like the episode of every TV show where characters sit around a photo album or something, and you just see the recycled footage of other episodes. I have seen that some manufacturers do expanded photo reports, but never more than 5 minutes. This movie is mostly a material that viewers have already seen, so you can attach the case that it's one of the biggest riots ever published in public. I have to see Theater, in 16mm print, which is good enough, I suppose given how rare this kind of material has to be in the movie these days. I give the film some recognition for the semi-convincing Gothic atmosphere and for unintentional humor, but that's about it. The Aztec mummy monster looks good, even has some facial mobility that is better than most movie monster seasons. But the robot is deplorable, though it is interesting to see the human face completely. He's a "human robot" or something that explains a little in the movie. I think it's considered an android. So technically in hard science fiction terms this film should be called "Android versus Aztec's Mum," but I doubt that anyone has been too concerned about the technical aspects before worrying about quality. In fact, the film is so sloppy that it makes television look good. Even dubbing from Mexican to English is lazy and weak - for example, in one place the hero says, "I could also start at the beginning ..." what the hell type of translation is? At least they couldn't say "beginning at the beginning," so it doesn't sound repeatedly? The editor of the university may have had a cut from this film. It is the epitome of utilitarian filmmaking, there is nothing at all in this film that might not be there for basic commercial purposes of the film. They didn't make more effort than being able to, and given the extensive recycled footage, I'd doubt they actually spent more than a week making this movie. Now I will stop publishing the principle that I do not want to spend more energy in the process of commenting than the filmmakers actually spent in making it.
