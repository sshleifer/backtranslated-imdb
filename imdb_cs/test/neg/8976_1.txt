Frankly, I could take it or leave it on the subject of the death penalty. The problem with this document is that it is a complete love holiday for the killer, absolutely no compassion with the family. The execution of Wanda Jean, with her one-sided look, only reinforced my view that she should be executed for her crimes. She tried to argue that she was mentally retarded, but she did not support this view in the video. She seemed uneducated, but so did her whole family, but that doesn't mean they were all retarded. I can fully understand whether someone is against the death penalty, but to completely ignore a crime as if it did not, and try to put Wanda on some moral peak of the mountain is offensive in nature, and that is not the party side. problem with which I would be connected.
