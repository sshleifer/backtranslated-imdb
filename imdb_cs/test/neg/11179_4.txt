Matt Cvetic is a loyal communist in the Pittsburgh smelter who works to recruit to the side, even if he isolates himself from his son, family and neighbors. Even more difficult is that Cvetic is actually an FBI agent who acts as a communist to get information about the party's activities. The party is trying to create a strike in the mill, where a pro-strike movement will lead workers to a wave of propaganda. Cvetic also has to contend with beautiful Eva Merrick, a party member and her son's school teacher, who discovers that Cvetic is a double agent. When Eve learns the ugly truth about the true motives of the party, Red decides he must be destroyed and Cvetic must help her without endangering her. The film should have enough tension and double crossing, but there is very little in this film, but (according to today's standards) very cheesy propaganda and little action or excitement. Lovejoy is very good in the lead, but he and the rest of the cast seem rude. Little surprise and how did this film receive an Oscar for Best Documentary? Rating, 4.
