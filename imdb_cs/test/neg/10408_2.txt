anyone who thinks they will follow the Iron Eagle must be shot. In this case, it was enough. Iron Eagle was a good movie to watch. Although it is unrealistic, it is still fun. Iron Eagle II has a pointless graph and can be used as a cure for insomnia. I didn't even bother to watch Iron Eagle III, but from the point of view of R, I assume it's more violent than the previous 2 movies. Well, Iron Eagle IV is probably the most dangerous sequel. Lou Gossett Jr. returns as always the wonderful "Chappy" Sinclair. Another Jason returns to the role of Doug Masters (Canadian Jason Cadieux, who looks like Jason Gedrick of the first Iron Eagle). But wait (Here is a possible spoiler) ... Wasn't Doug killed in Iron Eagle II? Writers had to be desperate for the story, so they revived Doug Masters by saying he was a Russian prisoner. This movie was the cheapest made of all Iron Eagle movies. Why do filmmakers consider it necessary that the continuation of non-film films? (eg Police Academy films). I always enjoyed working in these films. He was the only one holding the turkey. Hopefully it was the last sequel to Iron Eagle. let him rest in peace.
