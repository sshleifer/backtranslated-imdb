I can't find anything that is good on this miniseries. Why the hell would she ban chocolate when she could ban something much more practical like smoking or alcohol? Also, the fact that it is an Australian program and all that is in England and all showing British accents is stupid. Overall, I think this show is unrealistic and cheap.
