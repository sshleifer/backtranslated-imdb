Stupid movie with stupid plot. They feel they have thrown every imaginable clich√© in the blender. Especially "Did" parts where two teenage girls gets the French president clean the water. Because we all know how America is dedicated to protecting the environment. Kyoto, anyone? And a French chef who has probably never seen or tasted a hamburger ... That's why people think Americans have no culture. This, and the fact that we meet our children when they come to Europe to "see the world" (ie, ate at McDonalds in foreign capital) are not as stupid as two ditsy preteens in this movie, but they have just the same amount of cultural enlightenment and good manners.
