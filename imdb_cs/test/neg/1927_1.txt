I watched this movie to see the direction of one of the most promising young talents in movies. Unfortunately, with this film, Leelee Sobieski chose not only to wear well, but completely without any meaningful goal. This movie used every hackney trick in the book to leave the screen, tap you on the shoulder and politely ask if it can have your heart so it can give them a good tug. Romance can be done well, and when it is, the viewer is left feeling that love portrayed on the screen. I laughed during the emotional climax of this movie. Warmly. To save you time and money, I would suggest that instead of seeing this movie, they have a meal of Karo syrup and Velveeta. It's the same.
