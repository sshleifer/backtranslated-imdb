I am a huge fan of the original attack on District 13. The ice cream scene is still haunting me. Now I am 33 years old and I still remember that I scared it as a child. When I heard that they did it, I thought it might be good, but when I saw the movie, it's not 100% the same movie. It's not a remake. It's a bad idea. It was completely destroyed. Cast, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors, but they couldn't save this movie either. It was wrong. Even the setting was completely opposite. And how in the hell did nobody in the city know that there was a war in the neighborhood? Why didn't we show up sooner? Stupid. No sense.
