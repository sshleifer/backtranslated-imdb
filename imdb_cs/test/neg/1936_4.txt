My Take: Even beautiful underwater photography can save the familiar script and paper characters. <br /> <br /> For those who do not yet have enough FREE pictures, FLIPPER can offer a decent rental. Others are (strongly) suggested to stay on. Although FLIPPER is a harmless thing, it hardly shows anything for an adult audience (unless it's the first time you see a dolphin). The remake of the 1960s TV show and movie, FLIPPER may sound like a good idea in the past: dolphin enchants the life of a boy and a girl, helping the environment by getting rid of toxic waste that fits into the sparkling waters of the Florida Keys, while fighting the shark and salty sea baddie, which happens to be responsible for toxic dumping and also happens to hate dolphins. But even in the 1990s, especially if the mysteriously similar movie like FREE WILLIAM was a recent hit, FLIPPER is just another harmless but sometimes empty summer opening film for kids. Although animals (if the main dolphin, a clumsy pelican and a realistic-looking hammerhead shark, cast as a villain) and untouched underwater cinematography steal the show, there's nothing that FLIPPER stole. Br /> <br /> The story is absolutely predictable, and even more than six years old can be more than present. The (human) cast, led by pre-LORD OF RINGS Elijah Wood and Paul Hogan's out-of-work, rarely have anything to do but stand around and look pretty. Their acting skills, wherever they may be, are rarely revealed on screen unless you're thinking of the "acting" talent of Bottlenose. I think I don't try to recommend FLIPPER as a mindless family fun, it won't be fair, but anyone over 10 years old (No, do it 8) is better to rent or buy something else. In addition, the film is about 95 minutes of peaks. This could give you enough time for something else without worrying about your children. This alone is worth hiring. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of 5.
