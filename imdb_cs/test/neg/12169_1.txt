I remember when this show came out. It was originally advertised as a mini-series. At the end of the last episode he said, "To continue" to the dismay of all the people who watched the whole boring for the word thing. It ended as it had, so yes, you can blame the series for having no end. The plan was to have another one if the rating was higher, but it was a boring show for so long and angry people didn't stop when they said it would, so they never did. Some remarks blame his abolition and the lack of an end to the observing public, when the truth is that this show, which is not the case, has ended as it was planned to end, it is just a miserable end.
