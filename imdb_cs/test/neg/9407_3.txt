I'll leave it to my bettors, uhh, better here to look and stare at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that I thought it was okay. The great thing about this site is always to get different opinions, and look for them, by all means. You're not going to say what you get out of the movie. For me, those who have seen through simplicity and shenanigans have my money. One was dead, perfect when he pointed out two great moments of things that belong to Pacin. Meeting and airport. Other than what is a waste of time. Absolutely. Pacino is still doing the same thing over and over again, he would be better served by reducing the performance by about five degrees at his protected level. Everyone always says, but this movie could be much better. Of course everyone could be. But most of them should never be done. Including this.
