In fact, this film was filmed and filmed in 1987, but by 1990 it hadn't. As I watched this movie, I saw the good intentions he had, but I'm afraid there wasn't much talent or experience behind the camera. to make it work. The story takes place in California in the 1890s and some Italian immigrants who own vineyards say they have to leave their country to go through the railway. Dennis Hopper plays William Berrigan, who offered money on the ground but was refused. Giancarlo Giannini is Sebastian Collogero and he is proud to leave and ask other farmers to stand up and fight to keep their land. Berrigan is impatient and hires a lot of criminals to force everyone to relax. At the head of these criminals is a man named Andrews (Burt Young) and does not hesitate to kill anyone who gives him trouble. Andrews and his men kill Colloger one night, and his son Marco (Eric Roberts) promises to try to get revenge and get the country back for everyone. Marco throws out the bridge that the railroad will need and also destroys the tunnel that will slow down the project for several months and Berrigan is now starting to gain heat from other investors. This film was directed by Peter Masterson and besides "The Trip To Bountiful" he has a false career at the best. He's a great actor, but he seems to be overhead. It was a movie that desperately needed more attention to detail and its easy to see that it didn't happen. Roberts Hairstyle is perfect for the 1980s, but it's supposed to be 1890! The cameraman is Toyomichi Kurita, who ended up as a good cameraman, but that was his fourth film, which he certainly did not learn at the time. It's not a sharp-looking movie at all, and I noticed a few shots during the day that the sun would reflect something and the scenes just didn't have the sharpness to help the whole look. The script is just a revenge story and no surprises during the movie. We know Giannini gets it and it just seemed a matter of time. The cast is top-notch and do their best. This was promoted as Julie Roberts' film debut, but I'm not sure if it's right. Before that she could appear in the movie "Firehouse".
