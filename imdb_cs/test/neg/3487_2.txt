Bad news: The Canadian version of Beast In The Cellar, released by Maple Pictures and I saw, was bad. Dark and washed out, the VHS tape seemed to be randomly dubbed. It even skips in one place due to some missing frames. Good news: this movie is so bad that the bad quality of the DVD has disappeared a little from my observation. This horror film cannot build tension and lacks fear. It's a horror horror movie. While most scary movies have limited dialogue, the beast in the cellar is gabfest, so much that the character repeats something we just heard, two more characters said. Probably, all chit chat works as a filler for a very low budget, unimaginative movie. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not enough to be worth the watch.
