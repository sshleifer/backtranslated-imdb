A comparison with the original series is inevitable. It is a pity that Diana Rigg left the original show in the 1960s because of producers' ill-treatment, and MacNee probably regretted it just like any fan - there is no talk about how long the exhibition lasted. Linda Thorson was fine as a substitute, and her episodes still retained almost all the qualities and aspects of the Rigg episodes - missing only Rigg / Macnee chemistry. New Avengers should be left on the shelf - falling Macnee, annoying Purdey, and the one who's the fucking gambit. Also, humor was forced and poor - I granted just watched several episodes because it was all I could watch, but I think I got the idea. Try as many options as possible and it's almost impossible to revive an old show like a new format or movie.
