This is a documentary about homeless women. It was interesting in the sense that it focused on women who are engaged in society - they have jobs and permanent friendships - but are in situations where they can't afford to live. <br /> <br /> I found some women covered. Interesting, but there was little attention or progress in the story. The direction and cut I could not keep my attention. The differences in the stories of these women were of course, but the message was basically the same and could have been said by focusing on one of them deeper. I did it until the end of the movie, but it was a bit boring.
