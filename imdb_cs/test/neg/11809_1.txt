Pre-Nerd Robert Carradine, pre-Automan Desi Arnaz Jr., and nearly pre-pubescent Melanie Griffith embark on a journey and embark on Alaska with romantic dreams of becoming rich salmon fishermen. Well, their dream is as exciting as this small youth movie. It is not particularly interesting and the film does not have too many points, besides: "We have gathered the fry of some famous people and made a film about low budgets about their disaster". From the cannons of the 60s and 70s summer films and rebel youth movies, this film is average, under developed, unrecognizable characters, not very funny, not too fresh to the story, which is as bland as the landscape muddy movies. But for those who care - heading to Alaska, and apparently Alaska was like a wild west in the 1970s, because everyone carries a gun and is rough and fall. Robert Carradine says that charming things like `I hope we can find a shower, my nuts will certainly itch. '(And he is the one with Melanie Griffith!) They are quickly robbed and forced to take the job, and the local grandmaster, their employer, puts movements in Melanie and eventually fires Desi for not being corrupt. This is when they are not smart and do not leave the city, instead of eating dog food or going hungry, goons boys beat him and then bigwigs in the car. The last half of the film leaves the evil superpower when the trio commits a robbery, sets out to escape and portrays a bearable regime, and so on. The film is kind of ending, uncomfortable and ambiguous, but has seen how he didn't bother to have a lot of character and story development in the first place, rather appropriate. It's worth a look if you're really into a low budget of 70 years, but eventually quite forgettable.
