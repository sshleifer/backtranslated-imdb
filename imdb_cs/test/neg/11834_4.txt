Screen treatment of comedy Broadway's success "Gay Divorce" (a title that was considered too scandalous for American viewers, although it was used in the UK) relates to a man and a woman (Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) meeting under awkward circumstances while she is in the divorce process of her husband; they dance, argue, make, dance, argue more and dance even more. Betty Grable is very attractive in a short while (singing and dancing in "Let's K-nock K-nees" with apparently sissified Edward Everett Horton), but the star-couple looks desperate and unhappy. The neighborhood is sophisticated, but the characters are no more than one-dimensional. * 1/2 from ****
