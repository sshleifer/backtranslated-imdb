The man (Goffredo Unger) is found floating in the sea between the ruins of his destroyed ship, near the Florida coast. The helicopter winds it just to reveal that both legs are missing beneath his knees. Dr. Stella Dickens (Valentine Monnier) and her partner, Dr. Bob Hogan (Lawrence Morgant) is a marine biologist of some sort and conducts offshore research on dolphins. While at sea Hogan hears a strange high sound. He was interested and Stella was hired by Peter (Micheal Sopkiw) and his assistant Sandra (Iris Peynado) to create a source tracking and tracking device, or something that was not particularly clear. Meanwhile, a scientist named Florinda (Cinzia De Ponti as Cinthia Stewart), who works in a rival organization called "West Ocean International," is brutally murdered when he threatens to reveal someone in the organization. More people are attacked and Sheriff Gordon (Gianni Garko as John Garko) is on the case. Peter, Stella, Hogan and Sandra set out to sea. Soon they will get proof that something monstrous and very hostile can lurk beneath the surface. Together with competing scientist Professor Donald West (William Berger), Sheriff Gordon and the United States Army, they have decided to destroy the monster, but there are other sinister powers at work because someone doesn't want the genetically modified creature to be exposed at every point. costs! Directed by: Lamberto Bava as John Old Jr. it is far from the classic Italian horror film and the 70's and early 80's film splashes. The screenplay by Gianfranc Clerici, Herve Piccini and Dardand Sacchetti is cruelly slow and allows most people to sleep well before the 90-minute time elapses. The monster is hardly used, much of the film consists of shots of ships and helicopters. Big bits of the first half focus on the not so mysterious "who's behind it". There is no gore to talk to, a guy with both legs bitten off and someone with one hand is about it. The special effects on the monster itself are generally bad and are displayed with very fast flashes, disappointing. The cast of virtual nobody will help to make it easier to sit. It really isn't much to recommend this movie so I won't. Don't bother, you can do much better.
