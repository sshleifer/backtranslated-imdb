First, let me tell you ... Ghost Story .... Hi!?! If any of the other people who trashed this movie from start to finish realized this fact, their reviews would be very different. The fact that the characters were still disappearing whenever the protagonist turned back should be dead. This movie wasn't billed as a ghost story when you rented it in a video store, or a hint, and that's the BIGGEST mistake that the studio that sold it did. It was intentional on their side not to sell it as a haunted story in order to confuse you as the main character is confused as you try to make sense of it. The problem is that they have lost too many viewers; the ghosts looked like "too human and real", without any usual light signs, images, or special effects that Hollywood usually uses to know that you now see the spirit ... and that's what they were trying to do. The main character does not know that he sees spirits and not the spectator. Will you get it now? As long as you understand that the main character sees spirits, then you will understand the film and not be irritated by what is perceived as the main glow in continuity or conspiracy defects. I admit that it was said that it wasn't a good movie, just not so bad that everyone else did it. Just understand if you plan to watch this movie, all you see is "not" always what you think it is. 4 out of 10 for gaming, 3 for originality, 5 for plot and 5 for scare factor, though there were some gore and scary moments. It's still not a good movie, just misunderstood.
