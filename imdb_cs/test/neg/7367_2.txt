The second music has grown (the second from the movie) and it was a trick film hack, I knew I was on a very long ride. Very clich√© - (I laughed a lot and knew how the plot ended WELL before the end) - they didn't use Louisbourg particularly well and the costumes and hair were a little awful. (My special favorite make-up moment is that the only way to trust Depardieu, if I saw it, was to put a wig with straight hair on him instead of a wavy figure. to be massively upgraded to the 18th century score. (ETA: AH, it's the horrible movie guy Patrick Doyle, who's responsible for the score - say no more! Shouldn't be allowed near historical movies - had would adhere to the setting of the 20th century.) <Br /> <br /> "Visiting remarkable people" was also cheerful, especially his little visit to Madame Pompadour, who was not particularly convincing. <br /> <br /> I thought that the only actor who appeared in this century was Michael Maloney as James Murray.He absolutely stole the show for all 30 seconds he was on the screen. Tragically, he saw you what the movie could be. <br /> <br / Love Scenes Have Some Heat - d and the wires were stunning together. <br /> <br /> The most horrible scene for historians is where they are at a great dinner in Britain before Wolfe sets out to pick up a glass and says the first two rows "How does a glass stand around" aka " Why Why Soldiers "Like It Toast. Absolutely unbearable failure in historicity, much better to leave it. Thousands of people know that the damn song and thousands of others believe the rumor that Wolfe and the company sang it (probably drunk, not everyone who is so great). Daft.
