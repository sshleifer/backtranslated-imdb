This movie was really terrible. However, it is worth seeing because it represents the worlds most wasted sex scenes ever. This thing went about 7 - 8 minutes (repeating the same "moves" again and again), that is almost 10% of the whole movie! I must not laugh for so long as I laughed at it for a long time. In this movie there were some really weird and meaningless things, but the one I found the funniest was ever (not why at all) helicopter land and 5 or 6 guys in orange suits running into complex near the end. Two minutes later they run out again. What the hell was that? Also a small white forklift that magically turned into a huge yellow excavator was quite classic. I am led to believe that it is because they used the footage of the "carnosaur" trilogy to correct this absolute ass. I'll have to see you now! The film is worth a look at laughter or two, but if you dont find bad movies funny, stay away!
