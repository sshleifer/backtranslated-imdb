This film was sucked. From start to finish it was predictable. There was absolutely no chemistry between Pearce and the mumbai. The conspiracy did not go anywhere, floating into oblivion. All this made the film very cheerful in its stupidity. And I wanted to strangle Orlando Jones, the guy just has to leave.
