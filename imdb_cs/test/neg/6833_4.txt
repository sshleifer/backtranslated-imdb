The unscrupulous murderer was hired to remove someone at the very top of the US government. He constantly changes his identity and position, he is known only as a jackal. Everything that is on that person is a secret. An FBI Deputy Director who was aware of Jackal's presence, but was not sure of his intention, faces the greatest challenge of his career. To track down this cold-blooded murderer, he and the on-the-book Russian intelligence officer will receive the help of an imprisoned Irish terrorist. These unlikely allies enter a global race against time to stop a mysterious mercenary before completing their mission. If you're looking for a non-stop action movie like Die Hard, then The Jackal isn't your movie. It's a slow spy thriller with many great aids and weapons. Richard Gere plays a good job played by a passionate terrorist who helps the FBI for a deeper cause than just freedom. And Willis is making great efforts like a jackal. OK, but nothing more.
