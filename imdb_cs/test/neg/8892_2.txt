I wanted to see this movie because I liked "Caucasian Plennik" ("Prisoner of the Mountains") and "Brother" ("Brother") with Sergei Bodrov, Jr. and "Vor" ("Thief") with Vladimir Mashkov. Well, unlike other movies, "Quickie" was a complete waste of time. A story that has little meaning, very uneven playing (Lesley Ann Warren was particularly bad), really horrible dialogues, bad cinematography, what else could go wrong? I find it amusing that in virtually every American film, when foreigners who speak the same language (Russians in this case) remain alone, they prefer to communicate with each other mostly in broken English (and when it happens to speak Russian), of some Reason translators feel obliged to add a lot of "f ** pc" in sentences that do not have profanity, literal or non-literal). At the same time, native-English-speaking actors choose to speak in a broken Russian. Why is it? Going back to the story, most of the subplots of the movie (eg Betting a House, Inviting Latin American paramilitary units, etc.), Either makes no sense, or does nothing more than confuse the audience. It is too bad that Bodrov, Ma≈°kov and Leigh (all good actors in my humble opinion) were involved in this disaster.
