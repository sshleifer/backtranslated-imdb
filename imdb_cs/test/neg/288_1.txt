QUESTION: How does the film deserve two different titles like "Librarians" and "Strike Force"? ANSWER: The film is sooooooooo bad that filmmakers couldn't even decide on the title !!!! This film is a hodgepodge of martial arts, death wish-vendettas, melodrama, romance, and other clich√©s of film technique. The story focuses on a vigilante group called The Librarians led by Agent Simon (Wlliam Forsythe). The band is hot in pursuit of a shameful, multilingual, pockmarked creature named Marcos (Andrew Divoff) who captures women and holds them hostage in the legal urban world of South Florida. Burt Reynolds looks like a portrait in this film, and his scene is completely strange to action. Burt publishes a long monologue in one of the strangest draws I've ever heard. This could be Burt's attempt at the Irish dialect, but the overall effect is a kind of perverted imitation of Marlon Brand in "The Godfather". This film also features Erika Eleniak, who has entered the inner circle of the bizarre world of Marcos. Erika's character kicks her way into an alliance with Simon. Librarians and Erik become a strong offensive force against the evil in the film, which was delivered directly from the editor to the cable television converter.
