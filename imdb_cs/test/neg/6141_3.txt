I like the concept of CSI, but the show is spoiled by some serious wooden acting. The medical investigator has the best lines and delivers them in an arc that is a living way that feeds the story. Unfortunately, it has little time on the screen. Also why does Jorja Fox always look and act so unhappy? I know that forensic investigation is a very serious thing, but the characters are largely confusing the seriousness with hopelessness and total lack of personality. I can't imagine it being Sarah Sidle or Catherine Willows; what would you talk to one of them? I'm waiting for an episode when Catherine picks up the remote control at the end of the shift, points to Grissom, closes it and takes him to the closet the next day.
