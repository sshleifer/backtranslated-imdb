Salena Incident is by far the director, Dustin Rikert's best film, who doesn't say much. In his past films (and I use the term "movies" freely), the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and seriously marginalizes them. Salena's incident is no different. The film is basically Con Air meets Aliens done with the seemingness of its average film school production. The film is riddled with shots of outbreaks and plagued by special effects that would have trouble competing with most computer animation classes in high school. For example, almost every explosion on the screen is the same fire that is dim on the screen. <br /> <br /> Poor effects and production value are only threatened by misspelling and rocky dialogue. In the sentence, the story combines itself as an exposition of overused Hollywood clich√©s. The film begins with the worst CGI Alien ship, which has ever hit the worst CGI country it has ever done, and a team of army teams about to investigate. Subsequently, the prison transport bus, which carries the worst of the worst from around the country, is overthrown by prisoners with the help of their blonde girlfriends armed with silicone implants. Prisoners are fleeing and fleeing to Salena, where they meet aliens who ... SHOCK escaped from extraterrestrial prison traffic, carrying the worst of the worst of the galaxy. Prisoners and their captured police armed only with weapons and sad puns must fight the aliens and escape from the city before the International Space Alliance * throws its eyes * into the city into oblivion. The only real fun part of the movie is when actors (who are clearly undermined by the script) are given the freedom to improvise and also when they fight smaller alien creatures in the fire of weapons. In addition, the film is really not worth anybody's time let alone the plastic that is made from the DVD. How terrible was it? Let's say the Defense Minister is about 90 years old, working in a room that's about like a high-tech 1950 realtor and wearing a Looney Tunes tie. Yes, if it wasn't clear enough before, MAN OFFERS ON TENT PENTAGON WITH IT BUILDING BUILDINGS AND ROAD RUNNER. The film basically culminates (HAHAHahhaaa said it culminates ...) with the last remaining soldier running into a group of prisoners and guards, and the new molded team is fighting their way from the evil aliens - which for some strange reason leads them straight back to the Alien ? Yeah ... <br /> <br /> The movie has a heart, but it is riddled with a terrible direction and a worse camera. Someone seriously needed to slap DP and tell him that there is more to repetitive, stagnant chest shots to cinematography. This movie is really not worth hiring (if it ever does it so far) is that it's not as badly bad as the latest director's movies that reduces the laughter-ability, but it's nowhere near the cinema.
