About Carlos Menci (Mr. Holness, excuse me), there were many things that I had alienated. Damn, before Joe Rogan and him went on stage, I knew Carlos Mensteala was beating Cosby and Kinison and many others. In order to complicate the crime of his theft, he read it. comic genius jokes BADLY. And that's a crime that still keeps at this show. I'm sure the series must share some of the blame - it must be hard to write jokes day after day ... but that's why people get paid so boldly to do it! These TV series must return to their daily job of lousy burgers or whatever they did before they decided to pursue a career of intellectual theft. Don't say stealing all your stuff. You can say when he made a joke himself, when what you're watching goes beyond horrible and goes straight into terror terribly wrong. Because he likes calling people b *** h on his show, ten years old calling him a genius. They grow one of these days, Carlos, and when they do, you dry and blow away.
