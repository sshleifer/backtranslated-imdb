Nearby, as well as "Guinea Pig" flicks it was inspired ("Flowers of flesh and blood" or "diabolical experiment") and not to mention any real philosophy, this video feature, which is barely a function of length, adds hardcore sex (with censoring mosaics ) to his inspiration. Special makeup effects that include stomach cutting and disembowelment are pretty good if it is overlit. The amateur feeling of production is a distraction. It all seems cheap and lazy. The lighting is rough and the sound and finish are careless. A simple story involves a porn actress who ends up playing in real movie snuff. Just when he is tired of being abused, actual abuse begins. In the movie hero scene, the actor cuts the female stomach open in a graphic close-up, blending his member inside, and continuing to do his thing. I didn't find the shocking "psycho - snuff coils". On the contrary, I found out that this is a desperate attempt by amateurs for a one-up "Guinea Pig" and his bloody ilk. Interestingly, this was distributed by Aroma, a leading fetish producer.
