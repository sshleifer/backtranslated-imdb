I agree with all the comments so far: This film was a waste of time and energy for both the audience and those who did it. Terrible CGI, terrible scenario, stupid storyline and hey, setting is Alabama, but it looks like California. But the worst must be the Indian angle to that which pulls every stereotype that you can think of, from a boss surrounded by smoke, an angry warrior, people talking without using contractions ("Don't do it!"), Native American tubes playing in the air , etc. It just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that I tore my hair. A Native American with any ounce of self-esteem would throw his television out of the window in this basket. So at the end I would say that this film is largely an insult to everyone.
