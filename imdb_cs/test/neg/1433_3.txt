This movie was one of the most boring horror movies I've seen for a long time (and I've seen a lot). Personally, I liked the piercing taken on it all that was original but different than that it was quite unnoticeable. Dee Snider couldn't act as an actor or as a singer. It seemed to me that he was trying to do everything he said to be an unforgettable quote that they weren't. I can get movies for free and I still didn't think it was worth getting time.
