I know, I have no idea how everyone else lives in puberty, but it doesn't reflect the people I knew and hung around me, let alone myself. And just in case you're curious .. No .. we weren't untouched / clean cut / pat boone teens. (If this happened !!!!) <br /> <br /> See that I'm not a teenager. The better, actually the best teen movie of this time is the "Fast Times in Ridgemont High". Now those kids I knew and were so realistic as it was back then (and maybe now). That was stupid. It was a low-rent version of the Fast Times, and I couldn't do that much then. It had a few moments, but not enough to recommend it, or even claimed that this was how it was for teens in 1982. I couldn't relate. The leading girl (the girls) did nothing for me, and if they wanted to keep their virginity, they should, in which case this film would not be made. Pure crap and a bad core that should be left as a time-lapse cinema for youth / young adults in the early 1980s.
