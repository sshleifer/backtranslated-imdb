Nice visuals and lots of fighting doesn't mean a good movie. And that's exactly what happened here. First, let me admit that I still play FFVII (I intend to order it soon). However, I did research to get acquainted with characters and story. However, not everyone has the luxury of time to investigate such things, and Advent children demand that FFVII be required. Despite the incredible visuals I can't say there's too much. New. We've seen it in Final Fantasy: Ghosts inside, and besides some better movement, I can't say they've done a lot of cool things with it. <br /> <br /> Battle Scenes - Well, it's a little fun. But how could we question the outcome of any of them. This one was incredibly classic - there were three games with the bad guys, according to the standard procedure (hero, Cloud, broke, then almost got there and gets broken and finally wins). The reason I say that it was boring classic was that it was used a lot, but in this case it is poorly executed. I'll touch it later. English oak seemed fine to me, even though I didn't see it in Japanese, so I don't have a Japanese oak judge, but only English. I'll say it - I've heard a lot of better, even in a limited repertoire. And now, the plot. What is this conspiracy? Let me be honest, this movie is nothing but a fan service, an opportunity to see FFVII characters on a big screen with a lovely eye-catcher. As I said, fighting seems to be for no reason. The opening fight will never be explained, Kadaj doesn't seem to have the ambition to destroy the world alone, or any real motivation to do anything ugly. Cloud sits around moping for the entire movie, and almost everyone else gets a mandatory portrait. <br /> <br /> Indeed, FFVII was a file piece. Advent children are different. If they could give everyone an important role in the story (Star Trek: First Contact proved that it was possible, I can add), then it could be much better. Of course, it would also change the storyline, which, frankly, is almost set to be better than the one we have. The characters were also generally either unused or virtually forgotten. Avalanche members (that is, the Cloud group they've worked with in FFVII, for those who don't know it) get 2 scenes (3 in the case of Vincent Valentine, and some even less). Hell, bad guys get more lines than these guys, and that's bad enough. Music ... well, I don't care if Nobuo Uematsu is God Himself, this movie is a great time. Advent One Winged Angel was the only decent piece. Otherwise he couldn't decide whether he would be epic (and orchestral) or entertaining (with an electric guitar). When he moved from one to the other, you felt as if he had taken a hammer on his head. And that last point, whether this movie was epic or funny ... tried to be both, and failed miserably. Honestly, you can't please everyone and do everything. The film also tried to be deep (you can go epic and deep, or fun and deep, but all three are too much), but also failed here. The last scene, which resembles a baptismal ceremony, was thrown there for what it looks like. You don't have to be a Christian to just shake your head and cry. This scene wasn't part of the movie (and she didn't even succeed in relieving Aerith - she's dead Jim!). <br /> <br /> Given how fantastic I heard Final Fantasy VII, this movie is nothing unreal disappointment. Due to beautiful visuals, I give it 2 out of 10.
