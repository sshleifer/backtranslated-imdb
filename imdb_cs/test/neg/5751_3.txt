At the beginning of 'Loggerheads' we are introduced to three pairs of seemingly unrelated characters. To make it even more confusing, we are informed (through titles on the screen) that the action takes place in three separate time series (between 1999 and 2001). It takes a lot of time, but in the end we look at how these three couples are connected: Mark Austin, a young man at the age of 20, gay and HIV Positive is alienated from his conservative parents, Elizabeth and Rev. Robert Austin. Mark is now a drifter and comes to Kure Beach, North Carolina, a seaside town where he meets George (played by Michael Kelly), the owner of a gay motel, and finally joins him. . Meanwhile, Mark's birth mother, Grace (played by Bonnie Hunt) came to a point in her life where she decided to find a son who surrendered for admission when she was 17. Likewise, Mark's adoptive mother also decided to watch her estranged son, when he is missing (despite doubts about his homophobic minister). 'Loggerheads', which we have learned, is based on a true story and perhaps its Achilles' heel. The director / writer Tim Kirkman is trying too hard to create scenes full of dramatic tension where there is very little. Take Mark and George? They are both sensitive souls about whom little is arguing. There is some slight tension when Grace stands away against the Adoption Agency director who is banned by law to give her any information about her lost son, as well as a mild conflict with her mother who denies she disagreed with her when she became pregnant as teenager There are no sparks between Elizabeth and Robert, because a good reverend insisted that he had no intention of reconciling himself with his son. 'Loggerheads' is similar to 'Brokeback Mountain' in that a gay couple is good guys and equal men (such as Kure Beach Cop and Reverend) are baddies. The greatest delay of the film is that there is no interaction (and hence no dramatic conflict) between Mark and one of his 'mothers'. Mark is already dead before he is born, or the adoptive mother has a chance to accept him. Kirkman's theme is both a request for tolerance and a challenge for family members to express their feelings lovingly before it's too late! Kirkman's feelings are largely well-intentioned, but they don't mean good drama. Loggerheads move along the snail's pace without providing any new revelations (or tensions) about such topics as AIDS, acceptance, and homophobia. Eventually, "Loggerheads" fails due to lack of originality.
