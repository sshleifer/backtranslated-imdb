Normally I'm a joke for poor movies, but this thing is lost. <br /> <br /> Don't play this movie. Awful effects and very little humor, what the hell was that doing this movie? No gore talk about what I can't talk about. I could only handle 45 minutes of this rat fall of the film, and that's rare to me. <br /> <br /> Something positive about this drive? cover art was fine, I'm pretty sure the movie is over, even if I didn't. The rats were unorganized and the lines were constantly blowing, lacking intensity and looking only through their payout pace. The actors were worse.
