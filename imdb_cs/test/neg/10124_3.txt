When a naive young Eddie Hatch, a window-wardrobe at Savory's mall, falls on a statue of Venus and gives her a chaste kiss, Venus stepped out of her pedestal and gives Eddie more than she negotiates. This creaking example of what Hollywood can do for the Broadway musical can emphasize the inan story and eliminate most of the premium songs. The purpose was to create a safe, popular movie without undue investment, while using Ava Gardner's mobility up to super fame. Robert Walker as Eddie gets lost in an ungrateful role. Eddie is not just naive but blunt and unhappy. Gardner is amazing, but the only things that give life to the film are Olga San Juan as Eddie's loving but jealous girlfriend, Tom Conway as the great owner of Savory's and Eve Arden as Savory's long time, a wise secretary. It's the role Arden could play in his sleep, and he's good at it. The musical opened on Broadway in 1943 and made Mary Marty a star. But the only point of the musical is music. Because one touch of Venus was intended to be a social satire of sorts, Kurt Weill, composing, and Ogden Nash writing lyrics, came up with a line of stylish, humorous songs and one masterpiece. Without satire, or clever songs or Martin (or the showstopper equivalent), the film becomes only a weak comedy fantasy where much of comedy is predictable and fantasy is treated to death. Not only did the filmmakers throw out almost all Weill / Nash songs, but they brought Ann Ronell to the music director to write new lyrics for one of the surviving songs, a sharp observation of loving romance. Ronell was no hack; Willow Weep wrote for me. He wondered what she was thinking when she replaced Ogden Nash's clever work. One of the clear places in the movie is that the Weill / Nash masterpiece. "Speak Low" is a great song that anyone wrote. It's one of those ultra-professional and inanimate Eileen Wilson Garding Gardner treatments. Dick Haymes contributes the choir. As for Ann Ronell, she was one of the few women in Hollywood to become a major music director, as well as a songwriter and songwriter. Mr. Alley is a fascinating documentary by some of the women who have become involved in the field, including Ronella, Kay Swift, Dorothy Fields, and Dana Suess. And for those who want to hear what little of the Weill / Nash score was recorded in the original Broadway cast, you may be able to track the CD, One Touch Of Venus (1943 Original Cast) / Lute Song (1946 Original Cast). The music is paired with Lute Song, another Broadway show that played Martin.
