PERHAPS SPOILER !! Well, I saw it at the Cologne Film Festival and I must say it's ridiculous ... Excuse the author and writer and ... anything, but it's the worst attempt to make a good movie I've ever seen ... if u got 5000 times the opportunity to get away from my enemy and don't do it .... its boring ... there are szenes in the movie witch gives the impression that they are forgotten eg szene in front of a security camera, asking for help and someone seeing it and calms the police ... before there is a cut and .... nothing? ... killer gets shot in the head and 50 seconds later acts like nothing happened ... no one of his zombie movie ... and finally the final ... BIG END we promised. hmmmm, say, take a little guy who always wanted to give the world one of the best ends in history so bad that everything goes wrong .... im not going to vote "1" because the actress is beautiful ...;)
