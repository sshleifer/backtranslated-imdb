Does anyone else think "Reba" is basically a "Roseanne"? Just look at characters from both families, Connors (Roseanne) and Harts (Reba); blonde bomb senior elder daughter (Becky Connor and Cheyenne Hart) who is married to moron (brand Healy and Van Montgomery), sarcastic brunette younger daughter (Darlene Connor and Kyra Hart), little brother (DJ Connor and Jake Hart), and \ t unpredictable relative (Jackie Connor and Barbara-Jean Booker Hart). And then, of course, there's the greatest resemblance, Reba Hart and Roseanne Connor. "Reba" tried to copy the sarcastic and harsh love in fashion style without giving her the same kind of qualities as Roseanne. Or maybe he * loved her * too much, because Reba Hart seems to be confused about being average and scary (so Van's line to her wife Cheyenne "I'm not afraid of you, I'm afraid of your mother!") And be sweet and caring with a small transition between them. At least she had managed to get through being cruel to be kind because she was always serious and sarcastic, and whenever she tried to open it was hard for her. As opposed to Reby's character, it's hard to be believable. But even if the characters weren't completely ripped out of "Roseanne", nothing could save the show from the pod on the desktop. Writers try to show substance, but in fact they can't release corny jokes long enough to make any impact. And you'd rather believe that jokes are spoiled; it is as if they were written by a 12-year-old who thinks that any joke is merry. While sometimes they come out with something funny (not pretending not to be on a few episodes), these gems are too few and among them are "Reba" funny. Overall, "Reba" is a very average show with obvious ripoffs "Roseanne", subpars and sub-sub-par humor, and (let's face it) terrible acting. The show may be a little better, actually, if it replaces all the actors, especially Reba herself, which is better than community theater than the quality of the first-class sitcom. I give it 3 out of 10 to be fair to good jokes.
