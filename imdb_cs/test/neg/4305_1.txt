He rented this tonic from my local video store. It was called "The Black Horizon". I think somebody felt it was good enough to re-release 2004 ... <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, Micheal Dudikoff is a ninja in this film, one of the major shortcomings of this film right on the bat. Another major mistake would be that Ice-t's action scenes are stolen from other films, particularly the first scene of his rescue, which is directly from the Wesley Snipes movie "The Art of War," with Ice-T edited in. Paid for this record. The plot is terrible, special effects have had little effort in them (the love of those wires that keep them in space), the acting is wooden (also love those New York / Russian accents). Ice-T in the movie is useless. These guys also forgot the fact that there is no gravity in the universe, but I think they didn't care. Micheal Dudikoff should return to what he does "good" and make American Ninja 6.
