I haven't evaluated anything here for a while, but after I had the misfortune of sitting in this waste masquarading as entertainment, I had to put forward my thoughts. Normally, however bad it is, there is one redemption part, be it an actor who was fine, a scene that was passable, an attractive member, or a general feeling. Unfortunately, this is not true because the film starts ominously, with an absurd shootout that was so poor, I thought it was a practice, and two halves, otherwise known as boys in a blue cottage next to a school. Br /> <br /> One of these idiots was Daniel Baldwin, who not only played in this, but also in fact controlled this waste, and unlike his brothers, he cannot act for caramel. Not that he was alone here, because everyone in it probably belonged to a dramatic chimpanzee drama school. Fortunately, for me, I was just looking at the hour of this masterpiece. The DVD wouldn't work, and it was probably made by the same fools who made it. So if you have nothing to do but look at the dry colors, look at it as boring and ideal for getting rid of unwanted guests.
