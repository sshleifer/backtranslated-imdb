But it is not so. The story is not so bad, the actors are not all terrible, so it should be decent. Instead, despite the good starting point of the conspiracy, it only pulls and suffers from a lot of those that "I can't believe it's so stupid" moments so often used in horror movies to keep things going. Sometimes it frustrated me when I watched a lead character's decision. It also took too long to get into the good part of the movie. Expectations are great, but you can't spend more than half the film that builds it. Too bad because she has a good exposure after the release and hit just before the big Halloween season. Even so, I feel that it will have at least one sequel, if not more, so they may be able to build on a strong general conspiracy to eventually release something decent.
