I remember years, Michael Douglas wanted his wife, Catherine Zeta-Jones, to be in a romantic movie because he felt his wife had all the goods. No doubt he does, but not in this movie. Colossal waste of time, no story, no character development, no chemistry, nada. This was not the vehicle we all hoped that this film would be boring and a huge disappointment. He didn't even watch the whole movie, torture. Apparently, Catherine Zeta-Jones was trained in working in the kitchen, moving around, presenting food, but this was not a food network, nothing was learned here, and once her counterpart appeared, the brewery's romantic interest in chemistry was. The bad man on the second floor of his building is trying to combine all the tricks and do not develop any character there. The loss of the nurse was wrong because she knew there was proximity. Sister's daughter was right here and there with something to draw you, NO. Just a loss of film time. The organizers have certainly done their job to make this lack of luster film on all the networks that attract you with all sorts of puzzles. I'm sorry I don't have time.
