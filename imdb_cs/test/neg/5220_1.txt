This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. What they thought. Stop preaching to me! That's why we're all following the Texas Ranger Walker and getting used to our friends. Terrible dealings and extremely fake conspiracy. As the film unfolds, the story stops and the actors begin to preach to the audience. The headmaster somehow believed that they were both well connected. It looked like bullshit! When I saw the title on local blockbusters, it looked interesting. It should have been a warning that it was a religious site of fake advertising action / adventure. For the first time in a long time I stopped the movie and I couldn't tolerate it.
