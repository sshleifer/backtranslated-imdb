Christopher Lambert brought me to this movie. What a shame! The plot has more holes than my string vest, special effects were not very good, the power to find out who the creature's mother was, and the creature owed more than a small debt to the Predator. Anti-climatic this film could be done much better. However, it raises one interesting point. When will Hollywood discover the rich genre of European folklore, is it just waiting for it to be mined?
