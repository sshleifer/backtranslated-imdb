All the adults had a lot to live up to and there was a lot of hype when this show was announced. Now it is easy to explain why it did not meet expectations: First, this exhibition failed to create a realistic world of preschoolers in the way Rugrats captured toddlers' world and imagination. Second, character characters are stereo-types (Angelica: a white spoiled blonde unlike Suzie: a colorful girl from a modest family, ...) or boring (Tommy, Chuckie) and annoying (Dil). Finally, there is neither an ounce of innovation nor an original plot. To sum up, All Grown Up is a waste of time and a bad idea for continuing the series to show such as Rugrats. It's boring, lacks imagination, and manufacturers don't even know how children aged 10 to 13 behave. To be precise, shouldn't Angelica and Suzie compare the size of bras rather than fight for who's better at work?
