Perhaps, like most of the others who have seen this film long after the TV premiere, I wanted to see many of my favorite actors in the old and obscure form, which is exactly what 'Slow Burn' is. Except for the nostalgic value, the film itself is not very good. Eric Roberts plays former reporter Jacob Ash, hired by Gerald McMurty (Raymond J. Barry), a wealthy artist to explore the location of his estranged son Brian, who lived with his mother, Laine (Beverly D'Angelo) ) over the last few years. In Phillip Marlowe-esquire's fashion, Jacob Ash tells what would become more than just investigating Brian's stay. But as Jacob follows Laine, his discoveries break many problems. Perhaps because the events in the movie are moving too slowly, there is never too much pressure on this little thriller, nor at the end with the final routine of uncovering the culprits and their motives. However, as said earlier, this movie is probably the one that will attract attention for its then-relatively unknown cast of actors that include both very young Eric Roberts, as well as adorable Johnny Depp, who plays Lain's stepson, Donnie. This may be enough reason to try ... if you find it.
