I believe this film was a terrible waste of my time, and I would know that after I watched it five times in class. this film does not show what has become absolutely perfect in these times. No one can really say that these things have become a letter. if it were the only good part, they would be actors, even if they were really bullshit. quite boring. I'd rather play at school. so I'd definitely never like to see this movie again in my whole life. it is a complete waste of time if you do not want your time to be wasted and if you would like to see an unrealistic view of what happened in 1981.
