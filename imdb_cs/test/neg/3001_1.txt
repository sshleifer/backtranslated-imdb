'Northfork' is what's wrong with independent movies. For all their hard comments and attacks on large subjects of study, there is no sacrifice we make. For almost two hours, I was subjected to torture and pain in the film, which begins with wandering as a blind person in a new place and ends without covering any new place and, fortunately, dies. There are parallel stories that detail the dying city and the dying boy. Two men dressed in black (one of them James Woods) must force the remaining Northfork residents to leave before the dike opens and floods the city. The second story has a boy returned to the priest (Nick Nolte) that gave it to his parents. He dies and I think angels visit him. Among them, Anthony Edwards with bizarre glasses and Daryl Hannah in a bizarre costume that reminded me of a Seinfeld pirate shirt. Although it is a conspiracy, it's not about the movie. The film is about nothing. He does nothing, says nothing, leads now and has nothing interesting. Perhaps by design, but by the subsequent effect of the pretentious, surrealistic mentor David Lynch - we are an important artsy film that you do not see - a style of direction. The whole film is filtered through a gray, bleak backdrop that, in my opinion, fits into a film about death. Instead, it just makes a movie that's much harder to watch. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about men in black, look at the movies "Men in Black" or too impressive, but compared to "Northfork" "they're raised to" Citizen Kane ". If you want to see a movie about a dying boy, Lorenzo's Oil. If you want to see a movie that has the destruction of the city by water patrols, O brother, where are you? If you want to watch a movie better than 'Northfork', there are hundreds. If you want to watch a movie that is worse, there is only a handful. 0 * of ****
