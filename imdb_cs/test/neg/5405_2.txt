Scientist Charles and his wife (or assistant) Marissa accept some items and a skull from an ancient Indian cemetery and are attacked and murdered by a mysterious creature, the Skeleton of Man, when cleaning the vase. Then the military commander, Captain Leary (Michael Rooker), searches for two groups of four soldiers who have disappeared into the jungle. Facing Skeleton Man, shooting him as he kills every soldier. Then the skeleton goes to the power station and Captain Leary explodes a device that destroys a supernatural being. I bought "Skeleton Man" on DVD with the expectation of witty waste, but I found horribly boring, unpleasant and absurd crap, shoots and explosions. The story of the imbeciles is totally disconnected and makes no sense, and the military team is made up of imbeciles who insist that they shoot the supernatural Skeleton of a man until they are completely defeated. Their leader is also the stupidest, with the end of the explosion of the whole facility ending up to destroy the supernatural burst of the Predator extraterrestrial warrior. On DVD, you can use fast forwarding along the film to reduce viewer suffering. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Skeleton Man"
