This movie is so bad it's funny. I was looking at Hell Ride half thinking it was a comedy, though I couldn't quite work if they actually used p * ss, or if it was a serious attempt to do something decent. I have noticed that he is not listed here as a comedy, so he must be serious! Basically, it seems to be a group of gangs of retirees who ride motorcycles and shoot at each other and exchange the poorly bad dialogue you can imagine. One scene inexplicably has two figures breaking bottles over the other heads, then displaying each other 'getting out of jail free' cards they did! See also the accent of Vinnie Jones, where is hell coming from? Oh, and there are also a lot of naked girls in there who, for some incomprehensible reason, don't want anything more than to stop with these chinless guts. Whoever wrote it and directed it - Pee Wee Herman lookalike with Greeshan 2000'd bear and orange suntanning - threw himself into the lead role for some reason, maybe it's part of a joke, I don't know. Actually, the more I think about it, the more I'm sure this movie is p * ss. It is made by Quentin Tarantino and it is possible that he released it in humor as a little laugh. It's a total rapture of Tarantino's style, but he really did a really bad job. It's very fun, and I think that one way or another it could go as a cult classic, either from a fun parody of the Tarantino / Rodriguez style, or something that's unintentionally funny. It has to be seen to believe it.
