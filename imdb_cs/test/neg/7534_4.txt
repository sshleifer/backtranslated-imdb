Think of the extremely low version of "Heathers" and you have "Pep Squad". This is summarized in a brief summary. However, I have to give credit when the debt is due. The film has a nice visual appeal. I liked the cinematography, I liked the wild color schemes, I liked the costumes. But without good behavior, the film has no redeeming value. I'd rather watch a movie with little visual appeal, good actors and a sharp dialogue (ie: "The Brothers McMullen" or any Edward Burns movie). The actors either recite their dialogue in monotones or cover them as if they were in a bad series. That's why I don't have badmouth most of the mainstream actors. Let's face it, most of the mainstream actors are main for some reason. If they are not "big" actors, they are at least competent. People badmouth Leo DiCaprio, but when was the last time you saw a movie where he recites a dialogue as if reading it from a page? It's a shame because the director seems to know his stuff when it comes to mis en scene (sp). At the same time, I cannot fully praise Steve Balderson (director). He wrote a screenplay that contains some horrible dialogue. He could also be a bit racist, because there is a black director in the film who lives in the culmination of African-American stereotypes.
