That's a bad movie. I do not deny it the way I want. Tommy Lee Jones is about as good as he can be with the scenario they gave him, and he had a couple of decent action sequences that really felt good about their acceptable quality. Somewhere along the line someone found that all the script shortcomings could be suppressed if they were to hire every single actor in the business, unfortunately, indeed, deeply talented actors like Goodman, Beatty, Sarsgaard, Gammon, Steenburgen, MacDonald, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and let's not forget that Mr. Jones himself is unable to fix the wooden dialogue and portray a course that has not led anywhere. In fact, I looked up in one place and I'm sure the movie was up and running. in the last 2 hours just to find out I was 51 minutes. Perhaps the most painful point in the film was a subplot about the soldiers of the Confederate spirit who seem to be of little use. story. Other than slightly downplaying from a confusing business at the end with a picture. * If you haven't seen this movie, read this past statement, which may seem irritating and know it isn't, you won't understand it better after watching the movie. The most interesting thing about this movie is that it is actually a sequel to "The Prisoners of Heaven" starring Alec Baldwin in the same role that Tommy Lee Jones carries in this movie. Maybe I'll have to watch it now, first, to see if it's as bad as in an electric fog, and secondly, because (no matter how hard I try to), it doesn't seem to break my man crushed to Alec Baldwin.
