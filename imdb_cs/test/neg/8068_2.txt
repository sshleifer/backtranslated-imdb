so if someone meets you and he says, "I want you to look at my erection!" don't worry, maybe he wants you to look at a movie he made about how his house is to be built. Yes! this is the only thing that happens in this movie! it's like the worst Warholian BEEP I've ever seen! it's like shooting the inside of your toilet before you flush it, in fact it's less interesting to look at it than it is. but if you follow Lennon's erection, be warned he has given a lot of background noise as well. Indeed, it is as if the building had been attacked by space mutants from hell or something! In the meantime, the ongoing construction is growing, because the erection can also do (in almost 20 minutes, what a success). <br /> <br /> so if someone asks you to follow his erection, make sure he wants to record it all.
