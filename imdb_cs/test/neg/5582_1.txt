It's incredible how the movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being nasty. For those of you who appreciate careful special effects and unimaginable details in every shot, you'll watch this movie in awe. Simply because Predator Island has nothing to do with it. It's a redundant remake of every horror monster movie over the last two decades. Now I appreciate the bad horror movies that have a light atmosphere in the most dramatic circumstances. However, if your goal is to create an unforgettable job that will be buried in the Cult Hall of Fame, then my first suggestion is to find some imagination / creativity and get some talent. Oh, and a few more dollars you could put into your picture. One of the horror traditions was to shock viewers by violent deaths and gore. However, the shock will not last longer than a few seconds. In order to induce a satisfactory response from paying the crowd, characters, some identifiable features, should develop. I know, you probably say that this guy doesn't give anything to filmmakers intelligent, he just mentions an amateur note. Well, that will show you how amateur these filmmakers are. Despite the horror of watching this movie, it was a silver lining. The performance of Dan Gordon as Chris is wonderful. He has nothing to do in the script, but he can still look like a star from the movie. Of all the actors, he is the only one who believes in what he is giving. Not only does it provide the audience with whom we can identify, but we also have someone we look forward to going through the rest of the film. Gordon shows real talent and the ability to pull out quality work and overcome the huge obstacle that the rest of the cast is. Dan Gordon will be a star, sooner than later. That means if he manages to get movies like the one that holds him back.
