First, I just want to say that this show could do well, better than now. What it brought was certainly acting. Miranda Cosgrove, acting as Carly's main character, looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on Drake and Josh. Unfortunately, iCarly was a big downturn. Not only can Miranda not act convincingly, but she is incredibly stiff as she moves. It looks like he's not sure how the "carly" character moves or stands. In the first episode at the end, when throwing a hat up, her hand never leaves her side from the elbow up. even as she danced, she looked like a stick in the wind. And singing? The theme song was great, just because Drake was in it, the music was pretty good and Miranda's voice was fake. I have to admit that the plot and settings are good, unrealistic, but hey, it's Nick. They are practically known for silly lines and characters. But wow, iCarly is the worst of them all.
