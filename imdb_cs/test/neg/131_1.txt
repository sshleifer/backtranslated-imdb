Breaking Dawn begins at California College because Professor Simon (affiliate producer Joe Morton) tells his students that he has to conduct an intensive six-week study of a psychiatric patient in Cape State Hospital as a key part of his education, failure and will never be qualified doctors. A bright, young, attractive and intelligent student named Eve (Kelly Overton) has a particularly difficult patient to study. His name is Don Wake (James Haven) and is a doomed killer, except for a woman's dead body (Diane Verona) and her young daughter (Jenette McCurdy) found in the blood. At first, Don didn't even mention Eve, but just like the Eve soldier, he's still trying to figure it out. Finally, Don starts to talk, but what he says scares Eve, says someone is watching and mentions the name Malachay. Eve then begins to see a dark dark figure at every turn, when Don spews conspiracy theories and the bizarre statement Eve slowly begins to lose his mind as the line between fantasy and reality becomes more and more blurred. Is there something extra with the alleged nonsense that Don speaks differently than being a mad fury of a psychiatric patient ...? Written and directed by Mark Edwin Robinson I have nothing but negative feelings about Breaking Dawn. Now we love a good ending, an end that catches us in unpredictable things, surprises us, works well with the rest of the film, and remains in our memory as the cool ending of the Sixth Sense (1999) & Fight Club (1999) to a lesser extent, the end of films such as Scream (1996), where the identity of a killer comes with a pleasant surprise and is not so obvious. Then, of course, there are films whose end spoils everything that went before & as an example lets take it, oh I don't know, let's say Breaking Dawn, because I've never seen such a horrible end of the movie, never. Breaking Dawn starts out as a decent psychological horror thriller with scary things that are beginning to become Eve, not a movie that is most action-packed, but it's not the most captivating movie about what's in it. more than traceable, and it's not such a bad movie until the end is over, I have to mention it, because everything else until then (which was okay to be fair) suddenly becomes insignificant. I'm sure there are people who think that they have this confused mess of the end that was devised into the last detail, all I can say is that no one will be able to explain this thing in a satisfactory way. because I'm concerned, it doesn't make sense and will never be. Breaking Dawn is crap and it's a waste of time to watch how rewarded it is that lamest ends in film history, it's as simple and straightforward as that. Director Robinson does not initially do what could be a decent thriller, maybe he thought that what he shot would play fine, or it could be destroyed in the editorial office, but I would imagine that it was most likely on a trash scenario when trying to make all the absurdities together in a few confused minutes and give us everything happier than a happy final shot. In the first 80 odd minutes it puts tension quite well, but at the end of the day it's all up. The technically broken dawn is fine and is generally well done. Acting is pretty good, Overton is nice and easy on the eyes and gives a decent performance. It was just me or the one who played Don, he looked like John Morghen's star of such Italian sleaze classics as Cannibal Apocalypse (1980), City of the Living Dead (1980), House at the Park (1980), Cannibal Ferox (1981), Stagefright ( 1987) & The Church (1989)? OK, maybe it was just me ... Breaking Dawn is a waste, I hated it all for a few minutes. Don't get me wrong, it made me so excited, but it was OK. Definitely one to avoid when it comes to me, though it seems to be a fair share of positive comments on IMDb ...
