I was cheated to watch this many friendly reviews here. Boy, they're out of the way! To be 9 to 10 points and call it "one of the best films of the 1990s," it is simply unjustifiable. The big problem is the lack of tempo and paper chart. It's like slapping on Prozac. Everything stretches predictably and thoughtlessly. The Beginning Is Weak - Two Apostates are Watching Their Neighbor, Witnessing Murder and Deciphering the Conspiracy - and the movie can never get much further. There are some fun situations and decent gameplay, but it is nowhere near to save this jalopy movie. your time?
