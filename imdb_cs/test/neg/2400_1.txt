The creators neglected the connection of dots - the sequence of events and possibilities that led from Charlie Wilson and the anti-Soviet mujaheddin to Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden, and finally to September 11th. Of course, filmmakers neglect to tell us the story - why were the Soviets in Afghanistan? - but this omission remains in comparison with their inability to reveal that support for Islamic extremists in Afghanistan in the name of angry anti-Communism has finally strengthened the arm of anti-Western forces and has been a major factor that has contributed to the disorder we are facing today (9/11, terrorist networks, long-term ground war in Afghanistan, etc.). As these consequences are not clarified, the film leaves the viewer feeling sympathetic to Mr. Wilson (hey, check out his latest projects on the internet) instead of seeing him as an individual whose actions were contrary to his country's best interests and The West as a whole.
