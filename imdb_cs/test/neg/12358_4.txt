I caught this movie - under the title "What Lies Above" - ​​on Lifetime Movie Network last night, and just had to comment. Designed as an inventive woman-in-danger yarn action adventure, it is so unintentionally funny (thanks to a large part of Marc Singer's scenery-chewing hammy performance) that I thought I was watching the cross between "Cliffhanger" and "Home Alone 5." Heroine Nicole Eggert makes her malevolent, but stupid when spy pursuers look like the Three Stoogs are subject to her ridiculous makeshift pitfalls (in some way she manages to think of a rocking hammer with a rope and a logo to temporarily tear one clan out to kill her ). It's worth a look at hearty laughter.
