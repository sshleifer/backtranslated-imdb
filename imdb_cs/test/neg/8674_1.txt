I'm not a purist Jane Austen, but why do a film like this if you have nothing to say. Billie Piper was so bad it was hard to know where to start - bad personality, modern makeup, absolutely bad hair (by no means would a young lady of her age have to go public with her loose hair and uncut like that, it didn't seem too humble, nor should it be used to it. he did not understand why everyone considered her to be particularly holy or kind. Picnic (replaced by a ball) was so low budget that it was embarrassing to watch and completely ignore the Portsmouth section. Destroyed the point of the piece (as well as losing scenes that could add a bold counterpoint to this oh-so-claustrophobic pink living room.) <br /> <br /> Responsible: -If you don't have imagination do something meaningful with adaptation, please don't pretend to be pr Oducing Jane Austen. It was about 10% Mansfield Park and 90% not much at all <br /> <br /> PS Edmund was very good
