The only reason I gave this movie 2 and not 1 because I for some reason felt compelled to finish it! Basically, I wanted to find out if there would be any alien, any UFOs, anything that would be designed by the movie title, film cover and the beginning of the movie! I was very disappointed to see how religion was thrown into the mixture as it was. This could be used for a film advantage, but instead I felt that the movie was trying to send me subliminal messages! Finally, how big was this wardrobe! I became a scattered number of different and extremely bright shirts that each character had in every new scene I was wondering if this film should be classified as a "bad comedy". <br /> <br /> finger thumb down!
