In the evening I watched this movie on video and found myself in this uninspired snoozefest. First, one of my biggest pet peeves is when movies like this are characterized as horror movies. It's a DRILL! He has no monsters or anything supernatural. It's just a movie about a twisted serial killer (it's actually a very small number of bodies, so it's rather a series of torturers' movies and has done a good job of torture.) The basic premise of a man who attracts teenagers to his house of horrors through an online chat room would they could do it for a big movie, but we see him just lure one pair of teenage girls over the internet at the very beginning of the movie. One of these girls turns out to be the daughter of a local detective and is emotionally involved in the case. The film quickly changes from a potentially intelligent sadomasochistic thriller to a boring old cat and mouse game between the incredibly boring detective and the psychopathic Captain Howdy / Carleton Hendrick played adequately by the writer / producer / Twisted Sister, Dee Snider. Occasional attempts at meaningful poetical one-liners about the positive effects of pain and the like from Snider are ridiculous. If he tries to get people to come up with these views through this film, he fails and unintentionally makes them light. John Pieplow's director (whose only previous directorial effort was Jurassic Women who let the title speak for itself) was unnoticed, and with the adjustment that resulted in the film being disjointed with several totally unrelated scenes, something was wrong. The plot if the scenario is not to blame (which is quite possible.) This film a completely unsuccessful attempt at a thriller trying to go through as a horror movie that is just a success, it was me frowning at the sight of several graphic body piercings. If you see it in your video store, don't waste your money, but if you need to laugh at one night and Strangeland is on the cable, you can also watch. 3 out of 10
