Despite this being one of John Cusack and Demi Moore's early films, it is one even hardcore fans can miss unless they absolutely must complete the collection. I have rare moments when I can do Better Off Dead, but this movie is worse. I'm not just a Savage fan Steve Holland, and he did both movies. So if you don't like cheese, random comedies and amateur animations, avoid this. FYI even for Demi Moore fans: she can't sing and 80's synthesizers didn't save her. There are too many predictable twists and too easy jokes. I suppose if you want mindless fun or something you can leave behind and ignore when doing something productive then go for it. Otherwise, don't take this movie. If John Cusack (or Demi Moore) couldn't save him, you know it must be bad. It's the only reason I didn't give this movie 1.
