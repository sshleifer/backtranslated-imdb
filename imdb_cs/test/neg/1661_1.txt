I understand that the budget was low on this film, but that's really a horrible movie. The script is just awful and that was the free part. The effects are not bad, but this film takes place as a conventional R-rated film with lame scares and shortened violence rather than not holding an unrecognized gore-fest that was deliberately created for video. Who were the boys kidding? Like it was released in theaters. Acting is terrible. Editing, the next free page of the film, is beyond amateurs and the storyline, as I said, leaves little to be desired. There is nothing original about the film. Gore fans, avoid this. For filmmakers: next time try something original or stop making movies together. You're not good at it. People hate kitschy rehash, especially such a caliber. AVOID! It's not even fun.
