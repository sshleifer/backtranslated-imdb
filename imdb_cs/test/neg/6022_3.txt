This film was an absolute waste of time. It's nothing but a gangster movie. It contains a very predictable graph. My feelings are unsympathetic to the characters and dialogue is at best average. Half the time you're looking for something else because the movie is boring because you already know what's going to happen. The second half of the time you desperately hope the protagonist is going to grow into a couple of balls or just end his life by jumping off the bridge or something. Secondary characters are also largely one-dimensional. None of the characters in this movie have any depth! No depth!
