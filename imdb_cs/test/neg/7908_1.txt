I hate to comment on something I didn't finish, but if I let one person sit down for almost an hour before I shut it down in disgust, it's worth it. I decided to watch it with an open mind because I knew it was 100. <br /> <br /> Bad idea. I usually like rough humor, or at least I can tolerate it. I like the so-called "black" comedy. I'm not so offended. It started fine and went down quickly. I laughed a few times (for example, when the main character got stuck in the plane of the plane), but that was what I didn't feel. when the dog got into the jet engine. Usually I can't see the humor of dying animals (except the animal house). I wasn't even too ugly. I turned it off after a blind man and baked potato incident that I don't care about repeating details, just that the wave of nausea hasn't crossed me yet. Simply put, it was smut-filled and just not funny barely any conspiracy. This is one of the times when when you don't have something nice to say, you should get the word out. Don't say I didn't warn you.
