New celebrity deathmatch is terrible. They kill popular people and win low budget celebrations. I mean ... Andy Milonakis? Lil 'flip? Lil flip and Lil Wayne should both die. The fight between Lil 'Jon and Lil' Bow Wow and Lil Flip was MAD Corny and Short. They should just kill all of them. Why did Tobey lose to Jake and the Christian lost to Adam? are better actors and superheroes. They also spend too much time speaking than fighting that can carry viewers. Everything is rushing for some reason, can't they fight so long? old death death is much better.
