Perhaps the target audience of this Disney Channel TV-movie will be pleased with it, but if parents are watching along with young people, they will clearly see that the "cranked out" is written throughout this production. Obviously, it was no dream to make this film, but rather it was invented in the meeting room somewhere, then produced with cool efficiency. There is some talent among the cast, but actors like Dabney Coleman and Jay Thomas don't have much chance to show off their talent. Incredibly cute Elisabeth Harnois is engaged as the first daughter, but Will Friedle gets stuck again while playing another stupid character, though not as torturous and uncomfortable as the "Boy Meets World". The basis of this film is Washington, D.C. and the White House, but there is no real "presidential" feeling that the film and the secret service is made to be slightly better than Keystone Kops when it comes to its duty. Disney Channel presents many original TV movies and most of them are better than this.
