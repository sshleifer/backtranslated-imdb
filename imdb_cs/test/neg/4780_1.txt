The scariest thing about Carter Smith's new horror movie "The Ruins" is the final title featuring comedian Ben Stiller as one of the executive producers. What Stiller thought when he sank his money into this cooler about the cursed carnivorous undergrowth that floats on the victims and engulfs them. Oscar-nominated Scott B. Smith from "Simple Plan", who has customized his own best-seller, is stuck to the standard clichés and conventions of all twenty different terrifying sagas, where ruthless youth do everything, only those signs that would beg the forces of evil, to eat them. . We were specific characters who were not enough to deal with this nihilistic nonsense as another film where American tourists are in danger simply because they are Americans. In addition, unlike the really good horror movies that explain why monsters need to feed, the "Ruin" doesn't provide any explanation for the supernatural Shenanigans of his villains. The Set-up for "The Ruins" resembles the horror movie "Turistas" in 2006, when slimy South Americans imprisoned an intrepid American backpacker in America and harvested it for their internal organs. Indeed, "Turistas" generated some legitimate excitement and chills. "Ruins" do not find anything in the form of excitement or chills. The malicious mastiff, who is suddenly lurking at the camera to growl at our heroes, is as close to getting excited. The rest of The Ruins borrows from another film, "The Descent," a superb cooler of 2006 about a lot of girls immersed in a nightmare experience when lost in inhabited caves. albino mutants with blood desire for murder. Several other films that either served intentionally or unintentionally came to mind. It is a straightforward classic horrific classic of the "Lost Continent" of 1968 about the murderous vegetation that threatens innocent bystanders in the sea of ​​abandoned ships and the iconic Roger Corman class "The Little Shop of Horrors" (1961) about a New York florist. a man-eating plant in his shop .. <br /> <br /> "The Ruins" is developing in a picturesque, sunny Mexico, where four frolicking American high school kids, Eric (Shawn Ashmore of "X-Men" movies) Stacy (Laura Ramsey of "The Covenant"), Jeff (Jonathan Tucker of "Sleepers") and Amy (Jena Malone of "Pride & Prejudice") wrap their tequila with a wet spring break. Stacy loses the prized earrings at the motel, but a useful Teutonic, twentysomething tourist Mathias (Joe Anderson of "Copying Beethoven") restores him and embraces him as the newest best friend. These people live at a party and have become friends with three Greek tourists. Mathias tells them about his grumpy brother, who was accompanied by a cute female archaeologist in a distant Mayan pyramid that is not included in any guides. It offers to take them with them and accept them. The first rule of horror movies: if no one knows where you are going, you should avoid it. With only one day left and nothing adventurous, our two couples, together with their Spanish-speaking Greek friend Dimtri (Dimitri Baveas newcomer), decide to follow Mathias and check the pyramid. They catch a bus to the interior of Mexico and are looking for a taxi to get them on the next leg of their trip. The taxi driver looks at their map and warns them to stay on. The second rule of horror movies: when natives warn you to avoid, avoid. Sharp twenty dollar bills help him change his mind, and he takes them to their destination and then rings. First, our heroes will find a mysterious Mayan pyramid covered with undergrowth, which looks suspiciously like the Mississippi kudzu in the jungle than the superstitious natives. They know the pyramid is scary, and they kill Dimtri without trying to dispel their fears. The remaining protagonists climb to safety at the top of the pyramid, while paranoid natives surround them to prevent them from escaping. Finally, the vineyards slip out to greet our heroes and eat them. At this point, "Ruins" turns into a "mistake," a recent and ridiculous Ashley Judd schizoid film about insects that gets under your skin. Before long, our heroes carve each other in vain attempts to remove vines from under the skin. One particularly horrible scene shows Americans trying to save their lives. By comparison, the torture of the Spanish Inquisition looks tame. "Ruin" ranks among the other vines with nothing to use them.
