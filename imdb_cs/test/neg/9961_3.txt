The scientist (George Zucco) wants to make American soldiers wolf men to fight the Nazis, but he is described as mad. He uses the simpleton gardener (Glenn strange) to experiment by mixing his blood with the wolf's blood. Strange, constantly inserting its dialogue with Lon Chaney Jr. In "Of Mice and Men", he has no idea what's going on, just that he walks. Victims begin to accumulate (including a little girl who might be more disturbed by modern viewers and two of Zucca's competitors). There is some good dialogue about how one would not mess with nature (still prevalent today) and play God. Zucco's motives can be honest, but his methods are the most controversial. And then there is his daughter Anne Nagel, who is nice to Strange, but has no idea of ​​her father's deeds. Johnny Downs is a reporter who gets on the wrong side of Zucco by asking him, but wins Nagel's heart, creating the usual and always boring romantic subplot in classic horror movies. In 77 minutes it is about 15 minutes longer than usual in the early 40s horror movie (especially one from the PRC that released the movie), so the romantic story could be cut off at a cost and a little faster. . Zucco, fortunately, is never hammy; This was left by Bela Lugosi (who has always delicately wrapped himself in a theatrical manner that admired the audience) and Todd Slaughter in England. But try not to think of the "Bride of the Monster" lab when you look at one Zucco works or some of Lugosi's dialogue in this classic cult film. "Mad Monster" lacks cult following because it's not badly bad, it just has boring stimulation in more than a few places. For PRC and Monogram lovers, I would recommend "The Corpse Vanishes" or "Fog Island" higher than this
