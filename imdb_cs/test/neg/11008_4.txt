Although I found out that acting was excellent and the cinema was beautiful, I was very disappointed with the adaptation. One important part of the novel is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill, rather than go on. This is never mentioned in the film, it shows it as a toboggan accident. Character changes in Mattie and Zenna hardly exist. While in the novella almost changes places, at the end of this adaptation seems to be both invalids. Finally, Mattie and Ethan complete their relationship almost almost destroy the finale's power and honesty. The change of narrator who was a preacher was one effective change. Neeson and Arquette are excellent in their illustrations. Joan Allen was also amazing, but her character was much weakened from the Whartons novel. I do not expect movies to portray novels faithfully, but this has gone far and almost destroyed the story in the process. <br /> <br /> Overall, I wouldn't recommend watching this movie unless you read the book, bewildered and disappointed.
