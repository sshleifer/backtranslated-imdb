"I didn't laugh at this because my grandmother got caught in the wringer," says one of the potheads in this cheerful quasi-spoof of all those Val Lewton and George A. Romer films we (or hated) depending on your personal taste) over the years. <br /> <br /> In this story, a young couple of actors play ghoulish prank on the rest of their ensemble after, one haunted evening, visiting the cemetery island. Their artistic director, Alan, pretends to bring the dead back to life by performing a very stylized ritual. <br /> <br /> The way too much time on the screen is wrong; amateur dialogue contains lame witticisms, melodrama, and other kinds of unnecessary comments (Alan can't stop the irritating laughter ... too much!). Once the action (which is close to the end of this film) comes, it's worth waiting. This was what I saw on a TV show that took place at night, at a local station where the movies were very similar to this ... just scared me at the age of 13 ... but then again, you can laughing at your way up to the bitter end ... ... which is probably why very few people still wear striped hips today.
