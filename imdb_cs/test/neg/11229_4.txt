If you're in the mood to laugh with a really bad movie (bad in the way just Ken Russell at his worst can be), you have to try this one. You will be able to feel like you have just landed in a 0.25 porn-stand, and you can just feel the urine on the floor. Kathleen Turner is stretched out in a blonde wig, getting "pretense" kicks that is a double hooker (she has a really good job in the clothing industry and men are so hurt that it's the only way she can do it) Tony Perkins plays a hysterical "priest" who is beyond maybe her killer (yet another movie that ends with Tony Perkins in drag). Annie Potts appears and is not allowed to provide an ounce of her usual joke, which is why she hates this movie. Kinky will love the sex scene, so rent a UNrated version in the RED field so you can see that Turner gives the cop a taste of his billy club (I had to pause the VCR until we stopped laughing).
