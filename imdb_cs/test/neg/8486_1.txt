This film is a real shame, not just for conspiracy, empty performances of characters, it's due to the lack of creativity from the director and all crew members, it is perhaps one of the worst films of all time and it is hard to believe it is the continuation of one of the most famous films 90. flight. I'm a great fan of The Mask when I went to see this movie I was waiting for a movie with a good sense of humor, a movie with an acceptable plot, instead I saw a really bad copy of the cartoons of Chuck Jones and Tex Avery , the movie wasn't even funny for my 7-year-old sister, so I wonder: What's wrong with New Line Cinema He tried to repeat the success of the first movie, or tried to create another masterpiece like Lord of the Rings, because if they did, they were completely out of mind.
