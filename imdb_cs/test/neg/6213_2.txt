This movie was recommended to me, so we went to see together. I wouldn't say a movie, it's a combination of 10 different unfinished, illogical stories that aren't so fun. There are several characters in the film that seemed to be important in the beginning and just disappeared from the story. Just trying too hard to fit everything in 2 and a half hours. I left the show without wondering what happened to this and that guy. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is just an extended version of "Hitch", which has many more characters and dances. <br /> <If this is the best movie ever made by this couple, I'm sure none of his previous ones are interested in me.
