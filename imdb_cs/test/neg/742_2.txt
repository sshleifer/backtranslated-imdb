I'm afraid I didn't like this adaptation. When I started watching it, I had a strange feeling to watch the 70s TV series because of the filter and the music score. I didn't like the end of the scene. Mr. Tilney seems to be dressed only in his vest. Jane Austen should never drive a gentleman out without a coat. It looks like manufacturers have made a modern, bad interpretation of a romantic girl's dream. I appreciate the much more modern JA adaptations much more that pay attention to these details that make the BBC series so valuable. Sorry, we look forward to the 2007 adaptation. I hope it will be better and will show the benefits of a 20-year adaptation of Jane Austen.
