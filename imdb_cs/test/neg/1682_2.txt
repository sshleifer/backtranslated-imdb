I present the show six because the show was actually a platform for Damon Wayans, because the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby, it dealt with a lot of humor problems and I felt that it was actually tailor-made. Laughter, unlike letting jokes come from character. Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and wise person. There's PHENOMENAL in the movies, but there was a wisecrack in the show, and although I loved it, I felt that laughter was more important than credibility. Jay Kyle loved her from the House Party and enjoyed her at Daze and Martin's school, a big role for her and she made a great choice in choosing this sitcom to become a star. I also feel that Jay and Michael were just the same in the series, but Jay was more of a woman who fed her crazy lines to the line and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she could feel it worked <br /> <br Jr Just plain stupid, his character should be well developed and even if he has his moments of greatness, we go back to stupidity, as if he had learned nothing that forces me !!!!!!!! Not to mention that most situations (in the episodes I have seen) seem to focus around him. Clair An attractive sister who dated a Christian, I found her friend's character more interesting than her. (It should be better to stick to movies, writers should do more to show her intelligence, but it's not stereotyped enough.) Kady Dear and youngest daughter. I think the writers have stood up most at the show aside from their parents and Franklin I LOVE this character and I think they derived it from Smart Guy (T.J. Mowry), which lasted only one season. They did a great job of casting for this little genius (an effort would be made if Jr was smart but to point down also the sides) <br /> <br /> All in all, this sitcom is a wonderful thing and it's a tribute to the Cosby Show is well I did, I like the show and wished it stayed longer than that. I can't wait to see the series finale
