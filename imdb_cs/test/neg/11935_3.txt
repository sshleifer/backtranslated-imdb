I think I should now comment on the fourth film in the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN group; the continuation still surprises me or impresses them with their sleaze and deliberate _absurdism. They represent or create a fourth way, not a classical, not a revisionist, not a European, but a slimy American, related to the 70s violent films, absurd garbage. This installment is also a bombastic sleaze - inexplicably unpleasant and even somewhat strange. but that fans just don't feel any difference between the original style and the sequel ‚Äù. These sequels aren't boring or shameless, but bizarre. They are, of course, very poorly written scripts, trash. It's crazy; in this installment will every shooter receive several women? Van Cleef, a young woman, begs to release a young prisoner; finally yes. The young man continues his life, shoots Van Cleef, kidnaps a woman, rapes and kills her? Van Cleef, who had previously refused to help defend the village, is now building a small party and charging hacienda to the perpetrators of the criminals; then the offenders charge the village where Van Cleef set. <br /> <br /> I liked the cast. Van Cleef is Chris; Stefanie Powers, very active in the 1970s, is Van Cleef's darling. Callan, a very antipathetic, is Noah, writer and Chris' sidekick. The rest of the aggressive bunch is Askew (one of the three survivors), Armendariz, Lucking, Lauter; Rita Rogers is really hot, fleshy beauty.
