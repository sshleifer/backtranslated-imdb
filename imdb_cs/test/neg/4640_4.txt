The next day - this film requires you to watch it the next day to understand it. I was very happy to watch Shannen Doherty and I was quite interesting when I saw Julian McMahon and Shannen appear together with the roles they played in Charmed. Certainly PRAISE acting throughout the movie, even directing - but conspiracy ... what happened? I'm losing words because I'm still confused. I have to stay loyal to the actors who really did a good job of plotting the madness. I also have to advise you to look at it because, despite the conspiracy madness, I would have watched it over and over again.
