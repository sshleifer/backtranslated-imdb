I can't imagine how anyone who really read the secrets of M. Didio Falco could make them ridicule. Aussie has no work in ancient Rome. None of these books are in this film, except for the settings and characters, and are wasted on a plot that is thin enough to read a stupid script. Kevin Connor and Lee Zlotoff have a lot of nerves showing their names in credits.
