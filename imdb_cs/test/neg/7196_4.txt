At its core, it is a fairly typical Western revenge, heavy on spaghetti, and if you follow it, the protagonist goes through a successful defeat of the main villain. However, there is so much going on that it has no influence on the story that you need to care about what filmmakers think about it. I mean things like the way Miss Rosie just emerged from nothing and a boxing match in the middle of the city. OK, they have a loose connection with the villain's influence Mash Flanagan has, but why he suddenly appears with an alias - Mr. Donovan. On the other hand, I thought it was quite innovative, as the camera shot on Wallach's wounded view of the trail could be filmed by someone with a real bullet in his shoulder. And wasn't that a great way for Donovan's girl to use her old routine when she gets a little awful? Don't let me forget either the stunning gravel work, such as the Wallachian weapons that are in the final. But I still didn't do one thing and I was waiting for the whole movie. Whatever happened to the trio of hoods that Flanagan / Donovan hires at the beginning of the picture? You know, that guy Martel, who wanted to hire a funeral home for his weaponry, the devil's Mitchell rifle, and the Lincoln Tate knife thrower. Each one had five thousand dollars per head, and they were supposed to protect Donovan from the guy who survived the opening scene massacre. They've never heard of them ever since! I like to think Donovan let them kill them and keep 15K for himself.
