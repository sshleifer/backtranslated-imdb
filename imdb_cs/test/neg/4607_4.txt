An excellent cast that does the best with a terrible scenario, awkward direction and some of the worst results I've ever heard. More TV movie of the week than a serious drama. Which is sad when we realize that the source material is very serious and very real. The filmmakers decided that instead of creating drama and character, it would be better to show only the graphic and violent pieces and hope that the audience will be shocked by the sympathy and care. In my opinion, one of the most distinctive forms of film cutting and insertion adapts.
