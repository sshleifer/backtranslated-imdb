As metaphoric flies fled from this water that was in the water, I found myself eager to join them. <br /> <br /> From the introductory sentences you can quickly find out that the actors are talented. The script was probably dead and the director should be. To be honest, I wasn't able to finish this movie because about twenty unfortunate minutes in front of the main actress who threw herself on the floor like a Shetland pony who was shot in the ass was too much for me to keep his stomach. I've never seen a movie I've never seen, like the sweaty one, and I'm watching tons of crap. <br /> <br /> Turd.
