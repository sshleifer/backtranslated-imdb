Okay, I had to sound like this ... Like a huge mental gimp I just sat in this movie as a whole. Note that the tiny section of the IMDB points out that parts of the 747 rise have been "borrowed" from the 1977 airport. It really isn't scratching the surface ... Virtually all the external shots of the plane that flies through the ocean landing, sinking, and even on - airport shots are borrowed at '77 airport. All "flourishing" shots are downloaded from '77, including most internal flooding clips, except for Dennis Weaver's drowning. I couldn't help if I wondered if Olivia Dehavilland could ever float, or maybe "dead" Tom Sullivan. Another Eye Roller: Dennis Weaver's name in this film is Stevens, which is supposed to compensate for the fact that the airport plane is owned by Stevens Corporation (led by Jimmy Stewart of course). It's a real calval of actors who don't work too much, or at least don't work for a while, which might be the first guess that it will be a real stink. I rated this movie as 2 - It's Worthy "1", but if this movie can't offer any other quality, at least someone helped Coolio, Max Caulfield, Nicolle Eggert and Dennis Weaver to make their payments for the car Moon!
