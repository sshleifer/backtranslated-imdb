Wow, there are no words to describe how bad this movie really is. I am usually proud to have enjoyed any movie no matter how bad, but it was too much. I would recommend just watching this movie as a torture device. If you can get through the horrible plot and dialogue by looking at the silent, even more horrible camera work, and the awkward special effects make this movie a real horror. If your thinking about watching this because of your Sandra Bullock fan, don't bother because she has less than ten minutes of screen time, and her actions are absolutely cruel. Not to mention the rest of the cast that could be replaced by baboons who would have a better job, at least we wouldn't have to listen to the horrible dialogue.
