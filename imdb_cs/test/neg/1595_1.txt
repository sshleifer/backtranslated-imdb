If I could rate it zero I would, coming from someone who likes the shock / exploitation of time movies and Waters overall I have to say it's useless. It does nothing, serves nothing, the idiot with the camera and the urge to prove its cleverness by defying social standards, it's all that happened as. His absolutely amateurish, both in principle and in execution, has no meaning, his ripping for disgusting, obscene with a Neanderthal joke, its useless. Someone said Waters is probably "laughing" through all the bad press and disgusted others have given up with this movie, but why? If I made a short film depicting a man in a bathroom who would equal ten minutes, it would have the same accompaniment, but why would I be proud of it or "laugh"? It would be because I am so unintelligent that I have to resort to this so I can say "HA! Take your censors and mainstream! Im so rebellious sick doing what I want and movie it!" No. Waters should not be proud of this mess, water fans should not look at it, its uselessness, that is, without use. they don't even fall under the art criteria for art. <br /> <br /> To defend or defend this film, there is something that has been deliberately designed as an anti-culture that would be promoted to the mainstream audience in modern terms. This movie is a hot topic of movies. <br /> <br /> Unnecessary and outdated. Poser's film, which requires him to be recognized as a rebellion.
