How do you make the story of one of America's most famous authors a totally unpleasant film? Check out this movie and find out. Maybe I overcame the author Carson McCullers, but I was impressed with "The Heart is Lonely Hunter" and hoping for something memorable too. Forget it. Vanessa Redgrave looks like a man with short hairstyle and clothes. I've never found her so much to be thrilled in almost every movie. Rod Steiger as a Preacher? How insulting is it? Unlikable characters one by one. Well, maybe it's also a book and I'm unfair to this movie. I'm not familiar with the story other than what I saw on the screen and it was such an annoying movie that I could never recommend to anyone. It's just one person back after another in a backward city. There is nothing to recommend here and there besides the nice cinematography. How anyone could sit over 100 minutes of this is amazing. <br /> <br /> I'm not even going to how bad it is driven. It's good news: it was the only movie that Simon Cowell directed.
