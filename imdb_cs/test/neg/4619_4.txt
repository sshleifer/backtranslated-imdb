It's not a great movie theater. The film is cliché and in many places it is a copy of the original Carrie. Parallels with the original film are striking, but with the added improbability that telecenetic forces are innate. I can't say I didn't like the movie because it took at least a couple of hours ... but it was passed as if you were reading an unpretentious book about a long train journey. This book would not be a great literature, but it would swallow it for a while, and it would soon be forgotten that it would connect with many other clichés. Likewise, the movie was fine while it lasted, but it may be forgotten. At least I think it is. I can't remember a lot about it now!
