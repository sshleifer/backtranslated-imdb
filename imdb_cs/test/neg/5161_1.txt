This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thank God I saw it for free. I would hate wasting my money on it. First, there is no character in the movie that is by no means likeable. Michael Caine is coming, but he's too bad. The rest of the "commando" consists of disgusting ex-cons. There are two gay Arabs and three guys trying to rape a red cross nurse, and a "leader" who has no trouble sending his men away to kill himself so he can escape. mission is something exciting. They have to blow up the fuel dump. Sounds exciting, doesn't it? Well, the footage is followed by endless sandstorms and flat tires. Yes, you read it right. "Tension" is whether spare tires run out. In fact, we're watching them change something like 12 bytes on the way. This is how incredibly exciting this movie is. They get to the fuel dump to find out it's a bait. So blow up nothing. And at this time, for some very complicated reason, the British army decides that they no longer need these people, and radios their whereabouts to the Germans to kill them. So now at least we'll have an exciting race to freedom? No, instead, they decide to blow up another fuel dump to make a diversion. But when they get in place, they go on a trip and the Germans come to pick them up - and speak through the speaker. <br /> <br /> Really special. If the Germans knew where they were and where they were going, why had they allowed them to get to the dump before the "trap?" Instead, they wait until they reach the fuel depot, and set all charges. Yeah. Right. That would happen. So throwing out a dump, the leader sells out all his men - except for Michael Cain, because he was offered $ 2,000 to get him back alive. OK ... so all the men are betrayed and killed, and Michael Caine and Nigel Davenport survive. British soldiers come with tanks and decide to save. Because they are wearing German uniforms (they wore them to blow up the dump), they tied the white flag around the wand and left for the road. Some British boys go after them and machine guns to death. Credits roll. Yeah. The two "heroes" of the film die as a result of an accidental act of violence. It's almost as if the movie suddenly ran out of budget and decided, "That's a wrap. Go home." I lost 2 hours of my life and watched this tired, unimaginable and utterly unrealistic movie that ended with the grace of a bomb.
