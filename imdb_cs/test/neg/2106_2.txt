Really, really terrible. I don't even know where to start. This is a perfect example of a movie that doesn't know what to do with yourself. I'm not sure if I could determine a category myself, except I'm sure it's a slap in the face of everyone, everyone. Even unborn. Sometimes I thought I was watching a parody or some kind of farce. Sometimes just a bad B movie. But I kept out for porn, which, as I'm afraid, is almost (but not entirely) nonexistent. <br /> <br /> Someone recommended skipping to the end. I'm sure I would scare the emotions. The last five minutes is intense and certainly contains some of the best movies / cgi you have ever seen. Ed Wood would be proud.
