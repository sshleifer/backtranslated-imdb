This movie was horrible that it was as if he was watching gay porn waiting for girls, but they just don't come .... I waited almost 2 hours for damn scarecrows .... just don't come .. It's just some stupid ass that wandering through a dead cornfield with a camera, it's a mixture of Blair's witch and some bad episode of the twilight zone. And the best part is that since October 23, 2005 they started filming the sequel, please don't be fooled by the box, even though it looks just like the first dark harvest that is not the lion's gate bought corn rights: the movie and had a great idea to release it as a continuation of the original dark harvest that I thought was funny ... the only thing they had in common was that they were both shot in a cornfield. Movie WILLLLLL doesn't scare the crop of you first, so just keep moving !!!!!
