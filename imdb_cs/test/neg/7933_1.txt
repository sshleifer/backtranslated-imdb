** Possibly spoilers ** ** hard to spoil this thing more than it is, but just in case ** Gee can't see how anyone could like this re-make !! It was like "made for the T.V" show and it was still lame. Lots of fake snow, bad starring, bad action and crazy pine forest in Detroit. What the heck??!! I really didn't think it was a great movie, but I was hoping it would be fun. No, we fell asleep in the middle and we had to finish it the next day. I could easily skip the rest (but then I'd miss those great forests!) I'm so glad I missed it in the theater! Wrong enough to lose $ 3.50 in the video store unnecessarily. And I'm a lover of cops, action and drama. It was very smelly of 1 out of 10 stars. Give me the original day !!
