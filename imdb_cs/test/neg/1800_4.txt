Heart of Darkness Movie Review The heart of darkness of Joseph Conrad is pretty dark, deep and deep. I would have to say that the novel is better than film. Mr. Kurtz's character, played by John Malcovik, was an absolutely bad actor who did this role. He adapted the character "Mice and Men". The film has missed key parts of a man that I consider important to get the true message of the story. <br /> <br /> The movie is poorly edited. It shows a lot of non-important and unpleasant flashes. She has a very exciting atmosphere in the novel, but she lacks such a feeling in the film. There is so much in the book that was left to the reader's imagination. For example, when Marlow spent his timeless hours waiting for rivets and the whole scene was left out of the film. In the novel, Marlow waited very long for rivets to come to fix the ship. That was a great source of futility in the novel. The film added other parts that were unnecessary and made little sense. For example, when Kurtz talked to Marlow at the end of the book, and Kurtz barked the monkey's neck and killed him. This all destroyed everything, it didn't make any sense to me. So my suggestion doesn't show you a movie, just read the book. You will understand more and you will have a better interpretation of the story. Chris C.
