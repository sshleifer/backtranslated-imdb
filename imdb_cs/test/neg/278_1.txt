That was the biggest disappointment of the movie ...: (Sucks, what I really enjoyed it. <br /> <br /> All the twists were stupid. be surprising, so the audience is overwhelmed, but if you go and go, bulls! what's the point? /> The main attraction was the bag you didn't want to see, but you didn't see the team who would work on his deceptive and brilliant potential, and there wasn't even one good robbery in this movie! it was done in at least one other movie .. and that was stupid then also ... <br /> <br /> There is no reason why even HALF should be from 12 or 11 in this movie. the cast for the result of this movie? The first one was elegant, this was the CHEAP, and the whole team loses credibility. Especially the ocean itself for bowing Bennett.
