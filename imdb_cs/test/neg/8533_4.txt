This film has all the components of a great horror story and loses it in the last half. Several movies actually give me cold bumps. This one. Few horror scares me. This one. It should have guessed. I took care of the story. I took care of the characters. The meeting was decent. Unfortunately, probably in the middle of the movie, the story just doesn't have many good directions it can go. Obviously, everything that is amazing on the plot will destroy itself. That makes. What he puts in the first half as a great horrible concept is from horror to absurdity. A plausible fear turns into a series of unlikely characters' reactions. The story ends in disappointment. Although this movie seems complete, there is one free end that could be for continuation. The film is not good enough to continue. This movie is worth seeing in the theater, just don't expect you to be amazed. This is best suited as a movie for rent. It's probably not a movie you want to own.
