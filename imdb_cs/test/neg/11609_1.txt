After sitting in this divine horrible 82-minute apology of the movie and wanting to avoid my eyes after watching the other James Toback's "When I'm Beloved", I came to the conclusion that she had the best agent in the world. How else can these terribly written, painfully directed pieces of garbage be produced first. I like Robert Downey Jr., but maybe they've led him to substance abuse in this movie. Heather Graham has to be embarrassed about his zombified performance. Half the time the camera is on it is simply looking into the crowd. Such a crappy scenario. Get ready for a Hollywood Hollywood name (example: a five-minute meandering discussion about Denzel Washington's acting, etc.) <br /> <br /> A great character in the Joseph Heller Catch-22 novel Dunbar. Most of the time he spends in a novel for the shooting, which abhors. When they asked him why he was shooting all the time when he hated it, he would say it was CREEP time, and he would have a longer life. Well .... if you really want to feel the time crawling, watch this movie! I swear ... 82 minutes will feel more than 4 hours David Lean epic. It goes on and on and on and on ... <br /> <br /> I hope I'll never watch another James Toback movie. If I could give this NO STARS, I would.
