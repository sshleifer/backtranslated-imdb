My, my, my: Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance were desperate to work for their talents. A terribly confused story about Satanism in modern Greece, the Land of the Minotaurs (aka The Devil's Men) is an omission at more or less every level imaginable. Has a rare pair of scares (always a slight mistake for "horror" movie, don't you think?); poor performance; countless scenes where the characters silly roam themselves or refuse to stay safe; and some somewhat irritating editing techniques that don't add anything to control. I was prematurely excited about the prospect of Cushing and Pleasance working together 17 years after The Flesh And The Fiends - but this film is no longer worth the excitement; It's a huge downturn and rather embarrassment for its much more valuable leadership. In a remote region of Greece, missing people as tourists and archaeologists are still missing, and local priest Father Roche (Donald Pleasance) suspects something sinister. He writes to his friend, New York's private eye, Milo Kaye (Costas Skouras), to ask him to fly to Greece to help him get to the bottom of the mystery. Meanwhile, three other visitors - Beth (Vanna Reville), Ian (Nikos Verlekis) and Tom (Robert Behling), all of Roche's personal friends, have lost their lives walking around the surrounding ruins. Milo eventually comes to Greece, but is initially doubtful about Father Roche's belief that missing people have been caught for Satan victims. Milo and Roche's father are also joined by Laurie (Luan Peters), a girlfriend of missing man Tom. Together they reveal the activities of the cult of the minoan devil worshiped by the haunted Carpathian exile Baron Corofax (Peter Cushing). These crazy cultists sacrifice their victims on a statue of minotaurs. Seemingly, they cannot be killed by normal means, so Roche's father must use various religious artifacts to combat them. The Land of the Minotaurs should have been much better than they were. The land is so insane and unlikely to have all the distinctive features of a pleasantly wacky cult / favorite camp. But manipulation is just terrible. Director Costas Carayiannis has no idea how to combine the story in a coherent way, so the whole thing proceeds as if it were on a daily basis. He has no idea how to convince the compelling performances of his cast so they can be embarrassed by either the horrible hammy (Pleasance, Cushing) or the horribly amateur performance (Skouras, Peters). Worse still, the story doesn't make sense. Why should Roche's father seek help from a private eye that is totally exaggerated about his faith? How does Roche know that victims are only full-moon? How can a Minotaur statue speak? Why is one of the victim's victims instructed during the vision to print Father Roche, just to stab a few scenes later on before he gets a chance to do so? And - most of all the confusion - why Father Roche pulls Milo halfway around the world to help him when all he needs is a crucifix and some holy water to get rid of the bad guys? These questions - and others - appear in your mind during the Land Of Minotaur .... but, unfortunately, there are no answers to be. Frustrating, stupid and disappointed!
