Shamballa's conqueror shows what happens when the Anime creators can't understand what their fans want. As a fan I didn't want the 1920 Evil Nazi film. What I'd like to see is a real final showdown between Ed and Dante, because we don't really know what happened to her. I would also like Ed to return to his world much earlier and let him stay there to finally get a chance to be normal. You know, raise a family with a blonde mechanic, something like that. No, instead I got a convoluted conspiracy with Nazi mysticism, Fritz Lang, and about ten minutes Al, Cameo Roy Mustang's joke, and just one Armstrong joke, one short joke, and no Winners who hit Ed's key. Above all, it didn't seem like Fullmetal Alchemist.
