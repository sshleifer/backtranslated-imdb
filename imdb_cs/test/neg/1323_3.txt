The East War, as the Germans referred to the WW2 Soviet-Nazi conflict, was a war of destruction on parts of Germany. 90% of the German army fought in the Soviet Union. Their ultimate goal was to exterminate the so-called "sub-human (Untermensch)" Russian population and colonize a predominantly empty country with German settlers after they won. <br /> <br /> Read "Hitler's willing executioners." Here we have the German army presented as innocent victims and not as Nazi mass killers. When will modern German filmmakers be honest and face to face with the past? Better to see Russian movie "Come and see"!
