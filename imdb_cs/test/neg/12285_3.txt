The First Watched 7/7/2004 - 3 of 10 (Dir-Brett Thompson): A silly film about teenagers about three children who got involved in their favorite movies with their parents' experiment. The scenario has left many successes in this Hanna-Barbarian, such as Tearing up live action with dinosaur costume people in a children's show on Saturday morning. Nothing like that. I'm just overwhelmed when I found out in the Video Market store as bad as it was, and the way stores get rid of old VHS movies. I think they couldn't even sell it, so they returned to the rental stand.
