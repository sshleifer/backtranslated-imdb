This line is a good summary of this movie. If you read it and watched the movie for 20 minutes, you will know exactly how the rest of the movie will behave. Some researchers named Surgei (pronounced SirGay) seek hell in Moscow's underworld. However, he seems to have disappeared and his friend Oven follows the team to look for him. Could they find a more boring conspiracy? Some bad actors take care of an old man underground. Acting is very bad, romance really feels nonsensical and untrue, often there is no good reason for the characters to behave, nothing is scary and most of all: nothing interesting in the whole film is happening. They just walk, ask some gang leaders and other guys to go, walk even more, complain, find an old man and then run and finally find their way out of the underground. The only thing that gives me this lowest movie of all ratings is the atmosphere. If you want to see a movie, it may be a good choice. It's dark and it's mystical and dark. However, the rest of the movie is really boring. You are sitting there all the time, waiting for the movie to start or something that is happening. It's actually happening some things, but they aren't very well done. For example, I didn't notice one of the characters disappearing, and I swear I didn't sleep or anything. And I don't understand what's wrong with these kids ... They're just running underground, scratching the walls with chopsticks (I think it's supposed to be scary) <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you need an instant atmosphere.
