This film was beyond horrible, it was a pimple on the film industry. I know that every film can't be a hit or even a mediocre one, but the responsible parties that have come together for this epic bagpipe should be able to see that they have a time bomb on their hands. I can't help but think the cast would be among the scenes and consoling each other for being in such a massive pile of dung. Can I hear it now, "Will you" get paid? "" No, you? "I understand that this film was more than likely in the shoe budget, but even what was taken into account could still be better. it big yawn.I'm so angry at myself at spending 1.07 on this stinking !!!
