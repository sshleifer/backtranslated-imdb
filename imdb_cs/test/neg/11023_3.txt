Since I bought the DVD, I've watched as much of how I did it from my commitment to my wallet. secretary, she falls in love and marries her. Complications arise. Douglas is usually considered an intense actor who is given a strongly dramatic role, sometimes to heroes, sometimes to rats. It's not bad in this thoroughly comic part. The problem is that this part is not particularly comic and nothing else. Ten "quirky" characters come and go - most notably Keenan Wynn as Douglas's friend who does nothing but make notes. Thelma Ritter was better at that. Well, if the conspiracy is weak, it could still be saved by some spark in the dialogue, but there is nothing about it. Some gags are stupid. Others will not see the bar. Here's what I thought was a fun line. Douglas has just hired a day and wants to get her to the beach house and seduce her. The day is disturbed and notes that she has never heard of a writer working in a beach house. Wynn asks if she liked Douglas's previous book "Love of Last Year". Yes of course. "Well, most" Love of Last Year's Love "was done in a beach house." Ha ha. Nice cast, including support, but unsuccessful comedy. There were better sitcoms on TV.
