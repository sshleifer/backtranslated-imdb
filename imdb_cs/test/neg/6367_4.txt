This year's Eurovision was a great disappointment for me. I've been watching the Eurovision Song Contest every year since 1986 (well, at least that's the oldest I remember, and then I was just 2). Like every other year, this included good, bad and terrible songs - nothing new. However, this year's show was the worst I remember. Very few good (probably more) songs and lots of absolutely terrible songs. Turkish winning song "Every Way That I Can" sounded like a rip-off of Turkish singer Tarkan's hit "Simarik", just sounded much worse. I didn't deserve to win from my point of view. The Belgian song "Sanomi", coming in the second, was a song without languages. What will be next? Animals sing? However the music for the song was quite catchy, giving the song a kind of dreamy feel, to which "words" seemed appropriate. One of the best songs, but it doesn't say much. <br /> <br /> After one of the closest races in the history of the Eurovision, the Russian duo t.A.T.u. only three points behind Turkey and behind Belgium, with "No Ver", "No Boisia" ("Don't Trust, Don't Be Afraid") in third place. by letting some of the most shot girls of all women contestants .Let their song talk and if we ignore the fact that they failed to play several times in the first choir, they let the song talk very well. <br /> <br /> The biggest chance for this song was the bookmakers here in Denmark - a song that was really horrible - but it ended up in 8th place. Could it be the boom of his shock to the rhythm of the song? my family laughed most, not because it looked good, but because it seemed so stupid that it was actually fun. <br /> <br /> Sweden did what they do best, ABBA. Take Me To Your Heaven ". In 2001, they produced the top 10 with" Listen To Your Heartbeat ", again sounding like ABBA, and again this year they did ABBA-style, once again in the top 10. <br /> <br /> England was eventually Punished for having these absolutely horrible, non-hunting songs that have been in recent years. Ireland tore the 2000 winner, "Fly On The Wings Of Love". And I could go on and on how bad the songs were. I feel a little sorry for Aussies, who this year got the chance to see the Eurovision Song Contest. They deserved it better than this. However, I was not surprised by the show. The 2000 Eurovision is one of the best in recent years. 2001 was pretty good, but not so good. 2002 was fine, but certainly not more. This year was simply disappointed. Hopefully next year will be better. If not for us, then at least for the Aussies. <br/> <br/> 4/10. One for t.A.T.u., one for a close race, one for blunt friction and one for all others.
