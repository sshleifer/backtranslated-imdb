How to round off all possible clichés and stereotypes existing in the horror genre and then stuff them into one massively crappy movie? Answer: "Camp Blood". This is an amateur slasher nonsens on the micro-budget and a little too obvious inspired by "Friday the 13th". Four of the most unbearable teenage characters you'll ever see? are they like a combination of ugly, stupid and annoying? go camping and quickly find himself chased by a killing maniac in a clown suit. Don't even ask me what the killer's motivations were, or even who he was, because if it was in the movie, I totally missed it. This is one of the worst films ever made, without inspiration or craftsmanship. The production values ​​were so sad that there are actors playing more roles without bothering to be unknowable. The only semi-decent and valuable sequence throughout "Camp Blood" is the opening in which the impressively sensual Meredith O'Brien has sex in the woods with his strange scout. Yes, I am fully aware that this is a totally shallow note, but then it's a youthful and retarded movie, so who cares?
