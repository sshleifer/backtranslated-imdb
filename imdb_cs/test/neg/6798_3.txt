Poor Diane Arbus (whoever she was). Not only was she (according to this film) a spoiled but sweet-looking upper side East Side, she was a bad woman, a bad mother, a horrible business partner; Moreover, there is no evidence in this picture that she was an artist - except for a bold statement in the prologue. Nicole Kidman, who is incredibly attractive today than she was 25 years ago and actually looks younger, really delivers excellent performance; But what can an actress do with a wife and mom looking for and falling on an incredibly strange werewolf-looking guy living in the apartment upstairs? In the early 1970s, Manhattan was a virtual magnet for freaks and freaks of all sizes and shapes. So why is this matter worth 122 minutes of film? Robert Downey Jr used to be one of my favorites, but I think his well-known and long-term drug use has taken its toll. One might think he would be in a movie that treats drug use, carelessly, as well as cigarette smoking. FUR has already beaten at the box office, but considering those who put 10 points for this badly scrapped piece of rubbish, I'd like to say that's right, McGee.
