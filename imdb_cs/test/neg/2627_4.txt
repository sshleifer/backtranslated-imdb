That was a very good show. I enjoyed building real time and flashbacks when I saw the old meeting of excavators again and remembered the horrors of their capture in Changi POW camp. The main problem with the way the show was written is that Changi's life scenes are a holiday camp rather than a place. I'm old enough to remember the film shots of the men freed from Changi and other Japanese prison camps. No actor could lose enough weight to resemble the condition of those men. They made the Jews of Belsen seem sumo wrestlers. Over the years, I've met several Changi veterans. Many would never go in a Japanese car, let alone own it. The physical and mental torture of the men they endured was too terrible for them to talk about. What percentage survived? John Doyle can be a cool comedy writer for "Roy and HG" (I hate it too) but it is a serious sugar coating history that should never be tolerated. I am glad that satirists can write "The Life of Brian" and make fun of the Crucifixion because it is obviously a comedy, though some consider it a bad taste. "Changi" is written as a representation of a real event and as such can be considered as a real record by younger people. This powerful scenario can't redeem the great performance of great cast.
