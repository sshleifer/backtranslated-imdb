This movie is a lot wrong. It can be said that the sequel to "Halloween" was primarily a bad idea and we should feel happy that the previous records, even at their lowest level, were still observable. But still, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" - even today - is so bad, it's shocking. Poor filmmaking is the worst. There is so much guilt to go around. But where to start? What are the shoulders resting on? Was she director of Joe Chapelle? At least, the sixth installment is fresh on the visual front. And as far as visual effects are concerned, you will see Michael killing in some fearsome directions, though it does not fall into the overall tone of the series. So, could Daniel Ferrands have a problem with the problem scenario? To be fair, he did the best he could. By the time you reach the sixth place in any series, you'll run out of places to go. Finding a rhyme on Michael's reason is not a bad concept because it is uninteresting, especially the way it works. And it doesn't really help that the movie has been hacked into pieces and stitched together so many times that the story is completely lost. After all, this was the first studio movie in the "Halloween" series and we all know what happens when too many cooks get into the kitchen. Damn, look at the incredible lows that the "Hellraiser" was dragging on? I think everyone is to blame because, apart from actors and visual effects, no one seems to make a decent film. you cut it, slice it, cut it, or electrocute until your head explodes, "Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers" has never been a good movie. Marking an all-time low for the series, which almost killed some credibility for Michael Myers, "The Curse" is just that: cursed. The mandrel angle was never interesting, nor was it likely to be extended. The unnecessary gore is so out of place and replaces the tension that is the trademark of "Halloween" name. In the end, the film stops making sense, stops trying to push the plot, and simply tries to find a way to kill characters and end the movie before anything else is lost. Sadly, Donald Pleasence's final performance is immortalized in this film, even though the man did the best he could under the worst possible conditions. And in most cases, there are other members in this film. Paul Rudd plays a strange, anti-social adult Tommy Doyle somewhat naturally, while Marianne Hagan does just work in portraying the sympathetic female leadership. On the other side of the coin, Jamie Lloyd's assault was a pity, and thank God Devin Gardner wouldn't make the movies anymore. As a child in the film, be watched by a "man in black," Danny is anti-Jamie in that he is uncomfortable, whining and absolutely incredible in his role. It's sad when you can't feel compassion for a child in a horror movie. But I think it's "Halloween 6" in a nutshell. Basically it is an anti-"Halloween" created by a director who didn't know what he was doing and the studio that had his own program. Hell, the music is bad. Many will try to paint it like a nervous "Halloween" because it's a science fiction twist, but really, it's just stupid. Save for some good visual and decent characters, "Curse of Michael Myers" is just as bad as it gets. And this comes from a fan!
