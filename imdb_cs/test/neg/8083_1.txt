I thought it would be Ok movie after seeing ads about it. It was fun on some parts and very ugly. The only person I was sorry about is Horatio Sans, who got a hot woman who cheats him with other women. But he never got a chance to have a threesome until then, and it was good but they should have had a bigger movie.
