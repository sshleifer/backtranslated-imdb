Oops. I hired it because I thought it was Bitter Harvest (1981), which was recommended. After discovering the scary Patsy Kensit, I checked the recommendations and found a mistake. OK, it's observable because the main characters are very sexy, but acting is terrible. Stephen Baldwin looks annoying all the time, which is understandable to his teammate. Is Patsy competing with Liz Hurley for the title of most obvious actor on screen?
