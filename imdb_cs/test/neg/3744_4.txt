There is potential with "Tell No-One". Curious and interesting storyline and French story. But there were no possibilities for me. Although I liked the aspects of this movie, there were three prominent drawbacks that pulled it down to four in ten. First, it's a stupid, clich√© of a murderous mystery. Especially the fictional murder written by Bergerac. Being French doesn't eliminate this problem - it's just stupid and French at the same time. It's full of unlikely coincidences. Second, the transition from the US to France seems to have failed chronically. This French doctor hangs on the "streets" of the French city with new "homies" and their blingin 'SUV ... and then there's a chase car ... long. The film needs a good reason for me to be more than 90 minutes long and has a serious justification within two hours. This wasn't once.
