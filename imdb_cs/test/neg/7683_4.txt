Well, "built" Doris Day (like Ethel S. "Dynamite" Jackson) is mistaken for thespian Ethel Barrymore and falls in love with Ray Bolger (as S. "Sam" Winthrop Putnam). Elder French Claude Dauphin (as Philippe Fouquet) also digs Doris. Frankly speaking ?? What did they think? - This wildly unsuitable musical has Mrs. Day pretending to sing the standard "April in Paris" and more. Sure, nothing as good as her Columbia recordings of that time; and nothing is approaching the overwhelming and upcoming "Secret Love". Even if the material does not serve him well, it is nice to see Mr. Bolger performing. Some music numbers are unpleasant. **** April in Paris (12/24/52) David Butler ~ Doris Day, Ray Bolger, Claude Dauphin
