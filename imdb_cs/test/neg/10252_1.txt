Is it possible that the film will be worse than this? There are a lot of great apes who roam, mutter b ******, are they supposedly stupid and are we supposed to laugh? There is no plot to put you in the first place. Even when women finally appear, there are no signs of improvement; The most expected things are happening and you can be asleep while the movie is over. Beware: this is not a hideous cult film, it's a waste! I can't believe it's a continuation of this! <br /> <br /> 1
