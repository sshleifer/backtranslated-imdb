I waited for Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the unfortunate films he made after "Eraser". "End of Days", however, can be added to desperate films he had misfortune to appear in. <br /> <br /> "End of Days" begins well with grabbing action sequences, but quickly becomes drilling, taking attention from action and tension and instead focus on investigating demonic events and the rapidly approaching millennium (read "Doomsday"). The performances are outdated, special effects so widespread and abundant. Since I became a Schwarzenegger fan, I couldn't believe I didn't like the movie, but with such a horrible, lame script, what could Arnie do except to pass this turkey? <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 <br /> <br />
