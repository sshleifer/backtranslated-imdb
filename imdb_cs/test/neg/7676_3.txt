The real star of the last movie at the airport is the big supersonic carrier created by the French called The Concorde. If you remember that the whole movie is dedicated to what it shows, what a plane with a needle in the sky could do in the sky than the whole movie makes sense. But if you are expecting some serious drama here than by all means to show some of Concorde's evasive actions here, when some ugly people try to shoot it down. industrial tycoon Robert Wagner. One of Wagner's assistants just happens to bring her information about some of Wagner's dirty business dealings that sell weapons to people who are not friendly to the US. When the source, Macon McCalman, is killed before her and she is almost done in the hit-man she escapes from of course she confronts Wagner with the information. And of course it denies it. But just before Blakely boarded The Concorde, McCalman's widow, Kathleen Maguire, gave him the necessary documents. But on the way to Moscow with a stop in Paris, Wagner and his minions are trying to put the big bird down. But the fearless crew of Alain Delon, David Warner, and George Kennedy are on all their tricks. It's a pretty bag full of how you'll see if you want to watch a movie. <br /> <br /> If you are an aviation enthusiast, you will not take care of this land at all. It's like the Le Mans movie with Steve McQueen, who has a legion of car racing fans who made him a cult item. Maybe Le Mans is better because he didn't bother with any story. Among the passengers are the smokers saxophonist playing Jimmie Walker, an upset mother accompanying her new heart for her baby, played by Cicely Tyson and Martha Raye a woman with a weak bladder who spends all the way from Washington to Paris in the loo. It's actually the best. Robert Wagner must have been psychic because I'm sure that part of the number two has won Evil Evil in the Austin Powers series. I'm sure everyone involved got a big pay day from this movie, but he seems to have killed sagas from movies at the airport.
