Snakes on the Train (2006, Dir. Mallachi Brothers) The Zombie Curse is placed on a woman who causes her to have live snakes. Brujo, who cares for her, tries to take her to Los Angeles on the train. After several train confrontations, Bruj's collection of snakes managed to separate from his owner and go hunting. While all this is happening, normal, everyday passengers are free, what is unfamiliar to them, is that something deadly is heading their way and that they have not gone out. <br /> <br /> After watching the amazingly fun Snakes on the plane, I had to check it out. I knew it was going to be a rip-off and that the movie would look cheap, but what I found was the worst to watch. The whole curse was stupid and should never be included. Special effects are not terrible, but they are not the best. I had no idea about the end. It was silly to watch and poor. Acting was absolutely terrible and looked bad. They simply couldn't act to save their lives. If you want a big laugh, look at it, otherwise you should really avoid it. <br /> <br /> "We have a runaway train. I repeat. We have a escape train." - Conductor (Stephen A.F. Day)
