On paper, this film has some chops: a street boy who has overcome past trauma has rebuilt his life and succeeded when the world wrote it. Great stuff, everyone loves a happy ending. But there were some omissions in the theater that left the film inside. The dialogue was hollow and uninteresting, the characters were almost cartoonish in their lack of dimension and complexity, and why did they all have to be gay? I have nothing against homosexual themes or characters in the film, but when used in this fashion, it is not only offensive to homosexuals, destroys lifestyle and makes the film cheaper. If the story works without this cheap trick, it should be cut out. <br /> <br /> Each character seemed to come from the same shape cutter: Each had one major mistake and one minor mistake, each character's good heart was successful or not, and each one had or is in some offensive relationship with someone. The most annoying reality of the movie is that they never let you overcome the name "pip" comes from great expectations. They give it once and that should be enough. The story shares enough with the Dickens classic to make this clear. The most interesting part of the film is the story of the grandfather and the cassette, who is leaving for Pip and Pip, the main character. learn how to grow out of the lesson from tape. Finally, with lessons learned, Pip confronts his dark past and movies forward with his life.
