Screenwriters for this mini-series were to be sentenced to the guillotine itself. They killed a very funny story and wasted Richard E. Grant's talents. The only thing the writers of the original books kept was the name. All the characters were completely changed and the story was not the same. I highly recommend watching the next version of Scarlet Pimpernel. Every other version is better than this.
