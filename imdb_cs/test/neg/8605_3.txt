I watched this movie with such dangerous fascination as the hedgehog trapped in the headlights. There is no doubt that (even if you liked it) it's a bad movie, but why is it an important question? He has a good cast; it is alive; She is ready to deal with the sexual head, with some of the characters who get here and there, which is unusual for the British comedy. He also has Johnny Vegas and Mackenzie Crook, Marmite artists have agreed, but they have their moments in the past. <br /> <br /> What is basically missing is magic. The characters are incredibly stupid, incredible and alienated, so instead of the movie Men who are badly behaving, the producers have created a game. Any average writer who would like to make a film about dozy sex attitudes, sexist British men, would take a few copies of Loaded, Zoo, or even Viz to read Sid Sexist and that thing would be written by herself. Instead, the manufacturers were clearly trying to figure out some moronic, hardly caring characters. Character comedy - unlike grotesque, etc. - works only when viewers recognize a human truth in the situation. But watching this movie is like being annoying a joke that you know it won't end up funny, but you can't stop it. Sadly, the movie is also wrong. The structure of the plot is weak, there is little character or development and many scenes are not funny. From time to time the same lame reggae chips in split scenes, unnecessarily and gratefully. There's a lot of unnecessary repetition - if you made one joke about parking outside a sex party, you don't have to do it again. One wonders what the British Film Council saw in the script. It is a world where most men scrabble and most women are constantly behind it. The apartment and the Alfie satirized the same world view, but the producers of the film accept it without criticism. So they ended up with some kind of worse update of the Window Cleaner Confessions. Someone in the UK needs to do something like that and do it right? a good next project for Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright I think ...
