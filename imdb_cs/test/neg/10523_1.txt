OK, we went along with the stereotypical bad orphan experiences and explained to our son, admitted from Russia, that it was top acting and dramatization, so we could get to the dog to play football (because it plays football). But the last scene in which the dog returns to its original owner, put my son on the edge and cried for 15-20 minutes, "was exchanged !!!!" That from an elementary child. I do not recommend this film to any family with an adopted child; poorly depicts adoption, orphanage and adult - and even if they win the game - the dog the boy has joined with must leave - and that is too much. Please be careful if you have any adopted children, and be alert to families with biological children, because the impression of children being accepted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and ugly. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family's response to this movie.)
