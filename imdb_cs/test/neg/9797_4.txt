The plot here is simple. Country Boy, Lem (Farrell) goes to the city to sell grain, falls in waitress, Kate (Duncan) and marries her, bringing her home to a hostile father and a group of women-hungry mowers. There are shades of what they wanted and Mice and men here. Courtship, which takes place in two long sequences in a restaurant, consumes the first half hour and is lethargically stimulated. Lem is so weak that he allows his father to be wrong with his wife, which Mac (Richard Alexander), one of the students, suggested to leave with him. Duncan and Alexander are the only good things in this lengthy pot that lacks the insight and cinematic beauty we expect from Murnau. Farrell's character has no backbone, so we rejected the roots for a "real man" (Mac) to turn Kate away from it all. With the audience's sympathy, the film loses its narrative development. The father's conversion at the end of the film is unrealistic and incredible, leading to an inventive denouement. This film is intended for fans of stars and director - municipal viewers do not have to bother.
