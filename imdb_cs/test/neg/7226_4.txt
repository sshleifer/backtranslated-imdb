He has really good music and shows; Kid Creole and Coconuts, James White and Blacks, DNA, Tuxedo Moon, Plastics, Melle Mel, Vincent Gallo, Lydia Lunch ... etc, But besides, there's no more. In fact, the dialogue, especially the narrative (Saul Williams), is pretty good, but the performances are pretty or completely bad, no matter how many hips are nested; Debbie Harry and Jean Micheal Basquit (the latter being the leading role) both still do not have enough cultural credits to make this film a novelty. It's a Jack Kerouac style that moves spontaneously but has no insight to move on, which is where the band performs. I enjoyed it, but I expected more. Although it has a fabulous ending.
