I am absolutely amazed at how overvalued the "Cemetery Man" is among horror fans! Now I usually welcome films that combine two or more kinds of genre styles into one, and I only love every zombie-comedy I've ever seen. To my dismay, this Italian cult classic has not really shown me to be pumped about it ... It stems from the unusual duties of a caregiver in a full-time cemetery and his retarded, male child, Curly Joe-looking assistant, as they seem to be primarily it will destroy the recently deceased who will jump out of the country seven days after their initial death. She meets the widow she "wows" with some severely grave-yard atmosphere and develops a quick romance, soon having her sex on her dead husband's grave. Husband's corpses feed and bite, triggering a series of events that apparently consume the rest of the film. "Cemetery Man" attempts to incorporate every element it can, such as horror, romance, comedy, action, and failure in the long run. It plods along, never able to focus on any aspect long enough to be interesting to the viewer, such as a great sidekick relationship with a living separate head, a motorcycle riding a zombie launch from the ground, the main character to decide the gun down random people on the sidewalk, etc. This thing is so intricate and boring that it's almost impossible to take it seriously. Sure, it's elegant and often "elegant", but even "artsy" types of movies need the right kind of line to make sense. "Cemetery Man" moves along, seems to be unable to focus on anything for more than a few minutes, which becomes very tiring after a while. People say "it's a more sophisticated zombie movie". Honestly, as far as zombies are concerned, I don't want anything more "sophisticated" than Romero ... A little gore and nudity - especially in scenes where he wants to play "horror movie" but not nearly enough to cope with his uncompromising lack of structure. Terrible movie.
