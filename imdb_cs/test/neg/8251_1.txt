I'm not surprised that so many people have fallen on this. When I watched this movie, a few spectators beside me sobbed when you "should" sob - or at least feel "touch". Like Hunting said he didn't love the girl. Like Robin Williams's character (sorry for forgetting his role name), she repeatedly told Hunting: "It's not your fault" (oh, Lord, just thinking about the scene gives me goosebumps). I couldn't care less about what would happen to the characters. Many people sob for Hollywood characters that they can't even relate to (I think Titanic; Yuck!) ... but it just really crushed me and I want to get out of the theater. I think I just refused to be mentally and emotionally manipulated by everyone. It is not people who are condescending ... those characters are, and for no good reason, because they are unreal. Worse still, nothing is new or surprising. Even Robin Williams's character is a clich√©. I gave it 1 out of 10. It's probably not that bad; it's just average ... but so many people went to the other extreme and gave it 10, so I figured out that one balancing voice wouldn't hurt.
