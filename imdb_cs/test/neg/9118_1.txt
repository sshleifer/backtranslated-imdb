American Graffiti is one of the best movies ever made. I have seen it at least thirty times, and I am emotionally affected every time I see it. (I graduated from high school in 1962.) However, more American Graffiti is one of the worst films ever made. It's hard to believe than anyone associated with a great original film was involved with this terrible sequel. Part of the movie in Vietnam was very inaccurate. (In Vietnam, I served 18 months with the 101st Airborne Division.) <br /> <br /> The whole movie was worth nothing in any of its parts. <br /> <br /> If someone wants to make a case against the continuation of great movies, More American Graffiti would be the best example of what can go wrong.
