If I can add one word to this movie, it's his "embarrassment". It must be embarrassing for all those who are connected to the film to watch it in the theater. Everything - Screenplay, Screenplay, Dialogs, Song Lyrics, Direction - Weak, Miserable. When I was a kid, he saw this movie. It was at that time, mainly because it was a fantasy, a superhero-movie. It is a not-so-explored genre in Hindu film. Attempt deserves credit, but that's all. It seems that Sashi Kapoor was in a hurry in the movie. I can't understand why foreigners behaved like Hindu-speaking characters who can't even get sync right (what to say about dubbing). The script is terrible. Adjustments even more. If one follows close-up dialogues, it is possible to find grammatically incorrect sentences (which completely change the intended meaning). Nothing special about music. <br /> <br /> The greatest embarrassment must be for Censor. There are a few scenes with a nip-slip in the movie, one of which is very clear (so much that I can't even imagine a metaphor). The director missed them. The editorial team missed it. And the censor board also disappeared. So much for the motto of non-indecent exposure on the screen. The officials seemed to fall asleep while watching the movie. I can't think about why Amitabh went with the role. It may be because he was a good friend of Kapoors. But the role hardly means anything to him. With amazing roles in Hum and Agneepath he couldn't follow him worse. There are several heroic scenes, really good. But otherwise they are embarrassingly unbelievable (eg Arrow-Catching ... it probably might have been better with CGI, but it was '91 ..). <br /> <br /> Dimple and Sonam are not precisely set on the screen. Shammi Kapoor and Rishi Kapoor have inspired performance, but their range is limited. Amrish Puri is his usual self in the role of a fairytale villain (leaving that mundane laughter). <br /> <br /> It's an interesting concept overall. He could have been much better.
