The movie started very well .. far, because Isabel's exorcism could be believed .... but later, gosh !!! I didn't know if it was a horror, drama one or one couldn't see! The possessed being attacked the sheriff had no relationship with the film at all. well it looked pretty real at the beginning, but at the end, the last part of the film, makeup (especially teeth and eyes) was very exaggerated. If you want a good movie "Exorcism" watch "The Exorcism of Emily Rose". Together with "Hard Candy" (Totally Boring, Poor Conspiracy and End), these two movies are the worst I 've seen from Lionsgate !! But the film company has given horror fans excellent movies, but with that you will want to never rent it !! Exorcism Movie Fans, Just Staying With Two "Exorcist" and "Emily Rose's Exorcism"
