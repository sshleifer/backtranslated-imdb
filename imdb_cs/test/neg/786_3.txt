Cameron Diaz, James Marsden, Frank Langella: This is stellar power, but "The Box" again proves it's not a guarantee for a hard film. The assumption is promising: the couple will receive a visit from a mysterious man who offers them a million dollars. The downside is that someone dies, a man they probably don't know. So, what are you doing? This gives us an interesting story about 30 minutes. Then the story is completely derailed. Vaginate an uninspired plot about extraterrestrial conspiracy with NASA, nothing really explained. <br /> <br /> "Box" is disappointing, could have been much better. But because it is based on a very short story, it explains the errors of continuity.
