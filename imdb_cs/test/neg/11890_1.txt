I was forced to watch this movie for World Reigonal Geography. This film is what's wrong with America today, instead of finding out the best way out of difficult times or situations, we'd rather complain about someone else's fault. This film goes down Flint, Michigan and blames him 100% on General Motors. In this process, Moore goes to great lengths to make General Motors' leadership criminals simply because they do their job in capitalist society. Moore is filming several films throughout the film and never asks once if a person is expelled for GM release. In addition, he never filmed the interviews with the tenants. Moore goes to great lengths to reverse historical events to fit his political agenda in this pure propaganda movie.
