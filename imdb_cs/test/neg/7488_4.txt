It is clear that Andreas Bethmann would like to wear the crown of Jessy Franco while he longed (at least kinematic) for the wife of an old worker, Lin Romay. Romay plays in this modern, ambitious W.I.P. film. With some exceptions, many of Frank's films are insensitively produced and directed in a slipped, hurried manner. Shots are not always sheared and sound mixtures can be terrible. While watching "Angel of Death 2" (aka "Prison Island Massacre"), I asked myself if Bethmann was deliberately trying to replicate Frank's patent fragility, or was he just as naturally ugly as his mentor? Is this film deliberately wrong, which would be self-defeating, or is it just bad negligence? After a hitchhiker who is forced to shoot a gun, her bully fills her mouth, then fills her vagina with some drugs. A few minutes later she was taken to a cliff prison for reasons that were not explained and subjected to contempt and harsh treatment by employees and other prisoners. As it is a WIP movie, there are lesbian scenes and a lot of violent behavior. Gore is also bloody and sadistic, with delights like pulling teeth and scalping (courtesy of Olaf Ittenbach). Acting is pretty horrible and the battle scenes are lame, but in each frame there is a love for sleaze and an understanding of what fans enjoy from the basket. Unfortunately, the flat script is for flat film. Despite numerous cruelty, hard sex and guest performances by Jess Franco, the experience is empty. But isn't that what most Jess Franco movies are?
