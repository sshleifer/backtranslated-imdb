This is a movie that should be a mini-series because it is trying to get too much information in too small a space. The whole story is constantly bombarded by sub-parcels, character performances and nonsensical information that go nowhere. There is a basic plot where a boy meets a girl, she has doubts but gets married in any way and then her doubts surface and she goes to see if they are real. It turned out they wouldn't be, but her husband wouldn't believe she wasn't unfaithful and her almost friend doesn't want her because she wasn't unfaithful to her husband. It is said that there are no fewer than 1000 sub-lands and performances of characters that make this land almost incomprehensible. In the first 15 minutes, you are flooded with so many things and situations you have just ceased to care for. You are not interested in any of the confused and overwhelmed actors who throw themselves in and out of the story like vultures feeding on a corpse. Each of them comes and takes some interest from the viewer. After half an hour and utterly disinterested, I stayed and watched the remaining two and a half hours of pure morbid curiosity. I couldn't imagine where it was going, but as I stared at the fire, I couldn't get up and turn it off. Production values ​​are excellent, but the resulting film is a waste of time; instead, wash your socks.
