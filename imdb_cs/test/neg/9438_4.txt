I know this movie was on TV when I was little, but I can't remember whether I watched it or not; seeing it now, considering how completely forgotten it is, i still don't know? so I counted it as first viewing! There have been several films featuring the title character, the creation of visionary French author Jules Verne; these include: 20,000 LEAGUES BY MOR (1954; with James Mason in role), MASTER OF THE WORLD (1961; Vincent Price), MYSTERIOUS ISLAND (1961; Herbert Lom), CAPTAIN NEMO and UNDERWATER CITY (1969; Robert Ryan) and MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF CAPTAIN NEMO (1973; Omar Sharif). This version is the winner of the Josef Ferrer Prize. However, even if the assumption itself is not half bad? woke up from a suspended animation in his submarine "Nautilus" and found himself in modern times, Nemo accepts all his ingenuity to help the US Navy in defeating megalomaniac scientist Burgess Meredith? It will appear just as easy its most dangerous adventure yet! For example, five seconds into a movie, Meredith's assistant? dressing a steel mask? brags that "the world will be ours!"); Just as hilarious are the zealous gestures of a similarly decked-out dwarf whose job is to make a fire professor's all-important "Delta Beam" - and how about those android-type minions aboard the Meredith ship who never seem to do anything? ! Ferrer manages to maintain his dignity all the time, but Meredith is embarrassed (in what is practically the opposite of his Penguin characterization from the TV series BATMAN in the 1960s and film), where the budget was so tight? most of the time, he has invested in bland design and clumsy special effects; it apparently could not afford even a decent costume (looks positively idiotic wearing a tie in the sub)! The cast support includes Mel Ferrer (starring saboteur in the vein of Joan Fontaine from another Irwin Allen production, VOYAGE to BOTTOM SEA [1961], and who deals with the swashbuckling routine with his name tag inside the engine room ". Nautilus"), Lynda Day George (surprisingly, is It is the only female character nearby) and Horst Buchholz (as King of Atlantis? For whatever reason, Nemo is obsessed with placing the famous lost continent). By the way, when a movie from a theater show was cut from a three-part mini-series, the film obviously feels jerky? although one is still able to discern where one episode has ended and the other has started.
