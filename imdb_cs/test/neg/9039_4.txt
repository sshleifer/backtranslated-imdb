Do you think the movie, which played three of the greatest male movie stars from World War II, would become a classic. These three, who are also my three favorites, go daze and look like they should be anywhere, but there. Sadly, Way West definitely had some potential to be a classic. In these days of political correctness, there is something about the American pioneer and its migration to the West. It should have been better than then. Kirk Douglas is a former United States Senator heading west to build a settlement in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Being a former politician, he evaluates the hoi ploi he leads. The screenplay calls for him not only to have a covered wagon, but also a wagon to run a train. You think it's ridiculous you should see the scene where Douglas orders his black servant who plays Roy Glenn whipped him. I won't spoil it by saying what causes Douglas to demand it, but believe me, it's bad. Robert Mitchum is a trail guide and three stars that looks most bored. There was to be considerable friction on the set between Widmark and Douglas, but Mitchum only treads over the film above it all. Perhaps friction has helped somewhat because the film calls for Douglas, a widower, to look out for Mrs. Widmark, played by Lola Albright. Now it's the most beautiful thing in the movie. <br /> <br /> Sally Field introduces film billing. It happened between her Gidget and her Flying Nun Days. She plays a piece of white South Waste with a musical comedy named Mercy McBee. First, we'll see her in a movie sitting on the back of her parents' car, her feet, and an invitation. Of course he will be invited. Her character is something like what's found in every park trailer in America and then again what was a wagon but one big park trailer on the go. Despite this film, Sally Field continued two Oscar careers. What this woman had to overcome. The son Andrew Victor McLaglen drove this item and turned it into a mess with the miserable scenario. Shame on Andrew McLaglen, it's definitely better in his career. And so do you, if you're not an astronomer.
