I, like many tonight, have resisted the chilly winter and long lines to see what I expected as one of the best films of the year. Unfortunately, I was unfortunately unwanted in many ways after credits rolled. To be fair, there were removable properties (though very little). Let's start with what worked. First, Lycans: In Place In Any Direction? from their frightening corporeality to their utter rage. Action: sublimally visceral? when it happened. Nighy / Victor and Sheen / Lucian: Perfect. Now what not (and there is plenty). This was less film and more collage sequences (and don't expect to see any supporting characters from other movies except Raze and Tannis). There was a deeply lacking well-written story and anything real to get these pieces of film together. Did the story seem to start right in the middle? at the tip, where Lucian decided to resist. Therefore, there was no context; no tension; no feeling of betrayal? devices needed to make everything else work. In addition, it ended up where the peak was supposed to be (which had to be after the dispute had disappeared). It was too short. Purist also finds an insult in some freedoms taken to certain facts previously revealed in the first two movies? But to judge for yourself. In the end, this movie was extended by what should be a brief "background" (eg, Various Scenes), so we never learned about the main players ... or the movie (s). -D
