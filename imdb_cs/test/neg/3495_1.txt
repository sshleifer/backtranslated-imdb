I went to movies that expected a great movie based on all the words and amazing reviews. the moment the initial order began, I knew I had trouble. Music and credits tried to evoke the emotions I wanted to vomit. All I got from this film was a clich√© of characters, an inventive dialogue, and an unmistakable script. The director / writer Paul Haggis' has managed to get great reviews with his manipulative, self-righteous writing, but it does not fool me. some performance was good. Don Cheadle is always good. I think Terrance Howard is somewhat overstated, but he was decent. ridiculous was too much on her nose. he should stick to rap. Brendan Fraser was fine. Jennifer Esposito left no impression. I don't find anything interesting about it. Sandra bullock is always the same in every movie, it's okay. Matt Dillon was very good and I enjoyed watching him work. Ryan Philippe was also good. but as far as the script and the miserable direction are concerned - this is actually one of those films that are so unpleasantly bad that I actually took the time to write it. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone that is a waste of time.
