It's hard to decide what to say about this. It's not a hundred percent bad. Although the film-in-a-film is unspeakably bad, he wanted to be campy, but missing miles. But I'm sure it's intentional. Danny Aiello is absolutely sufficient here and more or less nails his pathetic character. Dyan Cannon is just fine at the corner. Clotilde Courau was the last twenty-year-old girlfriend. And Linda Carlson had a bold topless scene that she did very well. So it's not completely wrong, but I don't believe this goal will meet its goals. All in all it is worth it.
