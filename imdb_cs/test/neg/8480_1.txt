This film was not needed, simple and simple. The original, though some hated, was something I thought was really fun, mainly because before Jim Carrey really began to lose touch and Cameron Diaz was, "Smoooooookin!" Said Nuff. So why do the sequel / prequel thing? Honestly? Knowing that Jim Carrey wouldn't do that would be key enough not to deserve it. But then an error is made after the error. Jamie Kennedy. Why is this person still able to breathe? Writing and story: terrible. Why would I ever want to see a masked child? And why would I want to see it? At all? How do they think they are also thinking? Acting is despicable, in fact, almost everything about this film. I'm trying to keep calm, or the IMDb probably won't let me. Bottom line: don't watch this piece of waste. Pick up the original, see how well Cameron Diaz looked, and how Jim Carrey cared about his career and laughed. Don't waste a second of your time on it.
