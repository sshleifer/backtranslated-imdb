It is quite rare that the movie comes out that it is useless that I used negative scores with IMDb. In fact, I was thinking about this movie and I really can't think of a movie that had so little to go for it. Acting: Your child is right. Direction: Ne. Chart: No. This film has nothing to do with it as a serious film, which is often the case with movies of this genre, but most of the films of this kind can be watched as if it were a comedy and you can laugh at how pathetic characters and situations are and almost times worth it. This film is so empty that it cannot suit this purpose either. I have to give this -1/10, three points lower than any other movie I ever rated. I really feel that the staff involved in this movie should pay me for the 83 minutes I've spent watching. I don't really have words to describe how bad it is. No one should ever follow it for any reason.
