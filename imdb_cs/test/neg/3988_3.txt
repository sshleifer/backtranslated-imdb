For a country that has made some of the world's best playwrights and has such a rich musical heritage, it has always been a source of confusion for why so many Irish home theaters are so appalling. Perhaps because, by their nature, those who are talented in Irish cinema are willing to leave their native coast for a career in Britain or America (Colin Farrell is a recent case) and that the truly successful Irish directors who continued to work in Ireland and filmed their films with international money and eyes on the international market. I am thinking in particular of Jim Sheridan and Neil Jordan, who alternate between films with the Irish environment and projects shot abroad. But "Middletown" is an Irish film, although two of his main actors are English. It is certainly well-formed of its kind and it may have happened that Irish film is not very good; (Paddy Breathnach's "I Went Down", written by brilliant young playwright Conor McPherson, is a key exception). Unfortunately, this fundamentalism story took place in a fictional Irish city, probably in the north of Ireland, judging by the accents (Mid-Ulster Bible-Belt, if you ask me) and probably in the recent past (the fifties)? -the-top that's really pretty ridiculous. Nothing in the film rings is true and you can't help feeling that it's a writer, Daragh Carville, was heavily influenced by Flannery O'Connor and that the whole thing could make more sense if it were in the American Bible-belt, and not in Ireland, where even the most extreme Protestant fundamentalist has never been as polite as this one. It all meant being grim in a spectacular way of playing and certainly being, though I was more prone to giggling than the Friss on the right Reverand Matthew Macfayden. Ulster's accent is off the pat and there is nothing wrong with his acting or that it is Daniel Mays as his brother, Gerard McSorley as his father or Eva Birthistle as Mays's wife, but the script is so badly derived that good action can't do save the movie. I'm afraid it is just another nail in the coffin rather than a step-by-step ladder for the "Middletown" Irish cinema.
