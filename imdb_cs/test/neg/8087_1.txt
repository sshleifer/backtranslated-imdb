Rare and auspicious are moments in filmmaking, where size stands as a defining memory for the rest of the industry to face us and delve into this wonderful moment. Some stories go beyond their time and long for the noble reach of the classic and legend legends. Throw in the refined skill set of casting thespians who are at the very top of their game. <br /> <br /> "Where is all the originality gone?" It's here like this story and it's casting sashay through plot and storyline that will not only educate you but also entertain even the most experienced Shakespearean / action / love story connoisseurs. I can't imagine where writers dreamed of this extraordinary story. Where do geniuses get this kind of inspiration? Now I have hope for mankind because I know that this kind of talent still exists, it gives me hope that we will reach the stars and beyond, perhaps to the very gates of heaven. I have, like others before me, dreamed of size. Although I did not write this film, I saw it and, given the noble size of this film, I feel as if I have been promoted to a higher level of being, a higher level of spiritual integrity. It is no wonder that this kind of glory escapes most of us. What would happen to our world if we could all reach this level of magnificence? We would probably be consumed in the white fire of super-nove glory as we evolve into transdimensional spiritual beings capable of all-powerful creative power. The most important thing you should know with all your heart and the very essence of your being is that "Tomcats" is nothing I have talked about. "Tomcats" is the opposite of everything I mentioned. It could very well destroy our world. Since some reviewers rate a star system movie, ie 1 to 5 stars, or even zero stars, I rate the "Tomcats" black hole. I'm willing to give money to the cause that will stop these kinds of atrocities that seem to initially run at the box office. I'm not even unfavorable to using nuclear weapons. He must stop. What more can we take before aliens come here from the universe and throw our planet away because we have so many stupid, cracked, vulgar, unimaginable and humiliating films that come out of Hollywood? I'm not even going to dignify this film by mentioning the name of someone who has played or produced. I will not waste my time describing the story because we have seen it several times, and all earlier versions were at least ga-zillion times better. By the way, when I almost exploded during this film, but with the most selfless effort and a lot of luck, I survived to warn the public. You were warned.
