I picked up this movie because it captivated me as a movie focused on Jewish comedy - something I hadn't seen before. <br /> <br /> I came to this open minded movie and wondered how it started. The opening is well assembled and the first half of the film gave me many reasons to laugh, and that's good. However, humor soon became repetitive, the story became confused and tense, and I realized I had enjoyed the movie. I tried to avoid it, but the movie became "cheap" - it's not a bad thing for comedy if humor lasts but not. I admit that I may have missed some humor, not being Jewish myself, and having little experience of Jewish culture. However, as he wired heavily, there was a lot of humor in this movie, it is unlikely that I missed a lot. The idea is good, and maybe if you put a little more thought into it, you could see the whole way. I wish I could give the film a higher rating, but strictly speaking it would be better than a TV series or as a parody series. There was not just enough valuable fresh material for the feature film. One of the things about casting - the lead role looked like it was designed with Ben Stiller in mind, but I don't think He didn't think the movie was more valuable if it was in it.
