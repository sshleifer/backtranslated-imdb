I can only assume that previous posts came from managers in the manufacturing company ... <br /> <br /> He attended the UK premiere last night. Zane and Brook attended (probably knew I was going to be there) and they are undoubtedly stars, but what a turkey movie is. Sometimes I am sorry when the audience burst out laughing at what are serious "thriller" scenes. Perhaps the element of the tongue on the face was determined. If so, a pure genius. If not, career genocide. On the plus side, Zane always shines, and Brook can actually act a bit. As the other half said (as we ran into the cinema with broken ribs), they can be forgiven for this movie because they both look like nice people! However, the scenario should be abandoned.
