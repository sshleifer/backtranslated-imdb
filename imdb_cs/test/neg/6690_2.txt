The first two Bring It On movies were very good in a way. The first was quite serious, the second was a satirical one - and the third decided on the usual low-eyed idiotic comedy we always see in the totally thoughtless teenage movies that Hollywood came out of wood. The whole mention in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who hardly know enough to continue a common conversation, and that is the extent of this movie's comedy. Ha ha. No. There's no bit of cleverness in this movie, no theme, no subtext, nothing for anyone with half of the brain to have fun (and I certainly couldn't sit in it all). If you're the kind of guy who's funny fart jokes, this movie is for you. Congratulations! <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
