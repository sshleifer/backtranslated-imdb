Wow, this version of THE RACKETEER was hard to follow! While none of the other reviews mentioned it, the public domain version I watched was seriously wrong. The soundtrack has been turned off for about 10 seconds - which means that dialogue and action have never come close. So you would hear something happened before you saw it - a very confusing suggestion! The worst is where you can hear a gun shot and only later can he hit a guy and lose to his death in a cab. Even though the film seriously spoiled it, it also focused on easier dialogue. - and showed serious shortcomings. Dialogue was simply terrible - often supplied with almost no inclination or feeling. As one review said, it was like watching a high school game. Part of this is understandable because the sound was a new medium, but the dialogue of this film was bad even compared to other 1929 movies - really wrong. The film, like many of these early sound movies, was just too scaly - with a noble and too melodramatic language and just not much. And you should think with a name like "The Racketeer" that there would be some action !! However, it is a really sad romance - with very little action. The film finds Carol Lombard straddling an alcoholic. She eventually steals to take care of him - and the trickster Robert Armstrong comes to help her. When Armstrong catches her for cheating on cards, she covers it and then assists the drunken brother to get to his feet - and naturally falls in the process. The problem is that once a drunk is floating, he also wants Lombard and has to choose between them. Wow ... a recovering drunk or gangster ... talk about a few great prospects! Overall, it's a little hard to evaluate with regard to the crappy press I've seen. However, even if you ignore it, the film has a lot of problems due to poor use of dialogue and excessively dull nature. And ... it was too sharp shoes.
