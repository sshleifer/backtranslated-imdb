It's the only reason to see this movie. It gives a very good performance - much better than this crap deserves. He is very handsome and very talented - he deserves it better than this. Also depressing is see Malcolm McDowell. He is another talented actor who deserves better, but just like Esai gives a very good performance. So, if you are a fan of one of them, you may want to watch. Otherwise stay away. One more complaint - couldn't we have more Esai scenes without a shirt?
