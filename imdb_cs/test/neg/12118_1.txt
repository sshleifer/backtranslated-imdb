Friday Night With Jonathan Ross must have those who are in charge of Ross to rub their sweaty little hands together. They know that the BBC lacks the imagination about the talk show, so when Jonathan Ross is available, they're quite happy to just sit down and let half of the joke dominate this primetime slot. Ross spends most of his show getting ready for his ego and smiles as much as the BBC pays him. The show is a complete copy of many American chat shows - Leno, Letterman, Conan About Brian, the list goes on - but he and his team have clearly seen what works on the masses also for the silly masses in the UK. . Unfortunate situation - no competition? Parkinson's gone reality is that he was never really too much in addition to caring for celebrity ego. Can't we have someone funnier and smooth instead of Jonathan Ross on British screens? Once Ross has built up his ego, then he will approach the very boring concept of stiff personalities in the green room - and try to get on himself. If A-Lister is present (which is so often the case these days - because there are no other chat samples, they can turn to - to support their latest movie) - spend another hour flirting with them or trying to be their best friend in space. Sqeamish when he had Ringo Starr on - a man who cares nothing for ass licking - Ross really pleaded for his cell phone number (as a common policy on this show is for Jonathan Ross to get the allones number so he can be seen in the right company when not working ). Of course, Ringo said how it was - and he just didn't say you didn't like a serious pelvis dead. Ross has to be featured on all Awards and TV shows. .
