After the first 10 minutes I rarely turned off the movie, but that's what I did with this. What swamped me was that it was so obvious that the only purpose of this film was to reveal as much skin of so many actresses and nothing else really matters. Don't be mistaken; I like pretty actresses and sex scenes and sexploitation movies have their own merit scale, but this director does nothing else. gal and OF COURSE there are all these supposedly funny jokes among them) talking over standing above the first dead body. The camera moves between them for each line (there is more than one screen width between them!) And finally you ask if you are from it or from a clueless dialogue. after the first 10 minutes they got better, but I wouldn't know. I refused the bet and found something better.
