Evil that Men Do (1984) was one of the few non-Cannon movies Charlie Bronson did during the 1980s. Unlike most Cannon movies, Charlie played, this one was neither fun nor fun. Charlie basically tortures and brutalizes people over an hour and a half. If you thought it was Mr. Emotion, wait until you see it! Charlie goes to an unnamed country in Central America and shows people who have to play with Chuck or his people to pay the bagpiper. This is no fun. It's not kitschy or camping, just brutal, sadistic and not in a good way. I didn't like this. I have no love for this movie. No recommendations because it's not worth watching. Maybe hell wouldn't come out of it. Watch with caution. <br /> <br /> Don't bother.
