OK, if you're looking for a fun lesbian. This is not a movie If you are looking for a fun movie with hot sociopathic characters (in the robbery of 'cruel intentions' or 'wild things') This is not a movie if you are looking for a classic vampire lesbian seduction movie. It's not a movie. However, if you are looking for a waste of your life, it's your movie. It's badly written, poorly controlled, badly scored, badly filmed. He had bad special effects ... I mean really bad special effects. I think you can actually create the same special effects in imovie lol. It's really PRETTY BAD MOVIE. Actors were classic stellar beauties but they look more like porn stars. It is shot as a soft core porn but you never get money shot and the actors all look bored of their brains. The "girl on girls" scenes that suck btw was so LAME that it was hardly worth mentioning. Go watch 'Almost Sex Scenes' on youtube cos this is the only reason you would like to watch this movie and even not worth it. WAST OF MONEY AND TIME don't take it, instead watch 'Cruel Intentions 2' - the same movie without bad special effects, bad story, bad writing, bad dialogue and bad play. in fact, I could now look to get rid of my mind
