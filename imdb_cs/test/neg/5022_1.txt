Don't kill me fans, but I have something to say about it. Pros: Well, the most interesting season I've watched from all the seasons that are out there Inuyasha Shichinintai Arch. Unlike the rest of the seasons, I personally believe that this has more than a real conspiracy and mercenaries; good god are so likeable characters. Too bad they were killed. Of course I would write a 15-page essay why I like Shichininta so much, but that would be boring for some of you. So this series actually has some likeable characters. I will miss Bankotsu ... poor, poor psycho little boy. Disadvantages: Outside the Shichinintai arc, the series was generally boring, repetitive and some characters are very irritating. For example, Kagome: Overloads too much to my taste; acts as Yuka of Elfen Lied. Inuyasha: It's a loud demon with a huge sword. What's so unique about it? Has ADORABLE DOG EARS! Tch. Sesshomaru is all speech, no action and very cocky. Naraku just had to be the prettiest villain ever in the anime world. Miroku and Sango ... have some color, but they seem to be too far away. But what regrets me most if they don't have a common picture at all. Rumiko Takahashi made LOT better than this. I've seen it before. <br /> <br /> If you like a series with many events, no unpleasant love triangle, not repeatability, then it's not for you.
