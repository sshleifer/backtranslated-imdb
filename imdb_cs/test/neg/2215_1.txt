There is something about Doug McLure's appearance in the film, which is a guarantee of poorness. His initials DG are like a special film certification that comes somewhere before "U". In contrast, Cushing suffered from both dilatation and poor judgment. Like dr. Van Helsing did an excellent job in Hammer's films. I saw him make a very passable Sherlock Holmes in 'Hound Of The Baskervilles'. And his magnum opus was probably Grand Moff Tarkin in the first 'Star Wars'. The only man, but the emperor who could tell Darth Vadar to "quit bickering" and escape him. But - crikey! - He did a few turkeys. There was that pitiful 'Daleks' movie for one. And here's another. There's a machine that's been kidnapped from Tracy Island. It is a cylinder with a screw on the front and a traction device on the sides. I'm surprised that Jerry Anderson wasn't looking for plagiarism. Maybe he was bought. But if the film is a guide, they can't pay much. It's 1976 and we're still playing in latex suits. It's really about it. Some movies have fun in the "so bad that it is good" category. He can't even make it. Even children wouldn't like it. The "Crash Corrigan" of the 1930s has more to do.
