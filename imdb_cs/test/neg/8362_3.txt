Congratulations to Christina Ricci for making this movie and putting her mojo behind this important subject and trying to create a great movie. Ricci is my favorite actress: She is so gifted, so natural that her reactions are perfect, and so is the energy she constantly emanates, which gives confidence to the frequently used term "star". The film lacks its mark for many different reasons, but perhaps most remarkably for the story is the seemingly unacceptable on screen to make it a compelling story ... more about it later. The cast at first sight is excellent, but think that Jessica Lang as a Jewish mother is too Protestant and not quite right, Ann Hetch is approaching to show the psychiatrist's compassion and dedication from the book, and when you make a movie, how can you justify not telling Anne Heche and Jessica Lange? But the real problems are in the construction of the film: the first in not trying to provoke any lasting sympathy for the character of Elizabeth Wurtzle, and secondly to say something meaningful about the too common and terrible situation in which this poor girl finds herself. Br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the flashback construction did, Lizzy just disappears as surely a more affected teenager than most, but not nearly as devastatingly ill as she gets lost in the book. It is a big problem. This story had to be told from the beginning to the end and from the therapist's couch. She is only eight or nine when her depression starts because of devastating social factors, society and home, and this is a key point not only to provoke proper sympathy for her, but also for the gravity of her case. She is so talented and so vulnerable and dissatisfied soul so soon that her heart can't help but get to her because of her victimization. The film is missing. Finally, one has to deal with what the film is trying to say: it is a biography of one seriously affected girl, but also a film about the nation. who cannot act together; this is very clear in the book, but not interesting in a movie where the Harvard selected are even more confused than the average school enrolled. The film is finally unable to get one of these messages over convincingly, and that is too bad. Is Prozac a good thing or is it a bad thing, or a mixed blessing or seeming necessity in a country where so many people can't function without a chemical crutch? These are hard and challenging concepts that work and writing doesn't really try to reach one of them more or less engagingly. The Challenger disaster is an interesting image that symbolizes a dysfunctional America, but it does not affect the fact that this should be due to the cross-section and lack of prior control topics. Ricci's performance is tight and honest, and one of the best of her acting career. Michele Williams is also excellent in her role.
