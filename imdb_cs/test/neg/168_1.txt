This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, probably overcoming the horrible and utterly meaningless Blueberry. How can Harald Zwart even put his name on this crap. I feel every ounce of reverence I have for him. So what is it with this film that makes it so poor? Is it a story? Yes. Are they actors? Yes. Is it the whole "look and feel" of the movie? Yes. To start with the story, my God, it's about as cliche-ridden and predictable as what you'd expect from a drunk 14-year-old who's late writing his / her paper on "What I did this summer, the feeling of a good atmosphere that the filmmakers are only trying to drown when we suffer another awkward turn to the story. the same quality as the professional actors, but to make it work, the characters are to be charming and / or funny (preferably both), so viewers don't mind brazen acting, or perhaps even add characters to the characters. and by the end of the movie (I think it's about 90 minutes, even if it feels like 4 hours) you have a strong desire to hurt someone to think of those annoying stupid people! If you are really like the stupid hickeys, their previous mention of lack of talent and credibility in acting only makes the stupid and too simple scenes fall hard on the ground. Even the family of the people involved will find it hard to find anything but very, very embarrassing (I'd rather my sister make a fool of herself on American Idol). Finally, why do cramps in a lot of poorly placed Norwegian celebrities? If possible, they look even more on-site than actors. These celebrity portraits just add to the inexpensive feeling of the movie and are in themselves quite visible-through the shot in the dark when trying to improve something broken before setting up. I can't even start to emphasize how much I'd rather watch the color hiding than I ever watch this movie ...
