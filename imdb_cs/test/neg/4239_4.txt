First, a warning. "Getting married to a millionaire" comes at first sight with the apparently random 5-minute orchestral performance of "Street Scene", a piece of Gershwin-lite processed with full pomp and ceremony, well, Gershwin. Sitting in it takes some patience. If you have a DVD, you can be sure that you can skip forward. Don't miss anything. The film itself is one of the constant disappointments of the 1950s Hollywood, a film that has been supported by a great star power, opulent mission-en-scene and a perfect concept that has been a failure. The title itself is perfect. However, generations after generation are forced to ask themselves - how fragile is it? The scenario is a production throat albatross, a dead, stinking thing that suffocates everything and all before they can actually set fire to life. There are no comic situations, only rare moments that play for laughter. Whenever a real comedy scene threatens to appear, the film quickly moves to other, less interesting things. An example is the scene in which each of the three leading women brings a date to the same restaurant. One of them, shortsighted, refuses to wear vanity glasses. One of the data is married. A classic Hollywood farce setting, certainly complete with a bad identity, an angry woman, and probably a face cake for someone? Well, no. Instead, we have shortened these three dates when ladies "comically" respond to the things their partners say. Hit the stroke and crouch to another flabby joke. If in doubt, let Marilyn enter the wall. Where is Billy Wilder when you need him? The three stars are an almost perfect life cycle diagram of the classic Hollywood screen goddess. It was one of Marilyn Monroe's films, and the camera just dreams of it, even though the script doesn't do anything to her. It is so luminous that it seems to be hatched. On the other hand, Lauren Bacall has been a star for almost a decade and knows how to control the screen, even if she is in a frame with Monroe. He gets one thing that goes through a real role and brings some good lines with a cynical snap - with the right material to bring that thing to life. She is a curiously ageless actress - when she lies about her age in the film and claims to be forty, she is not immediately ridiculous - and much less girls than her companions, giving her a compelling authority. Betty Grable was far from aging, but she played eight years on her co-starsch, bringing her to an end to her Hollywood career. Sometimes there is despair in her, stranded on the screen, nothing but toothpaste, a smile and a few pieces of comic timing, unable to play her real age, but to fool anyone as a contemporary of this new, sharper generation of actresses, relying on the same old schtick that served eat her during her career (for Marilyn-doubters, seeing two juxtaposed in this movie helps throw Monroe's gentleness and - yes - intelligence into sharp relief). She is also torn with dead wood in terms of male co-stars (although all men - even the great William Powell - are guilty of lazy performances); she is unable to strike any comics out of them. It's better to give her the role of under-utilized Monroe, which could be fun by itself, and left Grable with Mr. Magoo's repetitive routine. That the movie is as fun as it can be postponed to seductive Hollywood production, which is also the way one who likes "Moonlight" takes care of it. But somewhere, buried under poor jokes and professionalism, lies a rough sketch of a sharp, cynical comedy about the marriage business that Bacall could sing - and the new generation of viewers will sit down with "How to marry a millionaire" in anticipation of the film, ready to be disappointed again.
