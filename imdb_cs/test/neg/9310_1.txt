I can't emphasize how bad this movie is. This director took every cheap little, unintelligent shot to make these people look so "desperate." Why are their clothes so dirty? Why would you get a new clark kent on the ground to play a crack head? You should be banned from movies for the rest of your life by Buddy Giovinazzo. I'm taking a serious assault on this fool who wants to throw real actors like thugs and lowlifes like some clever joke. Why would you ask Clark Kent to play a crackhead? Why does he scream so much? Why is that so? Why are these kids so dirty? No one would want to be so dirty? Not even a crackhead baby. <br /> <br /> You have to grow up and do some movies ever again.
