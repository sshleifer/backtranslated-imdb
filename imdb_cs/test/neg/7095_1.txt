This movie rips out every gangster / gangster movie ever made. MP Da Last Don has a link to every movie. The meeting was by far the worst I've seen. Who the hell is John Mario? His actions were by far the worst I've ever seen. Makes bad actors look good. As far as Master P goes, it sells faster than N * sync. I really wish I was there to tell the whole production company: WHAT WOULD YOU THINK WHEN YOU THINK THAT YOU WANT IN SCRIPT? One thing I know is that there was no one who wanted to distribute this movie, so it seems (and how predictable) that guys at NO LIMIT had to start, NO LIMIT FILMS. This movie is terrible and doesn't deserve to be called a movie!
