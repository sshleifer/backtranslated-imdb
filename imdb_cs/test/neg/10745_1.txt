Dear Mr. Dante, <br /> <br /> Dude, seriously ... the title of the exhibition is "Masters of Horror". And so be it to be an opportunity to show your horror chops, show the world why you deserve to be called the "master" of the genre. You have not explicitly understood the exercises. Apparently you thought it was your opportunity (or worse, your duty) to educate the American public about your political beliefs. And your attempt comes as disgusting, prevalent and above all preaching. The only reason ANYONE has marked your short score as a high score is that their political views correspond to yours and are the type of people who think that they have such a kind of policy thrust into their throats. I, on the other hand, will not give damn what you believe, believe or believe ... I just want such obvious (not subtle) and indecent (not satirical) messages from my horror. And although there were certainly other "Masters of Horror" that were great time disappointments, or where I was just generally confused, why would the director (william malone?) Be considered a "master" genre ... yours didn't go far beyond the rest is missing the whole point of the series. So next time ... can you just keep your preaching policy to yourself?
