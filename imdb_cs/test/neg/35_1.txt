Maniratnam, which is often compared to major world filmmakers in India and is considered a genius in filmmaking, has once again demonstrated that it can only create a visually good image without offering much food for thought. the pleasure that can be derived from cinema as a very old form of art. Although I wouldn't want to say and portray myself as someone who has seen all the beautiful movies made around the world, a still thoughtful and slightly educated film visitor can find out that his films don't have an innovative inventive plot after them it does not contain enduring effects and MOSTLY contains a ridiculous ending and LOT melodrama, which are widely seen in Indian movies. Overall, Maniratnam once again confirmed my dislike for his films again. We apologize for those who have said otherwise on this advice. My suggestion for you: WATCHING SOME BEAUTIFUL CINEMAS MADE ON GLOBE.
