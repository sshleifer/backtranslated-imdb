The sites were the villages of Liberty and Ramseur and the surrounding countryside. It's not a good movie. This was Merle Haggard and it brought life inland for a few minutes. <br /> <br /> There is a standard shootemup on the property.

Local people were thrilled to be part of the business. <br /> <br /> If viewers have difficulty finding a copy of this movie, a copy of the record is available in Asheboro, NC. Actors not credited include Ben Jones, Mimi Truth, Tommy Hull, Bill Monastery.
