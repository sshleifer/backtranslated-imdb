I just rented Blackwater Valley Exorcism because the cover and pictures looked scary and I don't normally see movies that are automatically released on DVD, but this looked so interesting and scary! I was very in the mood for a good scary movie and for me the property is one of the most scary things you can learn about. Just look at Exorcist or Exorcism by Emily Rose, both amazing movies that made the breakthrough not only horror wise, but the story as well. Blackwater Valley Exorcism is about a girl, Isabelle, who from getting go is automatically obsessed, so we can't even tell what kind of person she should have started. But the former wife boss turned to the priest's gardener ...? I know, I know. Then they go to several other stories with Isabella, priest and sister, and the priest struck sister and fiddled with Isabelle? I'm not sure then we'll get into a story with Isabel's father and his questioning the loyalty of his wife. I mean, the story goes into many directions and wasn't well developed. at all. Not to mention that exorcism did not seem to be absolutely authentic and more than just scare your pants out of a movie I didn't like at all because I couldn't take it seriously. The one who ordered and wrote it apparently had no idea where to go or how to drive the story, so I wouldn't really recommend it. <br /> <br /> 2/10
