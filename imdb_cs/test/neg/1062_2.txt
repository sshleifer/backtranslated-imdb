It is as if the Lost Marshmallow Man of Ghostbusters was reincarnated in Rutger Hauer's body and avenge his opponent's pregnant wife! If you see obese Hauer chasing a very pregnant Isabel Glaser (imagine the backbone excitement of this competition) sounds good, check out this movie! Seriously, if Hauer is what an Iraqi prisoner of war looks like after six years in prison, then hungry people everywhere should create a beekeeping line in Baghdad prison. Overall, "Tactical Assault" rated 2 stars instead of 1 because Mike Mitchell as Hawk is amazing. Mitchell fires the screen as a NATO pilot until his plane fires (enemy rocket), whereupon the film loses what has to be started.
