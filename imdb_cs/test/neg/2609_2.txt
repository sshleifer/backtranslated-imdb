As a child, I never understood why anyone would look at this very miserable show. It was pretty stupid, and I always wanted Spridle and Jim-Jim to get into some fatal accident (they were SO annoying). Now, almost 40 years later, I have a new attitude to the theme of cartoon fairy tale. Although I still think it was a total crap, it's just with regard to the American version of the show. This is because I read an anime book and found that the exhibitions we watched were totally different from those originally shown in Japan. You see, the idiots in charge of the series syndication thought they were too violent, so they cut off the episodes. That's pretty bad, but what else they do is out of the faith - they actually cut the episodes apart and put them together to create programs that are NOT as originals! For example, one episode may be made up of parts of episodes 3, 6, 18 and 27! As a result, I really don't know if the original show really was bad - it could be brilliant. But who can say that all we have to watch is this Americanized mess?
