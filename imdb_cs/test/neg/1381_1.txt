Besides being a liar, this guy is also a total idiot and a thief in a comedy community. Once, when I was trying to watch this TV show excuse, I believe I actually threw a little in my mouth. I can't help but feel a little stupid every time I see one of his horrible ads while enjoying great comedy central programs like Reno 911 and the American body shop. Looks like I'm concerned about the constant existence of humanity. It's hard to believe that Joe Rogan can even look like a moron. Please start praying now when the central comedy makes its mistake and ends up this show as soon as possible. Didn't we suffer enough?
