It's definitely not your typical Polizia, Redneck never worked for me. The film tells the story of a gem that went wrong and a young boy who is inadvertently kidnapped in the process. In an attempt to escape, the robbers leave a bloody trail of death in their wake as they plan to buy a boy. This plan never starts because the robbers intend to get to France and the boy intends to stay with them. Although I could quote a number of issues I had with the movie, will I focus on the most obvious? the character of Memphis played by Telly Savalas. From his work at The Dirty Dozen and Kelley's Heroes to other Italian films such as Crime Boss and his most memorable role as Kojak, Savalas was the winner. I always thought of him as one uber-cool customer. Unfortunately, Savalas is almost unobservable in Redneck. Did the director turn the camera on and motion him to act as psychotically as possible? Perhaps it was not too bad for his actions to be carried out in the context of the conspiracy I was caring for, but it seems bizarre to be bizarre. It seems to be random madness. And what about the accent? Savalas could have been a lot of things, but Southern isn't one of them. It sounds totally ridiculous, even when trying to accent. Besides, I found out I wasn't interested in the rest of the movie. As I have already indicated, the plot never attracted me. I just didn't care about what was happening. And the notion that a boy is so quickly attracted to a criminal lifestyle is not true. As for the other actors, Mark Lester is almost as bad as Savalas and usually a reliable Franco Nero is not much better. Three actors "name" and not good performance among them. To make matters worse, I believe the director has shot many night scenes with nothing but the glow of his watch to light the shots. I couldn't tell what was going on. The characters I hate, the plot I don't care about, and the production values ​​that have failed? No wonder I gave Redneck 3/10.
