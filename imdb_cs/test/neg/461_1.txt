I'm the kind of person who can enjoy a good B movie if he has some redeeming value for him, but Dead Space has nothing to redeem! This is the kind of film that will make you frustrated, restless and sick into your stomach. Bad behavior. Lame story. Terrible effects. Terrible, unbearable dialogue. Dead space has it all!
