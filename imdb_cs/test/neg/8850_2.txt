It would be promising if it were a student film. It seems he never knows where he is going, as if they decided on every other scene they did. As a result, many repetitions and a soothing pace. There is a totally confusing way in which ghosts affect people in this world: internet, phone calls, computer science experiment, suspicious graduate student, downloaded behavior, red rooms, dark spots and suicides. Good luck is finding out the connection, or when the character is still a ghost or just strange. Characters are barely outlined, which may be OK, but they are totally uninteresting. It is too long and ends when it reaches a promising scenario, although the conclusion is pointless. The weakest moment: when the "boss" sits down to provide some incoherent advice.
