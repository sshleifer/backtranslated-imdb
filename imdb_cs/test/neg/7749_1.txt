The director of this celluloid waste specializes in terrible exploitation films where everything is prejudiced; last year he made "Dangerously Close", whose good idea (about the gangs who get the power of schools at school and the school editor against them) was immersed in the sea of ​​distrust and he would continue "Cyborg", Jean Claude Van Damme's worst movie at all (no intermediate power). This little girl comedy - Kathy Ireland in her film debut - who is a total uproar whose inner little girl is just awakened after she falls into the center of the Earth and has a set of poorly filmed, impossible follow-up adventures (Above all, a set of dwarfs who want her Because He Has Big Bones - Go Figure!) Before He Returns Home Changed for the Better is not funny, clamping or fun in the least. And anyone who looks to saliva over Miss Irish will also be postponed - not because of her voice, but because she spends most of the film buried beneath tons of baggy clothes, with huge goggles for insertion. No wonder Cannon, the producers, is out of order. Surprisingly, Kathy Ireland has made better movies ever since ... or maybe it's not that amazing. Besides that, "Barb Wire" is "Aliens".
