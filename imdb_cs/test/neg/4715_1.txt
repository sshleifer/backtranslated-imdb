This film was a great disappointment. The storyline sounded great, about half-human, half-leopard creature in Africa that becomes the subject of documentary by young Americans adults. When many crew members are found dead, two survivors are taken into questioning. I wouldn't even call it horror because most of the movie is actually a (mis) adventure of the above-mentioned, narcissistic 20-somethings that include sex and animal dung smoking to get high (not as fun as it sounds - believe me). You rarely see a creature, and the main actor (who also becomes a director, screenwriter, editor, and producer) is incredibly annoying. Finally, I was so upset, the dialogue that I quickly got to the end. I guessed the end in less than 10 minutes to the movie ... and I was right. So, this horrible movie is also totally predictable - as if it wasn't bad enough. Moral Story: Avoid movies that are behaved, directed, edited, produced and written by anyone else. And avoid this film unless it is held at the gun.
