Absolutely disregarding the entire video adaptation of the video game, this is another horrible film by Mr. Boll. As he is still busy making movies, he is a constant surprise to me and probably most of the film that is happening in the community. As a whole, I will say that this attempt was a fraction better than so many of his previous attempts. Some of the dialogues in Far Cry were even polite even though some phrases are still abusing and in some cases not even using phrases. Now, besides Jack Carver being an American and not a German, Til was still entertaining in this role. An exception is the laughter of lame lines he uses to get to bed with a girl. Should we believe that she is prepared to have sex so sloppy after such a minimal dialogue? Emile? Just there for the comical relief I'm sure and still lame. Jack's character looks old and tired, yet he is capable of extreme acrobatics, which is necessary to avoid one of the altered super soldiers in the lab. Don't follow this for Far Cry adaptation. But you may be wasting an hour and a half and watching if you have nothing to do.
