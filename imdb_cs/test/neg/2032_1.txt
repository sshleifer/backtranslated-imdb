That was the most interesting horror movie I've ever seen. After about 1 minute, this space is remarkably forgotten. Acting is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when two guys kiss, yuck! What did the judges of the film festival think when they gave this waste to "the best film"? The only reason I didn't turn this movie off was to see what it was NOT to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper line could actually continue as it was. I was not disappointed with this term. There was no one piece of nudity or gore to make the boys interested! I also thought it was cheap to use about 3 minutes "Resident Evil 2" in the movie ... Was it supposed to be a filler? because it was the bloodiest and most interesting part of the movie.
