For the most part, "Michael" is a disaster? Ten minutes of magic and ninety negative mistakes. Travolta and MacDowell do their best. But the film moves like a snail. And even in a fantasy context, characters behave irregularly regularly. (Reporters who routinely leave a life story? An apparent angel living on Earth? From their eyes?) Someone forgot to tell the romantic comedy maestro Ephron that William Hurt, brilliant in so many other films, is not Tom Hanks . The movie's "climax" redefines the word created. Ephron can shoot in Heaven, but unfortunately "Michael" is a long, long ride through the cinema.
