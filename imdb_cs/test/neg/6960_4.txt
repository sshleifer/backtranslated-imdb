A respectable but overrated dramatic thriller, the film attempts to depict spinning off-checking inner demons of the tortured artist. The problem is that neither the relationship displayed on the screen is believable and the plausibility seems to be thrown out of the window. The title character is so difficult to relate to that it is quite impossible to imagine one of the characters emotionally investing in the screen. The conclusion is also quite predictable; there is certainly enough clues provided from getting go to show exactly where the story is being led. Choosing to completely suspend faith in a situation or relationship, the film itself works well (especially with the leaders) and can create some nice tension as the story unfolds. As a metaphorical feature, there is some food to think about, and if the scenario is stronger, there is certainly a potential that could be better used.
