The actors and actresses from this series are fine, but the scripts were absolutely awful. This family is so dysfunctional they're not even funny. In fact, scripts very often illustrate how to be a parent. The scripts are so bad that Homer Simpson looks like a better father than this one. the perfect guide. I think the garbage of this show feeds us, it's behind the words. Michael Rapaport saw much better material in his career (including his role in HITCH). They need a strong lead in better, much better scenarios than what I saw at this point. grapes.
