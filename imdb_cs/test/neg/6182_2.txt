Great disappointment. CLASH BY NIGHT is a lot of talks and stags, and the dialogue from these characters doesn't seem to be true. This is a melodrama on top. Acting is really at the top and very unreal. Only MARILYN MONROE and KEITH ANDES as supporting players give this movie any zip. He wished they had something to do. I'm someone who looks at the details in the movies. Two big questions ... 1 Who looks at the baby all day when Stanwyck and Ryan are together and Douglas works, then break the bar fight with father? 2. When Stanwyck wraps the city, why does she see how she wrapped herself in the place of the brothers, where she hasn't lived for two years? Also, when everyone goes to a theater in a theater that takes care of the child again? Such details really irritate me and cause films to give much lower ratings. What were the writers, directors, and everyone else related to the film? Nuf said.
