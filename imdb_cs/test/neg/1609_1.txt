I'll start by admitting that I tend to enjoy action movies (military or other). I'm a guy. But this was terrible. I saw it for free, showtime or hbo and I still feel I paid too much. It was an extended episode of a general hospital. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 because 0 or 0.1 was not possible. How or why 59 others would give him a rating of between 5 and 6 misconceptions. If it's not the whole family cast or crew. It could be, this film was so bad that many saved ....... and as such were too uninvested to bother. I'm sorry to repeat, but at least 10 lines seem stupid, for what's basically shrinking to a warning ... ... in the hope of saving another 2h black hole this film presents. Believe me, yell at the empty wall, there'll be more action.
