When the American film industry tries to look critically at its own government, they are sure to say that it looks good even if it's bad. The film does one thing right, proving what's wrong with American politics. The motto seems to be f ** k with anyone who does it! Mix American Congressmen, CIA Agent, Jew and Arab ... just to be Russian. Thanks to the US for giving us Osama bin Laden. The disappointment of the film comes in the face of tricky problems: using images of Afghan children without weapons and stories of Soviet atrocities, and then an obvious attempt to suggest a link between those and the arguments of American aid. Every reasonable person knows why $ 1,000,000,000 was raised ... not dying Afghan children who are certain. As usual, serious problems are covered by the facade of the dialogue crap. "Here is for you, M *** r F ***** with" Hoffmam singing in the end, all that is missing is the American flag in the background and silly military solutes. Movies cannot help but leave the taste of American pride and joy of how we (Americans) saved the world ... once again. The last 5 minutes of the movie can't save him where he tries to stop praising and waking up to his next American F ** up. <br /> <br /> and editing was good.
