This spy melodrama has a nice, almost promising cast and should have been very atmospheric; there is the will or intention of the atmosphere? and also want or lack it. Sheen plays a dissident who is now activated as an agent, a loner, loves women but is promoted; Mrs. Fossey is his mistress. Neill plays a gallant, generous, knightly Soviet agent. Sheen and Neill are both basically uncomfortable; Finlay makes a portrait, and so do other well-known actors. Mrs. Fossey is hot; But then again, it always is. Will I be your true friend and break you? Flick is low on tension and excitement, it's trivial and quite boring; The good thing is, you see Mrs. Fossey naked. In addition, a lukewarm derivative of espionage exploitation.
