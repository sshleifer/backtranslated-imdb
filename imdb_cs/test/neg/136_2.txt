I'm trying to find something of value here. The best thing I can see is that Truffaut wanted the film to be so boring, painful, obscene, unpleasant, illogical, and thoughtless as love experience. If that was his goal, then he succeeded, but the solution to his workout is really a drag that you're looking at. There is one scene that screams for spoof: Belmondo compares the features of Deneuve's face to face-to-face features in the landscape. All I could think of was the "glacier", "ice floe", "two lone fishermen who had an army surplus on a frozen lake in Minnesota all the time." The only other point of interest was the resurrection of Buffoon's theory of climate determinism. Trophies are presented as paradise, and things are getting worse when they are cooler, Calvinist French Switzerland is hellish. That was a little funny.
