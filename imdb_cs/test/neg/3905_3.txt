Hypothetical situations abound, one-time director Harry Ralston gives us the ultimate post-apocalyptic view of the dead world, left in the streets, in shops and across the countryside, sans in the middle of a forgotten desert. One lone survivor trying to revive his common sense takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert. Everything alone, hoping for another, but with no one around, he is left with white underwear, and a passion for the local Indian tribe? until the discovery of a camera that opens new doors and breaks the barriers of human coexistence. Alan, the man of the book, is after an unknown catastrophe on Earth. Does he think he is alone, is he starting to live his life? until Jeri Ryan appears (as if in any dream) from the forest, disheveled and unhappy to find the last man alive to be ... well ... like Alan. Anyway, he's trying to coexist, fail, get drunk and get to Redneck Raphael (starring Dan Montgomery Jr) before creating a final dystopia. The bonds are torn, the confusion fits, the couple becomes the third round, and the battle between the physically awkward nerd and the bullshit. Even if no one remains on the planet, it becomes true that even the darkest human nature will appear. Ralston gives us an average story freely based on another movie called Quiet Earth "(which I will be looking at later) with the help of variable film technique, strangely never giving any credit. With a borrowed story, I think he's doing It seems his strike is missing at the beginning, while Ralston tries to find his step and borrow again from other film director techniques to try to find his own. Sure, the last days have arrived, but there could be a brief answer to the question of "how" or even better "why" these selected ones have survived. The more horrific start would have led us stronger into the comic movie. "but instead let us feel as if we were watching a" made-for-TV "program. Alston, because he worked hard to make this movie, and his passion almost sells the movie, but from his interaction with the cast you can say he wasn't so happy with his overall final product. There were mistakes, the ones he pointed out, and others, for which he was ashamed to point out. Although it does for a decent independent filmmaking, it is sometimes cheap and in the case of Ralston it was second. I must admit that David Arnott's portrait of Alan hooked me up. He played very well this stupidity, school nerd, adult role. He was amusing when he looked and listened, and so he liked the viewer. He was a key player in keeping the film together, unfortunately, I can't say the same for the rest. That was Dan Montgomery's first movie and was it obvious? I think ?? really really clear. There were scenes in which I thought my dad was going to go out and read the lines for him, maybe even give us a more realistic performance, but unfortunately it wasn't. Then there was Jeri Ryan. By the end of the film she had stretched out her character, which for me was the culmination of an entire work of art. She goes from the alienated unknown bitter crazy girlfriend crazy to the end. Confused? Eventually, she got into her character to the end, giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her actions matured. Even as the commentary continued, everything she contributed was laughing, giggling, or "ohhh, look at that color" moment. While her beauty can sell tickets, one may want to consider knowledge as beautiful. That was her first movie, so can I be too cruel? Overall, this movie seems to be missing. Even though the idea was strong? the assumption that although there are still few people on Earth, the evil of human nature still exists. Jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs (perhaps because it is consumed by zinc?) And we as a race will always want what we cannot have. Ralston is not a surprising director, his techniques are wrong and used, but he knows how to make a low budget comedy. I think our idea of ​​"funny" is different, so I couldn't laugh in many pieces he found "hysterical". His actors provided a level of acting film that was below average. His film was free, which means that there were elements that were never fully explained or resolved (ie Something with the Wings survived?!?), Which overall damaged the intensity of the film. It was a comedy, but it could have been much darker and more fun. For those who thought Roger Avery was a huge element of this movie, as we learned from their commentary, all that was there was money? it was basically the "Last Man" bank. Don't let your hopes for all the classic Avery moments. <br /> <br /> Don't expect more from Ralston ?? And that's how I end up. <br /> <br /> Class: ** outside *****
