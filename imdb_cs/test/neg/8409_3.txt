Pretty neglected continuation of Roman Polanski's classic film. Rosemary's son Adrian grew up and is embodied in the fearsome Stephen McHatti. After removing Rosemary (played by Patty Duke) couch of the witches, he again led by Minnie and Roman Castevets, preps Satan's son for world domination. It's not really scary and light years more miserable than its predecessor. Instead, writer Anthony Wilson and director Sam O'Steen opt for a Satan-worship thriller full of lots of singing, lots of candles, and Ruth Gordon tries to act daffy and ugly at the same time. Gordon is the only stop from the original. George Maharis replaces John Cassavetes as Guy and very nice Ray Milland plays Roman Castevets, a subordinate for the late Sidney Blackmer. McHattie's newcomer is the only true saving grace of the film. He is very persistent and looks really ominous without doing anything. Charles Bernstein's music is suitably scary, but exaggerated, it's more disturbing than effective. O'Steen, who edited the former Polanski masterpiece, shows no talent or subtlety.
