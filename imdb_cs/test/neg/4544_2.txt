Fabric! Quite boring, as well as being shot in black and white, was so colorless. The film begins with a rolled text that explains cryogenius and asks whether God or Satan is behind it. There are some protests at the cryogenics lab. Some people robbed the bank and many thieves and guards were shot. The father of one of the thieves (I think) will make his son freeze. There's plenty of jumping in the beginning from scene to scene where characters appear without knowing how they relate. There is a power outage, and canisters that contain frozen people are struck by lightning and appear as zombies. They all have mylar-like silver suits and their skin is dark green and wrinkled (they have no idea why they look so bad - that they probably didn't keep their appearance frozen) and have silver eyes. They go around killing people, sometimes lurking like zombies, sometimes moving like normal people. Linda Blair is constantly appearing once in a while, for what purpose I'm not really sure. I think her character works in the cryogenics lab, but it's not very important for the plot, and her role is very small. The movie ends with some freeze frames with text subtitles that tell us what happened to characters who are pretty stupid.
