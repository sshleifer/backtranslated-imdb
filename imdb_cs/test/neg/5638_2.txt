Come in. How did all these talented actors / actresses end up in this mess? Was it some sort of blackmail / lost bet? Vinnie, you're a muscular man. Be what you were born to be. <br /> <br /> Whirlpool Scene? Scrabble Scene? I expected to hear the sound of a "needle dragging a record" at any moment. And what was wrong with him carried the invaluable Dickens manuscript with him? Let's see, I'm drunk at the bar, why not pull out the unforgettable Dickens manuscript? Meet some of the dubious offenders on the edge of the Thames, why don't I take my unforgettable Dickens' manuscript? <br /> <br /> Crapola. <br /> <br /> Terrible. Avoid.
