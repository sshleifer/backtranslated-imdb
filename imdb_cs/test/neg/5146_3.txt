During production, this series of LWT was titled 'Rocket to the Moon', a title that all of the settings at the time thought were cheesy enough. Then came the word that it was retitled 'Reach for the Moon', as if this addition of this new word had triggered metaphorical meanings involving the relationships and aspirations of the characters. The same heavy handed lack of subtlety and understanding is clear throughout the entire series, and the same tired and boring love-triangle story is actually stretched out over 7 episodes! Any TV program that decides to use the story of a "love triangle" for one episode shifts it, but is unforgivable to smash it over seven episodes. There are reasons to watch, but the scenery of the Isle of Wight is sure to provide a wonderful setting and to present Lynd Bellingham with all the right comedy brands seemingly effortlessly. But that is not enough. The number of shows is noticeable, especially when placed against the static and emotional wasteland which Jonathan Kerrigan refers to as his face. I have already mentioned Lynda Bellingham as "frantic mother" (yes, that is in terms of character development and back story), but I was impressed by actor Maurice Roeves (who is by far the most experienced actor in the world). The cast, having appeared in everything from classic movies such as Richard Attenborough's 'Oh, What's Beautiful War', and 'Eagle Has Landed', and television including Baywatch, Holby City, Bill, Eastenders, Cheers, Doctor Who in the 80s Star Trek, and even going to Hollywood with Sylvestor Stallone in 1995 by Judge Dredd), whose performance reminded me of many real teachers I met - often incompetent men whose lives are colored with a very sad stripe. It is refreshing to see that Roeves is still working, and has also appeared in the British film 'The Acid House' in 1998, and more recently, along with the beautiful Mary Bello and Sean Bean in The Dark. Exceptional reason to watch this series, though his performance is very little. Another actor trying to raise the program most difficult is Ben Miles, in the role of the sexual crazy "typical male" brother (again, what the original character is!). As with Roeves, CV says it all. After raising this, Miles has since appeared in the Hollywood movie 'V for Vendetta', and the 2001 star studded film 'The Necklace Affair', alongside Brian Cox, Adrien Brody, Christopher Walken and Jonathan Pryce. Unfortunately, the relatively capable actors I mentioned resign to relatively small roles compared to the dramatic driftwood Kerrigan and Saira Todd, both of whom seem to have been in Casualty for too long and have not yet learned to act. Even tolerable Frances Gray is ready to suffer in the presence of such theatrical fetal mannequins, and unfortunately for her, the permanent memory of her from the ensemble is AD, which asks for a further shot of a relatively complex shot, because during Take, subconsciously "pulled the cracks off the cracks ! ”. Famous faces appear in every episode - CBBC child actors and dramas like "2 point 4 kids", and other lines from ads like Mr. Ben's ("They'll remember me"), Lynda 'Oxo Lady "Bellingham, and others that I don't even want to remember. Every episode initially seeks to “solve problems” such as teenage pregnancy, disruptive pupils, and rocket construction (!)… Things that Grange Hill did better when my parents were young! Overall, this series was a disappointing and wasted opportunity to create a truly interesting and well-developed drama series. Unfortunately, they took an easy way for them, both in writing and (mostly) casting. I would recommend both "Waterloo Road" and "The Street" to fans of good drama - especially those who have achieved it. If you like Wight Island, not 'reach the moon', reach for a holiday brochure instead - it probably contains more character development!
