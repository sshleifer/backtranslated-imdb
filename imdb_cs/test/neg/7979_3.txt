This was my first "Bollywood" movie and I found it just like many other recent viewers - through "Ghost World". After doing a bit of reading in the Bollywood film industry this week, I understand why there are seemingly unrelated musical numbers and romance and comedy in the horror movie. But "Something for Everyone" does not always mean a coherent product. The ultralight musical dance number "Jaan Pehechaan Ho" has captured the world in a way that it probably couldn't do. in 1965. It's all over the internet, with many people trying to get a good English translation. Laxmi Chhaya has an amazing work dance that takes after adoption, so it all looks fresh, new and fun, even if a normal person would be exhausted! Rules! On the beach with Miss Kitty is a light fun and nice tuning in complete contrast to the horror plot. A week later, however, I found myself in Hindi. I found a rough translation: <br /> <br /> if you want to live in this life, then listen to what I say, leave your sorrows behind and join the party and take my advice. Live living with laughter and singing letting your hair down and freeing people from this world, what do you know? come to me and I will explain to you, whoever sees me will stop worrying about the fish that float here. My second favorite movie number is The Butler's Dream, where Mehmood is fascinated by Miss Kitty's dance. Electric tiki-like idols are simply beautifully cheap, just like the whole set of this number. Online, I saw it described as what would happen if "Liberace Throwed" !! Fun mode. Gumnaam is not a good film as a whole. That's why I gave him a rating of 3. It's actually a real stink of film with some fun, kitschy music numbers that have nothing to do with the murder plot.
