Final Draft - The screenwriter (James Van Der Beek) locks himself in his apartment and succumbs to psychosis in an attempt to write a horror script. It's not a terrible assumption, but execution is terrible. This is like the first year and writing work, and probably is. The director jumps from everything to hell. It should have been disorienting. What it is is unpleasant. So much that small pieces of film are incoherent. Writing is predictable, and does not use watch on most of the ideas it offers (a bag of oranges). It is as if she has run out of time and slap-dash it together for the Toronto Film Festival. This film is not jaw-droppingly "oh my god it's so bad it's good" bad. It is boring bad and after a long time it irritates you. James Van Der Beek is not a terrible actor and holds the ship barely above the water. But the psychosis the film is trying to offer is too normal. He is just a withdrawn person who someday sees people and hallucinates things, and then decides to act slightly. Cause follows effect. Maybe there's something in the water. Darryn Lucio, who plays his "friend", is now a terrible actor. He shares the resemblance to Chris O'Donald and is even more annoying, superhuman success. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere the film provides is good (dull gray and dark), but it doesn't mean how it reaches anything. This film wants to be a Jacob's ladder or a machinist. It's not even a secret window. It's a preppy girl in the classroom to choose to turn goth. It is not absurdly horrible, but utter stupidity will be the tide on you. I have considered this criticism more than the creators did. <br /> <br /> D
