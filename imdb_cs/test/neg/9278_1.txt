This must be the most terrifying abuse of the comedy ever witnessed. It's not just funny and the screenwriters probably tried to use the name of the TV series to go to the box office for a few words. This film makes the sequel seem subtle as far as sexual allusion goes (no middle performance), and has all the corpse charisma with rigamortis. I'm afraid!
