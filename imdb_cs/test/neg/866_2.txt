This film must be one of the most boring and stupid movies that Perrugorria has done. It seems to be commercial from start to finish. He does not have the tempo, the rhythm, for the whole time spent on the tripod. It's illogical. such a mess. You can say what happens from the first 15 minutes, and the end ... Wow <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ------- <br /> <br /> Jesus Christ, How the hell was Perrugorria shot? Are you serious? The worst scene of someone who is ever shot! <br /> <br /> ------ spoiler ending ----- <br /> <br /> Bad overhead, bad script, bad gameplay ... Really bad overall. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. It's a waste of money and time.
