I love Japanese movies - I've seen at least 100-200. It is obvious that I am not afraid of Japanese films. However, sometimes there are Japanese concepts for film that have not been translated well into Westerners. Could be hits at home, but abroad they just don't seem, well, ... normal. It's like a live fish my wife ate at business meetings or odd PS2 games, such as dating simulators or Katamari Damacy - things that are accepted there and confused by non-Japanese. This is probably the way others see things that Americans take for granted, such as American football, fried Snicker bars and Paris Hilton! Yet ATAMA-YAMA may be the king of strange Japanese movies that don't seem to be right to Americans. Now the style of animation is not a problem - it's different but nice. No, it's the story itself and a rather bizarre ending. That's what makes it a really unusual movie, and it's like this: There was one stingy man who, for some obvious reason, had a tree that grew up from his head. At first it was little and simply cut it off, but it grew again and again - so he just decided to let it go. And after a while people began to live on their heads under the shadow of a tree. Surprisingly, when they were under the tree, they were tiny, but when they left, they were full-sized again. After it all gets sick and rips out the tree, the man drowns (!?) In the hole in the top of the head where the tree was! End. <br /> <br /> Look! I told you it was very, very special - but not like TAMPOPO or HAPPINESS OF KATAKURIS - just strange. O-D-D .... special! And if you do not have too much tolerance for this kind of thing, I doubt you will feel bad to know that this Oscar-nominated film has not won. Frankly, it makes me happy because I really don't want this movie to encourage similar movies. The only reason to earn 4 is due to a nice but not spectacular animation. This film caused me a brain ache ... I hope it's not a sign that I have a tree!
