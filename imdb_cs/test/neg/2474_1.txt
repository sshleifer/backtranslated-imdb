No, * Hitch * is definitely not a romantic comedy about bilious (and bibulous) former-Leftist-pundit-turned-reaction-pundit by Christopher Hitchens, though it certainly would do for a fun movie. The tiny Englishman, the dirty teeth of the cigarettes and the Guinness, the barking advice - and the acerbic political comments - to the lovelorns: "Look into her eyes when you talk to her, you nutter! And remember: call someone neo" "Conservative" makes you de facto antisemitem! Can't you get anything equal, you liberal pantywaist? "<br /> <br /> All right. Instead, we get Will Smith, whose success is at least a mystery to me. I am obviously alone in this regard. Smith is the most powerful man in Hollywood since this writing: Americans just can't help him throw money. On the other hand, his self-service is unbearable, unrestrained by a scene (spoiled by a trailer) where he suffers from a drastic allergic reaction to seafood. We know that Smith will return to his bad, over-good-looking appearance because there's a fat sit-com actor (Kevin James). We should laugh hysterically whenever they start to dance like hell ("Everybody Dance Now!" By CC Music Factory), but why would an accountant behave in a straight line like that? I've been working with several accountants for years, and I can tell you that if the Norman age sentence "claims boys don't dance," even a straight arrow accountant. Do I take all this too seriously? Or - and here is a bold thought - perhaps the writers could not imagine a logically drawn figure to save their lives? Speaking of writers, they come up with a lousy idea for Smith's love of interest: the writer for the tabloid (Eva Mendes). Since when does tabloid mold deserve love? In what universe am I? - Everyone here on the IMDb actually jets over this trio. Either you have to raise the bar when it comes to the value of entertainment for your buck, or I'm just a skunk at the garden party. (Me, and about 150 million other long-lived lovers and husbands.) Anyway, if I can imitate Smith's Hitch and offer my male readers some smooth advice: when you drag them to see * Hitch *, tell your Better Half, ‚Äù Hey, that was pretty good after the movie. Don't be overly excited; don't tell it - he'll know you're lying to her. Praise him in a slightly surprised way, as if the film was better than you expected, and it wasn't the torturous time it really was. But what am I saying, guys? - We know all the moves. <br /> <br /> 1 Star of 10.
