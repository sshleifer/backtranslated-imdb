Five fingers are so bad that I hardly know where to start. Let me first admit that I only saw the first half hour. When the first finger was cut off, I thought I had a more useful activity. I told my girlfriend the meaning of "five fingers" and immediately followed my example. Like me? They were supposed to use digital chess clocks and not analog ones. This big stupidity makes Martijn's mental pressure just laugh. How, when and why Martijn dates a Moroccan girlfriend? Such a matter is very rare in the Netherlands. Of course, calling me a retard is an insult to all people who suffer much less than the average IQ. In addition, as far as I know, the retards don't play chess. Of course, the biggest problem is the script. Just compare the little smart movie Hard Candy. In order to keep the viewer grip, the information must be revealed by piece. Nice twist now and then also helps. From other reviews, I realized that it was big at the end of the movie. Any clever man can guess what it is. This, of course, raises other questions - why is the wizard killed? Oh, why should I care? The whole film focuses on one thing: chopped fingers. The creators didn't even learn Hitchcock's lesson: it's exciting to get a bomb explosion. This is more exciting to show that the bomb ticking. But no, we don't see the paper cutter until the impossible countdown has passed. I'm not going to waste more words on this crap. Look at Hard Candy.
