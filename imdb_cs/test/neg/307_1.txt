I tried that at the Vancouver International Film Festival and I wasn't impressed. <br /> <br /> The only part of the movie I enjoyed was a commentary on the film. For the most part, it seemed that this movie was random and somewhat fantastic (I'm not saying it was free) and just stupid. It was as if he was mixing fantasy with everyday life, which may sound interesting in some movies, but fantasy seemed to be unnecessarily perverse. <br /> <br /> My criticism of this film is not on actors, but on the story itself. I found it boring and narcissistic. I wanted my money back, but since it was a film festival, it didn't happen.
