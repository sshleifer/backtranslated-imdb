Since I was too young to experience the new Hammer films, I discover their sacred horror movies as I found them on DVD. I know it was almost ten years and a half between them, but it's hard to see much of the magic in the original Hammer Dracula at this late entry into the series Christopher Lee. The original story of Hammer the Vampire had a lot of atmosphere and an amazing story to join. Lee was a brilliant Dracula, a vampire alive, if possible, at the beginning of the trip, but there is nothing more than a cardboard figure that usually stands around and looks menacing. Fashionable young people speak like cartoon characters (although my aunt lived in England during the 1970s and says people actually talked to those terrible clich√©s). I had absolutely no interest in who would live or die among the younger crowd. They were just as horrible characters. I was very happy to see the young and charismatic Caroline Munro; but leaves the story too soon. Lee and his historical nemesis Peter Cushing give the film an atmosphere of authenticity, but they can't draw blood from this empty film. It's D.O.A.
