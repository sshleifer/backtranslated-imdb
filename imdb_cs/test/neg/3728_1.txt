That was undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever been through. And that says a lot because I saw my share of horrible movies. But I've never seen a movie in which every character to be displayed would be an unintelligent loser. Seriously, there wasn't one decent character in the whole scenario. How appropriate that the plot was equally lame, lacking any intelligence at all. I can't believe Keanu Reeves and Cameron Diaz would even agree to participate in such stupidity. And when I didn't see all their other movies, I always enjoyed their performances. It's not that it was wrong, the whole story was moronic.
