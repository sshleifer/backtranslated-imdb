This film had very few moments of real drama. After the initial minutes, the film descended in a spiral that did not enter us into hell and back - viewing was at least purely purgatory. Acting was more terrifying than the theme of the movie and sometimes I couldn't stop laughing. Continuity between some scenes was desperate - the characters disappeared from the scenes without explanation to be replaced by other characters that were a little earlier. Surely it was a false exorcist. The collection plate in the church had to be full of copper on the day Mr. Russo signed up for this. I speak Latin? Et here Brutus.
