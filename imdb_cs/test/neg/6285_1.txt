The perfect 6-step recipe for the boring center of the road movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Take one burnt, rogue ex-cop with a bad attitude, but also a sensitive touch (cabinet concert pianist with a cat); 2. Add some "cool" retro aids such as the defeated Porsche 356, roaring bike, heavily repaired leather jacket and a pair of cowboy boots with holes in the soles; <br /> <br /> 3. Mix in several "free" locations, such as a modern sea-side apartment and a dedicated office dining room; 4. Bring it to life with "deep" socio-romantic themes, such as post-divorce-traumatized-but-finally-re-wife-ex-wife, secretly-admiring-and-for-forgiving- waitress, pair-of-former-colleague-cops-only-one-of-who-is-really-complete-jerk and best-buddy-getting-iced-over-a-suit-full-of-illegal - $$$; 5. Let him choke for about 90 minutes in a "fast-changing", though not necessarily logical or internally consistent sequence of average action scenes, cheap tender moments, and slow wise cracks; <br /> <br /> 6. Serve either with a comfortable pillow that lets you sleep right through it all or something a little more interesting (don't worry: even the yellow pages will do!).
