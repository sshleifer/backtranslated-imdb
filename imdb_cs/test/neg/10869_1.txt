When a movie called Hell Ride comes out, you expect a certain number of biker cliches. With the names of the characters like "Pistolero", "Comanche" and "Gent", I prepared for the worse and it was a blow to the face just by that. The dialogue, soundtrack and shooting style are standard for biker movies. The dusty desert faded from the fire as the wheels break down the road while "CC Rider" plays and talks about sex and violence. Yawn! These three clues were just ridiculous and incredible. When they saw old men like Bishop and Madsen (in an angry tousled shirt) walking down the dusty belt of a desert highway, they reminded me of two men desperate to relive their youth. Poor Eric Balfour tried his best, but with such bad material he got lost. Even Dennis Hopper's full swing Easy Rider couldn't save him. And let's talk about the store we bought, right? Many likened it to the work of Tarantino. It's not even close. What makes Tarantino's work so brilliant is that he knows it's over the top, so he just goes balls out and takes it as far as the top. The bishop took this film so seriously that it became nothing but a bad copy of the exploitation genre.
