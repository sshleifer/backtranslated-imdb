This movie was chosen, frankly, as a pig in poke from our local video store. It turned out to be quite a pig. The plot line - like - was discontinuous, inconsistent, and predictable. The actors always looked embarrassed to embark on badly written lines. The only fun moment in the whole movie was about the danger of smoking and unwanted deployment of the airbag. The rest of the film lacked a blow to entertain my young daughters (under ten years old), myself, my wife, my mother-in-law, or even a cat or a dog. My advice, if you're tempted to borrow Turkey, is to save money and time. Look at something else ...
