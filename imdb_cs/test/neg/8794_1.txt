In his feature debut "Yellow", Chris Chan Lee tries to shed light on the Hollywood portrayal of Asian-American Americans by deviating from the stereotypes typically shown in mainstream film. In this way, however, Lee commits a much more derogatory crime: they exaggerate Asian Americans' own stereotypes to incredibility. Result? Horribly one-dimensional figures and an incredibly shallow scenario trigger casting into the madness of an over-acting, resulting in a film that is physically painful to watch. positive reviews collected by `Yellow '; each falls into one of two camps. In one corner (eg here on imdb.com) you will find Asian-Americans who are so excited that Asian character can be displayed on the screen without thick glasses and math books that somehow neglect Lee's idiom of the final product. On the other hand, you will find film critics who simply thought it would be "bleached" to "yellow" the thorough wound they deserve; After all, it is a sharp Asian-American film created by an independent Asian-American filmmaker ... a protected area yet. An example of the case: the main character Sin Lee (Michael Chung). Writer / director Lee performs a monumental performance with Sino by adjusting "Yellow" so that Sin never appears on the screen unless he frowns or screams. You see sin hates the support of your friends. Scowl. Check out Sin Walk on the Beach and the Fetus. Scowl. (Screaming to follow.) See Sin closing his father's shop. Scowl. See Sin urinating. Scowl. See Sin Breathing. Scowl. Gee, I wonder if sin is full of Asian-American anxiety. You think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Scowl. Just to be thorough, Lee introduces Sin's father, Woon Lee (Soon-tek Oh). Throughout the film, while Sin just frowned or screaming, Mr. Lee frowns * and * yells. In fact, this is Woon's main role in "Yellow": simultaneous frown and shouting. Gee, I wonder if Woon is an Asian father with an authority complex. You think? I'm not sure. Scowl. Křiďte. <br /> <br /> If Lee's one-dimensional characters don't worry you, his story will be. Meet Mina (Mary Chen) and Joey (John Cho), the two characters who only exist in this film to spin a tangent and irrelevant love story into the movie. You see, Lee learned at the film school that every good movie must include some kind of love related to the text, and these two characters allow him to fulfill his duty. Mina and Joey are an intolerably Danish flirting dialogue consisting of insults that culminated in a kiss: Nerd! "Stupidhead!"; (eyes meet); (understanding the smile); (kissing follows). But be sure somewhere out there, Sin is frowning while it all goes. That neither Mina nor Joey contributes in any way to the plot of the film does not worry me as much as Lee's insistence on the most beautiful movie clichés to fulfill their listeners. And believe me, the flirting sequence is just the tip of the iceberg. Towards the end of the film, we find that Woon Lee tries to explain his constant frown and shout at Sin's girlfriend, Teri (Mia Suh), in which I am sure Lee wanted to be an annoying moment. What a surprise: Woon refers to a metaphorical story about his homeland to illustrate his point, ripping straight from the Digest reader, and his voice trembling in this strange paternal way. The camera moves into a mandatory shot of Teri's shaking hands. We feel we are forced to close our eyes, except that we realize that Woon's explanation has no meaning at all. But the lack of substance did not stop Lee from making the film, so why would he shorten this particularly inefficient scene? After all, the world can always use other clichés. Well, you're saying the movie can be painful, but at least it must be a technical masterpiece - say, "What Dreams Can Come." Sorry, on a technical basis, `Yellow 'disappointment also. Lee's adjustments are uncomfortable and disrupt what's in the movie, but I'm sure Lee thought they would look like hips. To make matters worse, each frame is either underexposed or overexposed. Although the light meter was invented in 1932, some new technology did not do it on the "yellow" file. <br /> <br /> In the light of the total lack of film, Actor Burt Bolos, who plays Alex's best friend, is encouraged to perform quite well. Even though Bolos is slightly overcome, you can't blame him when Lee's scenario consists only of scowl and screaming. Bolos' colleagues, on the other hand, show no restraint in their overclocking. <br /> <br /> In a very long time I didn't see the film as bad as "yellow". And I really do pray for me not to see the film as bad as "Yellow" for some time. Please disregard it; life is too short. Thank you.
