The exiled reporter, Bart Crosbie (Pat O 'Brien) blackmails the gang chief Heinz Webber (George Colouris) for the money he has to pay for his son's life-saving operation. In return, he agrees to turn to the murder of his editor, who the gang killed, in order to prevent the incriminating story from being printed on them. Typical poverty line b-pic time for much more than Terence Fisher, who in a few months would become one of the top British horror film directors in the Hammer studio. The screenplay is a far-drawn and teenage idol Tommy Steele (guitar in hand) was designed to sing a poor rock and roll number called "Rebel" to a cafe that acts as a legitimate front for gang activities.
