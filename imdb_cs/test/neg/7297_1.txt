Looking for a film for your film festival in Turkey? ROLLER BLADE SEVEN is on my list of the ten worst films of all time. The story, the story of a post-apocalyptic warrior of the samurai, is an intricate film reference of everything from STAR WARS to SEVEN SAMAURI. The effect varies from bland to abysmal. The scene in which a villain attempts an old man is embarrassing to the point where it is laughing. Black Knight Frank Stalone reminds too many black knight John Cleese in MONTY PYTHON AND WORLD GREEN. (Word of advice, Frank: When you lean into the movie, your career is over.) I understood on this little stink bomb on a low profile cable channel and couldn't stop watching. It's like watching a train wreck.
