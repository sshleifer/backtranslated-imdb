The basic plot of 'Marigold' boasts a romantic comedy where the film industry holds the background. American actress Marigold, played by Ali Carter, is stuck in India. Worse, he's no money. She then decides to play a small part in the Bollywood musical so that she can earn enough money to return to her nation. Here he meets with Indian choreographer Prem, played by Salman Khan. In principle, the movie fails at the script level. Just because the movie from Hollywood calls, Hollywood does not guarantee a quality cinema. Marigold stands out as the best example. The direction of art is weak and outdated. Musically, Marigold turns out to be a bagpipe. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy is far from being recognized as a decent hearing. Salman will deliver his amateur performance to date. Ali Larter is good and has a huge presence on the screen. Performance wise too, she's good.
