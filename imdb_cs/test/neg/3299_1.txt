I watched the first episode "The War at Home" because I thought it was worth replacing "Arrested Development", boy, I was disappointed. It should be clear to everyone that this show has been ruthlessly ripped off of "grounded for life", "Titus", and "Married ... with children" because they are all similar in conspiracy and overall mood. So-called "punch lines" are repetitive and formal, even more so these "punch lines" are not funny at all, for me they are more in line with being rough and rough. The main character, Dave Gold, acts like a white basket thief who thinks he's funny and cool, which is not. (Even Hillary (Dave's daughter) said it in the "Strip Strip" episode. In the "Dream Crusher" episode, Hillary wanted to be a singer {but she was actually pretty bad}, Dave and Vicky then decided to crush her dreams by telling her she was sucked. Then she wanted to be a child psychologist and planned to go to Harvard, after telling Dave and Vicky and leaving the room, two of them started to ridiculously mock her. Also, in the first episode Dave said Hillary's {black} friend "" She's actually thinking we'll let her go out with this guy? I'd rather drink my own urine, that line has the dumbest line in television history. And Dave constantly makes fun of Larry (his son) when he breaks the fourth wall because he thinks he's gay and he's a geek. Let's not forget that you also made fun of Larry's (fat) girlfriend. Dave is the father to stand up for his son no matter what he is. "Home War" is undoubtedly the worst TV show for the family. This clearly explains why the show should be canceled because it spreads racism and homophobic agenda. It's like a show wants to be funny, because always in that silly laugh will be when someone says something, but all the lines are somewhat forced, idiotic and pathetic juveniles. Another reason why this show is terrible is actors, Mike Rappaport and Kyle Sullivan are terrible, terrible actors. Rappaport must always move his hands when he is in front of the camera, not only at this show, but he also did it during his time with "Boston Public". Sullivan talks and behaves like a robot every time he behaves (he also did it in "Malcolm on Wednesday"). <br /> <br /> So wrap it up, you all got the reasons for what's wrong with this show 1.It's unoriginal 2.It's sucking 3.It's not funny 4.All the jokes are the same 5.It's a lousy script 6. Characters are pitiful and unlikable 7.The is the Archie Bunker rip-off <br /> <br /> FOX must take this waste out of the air because something is better than this.
