I agree with most of the critics above. I was even more shocked by the presentation of love scenes with a gay couple. Why? because while they - the director, the producers? - they had no pressure to present different heterosexual couples in the most passionate embraces, including nudity and super detail of French kissing and all kinds of naked twists in bed, in terms of their length and story, when the same gay couple experiences appeared he dares to go to an extremely painful embrace, almost between scientific laughs, with two very nervous actors. So in fact, the creators of this film found that homosexuality is UNNATURAL because one of the characters says in a scene. What's the difference with a Spanish cinema !! I recall that I was in Italian cinema in Almodovar in Rome and that I was absolutely overwhelmed by the total lack of response from the Italian viewer, they were afraid of reaction! when, in Spain, people would fall from their seats, they laughed in all the risqu√® situations and the wonderful almodo wit and taste. Obviously, in Italy, there are dark forces in their history that prevent the free expression of some very normal and natural emotions. Damage. I must add that I was quite surprised to find that the same comment was condemned by another correspondent. It is very bad and dangerous when we cannot allow others to be anxious to express their opinions on certain matters. Where is freedom of speech? I don't know if the censor will agree with the changes I was forced to make in this commentary, and I hope she won't have the same treatment from any other narrow-minded judge. Too bad again.
