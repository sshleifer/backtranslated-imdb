Well, after seeing "Beginning", I thought why the hell burned Schraders' version and made it poor. But now that I have seen the "Dominion", I understand this decision deeply. Even they don't get much better. Sorry, but this movie is really stupid. Some good moments, but really boring story-telling and some major plot-holes kill this movie. <br /> <br /> I'm the Exorcist-story has a lot and in the prequel on this you can build on a lot and give the links the audience will want to see. But there is little in the film. The effects are really bad - not even the TV standard.
