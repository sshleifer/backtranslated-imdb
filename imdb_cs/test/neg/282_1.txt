Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) catches up with Danny Oceane and his team and asks them to return the money they stole from him (in the oceans 11) plus interest. However, he abstains from violent action because he is led by the world's greatest thief, the night fox. The team must then rip the band of robbers to pay back Benedict while testing their abilities against the night fox who wants to keep the position of the biggest thief ever. Put simply, this film is a complete mess. The masses can argue that it is "cool" and that Clooney and Pitt have done great, but these are the same people who have a "Hello" subscription and think that David Beckham has the potential to be a great actor. The story is intricate, not complicated or clever and has no intelligent twists and turns, it's just a complete mess that spills in more directions, hoping viewers will think it's cool and intelligent (Hello readers). However, any serious film follower will see the film as a farce. While Oceans 11 was not a great movie, he had a decent pace, was stylish and had some decent twists. This film loses its path very quickly and then basically gives up. It is as if the director and the cast have said for themselves, hey, it doesn't really work, lets just laugh! Indeed, the cast seems to be having fun, but I wasn't. I'm not going to plunge into a conspiracy because its confused development doesn't guarantee any research. Adding Catherine Zeta Jones is pretty uncomfortable. The scenes in which Julia Roberts stands for herself (with Bruce Willis involved in the role), while the slightly entertaining seem to be a desperate step for the audience to be interested. The film is so full of holes that Arnie emptied 9mm into a movie studio. Credits can only be given to some scenes where Night Fox uses Caopeira to perform a robbery against the back drop of some funky music, but it is hardly justifiable to watch a movie. The final scene represents a team in pointless drunkenness; this is exactly what the film summarizes. Stick to the original.
