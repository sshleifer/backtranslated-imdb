I watched the CORNER of ALL POLLES with the object disproved by this so-called scientific atheist. I don't know where to start because he's such a rich source of stupidity. Obviously, it's not a statistic, or 2/1 of its burning for eternity would push it toward him. Belief in God <br /> <br /> He considers science to be a religion and expects to believe it as we are. Just look at the language used in postulating it. As for faith. This commodity is widely used in everyday behavior. Think about it. When he gets into an electrician, he believes he will be properly plugged in and trust the switch. When he gets into the plumber, he pulls the chain into the bathroom and expects the water to flow in the right direction. Regarding faith in science When I was in chemistry, I believed and learned that atom is the smallest particle and theory of onion on the skin of electrons, both of which are now discounted. That taught me as an atomic theory of "writing in stone." So why should we trust a scientist, especially when he goes over the parameters of his field? Dawkins states that religion will be a fall of civilization. Religion is a civilization. Can it tell us, or any other atheist, what civilization was founded and nourished by atheism, barbarism or wilderness, please? She now lives in the last stages of Christian civilization and accepts all the benefits of her without any acceptance for her source. I found out that Dawkins is arrogant, dictatorial, decisive, overt believer in eugenics and the Nazi in his attitude towards the young. How dare to say what a parent can teach his child. The child is theirs, not the nation, and as parents have left their genetics, they have left their beliefs. His statement to Adam as "never existed", as he has no evidence, was an example of this same attitude. So I have no evidence that Joe Blogs lives in New York, but he can do well. I haven't found evidence yet. This does not question its existence. I note his argument with the Oxford bishop that the prelate is selective with what he takes and believes in the Bible. Dawkins does that too. Where will he draw a line between her as a historical document and a religious statement? It is also selective. I heard a lot when Dawkins came up with the ALTRUISTIC gene. That's stupid. Desperately looking for evidence for his unusualness, and when Piltdown Man was invented, we now have this so-called Gen ALTRUISTIC, which predestines us to care for our young and other members of our "group." - not just apes, and with evolution it is the survival of the fittest. not kindest and if you really think we are becoming kinder as a race, don't read the same newspaper as I found that its arrogance is beyond faith in the statement that when we have this life we ​​should enjoy it in its entirety. As it compares with his apparent position as well outside Europe to who is helpless in Africa, who has all his families exterminated and probably raped and starving. Will she help her? I have noticed that all his resistance to religion is a) that they go to war. Well G K Chesterton said that the only war for fighting was the war for religion b) we are against the use of contraception and abortion and homosexuality. All sins against the 6th commandment. Funny that. As a Catholic I consider his rejection of Pius XII. For the declaration of the Dogma of the Assumption in 1958, it was wrong. He, Pius, never said he was revealed when he was sitting somewhere with him. If Dawkins doesn't know, Revelation ended with the last Apostle. Pius would have taken several years of counseling and studied the documents that had been passed over the centuries to come up with this statement. Also, as a Catholic, I consider his release of all religious people satisfied. what a waste. We, every day, fight the world, body and devil. We are a church militant. We are also able to glory at sunset and admire the beauty of nature, even if we believe in God. The problem with Dawkins was that talking to fanatic whacks and extrapolating is for all of us.
