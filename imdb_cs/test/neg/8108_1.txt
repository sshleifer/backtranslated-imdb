No spoiler needed to turn you away from this ... well, bizarre movie. Canada is becoming part of the US. OK. I think I'm unusual, but I was expecting something about the implications that Canada would become part of the US. I'm a fool. Continue this movie and you are gone into the cloud coocoo country. The prerequisite for opening has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, in which (trust) you don't care about squat for any character. Loops and Arrows and Due South must be among the most imaginative series ever. But in this case, Paul Gross, I am so sorry that I have no idea to create a coherent film and waste a lot of talented actors. Real disappointment.
