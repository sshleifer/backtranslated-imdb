"Mr and Mrs Smith" is one of the not very well-known Hitchcock films. But if the "lifeboat" (which unfortunately also belongs to this category) is an underestimated masterpiece, not all the films signed by the tension master at the time (early 40s) are worth seeing. And to tell you the truth, discovering this movie is not really lost. "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is an average and conventional comedy where it's hard to find Hitchcock's touch. . Perhaps you can see his shadow (which is not much) in the cruelty that Carole Lombard is sometimes capable of (but it is well hidden in the impersonal package), in the vertigo scene where the two characters are trapped at the top of the fair and possibly the mother's character. And that's about it! Even for Hitchcock fans, there is little to contact them. And as far as paintball comics are concerned, it is no more: no situation is exaggerated to be really funny and we, for example, are far from the masterpieces of the Hawks. And if one or two scenes are pretty fun, it's not even funniest in Hitchcock's filmography that created comic situations in almost all of his movies (even "Psycho" could be considered full of dark humor). So there is very little to save in this movie, which can bother anyone without harassment (or maybe just hardcore fans of Hitchcock and comics who are in love with Carole Lombard), remains one of the not very well-known early American Hitchcock films.
