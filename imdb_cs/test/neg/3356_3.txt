When Pam Grier made COFFY in 1973, it was an exciting, though wrong movie. The storyline was brave and satisfying - though acting was often amateur. It was so successful that American International Pictures decided to play the FOXY BROWN formula next year - it's not a bad movie, but almost like "COFFY II". Now, only a year later, the studio apparently gave up to create something new for Mrs. Grier, because SHEBA, BABY was basically the same conspiracy from COFFY and FOXY BROWN once again. Since the idea was so recycled and that acting and acting are so tired and low-energy, it's really scratching the bottom of the Blaxploitation barrel. Just like these other movies, SHEBA, BABY starts with some local black gangsters pushing them and finally killing somebody Pam Grier loves. In the past, they were drug dealers and pimps, now they were gangsters trying to launch all the credit companies and pawn shops in the city to attack the market. And like other movies, Pam is the only woman who gives justice and good ass. And as with other films, there is a fight with cats between Pam and the White Lady in front of "Mr. Big". And like other movies, Mr. Big is a white guy who pulls all the strings. And like other movies, he is captured by Mr. Big. And like other films, he didn't kill her immediately, but gives her enough opportunities to escape (leaving the knife lying comfortably). And like other movies, he gets free and kills his jive - @ $$. Although this formula seemed to be interesting in 1973, this film was frankly a predictable bore. Even if you didn't see other movies, it was still bad because the action was so slow - punching and kicking seemed so slow and staged. The same could be said for a weapon. In one scene, four guys with machine guns, AR-15 and shotgun attacks. Pam responds by firing a .357 revolver and killing 3 out of 4 and getting the other to give up !!! Although it is a good shot, it was quite slow and the guys just looked like they would wait for them to kill them !!! Even a world champion shooter or Rambo could not succeed with such one-sided courses - after all, these guys had very impressive weapons and already pointed at her when she "smartly" whipped a gun and easily sent these professional hit men! In addition to the slow and lame action scenes compared to any other Blaxpoitation movie, the film has many logical gaps that show that writing was horrible, but the studio didn't care. In one case, her boyfriend, "Williams", knew about the yacht and Nu-tronic at the end of the movie, but Pam never told him - how did he know about it? In another, the cops approach a ship filled with balaclava and the bonnet immediately opens fire. However, the police had no evidence, and the crooks started shooting with little provocation. And the crooks had .30 machine guns and other amazingly powerful weapons, but in many cases they were killed by cops controlling sniffing .38s! The bottom line is that this is a great example of "We were there / did it .... THE WHOLE LOT BETTER". I love Blaxploitation movies, but this is just too much dopey and slow credit, with the exception of the very devoted genre fans.
