That's just the same old bullshit that spews from amateur idiots who have no idea how to make a movie - gee maybe that's why it's a movie with direct video! I think it's my fault for spending money to see it (one of the worst decisions I've ever made). What a shame. I usually like B movies, some of them are actually pretty good - but that's just too ridiculous and stupid to be funny. Wasting time and money on everyone who makes a film, which of course does not deserve to be on the film! These so-called filmmakers have absolutely no talent! Stupid conspiracy, terrible gameplay (especially dragging queens - what would the sicko really find, sexy?!), lame writing (if there was even a script - it looks like it's a bit of a bull **** Someone just created it on the spot <br /> <br /> What is amazing about this film is its complete lack of everything that is well done. <br /> How much attention do you pay to detail to ensure that every movie frame is so far below reasonable standards? I do not think it would be possible to deliberately make such a bad film and it is unthinkable that sheer misfortune could bring such consistently awful results. Anyway, avoid this stinking bomb at all costs! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
