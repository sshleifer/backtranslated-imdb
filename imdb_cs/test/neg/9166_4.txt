Something disappointing. Lee J. Cobb is Union Chief of Roxton Garments in New York. His store partner is killed when the elevator is released and throws 27 floors to the bottom of the shaft, in the scariest scene in the movie. Cobb doesn't know or not. he let it be realized, but the man behind the killing is Richard Boone, who protects the trade from trade union organizers. Then Cobb's son Kerwin Mathews returns from Europe, who decided to learn to do business and join his father in a clean shop. She is shocked - shocked! - Learn that Boone was crazy about union members and kill several people who became irreversibly irritating. Robert Loggia is one of the organizers killed by several of Boon's goons, led by Wesley Addy. Loggia leaves the widow, Gia Scala, with whom Mathews, of course, will be happy. Finally, Cobb pays for his own scams, Addy and Boone get only their desserts and Mathews winds up with Succulent Scala, after which the opera house is named. <br /> <br /> There is no spark in any dialog line. A few lines are literally stolen from "On the waterfront" - "pistoleros", "you talk yourself to the grave." The plot is schematic and has absolutely no surprises. The direction of Vincent Sherman is walking. The photo is flat uninspired, though there are some nice shots of New York streets. Lee J. Cobb can act. In this case, it must have been easy for him, because Johnny Friendly plays "On the Waterfront", this time with a soft heart. Richard Boone can also act. Joseph Wiseman, in a smaller part, does a good job. Gia Scala hits her mark, tells what the script requires, and does what the director tells her. A stunning woman, her life took root soon. The director and photographer do a good job at Wesley Addy. She has white hair, a bleached face, glacial lake eyes, and is sometimes shot with a wide-angle lens before she turns her surprisingly fleshy lips into those parasitic fish. But I don't see him as a muscular muscular man. He and Boone should change roles. Harold J. Stone is his reliable self, though he is forced to be more "Italian", as Tony, until he comes naturally to him. No one else, like the main part, is more than average, and some artists don't even have a bar. Kerwin Mathews can be a real-life boy, but he is indeed sterile and belongs to home dramas on afternoon television. Great title, reminiscent of intrigues and shadows. Some good people in cast. No one knows much about the potentially explosive exposure of a business, but which deals in megabytes. And that all comes out this way.
