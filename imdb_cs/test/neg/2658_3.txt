So much great chemistry between Kristen Scott-Thomas and Harrison Ford, but every time a story about their relationship began collecting the momentum of the script to cut off and engaged in some irrelevant partial plot that did nothing to advance the story. In fact, the subplots had nothing to do with the story. They were like commercial breaks in which you watched the trailer for the next movie. Writers (or someone who controlled writers) apparently did not believe themselves to write convincingly about the relationships and inner lives of their characters. They seemed uncomfortable if they did not put in any battle weapons and barfights. Or perhaps they did not believe the viewer to pay attention to the story of a man and a woman trying to understand their relationship in difficult circumstances. After all, we all know how boring "Casablanca" was. Perhaps if the relationship between Kay and the Dutch were more developed and allowed to play, the writers would know how to end the story. This film is disappointing that it has not done more with its amazing actors who have done well, but have been able to do more with a better script.
