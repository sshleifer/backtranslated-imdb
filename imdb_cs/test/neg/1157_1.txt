Ed Gein's story is interesting, very interesting. However, this film is only interesting in the fact that it was actually made. The picture of Ed Gein Kane Hodder is so far away, it's not even the slightest joke. Ed Gein did not behave psychotically in public, was very calm and collected and always very polite to everyone and talked to anyone who would listen, this is one of the main things that this film could not show viewers. But the biggest mistake of this film, which was next to the one when it was shot, was that Ed had never killed anyone without his dead mother, whom he thought was talking to him from behind the grave. He killed only the people who his dead mother said she must, because it was God's will, and he was very regretful about it, though it didn't stop him from experimenting with cannibalism and wearing people's bodies. I officially gave this movie a rating of "1" simply because "0" was not given as an option. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend everyone to stay away from this movie. If you want to see a movie that accurately displays Ed Gein and does not try to put in a subdistrict love story between a cop and a fictional woman who never existed, I suggest you see an original movie that unfortunately seems to be on IMDb.com, even though bad, but i still find it here. The original does not break away from real events and does not try to make a story. I can understand the story's story from a different perspective, but this film tried to directly change the real story, something that I find horrible, as if someone filmed a September 11 film, but gave him that Canada was behind it. Or the WWII movie says Hitler was a good guy and helped fight the Nazis.
