This is perhaps one of the worst movies I've had all my life. The story is ridiculous and the characters are terrible people. I watched this movie with three friends and we all agreed to turn it off 30 minutes before the end. Ben Kingsley's character is just stupid, but not funny at all. It's a miracle why an actor of his talent would be involved in such audacity. Leoni Tea makes a gentle impression of Hillary Clinton to portray a very cool and uninteresting female plum that has all the cute features of a broom handle. Throw in a senseless and inexplicable sub-fence and terribly cringe worthy assembly, and you end up with a waste of 93 minutes (60 in my case). Avoid this movie at all costs!
