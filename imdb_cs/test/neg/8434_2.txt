And one of them is a bad movie. The name, as it turns out, concerns the murderer of a human male variety, not a fish. This is not a Dante-driven "Piranha" '78 (which had fishes) and is also known as "Piranha, Piranha." Unfortunately, they are not familiar with the film biography of William Smith, who plays Caribe; otherwise they would know immediately that he was a villain of the work. Smith could also refuse to film the end or cut out before they finished filming (see end of this commentary). <br /> <br /> As mentioned elsewhere, this pic has plenty of fillings - lengthy footage of local wildlife (birds) - and a central set piece, a motorcycle race that goes too long. The reason a second star gets me is, of course, William Smith, who really can't save the sludge, but again demonstrates why he was "going to a guy" 30 to 35 years ago if you needed a really nasty villain; at best, Smith could be really scary. It's the kind of killing, maybe in a sadistic fashion, and the feeling you got from the evil smile he usually wears when the mood hits him. Physically, he is very impressive and you know that the other 3 characters are largely doomed to the first half hour. That was what Smith brought to most of his roles; the other characters seem to be hopeless against this male monster. Unfortunately, the film still muddy stuff to the very end, as if the minute footage was lost - confusing, incomplete climax.
