Only when I looked at the little thing, did I find that the original producer / star of this film, Tyrone Power, died during his work. This no doubt explains why everyone on the screen seems to think of other things whose symptom appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic. Do you know when you painted the wall until you were bored? Well, this is the kind of expression that fighters have on their faces when they chew swords in a very unconvincing spirit. The story focuses on Soloman, the king of Israel, who has an affair with Queen Sheeba, and his people were not happy about it. You can't blame them because there's a little more in the world than those Israeli hoops, even though Israeli women look like Cherie Blair! Israel's modern day is also very cosmopolitan, with most Israelis born outside the country, but it would be true a few thousand years ago when everyone speaks in European and American accents. The dance sequence that needs to be seen to be believed (And not that it is not praise) has a culmination where the heavily outnumbered Israelis must defend themselves against a mass Egyptian army that cannot read the map, otherwise they know there is a canyon in front of them. That's what I don't understand - Even though the Egyptians are blinded by the sun, they spend ten minutes charging the Israelis who never realize they're billing on the yawning gorge! Isn't that somewhat illogical? It is also something that reveals a mistake, because horses, wagons and men who fall into a canyon are obviously miniature figures. The film ends with a soloist who killed his treacherous brother and praised God for his victory. But who needs Moshe Dayan, Arik Sharon, or God, if you have an idiotic enemy who doesn't see a gorge in front of him, or waves of a sword, as if he is painting a wall?
