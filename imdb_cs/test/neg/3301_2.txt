I live in Istanbul for 24 years and I (39 years of experience would suggest) knows what Istanbul has gone through all these years. Faith Akin is still quite young (born in 1973) and falling in a big mistake to be ORIENTALIST while looking at Turkey (as well as his next film Gegen Die Wand did) This film is LACK LACK contemporary urban Turkish life And MISLEADS audience in giving away (quite false) clues regarding the geographical and cultural spread of Istanbul. Anyone who could speak Turkish could easily confirm that many underground bands and bands that appear in the film (Siyasiyabend for One) are so disparate and their members can't even speak the right language , which cannot be considered a "representative" of contemporary Turkish music. Much less bullshit that many Turkish listeners do not know at all. We Turks have long been accustomed to the "superficial" West who is looking at Turkey with some oriental look: trying to adapt the real Turkish image to their forms of mind. that the Turkish director (Faith Akin) now makes the same mistake: Looking at Turkey with some false western glasses and mixing to see it as if it understands better. All unnecessary effort. Ask any Turkish friend: What kind of music document is without a name: Zeki Muren, Baris Manco, Ajda Pekkan, Teoman, Muslum Gurses, Ibrahim Tatlises, Ferdi Ozbegen? .. and many others who are still listening to SHUDED yet? Faith Akin has a long lesson to learn before he breaks down the minds of other people with false opinions. pictures about contemporary Turkish music.
