Don Wilson plays Jack Cutter (Ooh real hard name!) Vampire killer who goes up against the vampire army, you see that the story is a bit different because vampires can't be killed by silver, cross or sunlight, but rather by bursting their necks (how comfortable as it cuts on the budget) and it's here Cutter runs into a reporter (Melanie Smith of Trancers III fame) A night hunter action sequence shaking without reason during combat sequences and although it is supposed to emphasize the mood, it just makes the film more annoying. Worse still, these combat sequences are overcome by faith because Wilson's martial art is masked by incoherent cuts. Of course, the greatest interest comes from the fact that it really precedes Blade, but the problem is that it was on a small budget and that Don Wilson had it. It's from Roger Corman and it's basically Turkey, which most people would pay for not seeing him. Unfortunately I am a feeder and I care about the part of the store looking for gems. With Night Hunter, I can have the most beautiful world in the world. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * of 4 (horrible)
