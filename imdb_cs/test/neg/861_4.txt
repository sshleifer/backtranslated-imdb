Sylvester cat stowway on the boat that Tweety bird happens to be on his owner's grandmother. I don't even have enough words to say how much I despise Tweety and Grandmother. They just aren't funny to me and they make this short fake fan to really sit down. Sylvester is a great character on her own, but it's just enough she can do when confronted with the utter horror of that damned offer and the senile old grandmother's witch. This short animated film is featured on Disc 4 of Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 1 and includes an optional comment from Micheal Barrier. <br /> <br /> My class: D +
