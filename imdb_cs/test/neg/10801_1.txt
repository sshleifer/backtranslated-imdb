It's Sooooouullltakaaaa! Wow. What skin peeling bad movie. Honestly, this is one of my favorite MST3K episodes .... Just a few things to point out ... I need advice now. 2) There is no God, there is only Dude .. I love the quote from Crow. 3) What happened to the nuns who took the bus home, will we ever know? I have a terrible emptiness in my stomach. 4) Finally, don't watch this movie un-MSTied ... It's Joe Estevez as the main star .. Yikes .. <br /> <br /> 1/10 for un-MSTied 8 / 10 for MSTied.
