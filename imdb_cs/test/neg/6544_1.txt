This low budget independent movie redefines the word "bla". Most will surprise you that this word can actually be defined in the dictionary as: "nonsense ... uninteresting, boring, lifeless". The film redefines the word because I have to add to the four words: "PC stupid", "pretentious at pathetic level" and "nonsensical". The film tries so hard to be "hip" and "in touch" with the simultaneous behavior of people who fight for it-ne-sais-quoi and "think". There is almost no conspiracy to talk about, even if there is one to sleep on. The most frequent and politically most accurate thing about it is how white is great friends with a young black shame, a black street sax player with a penchant for vast wise advice and advice, and a thick black psyche. Isn't it beautiful, how does it catch up after all? ... Ahhhh ... Finally, a woman reads "poetry", which is nothing more than one of her boring "diaries". She gets standing ovation (!!!), although in real life her listeners would be more likely than not to fall into deep sleep. But this film has nothing to do with real life, even if it's where it is going to happen. In real life, her "poetry" reading would have an ovation state only if she had the meaning to include juicy, sexual details. "And then I rubbed his huge cock against my sweaty, impatient pink little vagina ..." Hello! Worse still, the main actress has a dozen scenes where she either bathes with someone or hides with her, but they never make sense of showing her breasts, which was clearly the only thing that saved the mess. The black guy and the blonde, who are about a meter in height, are joining: they look like a cheap variant of Rodman and Madonna (as if the last two were no longer a cheap combination). Nicole Eggert, mentioned by Howard Stern in her book "Miss America", is a blonde. Stern writes about Eggert that she took the implants. However, I believe that when they took her implants, they also mistakenly sucked most of the meat from her flesh and muscles because she looks hungry here. wings; it looks like Al Roker, who promotes angelic food.
