Some movies are so bad that they are observable purely for the cringe factor. The disciples worried me so much that it was unpleasant. I watched what I watched wasn't anyone who was aware of how bad it was when they were filming? Mixing the most hammed performances from most wooden actors, the abysmal scenario were all comments from all 'actors' sounded like it came from the same character and the most rushed adjustments they tried (and failed bigtime) to make the film a pace. All of this has merged into a movie that will rob you of a few hours of your life and not give anything back. Avoid EVERY cost.
