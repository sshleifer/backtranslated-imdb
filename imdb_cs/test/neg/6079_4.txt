A large piece of fiction played as if it were factual. I watched Birdman from Alcatraz tonight. Robert Stoud was not a model humble prisoner and was in jail because he was a pimp and the customer did not pay. Once in jail, he was so rampant that he spent most of his time alone or in a prison hospital. She killed several people in prison. This film reminds me of the Birdman of Alcatraz, but even worse. Robert Stroud wrote books and contributed somehow to society. And BOA had some hints of Strouds' insanity. But this guy, Henry Young, who murdered the First, assumes that there is a well-known bank robber who took the hostage and defeated them in more than one robbery. It wasn't a poor man who ran into a grocery store that had just become a post and took some money. This man was a cruel criminal. He also killed a person 3 years before he went to Alcatraz. He killed another person in jail because of the loneliness that ended more than a year before the murder. The real story of his life would be more interesting. They didn't even get a custodian thing. You cannot be a superintendent at three different prisons. And in all things, the warden in the movie was a nicely built man, as the guards go. In addition, if mathematics is right, Warden playing Karl Malden in BOA is expected to be the same superintendent in this movie. Oh no. Not only do we think that poor Henry committed suicide in this film. And he wrote the word Victory. It's not true he can be alive now. He was sent to Springfield, where Robert Stroud was also a medical center prison, then Walla Walla for another murder he committed, and then was released and released in 1972 when he was never found. Maybe he's hanging out with that guy CB Cooper, who jumped that plane in Washington state after committing a bank robbery lol. Now it was very good. Kevin Bacon is in this class of actors, including Jeff Bridges and Dennis Quaid, a vastly underrated actor. Gary was good with the old men that they could make a guard to play him because he was great. Christian Slater still sounds like Jack Nicholson, I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. Bacons' wife Kyra Sedgwick was in the movie, I think it's just his wife. I like her but not in this movie. For some reason I felt this movie when it first came out supposed to be a special project for Kevin Bacon. I feel he could take a man who is truly a victim of the criminal system, surely there are plenty of them and scatter the light on their situation. Otherwise, he chose a psychopath who proved to be a victim.
