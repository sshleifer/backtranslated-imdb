This is easily one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time (and recently I saw Starship Troopers 2 !!!). I found nothing to buy this movie. Playing, which is probably the best aspect of the film, is fair at best. Michael Madsen sews it in his standard personality. It seems Denis Hopper doesn't know what to do. The accent of Vinnie Jones is bizarre. One positive thing is that Leonor Valera looks fantastic. Her performance is very bad, but I doubt it's why he's there. The dialogue is really scary. It's just waste. I don't know who signed it, but they really need to get professional help next time. This film is why the IMDB rating system should be able to include zero in ten. Avoid at any cost.
