OK, nobody does it with Citizen Kane, but you have to love a movie where women are always topless. There are several cat fights and some eccentric sex. On the other hand, I hope they didn't pay the one who wrote the dialogue. Here's an example. After one of the captured girls dies: "That's terrible. That reminds me of the day Zenobia died" "relative?" "No, my favorite cow." I think they saved some money on the script and fired them for great special effects like the plastic crocodile. I will say it took me three sessions to do this through this fine work of art, never a good sign. I think what happens after a while when everything looks the same. I hope that people waiting for rent didn't get too impatient. Don't worry, it's on the way.
