Jean Claude Van Damme's film career seems to have gone to hell in a handcart, so the irony to see him play a character that literally matches fate at the very beginning of the movie! It is also interesting to note how very, very similar to the plot of his films, regardless of who is the producer, director or screenwriter. Van Damme usually plays a character who lives in France because, due to a number of circumstances, he finds himself in another part of the world where he has a brother who dies and is on Van Damme to avenge the character he has just met. Look at AWOL or LEGOINAIRRE or many other films with the title "Starring Jean Claude Van Damme" and they all have almost the same type of story structure. This does not mean that they are, of course, identical, very similar, and if you saw one Van Damme movie that you saw them all basically. It's the same with MAXIMUM RISK
