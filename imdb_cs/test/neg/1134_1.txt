I noticed that I saw only about the last half of this movie, so don't hesitate to take my review with any grain of salt you think is appropriate, which was said when I saw what I saw was more than enough to be quite convinced that one is enough to do it. In short, it is the overwhelming defeat of an amazing predecessor (NL Christmas Vacation) with Chevy Chase, but it does not have a Chevy Chase and it is set on a generic tropical island, essentially without any connection to Christmas. Ol 'Chevy probably didn't want to, because the plot is free of real fun, instead they got into Cousin Eddie, who was great again in the original, but he's just up there, and an extremely bad base for any a film that would consider conspiracy and acting. Humor attempts are generic to the point that the current television comedy tops, and since it is a comedy, I doubt I have to say more. It is not seen on its quality because it has nothing but for its failure and again, as Hollywood's spill is its life blood from the past in pursuit of fast money. I think I'm going to watch the original before the upcoming Christmas season just to try to regain childhood innocence, from lost time when movies were more than high, but thoughtless, garbage.
