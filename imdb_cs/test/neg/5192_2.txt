I saw this movie 2 weeks before I went on a snowboard holiday, so for me it was really just to get into my holiday mode. The film boasts some sweet snowboarding skills in movies in action scenes. These moments were great, a bit like watching extreme sports channels. Unfortunately the story was quite frankly horrible, acting was generally fine, with a relatively small cast. This movie is probably a comedy, at least trying to be comical, but it seems that comedy and story was written by a teenager. The story lacks any depth or purpose, and comedy fights are something more than a small snigger several times during the film. Perhaps it is worth to rent a snowboarding event, but then there are a lot of movies that are dedicated to snowboard stunts and have no witty story.
