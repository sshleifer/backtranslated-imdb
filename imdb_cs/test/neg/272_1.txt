Like most people, I could not wait to see the continuation of this Ocean 11, but I must say that it really stinks. It stinks because there's just not a good script, it was just cheap. I hope manufacturers donate all the money that this film has created (or will do) for tsunami victims in Asia, so this film will have at least one good reason to exist. It's so bad that I can't even write a decent note about it, but .... I still advise the creators of this thing to make "Ocean 13". Ocean's 13 will be about the same thieves who are trying to steal the script well hidden somewhere in Hollywood. The 13th member will be a foreign (possibly Russian) writer who knows all the tricks to write a copy of this well-hidden script to replace the original they will have to steal. Or they need to find at least 13 people who will write a decent screenplay for a movie that plays not only Julia Roberts, but all other Ocean movies. 13 People because it is Andy Garcia's happiness number.
