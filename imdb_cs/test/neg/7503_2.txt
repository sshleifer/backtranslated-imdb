In the 1950s, gay photographer Bob Mizer (Daniel MacIvor) founded a male model agency that publishes a muscle magazine called "Physique Pictorial" and a film of men, and many models became prostitutes. "Beefcake" shows the rise and fall of this pervert. Changing footage from the 1950s, testimony of many models and Bob Mizer himself today, director Thom Fitzgerald used this fake to show naked men and lots of penis after 93 minutes of running, in total bad taste and very stupid stupid. I've never heard of this morally corrupt Bob Mizer and I don't know what AMG is. In my opinion, the theme of this boring and arrogant film could only be enjoyed by gay and very specific viewers. My voice is two. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Carne Fresca" ("Fresh Meat")
