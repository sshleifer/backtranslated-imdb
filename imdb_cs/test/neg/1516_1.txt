It was unthinkable. When I first saw him a few years ago, I had a movie that was my measure of horror, and the film was called "McCinsey's Island". A family adventure film with Hulk Hogan and Grace Jones (I don't do that up), immersed in the new depths of filmmaking and is still the only movie I saw that I wondered what else the movie budget could have been. Like new schools or drugs for cancer treatment. However, for sheer and undisturbed levels of crap, every movie will have to lower its standards even lower if they want to trump "Guest House Paradiso" to honor it as one of the worst movies I've ever had to watch. This film, which loosely surrounds the children's but entertaining TV show "Bottom", introduces us to the two biggest losers imaginable. Richard (Rik Mayall) is a hotel manager who is hostile, as anyone can imagine, and is so cruelly flattered that he almost tears slime from every action. His buddy Eddie (director Adrian Edmondson) is an alcoholic waste of human life, and together they are trying to run the worst hotel in Britain, located on top of a cliff beside a nuclear power plant. Among them, they accompany violence in cartography (with sound effects) at regular intervals, stealing something remotely valuable or interesting from fools who stay there and look longingly at every woman at all. The storyline, such as it is, includes the coming of the legendary Italian screen goddess Gina Carbonara (Vincent Cassel) who flees before her wedding and attempts to lie low at the Pension Paradiso, much to the amazement of Richie and Eddie. And that's all. I thought Carry On movies were all bad about the film industry in the UK, and God knows we've spent so much time and money to avoid this godly inheritance. We had films like "Trainspotting", "28 Days Later", "Four Weddings AA Funeral" and the brilliant "Shaun Of The Dead" (also starring Simon Pegg), but this ... pulls those movies that scream and kick back to the days when Sid James and Barbara Windsor flew away with a whistle. "Paradiso Guesthouse" is so low in its ambitions to insult you when you watch it. I was still watching and waiting in anticipation that they would start jokes, but they never came. Just an infinite stream of trapped button gags, unimaginable scenarios that defy explanation, slightly fun violence with pans and fridge doors, and almost nothing that would lead to a grin. Come on the first advertising break (it was on TV, you see) and I was ready to shut down, but my loyal duties to you, my readers, let me go. "I look at it, so they don't have to become a mantra, so you guys better remember how much you owe me, because it was about as fun as when the sand kicked my eyes and fed dog food. . Believe me, I like "Bottom" TV show. The combination of suitably bold action from Mayall and Edmondson with a youthful OTT humor worked half an hour every week. Certainly not in an hour and a half because Edmondson and Mayall enjoy their little private joke and carry and push the rest of the audience. Honestly, Mayall's "Drop Dead Fred" seems like "Godfather" and you should meet one of these two people (who are largely solely responsible for the chaos on the screen pretending to film), feel free to quickly deliver the shoe to the testicles area. They'll probably enjoy it. Pegg and Bill Nighy (both as hotel guests) are dragged with this sinking ship, but at least survived. Mayall and Edmondson shouldn't be lucky. Chernobyl film equivalent and as such should be avoided.
