From the first episode I watched "LOST" with my family, that was great. Last season it was very disappointing, it seems as though (writers) did not know what to do with the show, so try to make it for it by stretching one story across the episode. The current season, which, by the way, I decided to watch only Rodrigo Santora, and with little hope that things would improve; there was one disappointment after another; my husband and son even stopped watching. First, he (Santoro) appears only for 30 seconds in each episode. But the real problem is with a story story, NEVER HOPE, every episode could be displayed in 15 minutes. We watch every episode waiting for something that will never happen; I'm not asking every secret to suddenly appear, but how does any variation in the story? In the first and second seasons we had different story lines, we saw character history, a little action, a little romance, now it's like one big event that lasts the whole episode. It's almost tiring to watch him when he finishes, you feel like you have lost time. Now it's important to note that the actors are still great. I can't believe they killed Mr. Eco (Adelawale ...), he was great, Jack (Mathew Fox) is still incredible, perfect hero, so kind, generous, brave. Sawyer (Josh Holloway), "Bad Boy", is kind of soft, because Kate (Evangeline Lylli), but that's fine. I miss Sayid (Naveen Andrews), Sun and Jin (Yoon-jin Kim and Daniel Dae Kim), all are an important part of the conspiracy (or should be), but we hardly see them. I hope that Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro) will have a big role in the show; If not, why did you make such a big deal that he joined the show (Access Hollywood, etc.)? I'm sorry if I kept for too long, but I feel cheated by this show. When I started watching that was great, I got used to it, and now it's very disappointing to see how it goes. I'll be here, hope for improvement !!! Katia
