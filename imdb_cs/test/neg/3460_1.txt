Let me avoid this by going to record, I'm a huge fan of George Clooney, and I love John Krasinski at 'The Office' Well, I was and I did it. This was the worst nail in the world and it took 113 minutes. Silly boredom was interrupted only by my frequent effort to read my watch and guess when it would end. <br /> <br /> Every funny scene was in thumbnails. All three. There was no real story, no character development, and the script was just bad. I had a colonoscopy that was more pleasant. <br /> <br /> The title was supposed to be SuperDuper Bad. This film is a lock for Razzie. It should get the whole merger of Razzies. I want my money back.
