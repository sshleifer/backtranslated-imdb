The third film based on the play by Charles Belden entitled "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) focuses on generating X-Tasa. Two screenwriters, Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, spend more time developing key characters than other slasher films - a promising start. Their condition guarantees an authentic view. The role of Paige (Paris Hilton) was not too long for the world's heir. She looks at "style," striptease boys, huts on the cell, and sleeper over a poorly conceived pregnancy. Her regular routine has been changed. Hilton reached the peak of her performance - not so hot - during the "1 Night in Paris" (2004) parody. While the pimp-my-ride is in motion, he is eagerly "looking for a lip balm" in the lap of his friend (Robert Ri'chard). Finally, the "actress" atones for using the "N" word on the sex tape. Director Jaume Collet-Serra marries his couple, which is in contrast to the theme of the past. Each of them had opposite characteristics at the time, while today a couple of good or bad can come out of the womb. But he does not exclude the first. Childbirth is a lucky draw. Viewers can hardly consider Vincent (Brian Van Holt) contemporary Quasimodo. It is true that the recluses share some similarities, such as art, disfigurement, submissivity and murder. Nevertheless, one small variable between the two makes a difference. Vincent is even uglier on the inside than he's out there. Collet-Serra's "House of Wax" pays tribute to actor Vincent Price since his first remake in 1953. The film leaves the obvious van Gogh's false vision to the audience. However, the choice to divide the antagonist into two eliminates pulsing twist at the end. Professor Henry (Vincent Price) Jarrod's camouflage procedure is second, but the most frightening of horror history is Lon Chaney in "Phantom of the Opera" (1925). As far as the new applicant is concerned, the consequences of separation surgery make this effect less difficult. The surgeon should know the operation of Siamese twins scars - both physically and psychologically. Their father must call a couple of colleagues - Dr. Phil has consulted Dr. McNamarou. Despite what they said trailers, "wax" is not forever. In fact, you can get rid of it by burning.
