First, let me hate Octopussy on the chest with absolute passion. What is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence, but unfortunately, after the initial sequence, it all goes down. At first there was no conspiracy at all, just for apologizing to Moore for his crazy jokes. Further, there are several sequences that would cause Bond's fan to disintegrate, for example, the sequence in which Bond appears to disperse a clown-dressed bomb. Thieves are poor enough, Louis Jordon can't influence because Kamal Khan and Bollywood Kabir Bedi are as poor as his follower. It's funny that when people are debating what is the worst Bond movie and Octopussy gets overlooked when they can easily give them a run for their money.
