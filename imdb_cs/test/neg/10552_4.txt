There were nice characters playing nice-looking actors and actresses, plus a famous band and some famous dancers ..... but the movie just didn't work. By the time it was almost over, I was bored to death. The dialogue was stupid, the humor (mainly Milton Berle) was downright stupid and the music just wasn't my aisle. I've never been a big-band fan, and when I hear "In the mood," I'll vomit again. This was my first look at the famous skater-actor Sonji Henie and I have no complaints about it. Almost part of the problem, at least with humor, is that it is so dated that it is no longer funny. Crutches, Phil Silvers, Bob Hope, Red Skeleton, Abbot & Costello, etc. Etc. They were merring to the crowds in the 1940s and 1950s, but the humor changed and what was then funny is not today.
