Can you please stop believing what this man says. Get <br /> <br /> your facts right before you start praising this liar. Not even <br /> <br /> from Flint. He just says his "blue collar" looks. He is <br /> <br /> from a rich suburb next to Flint. I think he went to a private school. His parents paid to go to school. Wow, it certainly seems <br /> <br /> as if they suffered a lot from Flint going to the landfill. He was also born in Canada. Wait, it makes him a Canadian citizen. I wish he just moved there. Instead, he lives here in his 1 million apartment in New York. That's the working class. I'm sure I can't wait for the DVD to come out. I want him to talk about how big companies are bad. Where do I get the dvd? Yeah, in Target and Wal-Mart. The two largest corporations in America, which were also the only two stores, allowed them to sell.
