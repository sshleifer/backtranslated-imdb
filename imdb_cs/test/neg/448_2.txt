Let's describe Larry as an interviewer: complete suckhole, possible in every way. Laughing at all of his guests' jokes, asking about the most boring questions and never dared to oppose them. It strikes me as the kind of person who wants to be ... everyone. Friendly, boring, predictable Harry. She probably owes her success to the interviewer of dreams for celebrities because they don't want to be bombarded with what we people want to know and have the right to know. Let's say this: talks like he's in the red country. 02/10, 2 for guests who come to the show, but it seems unnecessary when Larry starts to ask his mind how disgusting questions like "What is it to be a mother?" followed by the usual answer "Being a Mother is the Biggest Ever Happened: It's Amazing, But Tiring".
