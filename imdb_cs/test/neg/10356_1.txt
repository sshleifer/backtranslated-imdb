I am a fan of this generally excellent, though sometimes somewhat boring show, but Season 3 has taken some terrible plot directions. HERO is an example of what I mean. The story finally breaks up is that the Cylons deliberately allowed Bulldog, a pilot captured a few years ago during a black ops mission, to escape, steal a Cylon ship and return to Galactica. The plan is that when Bulldog returns, he discovers that Adam left him for his fate and was so angry that he kills Adam, which he almost does. Now it's a problem - the Cylons built it so Bulldog thought he'd escaped himself. That means Bulldog gets off the Cylon ship without help. So he kills the Cylon and comes out of his cell - that is visible. Then we have to assume he goes to the flight hangar, manages to get into the Cylon fighter and learn to control it, take off, and fly back to Galactica. Like now. Starbuck managed to get one of them to work in the One season, which in itself was barely believable, but had to fly him visually from orbit before getting in touch with Galactica. Bulldog must program his ship to make several jumps over hyperspace and have managed to catch up with Galactica somewhere thousands of light-years away, in an unknown direction. How can he program a ship that contains completely alien technology? Cylons connect to their computers by touch, there are no visual consoles or keyboards. And how did he prove this miraculous performance, then how did he know where Galactica was when he remembered that Galactica had taken off about three years ago and had been trying to avoid the Cylons ever since? Even assuming that any sci-fi show would have to be distrusted, this episode makes no sense at all.
