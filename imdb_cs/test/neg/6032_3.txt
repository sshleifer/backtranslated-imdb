Very Cliched. Pretty damn. Acting is getting worse as the show continues. Don't believe anything people say about "realism" that this film is supposed to portray. It's just a shooter. An interesting twist in the fact that VC besieged the base got a human face and were not portrayed as the embodiment of evil.
