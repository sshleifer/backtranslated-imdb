I'm sure I'm in the minority (I know I'm among my friends), but I thought the movie was long, boring and unreasonable. The fact that the role played by DENIS LEARY is the most likeable character (the only other time I liked him in "A Bug's Life"!) Speaks with volume. Rene Russo's character was unpleasant and Thomas Crowne was flat and stereotyped. To say he was two-dimensional might be a little generous. (No, the scenes with his psychiatrist did not help him make him real.) With the exception of two beautiful scenes (including the museum band and NE involving Rene Russo), this film wished me, were at home and watched TV golf.
