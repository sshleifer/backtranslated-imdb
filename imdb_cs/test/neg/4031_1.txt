It was so poor that I had to shut it down. I've never seen such a poor movie. I love B movies and I was looking forward to the same, but unfortunately I was disappointed. It has the worst acting / conspiracy / direction / writing, etc ... from what I've ever seen in my life! <br /> <br /> My advice to anyone who thinks or watches / buys / rents is not there!
