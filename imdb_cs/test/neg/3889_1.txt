The Days of Heaven are one of the most painfully boring and pointless films I've ever seen. In any case, I would not advise anyone if you would not try to put your children to sleep, or, God, do not let anyone give an aneurysm. If I could go back in time and do one thing, I would set fire on the cylinders before it was sent to theaters. Why? The days of heaven are simple but very vague. Long sequences without dialogue compose a large part of the film. The characters are too shallow and ridiculously silly to apply to them. The top of the story won't touch you: by this time your brain has worked so hard to find a plot and a number of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone. All that works is your eyes and, unfortunately, your ears, who must listen to the sound of Linda, a little girl in a story that speaks like a man. I'm stupid now that I've seen this movie. Don't let it happen to you.
