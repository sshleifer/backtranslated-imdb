An unthinkable cash-in with nothing to contribute, in addition to ugliness, this is a case of sloppy seconds for Robocop. Irvine Kershner's stunning, conspiracy of less and tired confusion of continuation is observable and even amusing in a dubious, unpleasantly cheesy way, but basically has none of the original feelings, emotions, intelligence or excitement. Instead, we just have another blank show for a blockbuster whose only reason to exist is that the viewer seems naive to unwavering violence, which is far more unreasonably gratuitous than anything in the original. Omni Consumer Products, which produced the original Robocop cyborg, turned into more totalitarian forces than ever before with suspected Nazi-esquire banners, stormtrooper guards and tanks for rent at the end; As for the anonymous old man (Daniel O 'Herlihy), he is a less benevolent protector and more ugly type of Mr. Burns, surrounded by moronic robbers who truly believe that putting the brain of a murderous psychopath into the body of the new Robocop 2 is a good idea. And the first Robocop looks somewhere in the middle of this mess, although you wonder what he saw on the stage as a great actor like Peter Weller. Robot Tom Noonan has nothing to do as a villain, while Nancy Allen is badly wasting it as Robocop's partner. There are some merry moments everywhere; for example, opening the "Magnavolt" commercial, but this is a bad link to a really great original.
