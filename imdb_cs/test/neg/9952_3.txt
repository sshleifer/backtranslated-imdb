George Zucco was a great actor, often playing criminals with eyes on his eyes with a lascivious intensity. However, even he could not save this dull and flat footprint of B. <br /> <br /> Zucco plays an ordinary mad scientist, Dr. Lorenzo Cameron, who believes that wolf blood, injected by humans, can create an invincible army of wolves who can win World War II (go figure!) Experimenting on Pedro's maintenance engineer (Glenn Strange) Zucco creates a werewolf who looks more like Dave Allen played in his comedy sketches! Apparently, Pedro is based on Lennie from Mouse and Men, and you almost expect him to say "Duh, ok, George!" There's one surprising moment when a werewolf kills a child by getting through the window and grabbing him, but most of the time it is routine and pedestrians - very walking - 77 minutes of all the old clich√©s that are much better in others. The devil's bat, working within himself, borrowed itself from the Son of Frankenstein! Zucco is useless and you only have to see him in movies like Adventures Of Sherlock Holmes, Mummy's Hand and Dr. Renault is secret to see how wasted. Several scenes of atmospheric swamps they really offer. And the scene where Zucco demonstrates his wolf technique to those who doubted him (again the shades of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde) is unintentionally cheerful. Not one of the best films from the 1940s.
