I watched this episode with high hopes after I saw it on the "Favorite Episodes" list of many people. I'm not bragging at all, but from the beginning I realized they were in some kind of toybox / can, with the huge eye looking at them, the kind of characters there. Although throughout the episode, the questions "Who Are We?", "Where Are We?", "What's Out?" To bear the tension of an episode (which I unfortunately already figured out), I must say that the different types of characters and the interactions between them made the episode interesting enough. Although the story twist may have been harder to guess if all of them were (toys) soldiers.
