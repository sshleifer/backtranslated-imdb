Milla excels in this film because of her personal style and the way she hangs on her. I learned to hate that crumpled little three-year-old face he does when he pretends to cry. It does all the points trying to make it as a serious actress drop quickly. Of course, in the movie with Baldwin and Denise, she's still shining like a mature actress. David seemed to be making Woody Allen on the way of Howdy Doody. Neither a single word nor a gesture throughout the film seemed sincere or even honest. "How Harry Met Sally" and "Two Weddings and Funeral", even "Sleepless in Seattle" had scripts, location and ACTORS. The scenario seemed to be a string of bad and gross gags separated by LOT OF TALKING. Places seemed to be in several blocks. There are only two actors in this indie swing dishrag, milla and the lady who played the cat that was into the stars. I watched most of it when I first turned off the sound, just watching Mill. That first gag was old when I first saw it and it's a stupid rip of the song in "How to succeed in business without really trying".
