I seemed to find trailers better than the movie. They did their job and I was interested in watching UNKNOWN. Interest soon disappeared. Easy traffic in the countryside. Five men wake up in a chemical warehouse and do not know why they are there; you no longer know how they got there in hell. Confusion and paranoia bring fear and mistrust. Men learn that the kidnapper is on his way with plans to kill his hostages. Now the men are diluting each other and trying to distinguish whether they are all victims and who can actually be one of the kidnappers. The cast includes: Jim Caviezel, Greg Kinnear, Joe Pantoliano, Bridget Moynahan, Barry Peppper, David Selby and Adam Rodriguez.
