A real insult to the original "Spoorloos", which is one of the most disturbing movies (and I want it as a compliment!) I've seen in recent years. <br /> <br /> Where the original is cool and brilliant, the remake is flat and even boring, especially the "happy end" finale takes away what was little in the film in the first place. While such a distortion (especially grafting) the happy ending "that wasn't there before" is quite often the case of "remake" of Hollywood European films and could have been expected, the biggest disappointment is that this missing mess was created by the same filmmaker who made the original "Spoorloos" ... <br /> <br /> Why Mr. Sluizer decided to destroy his masterpiece in such fashion is beyond me. <br /> <br /> Avoid This Abomination at any cost, because it could spoil the original for you, even if you watched it after that, much less ...
