I felt compelled to write about this movie after I joined the IMDb because I thought it was the worst scenario I ever saw. <br /> <br /> Acting / direction / other areas of the movie are fantastic. I love Brad Pitt with George Clooney. It works. The first movie was still a funny joke. My question is how in the world did they leave this scenario out of the preparation process? I thought that not only was the conspiracy evolving like a slug at the end of the pavement, but that it was twisting? (I can call it) was so incredibly stupid that I wanted to go on demand for a refund from the box office. I have never felt this way and used it all my life. Here I was expecting something similar to the first movie (good chemistry, good acting, good direction, amazing plot) just to find out that they took $ 8 and made it ridicule. The part that gets me still is that this movie now has more than $ 125 million. In short, I felt that this film had insulted my intelligence. I still feel that the only part the writers focused on was Julia Roberts acting like Julia Roberts. This movie made me sad and angry.
