If I had to build this movie idea on Hollywood bigwigs, I'm sure it would sound like this: \ t * ME: “Four boys in private high school are good friends and they are witches. Hollywood: "Sounds like" The Craft ". ME: "No, no, I said four boys, not four girls." Hollywood: "It still sounds like" The Craft ", just with boys instead of girls." ME: "OK, but there's this fifth unknown boy coming into the picture and he wants more power." Hollywood: "There's still not much difference because one The girls in "The Craft" also wanted more power. <br /> <br /> ME: "OK, OK ... I'll make these boys part" in the crowd, they will be rich, and the school is on the east coast. Hollywood: "Now it sounds original. It's not like" The Craft ", here's a billion dollars." This film was so cliché and uninspiring. Even the drama produced between Chase and the Ipswich brothers was very bright. children, with their biggest problem, what color Bentley wants for their 18th birthday (and 18th car), I don't care at all, even though they have powers, every child in this movie looked like they were out of the magazine and of course there had to be no reason nudity and female 80% nudity just to go home as you are out of shape, I wanted to rename this movie "Witch OC" Oooh, rich children and their problems. This film was absolutely unimaginable and predictable, the final fight was lame and ripped out and the end was very antisimatic, which was the best film on the cutting room. floor.
