I just caught "Wild Rebels" on one of the "Mystery Science Theater 3000" compilations and this movie was so bad that even the MST3K crew couldn't enjoy it. There are some MST3K "goals" that were movies whose concepts were so dippy that they couldn't be good movies (like "Green Slime"), and others whose base spaces could be made into truly fun movies if their filmmakers threw is up to execution. "Wild Rebels" is a movie whose basic premise DID made a good movie three years earlier when Don Siegel directed his remake "The Killers" at Universal. Both films are about an unsuccessful racing driver who is seduced by a deadly femme into driving a car in a robbery that was embodied by a woman's friend - only in "The Killers" driver was John Cassavetes, a woman was Angie Dickinson and a criminal master. (Cast wildly but successfully against the type in what it turned out to be his final film) was Ronald Reagan. Steve Alaimo, Bobbie Byers and Willie Pastrano are quite a comedy! But what makes REALY "Wild Rebels" horrible movie is directed by William Gref√© (note the accent over the last "e" that is present in the on-screen credit), which has absolutely no sense of pace and seems to leave all the shot running At least half again if he needs to make his dramatic point. It's just a shame that someone didn't make a mocking commentary on this film (in 2009); a comparison between Steve Alaim's and Rod Blagojevich's hairstyle would be irresistible!
