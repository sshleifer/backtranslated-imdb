There was a lot of hype from this movie and the ads seemed like it was great. Sadly, like Bring It On 2, Bring It On 3 the ashamed glory of the original Bring It On. There is silly stereotyping in the film. The lines given to the actors were humiliating for all the film races. Hayden Panattiere's performance was the second time both in terms of gaming and cheerleading. There were several scenes in which I literally cringed because I was embarrassed to cast because the scene (lines, conspiracies, etc.) were so stupid. My recommendation to the creator of any future bring it on movies is that you should hire good cheerleaders and learn to act because the "acting" cast was horrible and their lack of cheerleading skills made them totally useless to the movie. Only a great character: Kirresha.
