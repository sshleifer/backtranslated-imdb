After a pleasant atmospheric original and a surprisingly stupid second, this incredibly boring, slow and hostile sequel meets with a big downturn. Again criminal criminal master Bat (Hammy Luis Aceves Castaneda) tries to steal valuable jewelry from the Aztec Popoca mummy. The bat builds a jolly awkward humming robot with a human brain to reach this nasty target. Directed evenly by Rafael Portillo, with Talky and the boring script of Alfred Salazar and Guillermo Calderon, crispy continuity (for example, Bat was clearly killed at the end of the previous movie, but is miraculously alive and well here!), An unbearably slow scenario, excessive footage of the first two movies , a meandering narrative, a crippling lack of action and momentum, largely grim going through (un) movements of an obviously uninteresting cast, and a poorly staged climate battle between mum and robot (the film finally breaks into a stupid life with great bash, but unfortunately it doesn't it hardly takes two miserable minutes, and it turns out to be too late to alleviate the severity of general overwhelming boredom), this numbly dry, drained and overstretched snorefest speed is a complete washout.
