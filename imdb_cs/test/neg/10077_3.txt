(Possible smaller spoiler) The first "Jurassic Park" was an effective but stupid movie that did its job and was actually pretty good. The sequel to "The Lost World" had several decent moments, but those were destroyed by the lame end of the movie that T-Rex was running amok in San Diego. Now in "Jurassic Park III", what little story was in the first and sequel, was thrown out of the window and replaced by just 90 minutes of essentially a non-stop action that would work if the film wasn't so badly done. Sam Neill is back as dr. Grant, who received the proposal of a couple (William H. Macy & Tea Leoni) to come with them to help them find their son, who was lost more than 2 months. Of course, this island is becoming inhabited by dinosaurs, and of course the plane you're on will happen to crash and let them get stuck with the dinos bunch after them. This one was obviously meant to be an exciting ride, without a real story at all, but it doesn't even bring this film to that level. Director Joe Johnston ("Jumanji") somehow managed to take what little magic remained in "Jurassic" movies and squeeze life out of it. <br /> <br /> Dinos look good, though now they 're just a fair standard and not too scary. The bottom line is that it's not a very good movie or an exciting ride. * of 4 stars.
