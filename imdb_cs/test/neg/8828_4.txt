It is very possible that I did not make a big enough chance for the film because it was so imminent for me (something similar to Triplets of Belleville), but I really should have seized when I gave the movie and I was a roommate, a student from Japan , he immediately laughed in the movie and said it sounded stupid. I do not agree that it is stupid, the animation is very simple but very skillful. It's like a classic animation with added layers that add another element of realism to them, while remaining strictly in the surreal moment. However, the subject is totally unpleasant to me. It has an interesting message of kindness and greed, but it is packed in such an unpleasant package that it is almost not good to learn, especially since you already knew it. The sound effects while the man is loudly devouring cherries and cherry pits, for example, are really repulsive. There was a clever scene of animation as we constantly dive into the hole that the man finds in his head as he pulls the sapling out of his head, but continues so long that everything else overshadows. There are so many stocks that one sequence that it's almost like the whole movie is about. As I said about the Triplets of Belleville, it would be great for a late night television program as an adult swim, or his Japanese counterpart, but an Oscar nominated movie? It gives me the impression that there is generally no long list of animated short films to choose from.
