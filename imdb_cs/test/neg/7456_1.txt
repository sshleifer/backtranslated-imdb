I don't know where to start. Dragon Hunt can be the worst film in the history of cinema. Even Anus Magilicutty was better than this because it was intentionally wrong. Showgirls? No, she was kitschy and was a technically well-made film. But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and dreams, then throws it back and feeds the homeless. It's that it's a lot of pleasure. Negotiations, if even called, are harsh. It does not have the magic of improvised acting, so it must be written, but it is recited with an almost malignant tone of low quality. Several lines have been delivered in a way that shows the actors (or basically those people on the screen) either regretted being associated with this movie, or wondering about a particularly funny joke on the Live Night Saturday that they watched before they got to the movie. camera. I could write another three paragraphs about the quality of playing in this movie, but we and I don't want to hear it. Make-up and special effects (which, for most movies, it's the only good thing) was ridiculously bad. The antagonist, whose name is so ridiculous that I don't remember, has a Mohawk stuck to the top of his head. Yeah, stuck to your head. And you can also say that it is stuck on it, if you look at the place where it meets its skull you see, you can see the plastic strip, unlike those on the false eyelashes. Fortunately, it is almost the only example of make-up no-nos in the film. <br /> <br /> There is also some terrible character development to make it easy. Women who are strangely harshly manipulated by supposedly benevolent fugly brothers (and I think they're really pushed around) aren't just ugly, but ... they're gasping ... they don't know what they're doing! In one scene he turns to his seeming lover, joins an even uglier evil guy, and then snorts some coke. Apparently they managed to get their hands on some really good cocaine because they started shaking and laughing before everything went into the nostrils. Great timing girls! In addition, they wear some really horrible clothes that belong exclusively to the late 80s and early 90s. Overall, this movie, this movie, this film waste I should say, is also a waste of time. Tracking will hurt and will require suspension not only of your faith but of your entire brain. If you want to stoner with your friends and have some good laughs, see if you can get this movie (you'll probably have to download it), otherwise don't even think about it. I hope I was useful.
