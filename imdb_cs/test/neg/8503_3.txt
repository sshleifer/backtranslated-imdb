Graffiti Artist I was not impressed with, despite the fact that it is a breathing (aka low budget improvisation) appeal. There is little dialogue and at least for me, I was disappointed that it did not give more credit or support the work of guerrillas like these. Instead, it was a story that covers a familiar territory. Two boys, who basically do just a little more than tagged buildings, become friends, mark partners, and eventually experiment with relationships. They look like opposites, rather unpleasant. Little is explained their background and things between the two young men are happening at a fast pace (though I can understand it because it's only 70 minutes). In recent years there have been countless similar graphs and productions to such an extent that the realm of independent film becomes just as saturated with this particular narrative as this stream is increasingly saturated. Most of the film can carry a viewer who needs immediate dialogue and purpose. The primary character of this story (at least extensively), performs its routines with almost no dialogue, no insight, and nothing else to carry the viewer. And for a short film, I wanted them to get to the place much faster. That, apart from my typical conspiracy, made me angry. Yet there was something that momentarily appeared in the daily habits of at least two graffiti artists, though most of them were rather vacant. Don't forget an independent picture and some are interested in this underground form of urban art. But you really have to look at it yourself, because it seems to be one with a more acquired taste.
