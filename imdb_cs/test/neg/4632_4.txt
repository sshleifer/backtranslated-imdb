History and experience over the past decades has shown us that the intellectuals who talk about sex relate to vague and intellectual things that anyone can do, but in 1986 it was not so obvious. The characters of greedy drive to find comfort, safety and pleasure in sexual acts is actually an unhealthy motif that makes them so unbearable to themselves - which are hiding from themselves with more sex. This journey is associated with the "decline of the American Empire" as expressed in the early film interview. So the idea is that relatively repulsive people talk about sex, and that speech is supposed to reveal how rude people are. At the very least, Arcand keeps it moving and moving by doing things with the camera, such as isolating most of the characters in each frame, revealing their ultimate loneliness and quick cutting between them, showing how much they are in the war. they are by agreement. And to get the credit to Arcanda, it's largely what is an intellectual life, a constant struggle with other intellectuals to excel, even though everyone knows that standing outside means standing alone. But yeah, characters and actions are inconsistent and pathetic. I think this film is much more an aspect of its time than it is supposed to last, which makes it almost dated. It is also the exact type of mental buffing in dialogue and links to people like Susan Sontag, who makes art films so popular with populist entertainers. In any case, I'll take it the same way - it has a place basically between the exact type of people that are characters - it's just that it's not really interesting or important to anyone who isn't of these characters. <br /> <br /> - PolarisDiB
