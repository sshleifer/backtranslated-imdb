According to most people, I know that I saw this movie and the reviews I read, it was supposed to be an extremely fun thriller that oh so more people must be seen. I didn't expect this movie to throw me out, but I certainly didn't expect this movie to be average at best, which is what it is. French and studied them as a student, so I am aware of the clich√©s and oblique plots that the English and American audiences can observe. There are some great French movies that should be provided with an extended international edition, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> To start with the fence is as far appealing, despite the complex and too clever assed to be fun so you feel every minute of your 2-hour and 5-minute run and at a time when everything is finally revealed, you are out of care . The main character alone lacks a real charisma or even an acting talent to focus your attention on him and his way at any time near the crap ending when you even thought about swallowing the main plot twists that began to dawn on you that you were wasting your time! In fact, I remember turning off before the credits really started to roll after the film was reunited - that was when I was sure I had almost completely wasted my time by the way. The film is not the worst thing I've ever seen, but it seems to be overrated. For example, I have read somewhere that overcomes all Bourne Identity movies in terms of tension or even having a "wall tension". I can say with certainty that some people deny this frankly boring movie. 4/10 is a generous review of this movie that I feel. therefore, save 1s, 2s and 3s for them.
