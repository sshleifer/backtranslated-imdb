I borrowed this DVD by the director of the movie I work with, playing the actor who plays Prospero. Knowing my own style, I did not expect anything to resemble a "classic" interpretation of the text. What I found is sometimes striking, sometimes evocative, but often meandering and tiring. Like most experimental music, even in films like this, building blocks of powerful filmmaking are created, though they have not found their most useful form in a more cohesive format. We have a Caliban who is more clown than a threat, and who even Miranda does not seem terribly afraid (which is strange because we know he tried to rape her at least once). Stefano and Trinculo, who are more annoying than funny. Strangely young Prospero who looks like Amadeus. And a great loss of character development and conspiracy through creative editing and highly stylized posture. Interestingly, I have no problem with the way Ferdanand or Miranda is being portrayed. His overwhelming rapture and her slightly strange innocence are actually quite appropriate. I'm not saying it's a bad movie, but experimental. The one who has huge risks, but is more for the students of art and film, and not for anyone interested in him.
