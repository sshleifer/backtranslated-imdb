Necessary things were one of my favorite books by Stephen King. But this film is one of the worst books on film adaptations I've ever seen that so many things have changed around them that it has caused me illness. Even the concept of a book is a delusion, things that do not always appear to be a reminder throughout the book have not been shown in the film. Although it was pleasant, as many Stephen King's films are, but so many Stephen King films this did not come out of the book and became a piece of the trailer of the Hollywood trailer. 2/10
