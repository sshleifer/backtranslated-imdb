I just can't believe the people who did and played in this movie took it seriously. SNL skits look more real. Everything was fake. Dirty gunfights, ridiculous struggles, dialogue, whimsical background music and even the blind eye of Bo. If she was billed as a comedy, it would still make more sense, but it would still be wrong. I see it as "fun" only when you get a room full of stone college students watching it as if it was a Rocky Horror Picture Show. Imagine some of the things you've seen on Blazing Saddles, like Mongo Knocking Horse Down or Old Lady Gettinf Stomach-Punched. Now imagine that the manufacturer wants you to take these scenes seriously and you have got these catastrophes.
