Wesley Snipes's latest movie in the video is a convoluted mess, reminiscent of Steven Seagal's latest works. The script is terribly written and does not take into account the low budget and tries to be too smart for its own good. Sadly, Snipes has fallen into a trap where ADR's voice has doubled, making a lot of his dialogue, and the whole narrative that comes every now and again. It is sad to see a guy from Wesley Snipe's talent doing trash like this movie and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothering to create his own dialogue. It was a bit of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact that he wasn't doing his own dialogue, but it wasn't something I'd expected of Snipes. Maybe it's because of producer, Andrew Stevens, who worked with Seagal earlier, or director Po-Chi Leong, who is responsible for the epic bad Seagal's Out Of Reach. On the conspiracy there are shady government officials, terrorists who coach football teams, discs with incriminating evidence and a hefty missing money scandal. Oh and biological weapons. Now, how they are connected I don't know, but what I can tell you is that the diabolical scenario is hard to understand and, like many of these DTV films, this is too much. The plot is also uninteresting, it is played with cards with people who have a shadowy figure in the offices and dark aisles, etc. It's all that is possible, "let yourself sit down and send some plot for the sad bastards watching this movie!" The pace of the film itself suffers because, despite the stupor of the show and the story, the film has some nice action scenes. As an example of how DTV successfully passed the story of a twisted nature, I give you the directorial debut of Dolph Lundgren, the protector. The film had a share of twists and turns, but the film has almost the last hour of action, with Dolph encircled by terrorists. Plot points are narrated in the context of action, on the move, while avoiding death. The film keeps telling us what's going on, it won't break the pace. Although the conspiracy was a bit convoluted, it was more forgiven that the event never left. A detonator like too many of these movies, stops everything to give us a convoluted walk, who is bad, and who is not before inevitably shifts that wheel in the retracted from the back of the twist at the end. These movies can often suffer from stimulation problems. Snipes alone, as I mentioned, is quite bland here. Initially, he devotes himself to a camp personality, as is hidden from some arms dealers. At first it seemed as if he was having fun, but unfortunately the rest of the film saw him, and his occasional voice of double singing went through the role. Snipes only comes to life when he calls to kick his ass. But there is some nice action, with some quick and crunchy martial arts and some pretty punching gunfights. The film also has a decent chase behind the car. Silvia Colloca co-star and she's not much of an actress, but she's gorgeous, with a costume that shouts "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the cast fell in and out with clich√©s and uninteresting roles. Fortunately, Snipes has better projects sorted from now on. My next team with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, will do Chasing The Dragon, from director Chris Nahon, who was Jet Li's Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally Snipes apparently makes Toussaint, a biographical drama, directed by Danny Glover. The future is suddenly clearer for Snipes, but he remembers that he was very well paid for his DTV films, about $ 7 million in film, maybe more. It is also funny to consider that of all these Lower Lundgren gods of DTV, he makes better films, directs, with a pleasant defender and supremely violent and nicely executed Russian specialist, and what makes them for a fraction of the budgets these wicked victims Wesley and Steven Seagal produce. * 1/2
