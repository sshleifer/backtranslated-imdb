A divorced single mother in a picturesque seaside town finds an anonymous love letter and allows her to spur her sleeping love life into life. The Pet Project for Kate Capshaw, an actress / co-producer who gives warm, well-modulated performance, but this story is so slim and directional and increment that weak dissatisfaction creeps into it. friends who read her a love letter (an interesting visual joke), but the first person doing this trick is Ellen DeGeneres, who doesn't play a lesbian, but who is going to be one of those tricks. Various hopes are bent in the hope of being held, and continuity is extremely jerky. Supporting casts (including Tom Selleck and Tom Everett Scott, who usually play with the shirt) are very good, but they can't save the last act that is disappointing. Low-keyed, in an unpredictable, pleasant way, but it's pretty good-natured, nothing more. ** 1/2 from ****
