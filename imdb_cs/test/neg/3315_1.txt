I never voted 1 for a movie on IMDB, but for this one I'm sorry that the scale doesn't go down to -10. All I can say is that this movie is that I saw it in Sneak Preview, and it was my worst movie experience ever. I don't mind the stupid jokes. I can live with a stupid story. But when I see those stupid "main characters" with their pseudo-alien expression (only the Germans understand what I'm talking about), I felt I was a bit of a hatred I never thought I was capable of. (If they left them, the matter could actually be acceptable ...). This is no more about this. You can laugh once or twice because it's so ridiculous, but that doesn't mean anything better. I'm sure it's not funny. <br /> <br /> If you live outside Germany, be happy and rejoice that this terrible job is unlikely to go to your cinemas. If yes live in Germany, avoid this movie at all costs.
