So far I have not liked every Jean Rollin movie I have seen, and it has always bothered me because it is a recognized Euro-trash monument and very popular among many regular reviewers on this beautiful website; people whose opinions I always appreciate and usually agree with. It seems that his work always seems to surely cover some grim and stylistic film marks that are completely lost to me. Rollin's films are unimaginably boring, they all have the same basic concept (lesbian vampires in different environments), the dialogues are incredibly absurd, the gorgeous gothic environment is always underutilized and the production values ​​are cheaper than the price of a bus ticket. I actually gave up Rollin's repertoire (especially after the "The Iron Rose" persistence) until I learned about "Night of the Hunted". Reportedly, this film does not contain any lame lesbian vampires and stands as a bona fide horror movie with horrific murders and fearsome twists. And the verdict is? Yes and no! On the one hand, it is undeniably the most convincing and inventive Rollin's film, which I enjoyed seeing so far (and also the only one I watch without fading away). On the other hand, he still remains a moronic film with senseless conspiracy and heartless sexual sequences that compensate for drowsiness. Jean Rollin is struggling to create an atmosphere of secrecy and tension, mostly through the lack of information and vaguely established characters, but he can barely hide the fact that he has no story at all. The unearthly beautiful actress Brigitte Lahaie and the beautifully sinister musical lead are the only elements that keep you on screen. During a night ride home to Paris, a young man suddenly has to stop at a confused and barely dressed girl coming out of the forest. Her name is Elisabeth, but besides, she can't remember anything about herself and what or who she is running. Her case of amnesia is so bad that she still forgets who picked her up. The next day he is once again kidnapped by the old man and taken to a sinister apartment complex where many people in the same bizarre mental state are captured. Elisabeth knows nothing, but feels she has to escape from here. Of course, I will not reveal the denouement, but I can assure you that it is quite silly, illogical and far drawn. Apparently Rollin also realized that the explanation was very brief and quick. There are a lot of too strange and meaningless sequences, sexual shots are horrible and filmed without passion, ugly makeup effects look cheap and random without real purpose. As said, the score is fascinating and the perfect body of Brigitte Lahaie is addictive to glaze.
