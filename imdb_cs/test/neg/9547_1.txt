I can imagine the writers of this story inventing this script: <br /> <br /> 1. It's a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and Silence of the Lambs. People like the stuff of a serial killer. He'll sell it ... 2.The murderer has to accept a pattern. I know; copies it from a serial killer novel. It hasn't been done yet, at least not entirely. 3. Now we need some way to make this film unique; Of course, a good person can be bedridden as in the back window. 4. Lastly, we need a spiral end that will give this film the success of Sixth Sense and Usual Suspects. Well, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so you can't lose your money. One thing I really hate about filmmakers is that they have a perfectly good concept for movies and run them completely into the country. I wrote better stories than when I was at Junior High. I just checked my watch every five minutes. When the winding end finally arrived, I wasn't shocked, I just said, "Oh, who cares?" Characters are two-dimensional. They have their typical film personalities. This film is just a proof that stealing the elements of other successful films is not an excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10. Normally it would earn at least 2 or 3, but I'm so sick of unoriginality. When will they learn? 1/10
