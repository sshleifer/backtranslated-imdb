I was still a photographer who worked in Europe in the summer when Jim Salter filmed Three. I've done some swollen pictures for him, one of which has been told as a movie poster. I haven't seen the film after years. I thought it was bad. Too bad because the elements that entered it were convincing. Robie Porter's girlfriend was as beautiful as herself. He asked Salter if I should stay on and be a cameraman, so they wouldn't have to shoot everything twice. I told myself, but I had to go back to NY, I promise I'll be back. Unfortunately, I never came back. One of the non-life melodies. <br /> <br /> I wish I could send photos I did somewhere. Rowland Scherman
