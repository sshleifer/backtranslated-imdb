Let's go straight to the heart of the matter ... That's a horrible movie. The story is confusing, the support cast is ridiculous, and the main actors seem to be forced into it. The story asks us to believe that there is an underground lesbian sex cult where members are murdered by their transvestite psychiatrist. Ellen Barkin investigates crimes and develops a mood for Pete Wilson, whose work seems to be a cult recruiter. Sexual scenes are equivalent to bad porn and when Barkin and Wilson kiss, Poor Ellen seems to be in pain. Barkin's Talent is totally unnecessary in this class B class sexual exploitation class, and I hope she gave her the agent a pink slip after landing in this movie.
