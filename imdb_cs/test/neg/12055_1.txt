But I can't say how I really feel this pile of smoking manure. Where to start. The quality of the film is not. I've seen clearer pictures on US FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS! Negotiations are non-standard, the effects of gore are fine. The clown mask is the best part of this film, the story is repeated. Same thing over and over again. At least on Friday, 13th or HALLOWEEN, we are largely holding one main character. There are no main characters, just victims. Man, now we're getting to the worst of all. The last survivor kills the clown and finds out that she was one of her friends. When the police finally arrive, they don't trust her and she is locked in a rubber room. What end you call it, stupid, that's it. In my opinion, there is no excuse for the bad end of a horror movie that was just sloppy writing. Apology: "It must end badly, it's horror." or "We have to end it badly to leave it open for continuation" are just lame apologies and that's it. I have to give CAMP BLOOD THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
