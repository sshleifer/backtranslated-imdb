One of the most well-known banned "Video Nasties" from the 1980s is also one of the most over-publicized. "Make Them Die Slow" is about what you would expect from Umberto Lenzi-driven jungle potboiler ?? inventive (yet poorly provided) native torture techniques, some ridiculous "social commentary" (yes, even sillier than "cannibal holocaust") and lots of guts chewed. However, the exploitative violence of a film often only appears in short detail and has never appeared for a very long time, reducing its effect (interpret it as you can). Dialogue is Lenzi's usual stupidity because our male heroes show their affection for women by calling them "tw @ t" and so on. The cast of familiar faces (including Lorraine De Selle, Giovanni Lombarda Radice, Zora Kerowa and Robert Kerman) does their best in the face of escalation escalation (including a totally absurd "castration"), but it cannot be overworked, miserable save. effort.
