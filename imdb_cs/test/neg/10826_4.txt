I went to see this movie to kill some time. I remember Cole Hauser in "Tigerland", and although his performances are wooden, he portrays the stiff character of "leader". Same here. This film was about a lot of young, hot scientists and divers who explored a cave in Romania that needs to be diving to see it. The initial scene was very interesting, with a bunch of Romanian or Russian men exploring the cave in search of prey. Lightning for 30 years, and we have a team of divers who have been called by a scientist and his crew to explore a cave for some unknown scientific purpose. There's a lot of clich√©, no use. Women are too hot for their work, let's face it. I hate to watch the lips of these women talk about guys while drinking beer in a pre-cave exploration party. It was like we were at a bar with frat and sorority types talking about the opposite sex - not a group of scientists and divers. Each character had a ZERO personality, perhaps with the exception of a scientist who at least was not one of the young and beautiful people. Although acting, though artistic, was not inspiring. The dialogue was bad enough. At one point in the movie, Cole Hauser ("Jack"), the lead diver - his morph iris into the Cingular wireless symbol, and stay like that. We are led to believe that since he was scratched by one of these monsters, he has become one of them. Sufficient. But first of all, no one tells him what's obvious: "What's wrong with your eyes, buddy?" No. They were all just talking about being "changed" and not being the leader of the group anymore. And then this guy says, "See how he is not HUMAN". Huh? If they really believed it to be a monster, why not? Instead, the group split into two - those who go with Jack, and those who go separately, I think it's a monster. It makes no sense. The best scene in the movie was this blonde diver woman walking through the cave wall, and gets attacked by this goblin. Her scream was really sucked - but she fought like hell to send an elf. <br /> <br /> The photo was fine when the camera was STILL. But all the action sequences, the director found it useful to confuse the hell out of us with blinking bubbles, flashlights, dark space, God knows what. I wish they'd show us the scene in a while. Just because you move the camera all over the place, no SCARIER, people. <br /> <br /> This movie could be much better if the following changes were made: <br /> <br /> 1. Every actor was replaced by someone who looked real. Let Cole Hauser be the leader, it's okay to let him be good. I'm tired of seeing 20 supermodels. Give me a break, guys! 2. The cameraman was fired and replaced by a man who just showed the camera and sat down. That could be a director's mistake, I don't know. Jumpy camera (as in Constant Gardener) is aging, people. 3. We must see that the goblins are actually eating people. What seizure? There is nothing else in this movie. We barely saw those creatures - I felt a little torn about it. 4. The end was lame. During the denouement, a sexy British scientist has a secret ... guess what it is? It's a little conserved. The end would be better if everyone died instead of blacks (Morris Chestnut), who seemed to have a little sympathy in his character, just his worried expressions. All the other actors had no expression. <br /> <br /> I gave him 4 out of 10 because, after all, the negotiations were without any noticeable mistakes and the concept was quite original. I'd like to see Cole doing more military roles - he's good at it.
