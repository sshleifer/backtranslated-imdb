The fact that this crispy series could trigger dozens of comments (much fewer hundreds of "voices") speaks of the decline of Western (or at least American) civilization. <br /> <br /> Read Proust, you idiot! ! Or at least Dave Barry or the Calvin and Hobbes anthologies. Chuck Norris. Wrap yourselves around the fact that in order to evaluate or write about this series, you would have to spend a few minutes ... well, HOURS ... to look at this poor nerd pedaling boards and spouting lines with less emotional impact than gal used to call the right time in your local service. <br /> <br /> DO NOT SHOW THIS EXHIBITION !! PLEASE PLEASE YOUR PRESENT CELLING CELLS!
