It is difficult to decide whether this film suffers from a stupid dialogue, or if it is just to be bullshit. In any case, it suffers from a scenario that is average at best. Although in the late 1980s, the first part of the film plays as a 60's teenage teen comedy (preventing the absence of any real humor). ), especially the part of the "good girl", which is as annoying as the Doris Day character you might be hoping for, including the gentle resentment of something "fun" that her friends want. The net effect is that after a while you start hoping it will bite, so you no longer have to listen to her voice. Some blasphemy and gratuitous nudity, plus some really 80s clothes, is your only guideline that this film was made in the 1980s. And some nice music. Storywise, it's a pretty formal matter. Bunch of horny (as opposed to, of course, from 'Miss Pretty Girl') Teenagers decide to celebrate Halloween night by throwing a party in a haunted house. Followed by a party and fornication, along with an unexcused "session" that starts the demonic property spree that is the subject of the film. After this, the only tense part will try to guess in which order the characters will expire. I'm sure you don't care whether or not they will. Actors are so bad that they become demons / zombies / dinners in fact improving their performance somewhat, and the ridiculously clich√© dialogue is so uncomfortable that it curls into place. Gorewise, this movie is not nuthin 'special unless you think cheesy is a kind of' specialty '. For example, a demon head that occasionally appears is so blatantly false that you're wondering if it's a 5-year trick-or-healing. That doesn't mean anything nice in the movie. Some music is not half bad, and the first of our crazy Scooby gangs who are in control plays an amazing and really sexy dance routine in one place before it becomes ugly. Also, and I don't know why, at the very end of the film, I actually got involved. The tension that is lacking in most of the film appeared late, and I began to pull myself out of restlessness instead of annoyance. What is a horror movie? Indeed, I can't bring this rock-bottom rating to the movie because some inexplicable miracle (I don't exclude being obsessed) demons. I was actually a little creepy. <br /> <br /> You won't pay money to see it. Hardly worth your time, but only hard money. Check out YouTube when it's there.
