Get Shorty was an excellent movie. It was funny and had a perfect balance of highly comic acting and serious conspiracy. Be Cool is like some cheap knock-off that is trying to pass on the sequel. John Travolta, like Chili Palmer, seems to have forgotten that he was in the crowd. It plays like he is a bored movie exec, rather than a bored movie exec who used to be Shylock. Uma Thurman, great in almost every role she has ever played, comes as tense and confusing. Should he be ditzy or smart? The chemistry between her and Travolta is tense and unpleasant. Other than that, just add every movie cliche you can think of. A well-educated rap producer from Cedric The Entertainer, a clumsy gangster who likes Andre 3000, a girl with a heart, soul, and a good set of pipes in Christina Miliana, an unusual black dude in Vince Vaughn, and the stupid celebrity portraits Stephen Tyler. The only funny part was the Rock, who invented his own new clich√© as a gay actor Samoana of the Wannabe. Probably the biggest crime is conspiracy. Get Shorty was clever when Chili played one group against the other and climbed to the top. But this film tries to make about a million different characters. And even Chili doesn't know what's going on. Get Shorty Fans Are Warned: This is a very different, very worse movie.
