Wow. Not because of 3-D images that were sometimes used nicely to provide good deep images, but what a lame end! It seems to be imploding at the end of the film. This film must be one of the strangest movie monsters ever and one of the most pathetic attempts to explain it. Misogyny of this film is also painful. If you are looking for a bad science fiction film 50s that will laugh (aka "bot feed"), go for it. Otherwise look for better movies.
