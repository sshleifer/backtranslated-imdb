I found the film completely and completely incomprehensible. I knew of some facts about the Caravaggio, but here they were twisted and confused. Images were wonderfully interesting, but I was looking for more for the biographical and / or critical accounting of Caravaggio's life and works, not the LSD type drug trip. The dialogue was very confusing, and in time it skipped through trains, calculators, typewriters and cigarettes. If he was labeled "artsy", I wouldn't buy a DVD; now I have a DVD that I will never watch and who would buy it? I prefer mainstream movies, not those that require translation or clarification. Thumbs down on this one for me!
