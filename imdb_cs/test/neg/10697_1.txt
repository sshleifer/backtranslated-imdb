This piece of Crap is actually a BOMB like the bottom of the barrel. I can't figure out what's worst; Norris's blunt depiction of anonymity (not a big feature in the action protagonist) or the hysterical overload of Christopher Neame. This film shows no level. Action sequences are tame, the storyline is thin, and scenes to be horrible look like a 1950s clich√©. You can't just fill the room with smoke and men in rubber suits and expect the audience to scream in horror. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film won't do anything for me. In fact, it looks like an unfortunate mix between a cheap movie movie and a rip of Miami Vice with a little sprinkling of hell. No, wait. It was supposed to be a yawn.
