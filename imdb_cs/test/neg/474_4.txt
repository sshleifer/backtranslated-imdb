I enjoy B movies. I think Bruce Campbell is a very attentive actor. I love how he adds his lines. Evil Dead 2 and 'Army of Darkness' were great movies. I liked the "Run of Time". However, I do not know if I will watch this movie again ... and I bought it. Now that I say, I bet it's worth watching comments and special features! This movie has too many holes for me to really enjoy, even as a cheaper movie. First, Ted Raimi was annoying, just angry. There was nothing that his badly behaved / written character hadn't done better a thousand times before. Direction sadly under par and choice of some shots ... yikes. I don't expect Woody Allen or James Cameron to be here, but Campbell didn't deliver it. I didn't buy this thought that it would be Oscar's movie as 'Annie Hall' but I'm still disappointed. I'd be happy with 'Mallrats' or 'The Rhino Brothers'. I had much less. At the end of the film, there were no scenes that would appear to me to be a dialogue that resonated in me. Even the 'Hostel' had a classic line for petes sake! I do not recommend this movie.
