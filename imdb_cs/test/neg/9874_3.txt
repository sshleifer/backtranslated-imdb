I am an almost twenty-year-old who reads comics for most of his life. I'm not a big fan of the Fantastic Four, but I'm quite familiar with them. In 1994, Roger Corman (B-film legend) produced the first, I think, feature film Fantastic Four. The result was such a pure schlock that it was never given release. There are still copies, mostly on the Internet and on conventions. If you're looking for a laugh and you can find a copy of your favor and check this thing out. The film basically repeats FF's origins and meeting with Doom Doom and the villain named Jeweler, essentially a molecular man with a penchant for tiny malaise. As with these comic book films, everything has to build on everything so FF plays an important role in the creation of Dr. Dooma and he and the jeweler play a vital role in their role. First of all, I would like to mention that, despite everything that was bad in this movie, I'm actually so fond of a guy who played Doom. He doesn't get many decent lines, but when he hits them. Armor also looks pretty good. As for the rest ... it's a dirty, dirty mess. Bad conspiracy, bad behavior, bad effects, bad everything basically. Boos especially Jay Underwood, who brought a new meaning to overnaing as Johnny Storm. It's not exaggerated, it's ultra. <br /> <br /> As for FF, they look good and Sue plays a very attractive actress, but it doesn't seem to be a real team. For one thing, they have no reason why Sue and Johnny should go into space. Ben and Reed go in the first part to visit two, Johnny as 8 and Sue is about 12. It just stands to make their possible romantic pairing superbly creepy. Thing looks more reptilian than anything else, not too rocky, and the only time a human torch is really a human torch looks like a silver surfer toned in red. I could write hours, but I think the scene that best describes it is a climate encounter with the above-mentioned non-human torch. It races with a laser beam and eventually destroys it with a blow. Yes, blow. Laser beam. With a blow. Then he flies around and goes "Yippee!" a lot, then the camera leans down and flies back toward Earth. Apparently, Reed's intellectual forgot to inform Johnny that the fire was not in the vacuum of the universe. This and many other scenes work like Looney Toones, if they don't know they're above the cliff, they don't fall. I laughed, I cried, I was glad it was never released.
