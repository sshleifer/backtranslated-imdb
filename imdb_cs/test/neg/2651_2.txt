Harrison Ford plays Sergeant Dutch Van Den Broeck District of Columbia Police Department. He's trying to get those bad guys, but he's not going to do a good job. When we meet him, he tries to catch a corrupt secret officer. Kristin Scott Thomas plays New Hampshire Senator, Kay Chandler, attempting to get reelected. He runs against a candidate who has a lot of money. The last thing he needs is the death of her husband. He's a politician - he can't be overwhelmed with feelings. This story moves slowly and painfully. I was looking at my watch every five minutes and wondering when it would end! The story is lost in detail The director, Sydney Pollack, did not have to insert. We don't want to know about Dutch police investigations. They cast insight into the policies and controls they do for campaigns. After seeing the movie, I'm still wondering why they were romantically involved. Is he mourning anyone anymore? You don't need more than two weeks to even think about saying goodbye to someone else? It was good to see the actress, comedian, native Chicago and Bonnie Hunt second city graduates. Her role is not necessarily a comic relief, but she was the only one I wanted to see more. Do yourself a favor, wait for it on the video if you want to see it at all.
