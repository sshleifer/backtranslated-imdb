Capturing Bigfoot is one of the strongest and worst films of all time. I love Sasquatch and Bigfoot, but this is just a waste of one time. Terrible, terrible, terrible! I watched this movie last night and it was all I could do to watch. Capture Bigfoot, but it was the only thing that made sense in this movie. It made some fun part though. There was this very cheesy and corny disco club with a very bad disco dance that seemed to go for too long in the movie. I think the director was trying to fill the time. Pink Faux Fur Bigfoot.It was ridiculous.If you want to see the very bad movie Bigfoot, then I suggest you buy this movie.
