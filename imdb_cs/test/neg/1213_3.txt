I was pleasantly surprised. It's actually quite interesting and engaging. The cast is strong, even Dan Cortese. Brooke Shields came as an actress. Black and white really had to free her because I had never seen her play such a conventional character in such a great command. If they sell correctly, there may be moderate interventions.
