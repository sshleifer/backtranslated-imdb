This movie is a really big piece of basket trying to make it look like a Hollywood production. The Outline of the Story (The Silly Tale of the Robot) ... the ultra-bad playing non-traditional pop idols ... and trying to "fight" !! My God ... those poor actors use wires to look like "good fighters" ... :( and I hate arrogant Edison Chen ... the worst actor I've ever seen !!! touch his movies again. I wanted to give him a negative value of ten ... not even 0/10.
