We thought it was one of the worst movies ever. I had to voluntarily follow the end. Romance was unbelievable; the characters were not developed; love affair barely made sense; it was bad; and the scenery was absolutely stupid because it was either (my opinion) like ADAMS FAMILY GOAMES VACATION ... just scary, gypsy and cheesy; and OUTERBANKS typically do not look like those surf houses; and who would spend the night in one during a hurricane if it wasn't theirs. Also ... it wasn't realistic. hurrricanes give you a lot of attention so you can fly through the hatches. and does not correspond to the story What does civil war actually have to do with the outer shores? I must also mention the wardrobe ... had D Lane in every scene had a scarf / pashmina / scarf? It was exaggerated. She looked good enough not to hide things; without being visible as with lightweight socks. Finally I deal with the impact on our landfills, where everyone has to deal with this stupid and I think STUPID film !!!! Don't fall for hype on this !!!!!! We did. Not even observable.
