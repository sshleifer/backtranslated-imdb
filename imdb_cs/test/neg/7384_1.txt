This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. No story, no point, it wasn't even funny at all, not sure why people say this movie is merry because it sucked too much! Felix Bean sucked in the main character. Susanna screamed. This film was made in 1996 and was really set up in the 1980s. What else, I'll never let my friend pick movies again. Hmm, the film cover said it was from producers from super soldiers who kidnapped them and stole their identities. Wow, that's a waste of time. The only minute that was funny was Freaky Ricky, was funny, especially when they and Emily were together. That was funny. All and everyone, it is knocked down, a waste of time and sleep. Wow, he never thought such a movie could be created, so stupid to watch him to the end.
