I received a copy of this movie from a friend for my 21st birthday, which he apparently picked up for 99p from a convenient video basket. I've never been so frustrated when I watched the movie - it was tiring, Adam West was wasted (literally) and I can't remember one thing in return. My lack of enjoyment grew to such an extent that the second of the loans rolled, we broke the cassette and hung the tape around the living room. Just for good measure, we lit the cover.
