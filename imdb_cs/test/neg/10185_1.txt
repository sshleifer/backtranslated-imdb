My mom and I rented this movie. We mean these Sci-Fi movies, whether it's big Hollywood flicks or Indy flicks. But oh, we were confused !! Two journalists investigate UFO kidnapping in a small Texas town. In the middle of the way, all sudden things get us to us. My mom and I believe in God and Jesus and the Devil, but the way this film preached made it annoying. All I really have to say is that we are Christians, but we like to have fun. So don't blame Christians as a whole, just blame Christians who need to suck on this movie. In fact, you can clearly understand the directors' attitude to UFOs and that is that he believes it is all demonic. Now I could say some words, but I won't. All I can say is that you won't see this movie unless you want to be preached. In fact, he says many times that we must be perfect to enter heaven. Well, the last time I checked that the only perfect man died on the cross.
