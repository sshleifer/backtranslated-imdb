I am a fan of paranormal and I love Ghost Hunters, so when this show first appeared, I decided to try it. I could barely sit in one episode. The show is so clearly staged. I think it will come, every episode includes someone who is possessed or includes a demonic force that tries to kill the family. Another big flaw is that these guys never did anything wrong. Looking at Ghost Hunters, they find evidence and try to disprove it, and if they can't, it is proof. They will find voice or video proof on this show and are very quick to call it a ghost. This will completely ruin their credibility as opposed to TAPS and Ghost Hunters who really know what they are doing. Honestly, if you're interested in paranormal and want to watch a show about it, watch Ghost Hunters.
