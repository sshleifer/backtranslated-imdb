With so many horrible spoof movies, this is unfortunately a breath of fresh air to the genre. Compared to classics like Airplane or Naked Gun, it's terrible, but compared to recent spoof movies like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie, it's very clever and original. Don't get me wrong even though it was by no means a good movie. I laughed a few times and there are several inspired gags, but every pop culture refers to her face, as do most movie jokes. Lambeau Fields (David Koechner) has been a bad coach in the past, but is now brought back to teaching football and this time he does a good job. His wife (Melora Hardin) is away from him and his daughter goes out with a big football shot to get rid of her father. Spoofs of various recent movies come into play, as do much visual gags and nonstop stupidity. <br /> <br /> The best parts of the movie are gags not relying on a link to recent movies. Radio spoofs, Rocky, Dodgeball, Friday night lights, Invincible and many other sports movies are not funny in the least. They are mainly small gags that get a few laughs, like a bizarre crotch scraping the scene, or chewing the chewing tobacco. These little laughing laughs must not carry the film and it's hard to watch in the end. She has been exhausting for the last 20 minutes to sit down. The characters are surprisingly developed for a sports spoof film, but I'm sure the characters were built on the clich√© of the genre. However, they are not too bad. David Koechner can turn off the lead actor in the film. Too bad they gave him so much confused material they could work with. Matthew Lawerence has a subtle comedic timing in a not always so comic role as a ballet dancer with a cross dressing father. Carl Weathers completes the cast, again playing in the subparpar sports film (Not Rocky Movies ... Happy Gilmore!) Overall, it's a goofy comedy. Sometimes it's funny, but more often than not, it's just very unpleasant and predictable. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, sexual humor and drug humor.
