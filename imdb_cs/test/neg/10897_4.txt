A young woman, Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander) and her boyfriend, Jess (Joey Mendicino), are being targeted for a serial killer after a break at a "comfortable break" at a distance. What could be an effective frightening cooler in more competent hands, turns out to be a confusing, ill-considered clutter under the sloppy direction of John Shiban (who also wrote the script). There's a lot of juicy violence, a short stir of nudity and self-confident performances from the cast, but that stupid script leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions that one can't help but feel disappointed. On on the surface, the film takes place as a standard clich√©-ridden 'killer-on-the-loose' movie, but Shiban (an ex-writer for X-Files) throws in some subtle supernatural elements that suggests that his goal was something else entirely: the spirit story, the rest ceases to function as a vengeful specter that punishes sinners. By reading on film, controlling viewer theories here on IMDb and watching some extras on DVD, some conspiracy elements begin to make a little more sense (though, even with the benefit of special information, there are still many questions left unanswered) . In my opinion, no film that would require this much investigation to understand itself (only partially) is not particularly good.
