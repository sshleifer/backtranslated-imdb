To be honest, the popularity of this show sad me. Inuyasha is definitely not terrible - she has a few good moments, an occasional glimpse of clever humor and, unlike many anime dignity. However, it is completely missing in the essential elements of a valuable story. From the outset, his assumption is that it is stereotypical. The main story focuses on collecting pieces of a broken jewel before they can be obsessed with evil, and it is, as one might assume, an entirely epic fantasy. The story follows a well-known pattern of fighting against various enemies for pieces of jewelry, and is so quite predictable, lacks complexity, and easy to lose interest. But as many animes have shown, the wrong assumption can be saved deep, realistic characters. Unfortunately nobody will save the story of Inuyasha. Kagome, the main character, is a stereotypical anime heroine (and too reminiscent of Akane, the main character of the original comic book work Ranma 1/2); he is kind to other women, but treats many men, especially love, with unjust, blatant, unjustifiable brutality. Inuyasha is a hard-on-the-out-but-sweet-on-the-inside type, and Miroku's lamentable character shares "pervert". Defects continue with what happens to this conspiracy and these characters - nothing. Despite constant activity, the story does not continue. Despite regular romantic moments, no major relationship. Despite enough time, the characters never change. And adding cherries to cup of mediocrity, all this stagnation is stretched to about 150 episodes. <br /> <br /> My latest critique of this anime is animation. Although it is certainly not ugly, the creators show almost disrespectful laziness. The animators seem to enjoy the long Inuyasha scenes leaping through the air, whistling in the wind, in which they have little to do but move in the background. In short, with all the beautiful world animations in the world on finger fingers, there is absolutely no reason to watch Inuyashu.
