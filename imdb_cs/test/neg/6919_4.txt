Begin with the assumption that you will do anything to replace your lost love with a similar look. Throwing your scientific knowledge about a deforming disease (it's not the thing that Leo G. Carroll made of the spider poison in "Tarantula"). Throw in that the main character, instead of finding a way to attract a young woman, is engaged in a cumbersome pursuit until he sees himself on himself and comes across this crazy plot. , then help him to marry him. The problem is that most events are random and unpredictable. Anyone with half the brain would see things. There's a third party, a woman the doctor, played by J. Carroll Naish, treated with great numbness. You know this will be a factor. There is also a gorilla, which is kept in a cage and which is sometimes used to make the sky know what. Oh, good. It's such a little sense for whoever plays alone, and people just get their desserts.
