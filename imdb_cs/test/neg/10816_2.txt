"The Cave" went more or less concurrently with the English film "Descent" by director Neil Marshall. Both films have a similar assumption; only the "cave" is terribly unoriginal, insensitive and incompetent compared to the wonderful horror adventure that is "Descent". It's like Neil Marshall realized that the basic story was too poor and instantly added thoughtful ideas, depth and personalized style, while director "The Cave" Bruce Hunt simply went to the most basic script processing that was fired on the table. . The result is an incredibly average movie that features every single horrible cliché you can think of and where most of the violence takes place off-screen. And we all hate it, don't we? The story is a crank of unbearable cave divers trapped in a totally undiscovered Romanian underground ecosystem. The hidden winged creature, which also became a parasite, will soon attack them and the leak seems impossible because of the landslide. The first half hour is still a little fun if you look at all the clichés and listen to the mushy textbooks of the textbooks, but the whole thing is too terrible. Neither of these events is even slightly credible, and the entire cast seems to compete with each other to provide WORST performance. I've seen better special effects in anonymous B-movies, shooting sites aren't used to the best and ultimate downright! NOT RECOMMENDED!
