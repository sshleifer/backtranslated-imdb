This film was so terrible that I couldn't describe it. I was amazed to be sitting over this pile of rubbish. I couldn't believe such a movie was even considered a movie. It was about a serial killer acting like a chicken. He doesn't look a couple of times, the whole movie won't touch. He even knocks his hands like a chicken, which is even more stupid than I've ever seen. I couldn't believe it came out in 1990. I thought it came out in the early 80's or something. Then the daughter is not very clever because she protected a geek or a male chicken. The end is getting worse and it's the worse end I've ever seen. This movie is just a chicken with ** t. I laughed more than I was afraid, and I strongly recommend going out and getting a bucket of fried chicken instead of seeing this movie.
