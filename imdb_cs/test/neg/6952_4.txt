Not every lesbian and vampire movie that touches our favorite genre / genre is nice. Unfortunately, this film hides originality and performance does not meet garbage standards. The creator's intention to make this cult seem to have failed. Basket baskets are movies because it's happening. You can't create this intention of this kind of movies. Even lesbian scenes are pathetic so no x-ploitation fans will be happy because there are thousands of movies better than barely legal lesbian vampires.
