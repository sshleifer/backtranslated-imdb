Well, it's a movie for kids, and it's not one of those movies that adults would enjoy as well. However, there are some unintentionally humorous moments, most of them involving holes in the story. For example, a child needs a computer part to return his father to normal and has no money. Does he ask his father for dough? No, it's ITAL and gets caught. Kids, if I ever get invisible, I'll take care of your post, ok? Even if this child is in the police station (no doubt he will be accused of criminally deteriorating behavior), his beautiful blond teacher will come, announce who he is and where he works, then BUSTS CHILDREN FROM SLAM BEFORE HEAD POLICAJTI! To make matters worse, instead of a quick escape, SIT IN THE PARKING BOAT POLICE STATIONS AND DECIDE THEIR ACHIEVEMENT. You know, I hate it, but DID kid stole something and should face the consequences, but maybe there's enough punishment in this movie. You will avoid it!
