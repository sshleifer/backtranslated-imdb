As you may not know, EÃ§a de Queiroz is one of the most legally celebrated writers of Portugal. He was humorous, spared no one in criticism, and now he must swing in the tomb. And that's not because this movie is bad, which is, but as a result of the treatment being released on one of his masterpieces "O Crime in Padre Amaro". It's processed like cheap garbage. When it was reported that it is a "modern and urban" book that I feared the worst, usually modern, in these contexts means taking the freedom to p **** when you are adapting to half ass it the weakest possible way. And so the moral and social dilemma of a priest who has a secret, forbidden matter is replaced by long passages of people dealing with drugs and singing hip-hop without a particular or relevant reason to conspire. It's just there, as if it couldn't be very well. Oh and there is plenty of sex so you can at least count that when you put it on. Remember how every movie in the 80s, regardless of genre or tone, always found a way to sneak into some nudity? If it was a thriller and they didn't need it, they just found the way that when they captured the criminals, "it happened" that he was in bed with a woman screaming around him (naked of course) when the cops went off with Ahem the word I think. Not that it is something bad with the nude scenes, but here the creators of this film are doing so desperately just because there is nothing else on the film, it's completely free of what you call dramatic content.
