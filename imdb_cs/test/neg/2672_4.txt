I'm not quite sure what to say / think about this movie. It's definitely not the worst in the series (there is still Halloween 3). The style is very different and focuses on elements other than its predecessor. He is trying to explain why Michael Myers is spreading on Halloween and is beginning to feed. Everything that was cursed about Michael Myers and the evil cult was a nice effort, but I didn't buy it. None of the other installments in the series tried to come up with some fantastic explanations. <br /> <br /> The movie contains a lot of gore. Actually, it's a simple massacre. If you haven't seen more Halloween movies, you'll probably like this for his blood content. But for real Halloween, this may be too different to be considered good. Tension has turned into horror and bloodshed (exploding heads ... you get a point). The end (theater cut) is just awful. Michael gets stabbed with a needle, then beaten with a tube, then stabbed again, this time with more needles, then beat a little more until his mucus disappeared from his head (where it actually came from this green thing?). Basically, it's nothing but $ 5 million worth of baskets. Although it was one good thing: Michael's mask! Dedicated to Donald Pleasance, quite a shame. <br /> <br /> My rating: 4/10
