I watched the movie when I was a kid, and I thought it was awful. Now that I'm older, I've found it just as bad. Universal could do better. They decided to make as much money as they could to use all their monsters at once. For me it was a cheap shot. These characters were able to hold their own movies and the selection of actors was pathetic. Dracula needed to be Bela Lugosi, Frankenstein, the monster needed to be Karloff. In my mind it was the Disney's posthumous sequel that was made decades ago, and it wasn't appreciated. Umiversal started with something big and original, and then he thought they could hide from the masses with Schlock, which is extremely evident in this film.
