It seems that all the companies enjoying the Romanian tax picture are giving away a picture that has disappeared since 1994. They are barely trying to get the oldest car they have built, but they never take Lamorghini, Ferrari, Aston Martin and all the new Mercedes found in some important countries. The second problem is that they were filmed in some neighborhoods in Bucharest, where they had the opportunity to clean up the streets and put garbage to dress up people I don't know maybe '90 clothes and make them seem so stupid you realize the script He was possibly second hand bought from eBay or worth it. I'm in the future to continue making movies in the US and earning good money there than to help us a little and shame our country. I have no reason to believe that someone will understand the message (except my English ---: sorry)
