If a movie ever made an Italian look bad, that's it. Duke Mitchell - What A - HOLE. Duke Mitchell, I'm on your grave. When we see practically every man cowardly Mimi shot in this film, he is either black or some other racial or ethnic minority, it is hard to see that the guy owes his loyalty to the Ku Klux Klan or skinheads. Awww, but he doesn't shoot a little black guy in the elevator in the opening sequence, so it means he can't be bad, right? POORLY. Typical softeaded sentimental impudence. While I understand why some people might be hit and even to some extent admire the daring, totally un-PC movie thrill (it's certainly not ashamed of their own hatred and self-fulfillment), but that won't change reality that the main character, Mimi (and Duke Mitchell), is a thoroughly repulsive human being who does not earn one iota of empathy or interest, especially since Duke Mitchell is such a COMPLETE BORE as a performer. But what do you expect from a guy whose main claim to fame (besides this dog t - d movie) was the second Dean Martin impersonator?
