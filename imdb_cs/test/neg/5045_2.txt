Do you know that mouthwash, where does this guy have a mouth full of Listerine or what is it and he's trying really hard to stick to spitting it into the sink? This is a great metaphor for this movie. I watched, though it was really hard. But keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave a fresh, fresh feeling. This film left a bad taste in my mouth. I should have spit when I had a chance. The assumption is high enough to be fun. For the first time in a thousand years, the Gargoyles have returned to Romania, and all the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things have long been dead. It depends on Michael Pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles start running. Unfortunately, this assumption is completely lost in the wrong dialogue and less than enthusiastic by the actions of human leaders. The best acting performance is CG Gargoyles. Finally, this film feels like Van Helsing from a poor man. If you checked your brain at the door, it might happen on a gloomy Monday night. I gave it 3 out of 10 stars.
