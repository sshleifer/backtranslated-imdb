Well, if the discount on production value, ugly clothes and big hair, this adaptation is still much lower than the 90s version. The first Ann Firbank (playing Anne Elliot) is literally ten years old to play this role, and her acting performances leave much to be desired. Amanda Root (playing the same role in the 1990s) can express more in her big, brown eyes than Firbank can with her face for four hours of production. Anne turned into a peevish, whining, boring character (and what was with the scene during a `long walk 'where she stops to spew poetry?). Henrietta and Louisa looked so similar that the only time I could tell them was when they stood side by side (Henrietta was taller). And Louisa! There was never another unpleasant character! It was ridiculous to think that Wentworth should be interested in her. It is believed to be very lively and pretty and charming, not stupid and stupid with a ridiculous laugh that is like nails on a blackboard. When she starts singing, "Lyme, Lyme, Lyme," I started to scream, "Shut up, shut up, shut up!" The best part of the film was when Louisa fell on three feet on the carpet because I knew I wouldn't have to see her in the movie anymore. Speaking of falling on the pavilion; it was the badly played, badly directed and edited scene of the movie. How does one drop three meters down, land on your feet and still be unconscious? On the plus size, Elizabeth's figure was much closer to the book than the 1990s. At the end, they also had many other scenes with Anna and Frederick. I admit that I bought this movie, even though I knew how it was, but I'm a huge Austen Fan, so I'll buy a movie adapted to one of her novels. Follow this step if you are morbidly curious or appreciate the 90's version even more. The bottom line is that this version may follow the letter of the novel, but the 1990s version follows the spirit.
