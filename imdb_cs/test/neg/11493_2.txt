This is a perfect example of how a great book turns into a poor film. The direction only gives the impression that the film was made when they went together and Patrick Swaze is so wooden that you see almost puppet strings on his body. Spy Vs Spy movies aren't - nor should they - be car chases and shootings, bad guys in these movies are really bad shots and lack the main characters, even in empty space. Even action shots are just a clich√© with the usual fitting of sidewalks and falling over tables and chairs - yawn. <br /> <br /> I got half and turned off - completely bored.
