Not me. If it went down, I could kick a dog in the ass, so this movie doesn't work for me. If it was me against Alien or Jason ... Or .. Shit, I don't know .. ANY OTHER HORROR FILM ANTAGONIST, then there would be no competition and I would have my ass hand over to me divine intervention. The horror movie works because it puts people in a situation with creature, person, being, entity, anything that is stronger or more inventive or intelligent than they do, and then people think "what if it happened to me" and they are afraid - and that's why it's a terrible story idea. I can't imagine a dog terrorizing me, so I'm not afraid.
