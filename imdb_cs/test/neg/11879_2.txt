What can I say? Such a great Prestige-Production - but at the end? Lost time, waste of money. This work is a disaster historically seen. Only some examples: * Augustus is often called 'Gaius' - his first name (Pronomen). But the ancient Romans do not use this name. The right would be the surname (Nomen Gentile and Cognomen) or 'Octavian', 'Caesar', 'Augustus'. Livia was shown as a tyrannical wife. But this historically bad. Iulia was shown as a pretty young woman - but she wasn't one. Adultery and (maybe?) Prostitution and arrogant behavior were the cause of her expulsion. She wasn't on her Father's dying bed. She never let her leave her. And she was about 50 years old at that time! Not as young as her. In the same year, Augustus died of committing suicide because Tiberius had stopped giving her a pension. Augustus was much more helpless than in this movie. However, the author and director seem to believe August's own Res Gestae. <br /> <br /> What's left? Historically very doubtful, wrong, wrong building and equipment - 2 points out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole.
