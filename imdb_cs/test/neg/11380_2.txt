First, I personally adore demons and demons 2, I saw them, though it was hard to find good horrors without a good official movie that would be here in Russia when I was distributing, and that is a constant part of my childhood. Then I didn't hear anything about Mr. Bav. Then I saw his Son Spirit. Well, it's definitely not a good return! Why was the lead character we never knew, at least like him, in an accident in the middle of an empty road? Why do African servants say so stupid and stupid things about the human soul? Why is the story so primitive? Have we not seen enough ghosts for 100 years of film production? It is clear that Lamberto Bava has nothing to show us yet. It's a shame.
