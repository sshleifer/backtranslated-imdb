Diane Keaton is a pathetic actress. He's so boring and fake. It's the same on screen and beyond. I saw her in an interview with Ellen Degeneres and behaves exactly the same as in the movies. Her foolish facial expressions make me change channels. She was in some good movies, but it would be better if she chose someone else for the part. Steve Martin doesn't add much to the movie. He also works and also destroys the old favorite. The sensual part of Martin Short games in the movie add only other idiots. I tried to watch the movie twice, but both times had to turn it off.
