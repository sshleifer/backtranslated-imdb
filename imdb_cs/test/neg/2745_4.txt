-SPOILERS ------------ I'm a fan of French cinema in the 1960s and 1970s, but not necessarily more modern, so to be honest, I watched it for Bellucci. Beautiful and on top of this supposedly this movie is where they met Cassel, so it gives some extra importance. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a very nice style reminiscent of DePalma.Then suddenly we threw on the flashback, and back and forth goes on, which gets tiring. By the way, the film is still interesting to me until the moment when the first and a certain hole on the plot that allows the rest of the story, will never allow me to enjoy the rest. is the story of a man who is literally looking for an old flame. This is the main storyline. Bellucci-Cassel is a couple, then Bellucci urgently has to go to work in Italy (not the farthest place on Earth from Paris) and leave a message that explains that he won't do it. Not like this, these people don't have phones? She was probably gone for 2 months (not exactly a century) and wouldn't invite her friend in Paris to see how she did it? Of course not. Even after he returns, he forgets everything about him. And that's fine, but later in the movie he tells his friend that it was her greatest love and was ready to commit for the first time in her life. he failed to call for 2 months and then never tried to come back with him. And what about Casselin's character? He was probably unable to find her in Italy, really hard to find someone in Italy, probably as Siberia, especially an actress who is probably also featured in the art newspaper. And after 2 months of being back, it's hard to find and ask for an explanation. You think she wanted to avoid him, but no, we found out that they just couldn't meet. OK, I don't need to go any further because that's the incident where the whole movie is based. Worse, Bellucci is not really the star of this movie, but the other girl, Bohringer, is.
