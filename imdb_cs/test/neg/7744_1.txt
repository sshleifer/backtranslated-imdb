Kathy Ireland: the body of the goddess, the face of the angel, the voice of Smolka. And the talent of a bucket full of calcite. If you don't believe me, look at this: "Alien from L.A." in fact, it depends on her to act for the entire 9/10 movie! Sure, she ends up in a nice red bikini top and wrap-around her skirt near the end, but it's too little (so talk too late). Ireland seems to play a daughter of a reputable scientist who falls into the middle of the country to find him. On the way, she falls on a guy named Charmin (yes, just like toilet paper - make your own jokes) and find out how "mad Max" refuses to live. Did you know that people who live deep in the country have Australian accents? Me neither. It's bad (after all it was MST'd) and also Golan-Globus production, but after all it is said that Ireland is basically lost, just like trying to find where photographers are , so he can take a photo shoot instead. And I don't blame her. <br /> <br /> One star. And if you insist that you watch it, turn off the sound - save your eardrums.
