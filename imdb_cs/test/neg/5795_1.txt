Over the past few years, Ron Miller (Walt Disney's son-in-law of the Producer) has ruled that he was throwing a lively action bullshit that often played with the very boring Dean Jones, whose whole career was based on this kind of light, empty-headed fare. Other horrible movies of the same time include Pete's Dragon, Noah's Last Flight, Unknown Oddball Flying, and the dreaded Condorman. I won't mention Tron because I thought it was ambitious and Miller was just an executive producer, so he wasn't dealing with real production. But he was in full force when this terrible piece of human waste was expelled from the bowels of creativity. Herbie goes to Monte Carlo. The second sequel to the very popular Love Bug story finds Herbie in love with another car that also has a brain and heart. There's a race, some bad guys, a diamond and Barney Fife. The film shot in France is really nicely photographed and the landscape is beautiful. But one gets the idea that the film was made, so everyone involved could have three months' holiday in France. The rest of the movie is a wreck. Prat falls, shattered thieves, evil Germans racing competitors and pretty bouncy feminists all fall into the category of stock supplies. The Greatest Insult to the Film: The pursuit of further development of Herbie's lover by shaking, beeping, flashing lights and movements, suggesting horny seventeen-year-old Disney writers, will make injustice to our cute little VW. Then I would again think it would be hard for anyone to have Helena Hayes drive Herbie around the skyscraper in the second trip.
