The creators are asking for a huge suspension of mistrust, giving them a chance to convince them that this is possible. Unfortunately, TV movies seem to be specifically released on cheap Cosmo questionnaire films. With a small budget and great demands, you should spend every penny on details to convince the audience. Not here. The film gets a few points for a good performance that two ladies give a chance, but unfortunately it's not enough to save the day. o, and the less they said about the end, the better. Happy movie-viewing everyone!
