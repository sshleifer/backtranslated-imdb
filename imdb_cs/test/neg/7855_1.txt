I came across this film by chance and I wish I didn't. Why make a sexual coarse sequel (and some gore when a man is beheaded) a well-known children's film. Don't take small children to see that this name is wrong for you, it has nothing to do with the original snow world, except for the theft of its characters. Even better not to bother to go alone, it's not worth it. I couldn't look at it all, the poor (compared to Disney) drawn graphics, and without a plot, besides how to completely spoil the classic movie made me give up and leave.
