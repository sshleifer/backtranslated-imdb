This morning I unexpectedly remembered that this film exists. It seemed to me that I was thinking, "Yeah, there was Mr. Magoo's movie, wasn't it?" This is much more surprising because I recall that after discussing this film (an advocacy group for the visually impaired said this film was humiliating). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened because I'm a fan of both Mr. Magoo and Mr. Nielson, and I thought it would be a great choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the initial animated credits because I thought they were pretty fun. After all, it's all empty. I think it's a pretty sad statement about every movie that it's so lame, so bland, and so absolutely without merit that you can't remember any of it. I understand that Leslie Nielson is not always known to appear in first-class comedies, but I saw him in "Spy Hard", "Scary Movie 4" and "Police Squad 3", and none of them were great at least the memory of something *. However, Mr. Magoo is complete empty. I'm wondering how now I'm wondering if all the film controversies were actually created in the studio that produced it, in the hope of generating at least some little interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.
