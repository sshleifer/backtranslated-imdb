The two redeeming qualities of this film were cinematography and a story that was hard to resist. However, script, direction and some scenes were just terrible. I asked myself why such a good cast would create such a bad movie. My only conclusion was that these actors must believe in the charity that underlies the film, but knew that the film was filled with flaws. This movie could have been much better and reached a bigger audience. What I can think of is that with all the problems of the film, with some scenes that are painfully bad to follow, I still wanted to see how the apparent conclusion would be solved.
