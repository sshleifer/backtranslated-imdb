... If you laughed too long and need a rest. <br /> <br /> After reading about 25 unfavorable reviews of this show, I decided to turn it on and check it out. for me. Everything that each of these people said about the show is absolutely true. Mencia's mind is like a half-hour version of Mad TV, but with some worse jokes. One parody I had was dissatisfaction with the observation, it was "the second annual Olympics of Stereotypes". What's funny about a black man who has a hard time swimming, or a gay man named "Sparkles" who wins a banana competition? Neither of these terms is particularly innovative, insightful or entertaining. Do we really need a joke about Star Wars every episode? The movie came out like 30 years ago. Mencia's solution for funny things up is to throw in some stereotypes about Hispanics and throw a few "beaners" there; and call it a day to come home to roll in a pile of money. A pure comedic genius. Then, at the second show I watched, he ripped Jeff Foxworthy ruthlessly, with a piece of "Your gay if ...". You could imagine a roaring laugh as he stabbed Ryan-Seacrest-is-gay. It's not that any of those who have already been killed have already been done. <br /> <br /> If you're not a big fan of Jason Friedberg and Adam Seltzer's movies, please stay away from this show. Especially when there are authentic comedians like Dave Chappelle who can joke about races and racism and are still bright.
