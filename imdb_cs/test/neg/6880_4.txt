I wouldn't really say a good movie, in fact it could even be bad. But there are at least 2 good reasons to watch this movie, these are the performances of AGNES BRUCKNER (Eden) and JONATHAN JACKSON (Eric), who both act as solid performers. They are much better than others who are pretty bad, especially MEAGAN GOODE (Cousin Skeeter). BIJOU PHILIPS was excellent in "Suburban kids go to the hood" -drama HAVOC, but here it is far from good on the edge to be uncomfortable. The story is pretty decent, though nothing special, but it would be much better because it takes place in LOUSIANNA that each of the children actually included an accent in the south but not (!). Especially in a movie where a "monster" is actually delineated so deep into Lousianna folk-lore, with voodoo, so it's just plain stupid not to include that accent. The only w it does rapper METHOD MAN, plays Deputy Turner and in some of his scenes puts off a pretty good accent and I think if the rapper can do it, why shouldn't "professional" actors do the same? Mister Tical aka Meth is very nice in his very small role, who knows that Ticallion Stallion would ever be a cop? Although only on the big screen. By the way, it is quite a stupid but rather pleasant movie Slasher, but if BRUCKNER and JACKSON were as bad as the rest of the young cast, it could have been really bad, fortunately they are good as usual. 4.5 out of 10, decent BUT there are hundreds of better slasher-films out there.
