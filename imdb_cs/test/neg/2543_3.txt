Due to a somewhat dubious tectonic plate, Japan begins to slide under the sea. Initial predictions say that it will take about 40 years for a country to sink, but a dishonest scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines that it will actually take less than 1 year! The government thinks it is a crackpot, but the evidence soon begins to carry its theory out. This big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of Hollywood films from the late 1990s (I suppose he saw none of them), with the extent of the catastrophe and tragedy that bring the nobility of human (well, Japanese) the spirit into acts of heroism and sacrifice and prove the power of love or something like that. ie it is so naive in its psychology as geology ... we all know that half of the population would be raped and looted the moment they thought the police had turned, and the other half would be panic and useless. /> <br /> The movie has some very nice special effects, but it's not as smooth or expensive as equivalent Hollywood production. This is at least as nationalistic, without humor and lacking in the realization that the Hollywood movie would be, and probably worse. It has a hot evil chick out of the Battle Royale as one of the leaders ... but she's not even mildly bad and hence much less hot. The film is too long for 132 minutes, and worse and worse as it progresses towards the conclusion that threatened me. Surely I didn't care at all whether Japan sank in the middle of the road or not, and before the end I tried to think about ways to speed up this process if I found myself in this situation. But it has nice special effects, and Kou Shibasaki is still hot enough to give him a generous ... 3/10.
