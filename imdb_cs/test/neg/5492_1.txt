I don't mind the strange art film. But when they are bothered by mysterious symbolism and dark dialogue, and when it is clear that they did it for the filmmaker's ego rather than the viewer, it makes me angry. I'm not a stupid man, but I just didn't understand what the movie was trying to say. Or yes. The film is a wonderful form of human communication. Why do some filmmakers use it for confusion instead?
