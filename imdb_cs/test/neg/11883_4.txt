This is the voice of the person who has just finished watching Rome's second season, almost in one step, and grabbed the opportunity to see "what happened next" - this movie starts conveniently where Rome ends. If you find that Rome is an abomination, a bad throat that has little historical accuracy, then you can enjoy Imperium: Augustus. But if you feel that Rome is a good thing if you enjoy intricate intrigues, decadence and actor work, then the Imperium seems to be too shy, useless, and tedious soap opera that doesn't have many redeemers. factors. There are some actors who for my taste look a little better than those in Rome. I didn't particularly like the fact that Rome's image of Cleopatra was drug addict. The woman had to be very strong and dignified, and the actress in Imperium was much better off. O'Toole and Rampling are good, so some others. But then ... If you learned - and love - Atia as a super cool bitch, you will find that her imaging in the Imperium - like a tear-tearing mother of goose in an apron - is absolutely ridiculous. There are supposed to be some biting characters in Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily on looking at men and nothing more. You won't find any interesting female characters in this epic. There are also painfully comical Maecenas that we see as a screaming queen, though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he is once referred to as "being effeminated in his pleasures" in the annals). The interiors are rather poor and rely on clichés for clichés. The Great Hall of Cleopatra looks like something from a computer game or a children's playroom in an Egyptian theme park. There are looooooooot really bad 3D graphics, not until 2003 standards. The action is presented as a series of flashbacks in Augustus's age again. So we quickly look at some historical events, some of which are well presented while some are not. An excessive amount of time is unnecessary for Livia to turn out to be the "eternal flame" of Augustus. This matter does not look like a moment, the dialogue is superlame and everything is flavored with a sticky musical score that raises tears. Whatever the size of the reality he wants to capture, every last piece of it is destroyed by dry synchronized dubbing (most actors are not English speaking). <br /> <br /> Everything is lukewarm in this epic. It is true that there is more historical accuracy than in Rome, but in dramatic terms it is boring. The characters lack the depth and sharpness of the dialogue. Working with the camera is often reduced to static footage, and lighting does not offer anything to please you. There is really no one in Imperio who likes and hates anyone. No matter whether you like Rome or not, there are much better movies and miniseries. Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of the Empire would be one thing I recommend.
