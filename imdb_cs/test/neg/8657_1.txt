Yash Raj movies are so funny, no matter what they do, but are they called the best production house? Looking at Bhatt's movies working copied formulas, bikinis and everything plus casting low actors like Uday and Tanishaa <br /> The movie is so terrible that it tears you down. jokes are so bad and horny that you slap them Uday reminds gay plus monkey Tanishaa resembles an idiot <br /> <br /> The director thinks we're all idiots Arjun Sablok goes for granted to viewers Music saves grace Camera works fine <br /> <br /> Uday Chopra ham as an idiot, Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying then Tanishaa is worse the rest to be fine
