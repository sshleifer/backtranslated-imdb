Although it was Hunter S. Thompson's first documentary, I saw that it was average at best, even though it was a huge stellar performance like Johnny Depp, Bill Murray, Gary Busey and several others. I left this and yet it was a little interesting. What I was watching was some old clips from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Where is Buffalo Roam. Not so well, mainly because of the old guys roaming and the things every fan would know. I still think they milked it because it could have been compressed by at least half. Even if a fan likes anything that has to do with a hunter. best regards
