While traveling with a team that is missing for Miss Galaxy's dispute, the plane piloted by Maximus Powers (Eric Roberts) and Mike Saunders (Charlie Schlatter) crashes in an isolated place where Noah's Jurassic-protected Ark lies. While the group struggles to survive, extraterrestrial apes use the fence to destroy the human race and control the planet Earth. I like parody, but "Miss Castaway" is an insult to human brains. The terrible story and special effects are very, but really very bad. There are spoofs with "Lost", "Castaway", "Jurassic Park", "Sixth Sense", "Titanic", "Planet of the Apes", "Raiders of the Lost Ark", "Congo", "MIB", "\ t "" Austin Powers "," Jaws "," Mission Impossible "," Close Encounters of the Third Kind "," Star Wars "and" Hulk ", but the problem is that most of them are very stupid and not funny. better than movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Missão Quase Impossível"
