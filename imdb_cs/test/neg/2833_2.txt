That wasn't a good movie. Poorly written and acted - the concept was not new, the effects were poor and not an example for Arnold Voslo, who is a really polite actor. I watched it under some protest and I remembered seeing it at the very end - it's forgotten. Acting seemed to consist of a number of perspectives, and it looks without any sincerity. I expected this to really happen and I hoped it would end. As far as medical stuff is concerned - I didn't expect a real version of ER events, but it was just comic - I'm a doctor, so I know what's going on - and operative pieces were just stupid. Don't waste your precious time - if you have nothing else to do - go out, pick up a long lost friend, watch dry paints, sort your socks, do some homework. Avoid danger.
