WARNING!! This review can contain spoilers. The back of the box is misleading. He says all the bullshit about kids who tell the ghost stories they do, but then it means they're going to be killed by a killer in the woods. It will not happen. The stories they tell are a little interesting, namely the one with the dog and everything that is licked, but most of them are somewhat boring, monsters in the woods, some dumb girl and the main, the whole movie.
