I have to say that when I saw this movie at 6.5 on this site, I thought it was worth it. I was very disappointed. From the almost introductory scene, it is clear that two alleged FBI agents are in fact murderers. Could they make it more obvious? If it's an intended "twist" in this movie, it's pretty sad. While Pullman and Ormond are excellent actors, their talent is not responsible for the incredibly bad scenario. Pullman behaves adeptically as part of a sociopathic killer ... and that's a problem. There is no switch from "I play FBI guy!" "I just killed 12 people and boys, my hands are tired." You can't blame the actor ... the story fails much more than one. However, since the beginning of the movie, I was sure that I was wrong that no director / writer would ever be so blatantly obvious about the "twist" plot. Ormond and Pullman must act strangely to distract the viewer from the real killers, I thought ... which gave the filmmakers too much credit. I should have followed my instincts and turned off the film before it made a 15-minute mark. Lynch's credit has overcome many things that make up a good movie: sex, violence, humor and well-trained actors. Too bad they were in a bad configuration. Hopefully Pell James can recover from this role ... I find her performance is particularly impressive because the overwhelming drug addict has turned into a Savior. She should rewrite the role so that "crack bitch" win. Those people who likened this film to Natural Born Killers will note: Tarantino has made the characters Mickey and Mallory offensive, yet sympathetic. The art work of this film far surpasses gore, and it's not visible in Surveillance. Surveillance just wants it to be naturally born killers ... in fact, it has wet dreams of even being a fraction of what the movie was. People who haven't seen Surveillance ... stick to something with a little intelligence. Like Camp Rock.
