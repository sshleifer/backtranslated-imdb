What could Irene Dunne mean by adopting a role in this disgusting report on a woman tradable morality? Irene Dunne of the 1940s, whose reputation as a loyal Roman Catholic who publicly reproached smut, and avoided all film scenarios or Hollywood society that could even be remotely perceived as corrupt public morals, would never associate with such a dubious a project like this. Perhaps Cardinal Spellman in New York, in his private audience with her, has dressed this role well? The fact that we will probably never know about this because she never spoke about it in later years, although she condemned her morally suspicious (though quite successful) 1932 movie, "Back Street" as "Waste". At the time when in 1965 it received the outstanding St. Wenceslas Award. The Robert Bellarmine Award for exemplary public Catholicism, "Ann Vickers" has not spoken to the public. Suffice it to say that "Ann Vickers" does not work either as a fun or social commentary. <br /> <br /> The role of Miss Dunne as an adulterous social worker who sleeps around (between reforming prisons) and writing the best remedial reseller) is not consistent with her temperament or on-screen performance, and one still suspects that the whole thing is a kind of tongue in the face, (what else can we think of when we witness Miss Dunne's sympathetic blissful look , who is covered by a female prisoner shot?) At the end of the films she gave up her careerism in favor of marriage, (no less to crunching Walter Huston - and what kind of madness would he ever imagine pairing these two romantically?) <br /> <br / Irene Dunne will undoubtedly want to see this curiosity, if only for the opportunity to hear her promise to reha under her accusation. cocaine junkies: "I'll get you out of the snow-cold Turkey!" Well, if nothing like the worst things is her light years from her usual opera helicopter, hairy chiffon and strawberry phosphates - cocaine addiction is not the first person to associate with irreparable Miss Dunne.
