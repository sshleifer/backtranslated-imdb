This movie is a waste of time. Although he has actors who have the potential to do something decent, he is in a sub-par film and has a clich√©. "You never know what will happen tomorrow, so live your life to the full and do what makes you happy." This sentence will save you from wasting hours of your life on this movie. People who like this movie are the same people who would enjoy two hours to find out that the whole movie is a dream sequence. If the most important part of the film doesn't happen, at least it's nice to watch and subdue. This is why this project did not make theatrical releases, and although movie films may prove very good, this will not come close.
