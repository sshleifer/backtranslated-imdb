Some aspects of this production are good, for example Angela Lansbury, George Hearn, Cris Groenendaal and Sal Mistretta. But I'm the only one distracted by the terrible performance of Betsy Joslyn as Johanna? It's terrible! She kills songs with her creaking voice and overacts in a role she clearly doesn't understand. I also think the choir is not except for snuff. They pull the pace and make the worst facial expressions. Overall, I think this production is fine, but Sweeney Todd can be a lot more if done right. This production is close to the level that this material requires. The concert version with George Hearn and Patti LuPone is much better.
