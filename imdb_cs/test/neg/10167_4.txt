It's been a long time since I've seen my boring thriller with my wife. It's definitely NOT a breathtaking story and it's a pace so slow we're almost asleep. This could be the site of a very low budget television crime series. There are some ridiculous scenes like the one where Mafia boss Pirano wants to see a lady jury in red clothes or other mafioso can't stop thinking about her and so on. Well, maybe it was supposed to be a romantic thriller, but believe me, there's nothing really missing. We gave 4/10.
