Maybe the worst movie in the genre in existence. It was announced as a comedy, but it is simply tragic pathetic. I don't think anyone could achieve anything more terrifying and irritating if they were specifically asked to do so. It is toilet humor in the poorest, I would also avoid watching a trailer. I just went to look because it was announced that if you like Monty Python, you have to love it. The one who wrote it was either distorted or seriously upset. I am still confused about how to be honest with such a statement. I rarely leave the cinema, it really takes a lot of effort to make the film look like this: just 30 minutes ago.
