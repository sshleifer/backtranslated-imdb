I will never return to the three hours of life this movie has stolen from me. The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process. I would like to know what is happening when this film is made. It is also the historically most accurate film in existence; 2001 came and left without any event or prediction to take place. The characters are unlikely, the design is simplistic and everything just steps without any meaning or logic to it. And the end is probably the worst: his thought is supposed to be provocative, but the only thought that has entered my mind is "What is F $ * K?" <br /> <br /> I'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment, AVOID this movie at all costs and choose a sci-fi movie that ISN'T didn't catch its own @ $$.
