on this bleakness of mediocrity? You are so much better than this. Simply put, Frostbite is worthless. Bad playing (and I use this term freely), minimalist "plot", sophomoric humor, and indistinct snowboarding. Nor is there a sufficient representation of female pulchritus that would cause a seductive interest in socially inept, but red-blooded, males. <br /> <br /> Top Gun had spectacular flight sequences to look at. Thunder's days had heart beats. Even Point Break had his jump scenarios in his credit. Frostbite has none of this. It is not worth your time, time, time Traci Lords, Carmen Nicole time, or the time when someone from this destruction of celluloid, which would be perfectly applicable to something that would pay off if it was not unnecessary on This feed for the recycling center, tossed. The world will be better to forget that Frostbite existed at all.
