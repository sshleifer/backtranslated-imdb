This is really, without exaggeration, one of the worst films ever made by Slasher. I know it came out in the 80s after the tendency that started "Friday, 13th". "The Prey" copies the above film in many aspects. Setting forests, killer, silly teens, gore, etc. <br /> <br /> But "The Loot" is as bad as you'd expect. I didn't even remember if it wasn't for coincidence. Well, the killer is actually human, so don't expect a supernatural killer on Jason's orders. Situation somewhat boring and lack of tension, gore, violence, etc. It just doesn't work for flick slasher. Acting is just awful. The score is terrible! a combination of boring tools with cheesy 80 melodies?! I will not even mention the technical aspects of the film, because I believe that it cost only $ 20. <br /> <br /> Avoid this, like the plague. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that's something I would say. Thank God, he seems to have disappeared from the ground.
