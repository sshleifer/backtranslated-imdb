Made in a false documentary style, subversion from the late 1960s and alleged critics of the mainstream government are arrested and have a choice. After conviction for their misconduct, there is a chance to go to prison for 7 years to live or spend three days and two nights in the California desert in Punishment Park. In the 100 degree heat, prisoners have to go fifty some extra miles on the American flag for freedom. The US and state law enforcement will follow two hours of the latter. If dissidents are captured, it means prison. They appear in this pseudo-documentary: Carmen Argenziano, Katherine Quittner, Mary Ellen Kleinhall, Stan Armsted, Scott Turner, Patrick Boland and Kent Foreman.
