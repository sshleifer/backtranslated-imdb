Unlike some reviews written here, I hated this movie. It's a movie that could have been much better than it was. No Oscar material, true but much better than it was. <br /> <br /> I thought the land had a good hook and over the line. It is true that this film was misspelled. AND TERRIBLY MANAGED AND MANUFACTURED. How many irrelevant flashbacks can you have? Why were we there? What Exactly Is The Point Of The Starting Sequence? It looks like the producer (s) watched American Beauty several times and thought I'd use it in an action movie! I thought the movie wasn't that bad. Wesley Snipes did a credible job, just running out of the wrong direction. And when the film hits the production room, things got worse. I think the main actress had the same problems. Some of the other actors were suspicious, yes, but it was a low budget. Again, I would say that it is the director's task to pick it up and correct it. <br /> <br /> As a general recommendation, I would agree with the first assessment I read that this film is not worth seeing. Or maybe it is worth seeing if you are a film student and want to see what NOT to do. 3/10, and that gives praise.
