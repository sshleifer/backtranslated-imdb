Although this film has a slow, dream-like, almost enchanting pace, and an interesting, though perhaps not entirely accurate, description of crime investigation procedures in rural French government and personnel, it is ultimately impossible for me to recommend. I think this film is simply an installation work that moves one person - the director, one assumes - resistance with heterosexuality. Human sexuality in all its forms can have its rebellious moments without denying it! But choosing poorly uniformly at the expense of good, as this film does at every turn, suggests distorted sensitivity at work. In a nutshell, if you like watching homo-eroticism that is like compassion, and displaying heterosexual lovemaking and feminine forms in a nasty and humiliating light - then this movie is for you. No no.
