A rich business daughter who, as a young girl, caught a rheumatic fever and now suffers from a shortage of breath, finds that her marriage to the charming ne'er-do-well was arranged by her dad (whom she lovingly calls "Darling"); worse than that, she may in fact have only a few weeks left to life, leaving her husband free to marry her romantic rival boom. Clean bed. Paul Osborn's screenplay (through Jerome Weidman's thin story) pulls out extra flashes in the second half instead of continuing to conspire with the soap script into grim speech. Why go back when we can find out what's going on for us? It is a "woman's skin" without faith in your target audience, so simplistic is the setting. Dorothy McGuire, who in most of the picture is embroiled in furs, is not a coveted, clever hero; when she is angry, she turns inward and stony. When she realized that her marriage was basically a scam, she shrinks from her husband, like a virgin (well, that's the possibility, she and Van Johnson are sleeping in separate beds after all!). Ruth Roman has the best moments of the movie as a shark company with a trap set for Van, but what exactly do these women see in it? Johnson can be charming when necessary, but put it in a melodramatic environment and he also goes stony. MGM production values ​​just so-so, director Gottfried Reinhardt tries to add a visual flavor to flashback segues and tries to lively stimulate the opening half-hour of the film. ** of ****
