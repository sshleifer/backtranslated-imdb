I want to believe very much that the above quotation (specifically the English subtitle translation), which was actually written, did not speak, should be confident in the language in which the publisher sends it to the protagonist. -cheek way. But if so, director Leos Carax apparently forgot to inform the actor of the true nature of the film. They are all so serious in their illustrations that I have to conclude that Carax is taken seriously here, otherwise it has so much contempt for everyone, especially for viewers, that they can't bother to make jokes. Br /> <br /> Some authors may get rid of sloppy, bizarre movies because they do it with the Ã©lan and a unique personal style (eg David Lynch and Alejandro Jodorowsky). Others use a more subtle approach, while still weaving surrealist elements into the story structure (eg Krzysztof Kieslowski, and David Cronenberg's later, less bizarre work). In Pola X, Carax throws a discontinuous mess on the viewer and then dares him to find a mistake with him. Well, here it is: stimulation is erratic and choppy, especially continuity is often not required; superfluous characters are abundant (eg gypsy mother and child); most performances are overcrowded; lighting is often poor, especially on the sex scene discussed; unconnected scenes are pulled into the movie for no discernible reason; and the list goes on. <br /> <br /> To be completely negative, it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions. I liked the music score, even the cacophony-techno music played in the vast, abandoned complex, where the main characters return in the second half of the film (perhaps a reference to the "factory" of Andy Warhol's 60s?). Much of the landscape photography was a beautiful, obvious attempt to contrast with the dirty urban environment. Cathering Deneuve, even in middle age, shows she still has 'it'. Her performance was also one of the main characters who didn't dive into bathos. Previously, when I saw such films as "Pola X", it was much earlier. The experiment is admirable even if the experiment doesn't work. But Carax doesn't do anything here; The film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films, and after several decades of watching movies and literally thousands of movies later on, I simply do not have the patience for this kind of unoriginally crafted trio. At this early 21st century, one asks: With the exception of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, are there any directors in France who already know how to make a traceable movie? Rating: 3/10.
