To summarize this movie, it's LaBute carrying his sadism into a comedy farce. The predictable result is that he constantly encounters all the jokes by insisting he surrounds them with blood and cruel violence. There is also evidence of his continued effort to insult and mock everything in sight but then apologize for it with weak gestures to the PC. Basically, the film just doesn't work, its plot is out of the way, the characters are one-dimensional clich√©s, there's no consistency or the evolution of anything, and the comedy (where it's not completely out of place) is the worst kind of High Concept drivel. Morgan Freeman and Renee Zellweger are totally unnecessary on characters that seem like a parody of a studio-driven pandering audience - no matter how nice, neutral (and neutered), and full of moral phrases . Crispin Glover is only here long enough to convince you that he no longer belongs to the movies. In fact, Chris Rock has negative chemistry with fellow hitman Freeman - it's as if they were in different rooms, even if they're two inches apart. In fact, Chris Rock looks like a digital insert. At least he's not as annoying as Jar-Jar. <br /> <br /> 15 minutes from LaBute can be now. It looks as if he has exceeded his welcome.
