Let's start with the fact that this revised version of one of the biggest films ever made, "Psycho" (1960), was just a good example of the wrong direction, bad behavior and bad cast. The best way to describe this film is to compare it step by step, by negotiating and processing the process into the original. Shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time. Okay, the people of 1960 didn't have to be accustomed to bloodshed or scary scenes as we do today, but that didn't stop people from enjoying them and being nominated for 4 Oscars. Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to do it in color, except in 1998. What should look realistic in color. After the shower scene, Norman washes his hands, it is easy to understand that what was used for blood looked like some red wax. When he drinks blood, he has a red color. About acting, maybe Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins couldn't be better cast in the original. Perkins was good for Norman and was incredibly natural when he smiled and talked to a stranger. Hitch wanted a nice and good actor and it worked well. In this version, I personally believe that Vince Vaughn looked perfect and pretty and strong to play Norman, but unfortunately his actions were nothing short of terrible. At the motel's office, where Norman and Marion have a long conversation, his face was null and his voice and face never changed. In the original in the same scene as madness, we can clearly see a sudden change of expression on Perkins' face and look terribly angry, though not aggressively. Vince Vaughn is working on the whole conversation here, as if he has only his heart. Again a terrible act. Like Anne Heche. In the opening scene in the original we see Marion (Janet) tense and nervous as she goes to Phoenix. She was happy to get the money, but she was also afraid of life. That's what I say acting. In a remake, Heche has no sign of fear and she regularly smiles for getting money. I don't think anyone is "happy and smiling" when they just stole $ 400,000 and the whole state police is behind them. In the shower scene, Janet in the original grabs the curtain, turns and dies after getting stings. In a remake, Heche gets a sting, turns, then swings to the other side, has a foolish look on her face and manages to die with great effort. Again, terrible gameplay. There are also some specially introduced changes in this film from the original, which seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation. In the scene where Arbogast is murdered, two scenes flicker between stabbing. One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep. Many people, including me, are not entirely sure whether the second scene has shown a sheep or a cow or what it was. What has an animal or a naked woman with an investigator killer on Earth! The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary. There are also a few changes in the last scene. <br /> <br /> Let me add some (and only) positive points. I felt that Julianne Moore did her job well and played Lila. And William Macy was doing well, it was almost exactly how Arbogast's character was supposed to play. It is commonplace that the aim and purpose of the film is to remake the current generation of film. who has a good classic plot line, and to try to make it look better than the original. And if something happened here as I just said, it's just the opposite. Unfortunately, many people like me have not been impressed after watching this movie unless we knew the existence of an unforgettable original version. <br /> <br /> Please do not look at this movie, it is nowhere near the original and the original will always be one of the best movies you have ever created, if not the best.
