This movie is excited! I am sad to say that I will be able to watch the first 15 minutes of this film and anything to push hard to sit down and watch the rest of the movie. It's totally stupid and fake. The robot in the movie looks like a man wearing a steel suit and the acting is really bad, especially the one that plays the Alien character. Don't waste your money watching this sequel to the popular Gen-X Cops. I prefer to sleep or spend my money on things other than watching this movie. 1 out of 10.
