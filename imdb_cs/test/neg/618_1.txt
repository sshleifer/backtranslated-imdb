Lance Henriksen is talented for being the best name in B-movie, even in this case playing alongside Charles Napier, Master Control and Joe Don Baker. As always, she does a great job of being evil, but the plot is just bad (they didn't even start the end). And the cut is so terrible that it could be a beauty thing. Is it just me, or does Joe Don Baker seem to have been put in a movie at the last minute? Also, whenever glass is broken in this movie, editing is so anti-phenomenal. Finally, when I looked at this number, David Warner's character dies for Tron 2.0 to finally get the green light. Iron Eagle IV and no mercy.
