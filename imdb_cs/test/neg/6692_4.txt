Strawberry blonde has a great script, but I just wish Errol Flynn was instead of James Cagney, not a person for that part. I think Olivia did a great job. This movie is also a dream day around, so it's hard to watch. I do not like the attitude of a male character; the way Cagney presented himself was just gone. I give him 3 for bad behavior by the main male character. (If you like hard ruff men who like to fight all the time and argue then this is your movie). Strawberry blond would be better if the main character had more positive attitudes and changed the script to be happy to be with Oliva. This film points out that money doesn't bring happiness, women are right jokes. Simple and simple is not the best movie, but everyone has to decide for themselves.
