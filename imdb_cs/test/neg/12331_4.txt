What to say about this movie? A married couple has more than one another. After playing, things get more serious for some time. It is necessary to make a difficult choice: to continue the old situation or to start with the whole heart. Guess what happens at the end. <br /> <br /> This movie seems to be a very low budget. But a good story doesn't have to be expensive. It looks like a game that has been transferred to a movie using only a few cheap places (at least very few other people visible) more than just a stage in this house. From the first minute, future development is as clear as water. Nothing will happen. Sometimes you may think you're watching a soft pornography movie, in which case you know there is no story. <br /> <br /> I find this film unsatisfactory, which explains the voice (4).
