Although this movie was fine. I don't think it was great. It was a bit too slow for my taste.lots of drama but not much action until the end of the movie. This movie was basically a dramatic movie, with a paycheck if you can call it that not until the end of me, the scene of the dam dam and the water flooding the city was fine but too short. acting is decent, but it just didn't do me, in the long run it had something to do with the tension or tension in the whole movie. Another factor is that I just recently watched '10 .5 'and its continuation '10 .5: Apocalypse'. These are 2 big movies that, in my opinion, are a very tough law to be followed in terms of special effects and scenes of destruction. As a result, I have to evaluate Killer Flood: the day Damn Broke got to 4/10
