Talk about false advertising! What did it do in the comedy section of my video? I think maybe there was one ridiculous work in the movie. I appreciate the black comedy, but it only had black without comedy. The film was generally distracting and un-funny. Yes, Kevin Spacey was good because Buddy and the rest of the cast were also good, but in general the film is falling apart, because in fact we don't see enough good reason why Guy (Whaley) would lose his mind so badly. The end was also disappointing. What would Buddy's motivation be to let Guy get rid of what he did? This is not really explained. Why would Buddy go to such a plan? Wouldn't it be more like Buddy to have Guy completely turn him to the police? It didn't seem to me that the end had any sense for me, no matter what I looked at. Despite my good performance I didn't like the film in general. Spacey basically chews the scenery for most of the movie, but at the end it gives Buddy a little needed humanity. The story just wasn't as good as the cast.
