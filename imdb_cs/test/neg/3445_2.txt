OK look like this show is the worst show at nick @ night. I love so many concerts at nick @ night and I love them. When this show came to nick @ night, I was so angry. It's a boring show and it's scaly. Of all the times I watched, I found one episode slightly funny. This show has some of the most ununny and silly jokes ever. This show is terrible. Put props for fresh Prince Bel-air and George Lopez. This show is boring and not so clever. This show should have been canceled much earlier. I don't think they deserve to play at nick @ night along with some great classic shows. This show lacks cleverness, good jokes and style.
