We had no idea what the movie was about, but based on the fact that John Leguizamo appeared in it, we decided to watch it. It turned out not to be the wisest decision. In fact, as another commentary in this forum says, we felt embarrassed for the actors who took part in the film. While the film is by no means terrible, it makes no sense at all. Even William Baldwin's peak performance won't help. John Leguizamo is a multi-talented actor who deserves better. The basic problem, which seems to be a film, was a project that started out with good intentions in making a small comedy, and the people in charge came up with ideas. The result is an uneven film.
