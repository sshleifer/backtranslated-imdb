I watched it because of the description and cover art and again it was deceived. I get sick of all these new stupid straight to DVD horror movies. Once in the blue moon 1 it will be fine. It started with a confusing scene and then jumped 30 years and showed a couple one night during a thunderstorm that was fine because I liked the storm and set a nice mood. . The rest was strange and then confused. I followed him to the end, but he was even more confused when it ended so badly. I had more hope for this movie, but it was more like science fiction then horror and something that should be created for television.
