When I saw the first scene, I realized that the acting was so bad that it could not rise later. Superficial and artificial, with frequent attempts to look professional by referring to technology as a five-year-old tries to make it sound like he knows what he's talking about. The story from second to second is absolutely unrealistic, and just about every single decision made by the screenwriter was the kind you expect from a pupil of below-average grade. The overall story was as unoriginal and predictable as a pack of sausages. Several attempts to make dialogues sound intelligent have been limited to neurotic, apologetic behavior. A ten-year-old might like it. However, it would take five years to accept the lack of realism. As the advanced cell function allows someone to bypass the code lock by touching it as if it were a magic wand, select one of the 100 voices through the ventilation system (which tears Superman) and repair the home computer by scanning what's wrong instead of finding mistakes? In fact, this scene is a clear example: the mistake was that one of the CPU cooling tubes (aluminum tape) was broken, as if it were if the exhaust pipe on the V8 engine had been torn by an explosion. This is something that cannot happen, and if so, it will not prevent the computer from working. There is no electric current passing through this ribbon, but when he (without doing it himself, his hands worked autopilot because the cells in his body were super efficient) put the push-pin into the rip, icons with icons appeared on the desktop. screen immediately without booting. And so it goes all the way. Like escaping from the examination room at the NSA headquarters, he lit the lighter under the fire sensor, which led to the door opening in the entire building. Naturally, the NSA did not foresee this sharp witty approach to escape, nor did they give any guards outside their room (or elsewhere) to watch a vivid, breakthrough breakthrough in military nanotechnology. So he left and got a taxi. Examples like this are not only numerous, but there is in fact no single scene that makes sense. <br /> <br /> So-called big effects were terrible. He returned the basketball back to the child in the park and the boy was thrown 20 feet into the tree horizontally. No acceleration or deceleration, but constant speed and height, like a motorized cart. I'm sure I was silent and looking for cables that held the boy's attitude just as cables could, probably didn't know how to bother them completely. If someone is thrown so far into the tree, they should at least say ouch (or hospitalize with broken bones), but the boy was just confused and overwhelmed. Moronic. This is the word for every creative decision in the whole production. I will give the director a name on my own personal list, someone who is poorly qualified cannot improve. I feel that I demand compensation for having missed 45 minutes of my life for watching it, and the time it took. Although it was therapeutic, it was traumatic to realize just how little the pilot needed to be approved. The only excuse an intelligent person could observe voluntarily would be imprisonment or lobotomy.
