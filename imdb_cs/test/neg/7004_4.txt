I ran through Yvette McClendon in a film at the Los Angeles Film Festival and thought she was a doll. After writing my review there I wanted to see more of it! He found this movie, it was pretty bad. It's not her fault, she's only in the first few minutes when she's obviously the person who pulls you to watch this bad movie. BAD directing. The scenes are looping over and over again, with all the actresses. Amber Smith has very bad work on her chest, but the other actresses looked pretty good. I really like Yvette, but this was probably her bad choice. I can't believe I borrowed this waste to look for it. I hope to find her other movies.
