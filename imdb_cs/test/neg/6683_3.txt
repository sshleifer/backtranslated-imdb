It was missing in the cinema, but it was always slightly forced. I found it in the trash bin at my local video store where I found enough money! I'll give it away to anyone who wants it? Probably! No purposeful conspiracy, one-dimensional figures, the plastic world has not ripped out much better films, not to mention a decent dialogue. Do you know the empty feeling when you descend from ecstasy? It's the feeling here. Sadly, Australia I know is heading in this direction, minus the melodrama and simple answers. The only interesting thing is to see older Aussie actors (who had to go back in their day to get there) against the newer Aussie actors (who must get GOOD). Like a terribly blatant introduction to a movie clip that never starts ... Poor Kylie, she started her career as an actress ...
