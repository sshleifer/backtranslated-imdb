When I first saw this DVD in a three-dollar bar, I couldn't believe my luck: a Christmas movie with Tori Spelling, William Shatner and Gary Coleman ??? Needless to say, I immediately grabbed it and considered it a useful investment. The film itself was just as bad as any movie you'd expect to combine Christmas and the three "celebrities" mentioned. The dialogue was unusual, the figures were one-dimensional, and Carol's arch of figure was incredible. The film itself was a boring piece that refused to end and I felt like a man when finally the end came. My advice: Don't watch this movie unless you have to, and then just under the influence of some serious permitted egg cognac.
