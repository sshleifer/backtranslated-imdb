Although Charlie Chaplin made some great short comedies in the late 1910, others do not do it. Examples like His New Job and Shanghaied come to mind and I would also also in this category also The Floorwalker. Charlie is wrong with a department store manager (and vice versa). This manager is trying to steal money from the box office and run away for it, and Charlie is just an honest customer, but blame some missing objects stolen by other customers. There is not much laughing in her, except for the last few minutes or so some great scenes on the escalator. For the rest, quite disappointing. <br/> <br/> 4/10.
