This movie is just smelly. I know that some people will say that anyone who thinks it is not good, "just won't get it." I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But this is complete. The main character is so annoying that I couldn't worry about what he's doing. He is, as stated in the next review, bouncing around like a little unpleasant monkey. I couldn't build it or force myself to care. This is the case with most characters trying to be difficult to be strange or weird. I liked the character of Mel Gibson and the character of Milla Jovovich, and I wish they were more focused on them. Of course, Milla is beautiful, woeful, and you really feel what she is and why she is. I see Gibson's characters as almost Frankenstien. I just wish he'd saved Milla from the hotel and the helpless, boring characters that lived in her. Rating Milla 10 Movie Rating 0
