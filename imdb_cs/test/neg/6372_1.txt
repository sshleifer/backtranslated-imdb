I have been collecting Iron Man comics since the 1970s and have always enjoyed a character that is far from the average pure hero and his many and diverse enemies. There were no fewer than three attempts at an animated series for the Irish Man and the only original and part of the latter ever made the character justice. So I was a little hopeful that this latest version would be good. The boy was wrong! DVD art is very misleading and represents an image that is not a film. Fist of the good thing there is little ... Art and animation are well drawn and writing and dialogue are generally good, albeit with remarkable exceptions. Character voices are very well chosen and each character is distinctive and well-functioning. Now for the wrong ... Unfortunately, the writers decided to completely screw up both with Iron Man's origin and especially with Mandarin. In addition, they decided to make Iron Man and his opponents in CGI. Bad CGI. This makes them almost as badly as if they live actors in the cartoon. CG work is often repetitive and occasional abbreviations are occasionally accepted. CG battles are also clumsy, which is further enhanced by the fact that CG and line animations do not mix well. The film would certainly be better if they chose all the characters. Another problem is that Iron Man is in his traditional red and gold suit for the ONE battle! And not even the big fight at the end. All this drags the film down and never picks it up. <br /> <br /> ************ SPOILERS (or warning) MAY FOLLOW *********** * <br /> <br /> The movie is starting Interestingly unusual sequence of stopping machine movement, welding and gears. Then we are familiar with what looks like a Chinese temple in the process of renewal, and a statue of what fans recognize as a tangerine is prominent. Things happen strangely, preventing progress in restoring the temple. Watching it is James Rhodes, Tony Stark is a longtime friend. They seem to be planning to actually lift the temple out of the country, despite the group's resistance, insisting that the temple's resurrection will cause a terrible catastrophe. Rhodes is captured during a raid. Stark, pictured in a hot tub with a beautiful lady, is informed about the problems and sets off to personally oversee the project and save his friend, while in the background his father deals with the board of directors trying to remove Tony. Tony's coming just to get his armored escort over and drop it. Tony later wakes up deadly wounded in the heart and the insurgent prisoner. He is rescued only by quick action from Rhodes and scientist. Finally, Stark must build a prototype of gray iron armor and escape, but only after some loss of life. While the rebels meet a troubled girl named Li Mei and two fall in love. The temple is resurrected and four elemental beings (all done in CG) appear and begin to collect hidden circles of power. Stark and Rhody find trouble at home, but without success they manage to confront the elementals who actually stop them. First, using Aquatic Armor, then more classic Red and Gold Armor, and finally everything goes back to the temple and Stark returns to the bulky gray armor. for final clearing and running with what Fin Fang Foom can be (also in CG.) Here the story has a major twist, as it turns out that Mandarin needs a host body to manifest. This leads to a somewhat tragic final battle that is marked by Mandarin being slightly more than a ghost and not seen until the last 5 minutes of the film. ugh ... <br /> <br /> If you are an Iron Man fan then you probably won't like it. And even non-fans can find the movie somewhat missing or not.
