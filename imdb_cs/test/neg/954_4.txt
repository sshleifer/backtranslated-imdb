This meandering crowd revenge story is not just too interesting, even with Ed McMahon in a mature chief role. Jim Brown kicks his ass effectively, Gloria Hendry proves once again that he can bring life to the poorest roles, and Brock Peters is decent as a Cop who plays the book. It is still boring and poorly built, and even the print shown on the cable is now brought out of its original James Brown score.
