This movie is worse than the Cat People movie I saw during the same week. She has an 80th style. MTV punk rockers, the real ones who are against social, not today's PC commercial types, frat boys, and a bad guy named Splater. I really like Splater and the movie has a blue light of 80, but the rest looks like a low-budget Canadian schlop. I have seen so much of it while I live in this great country, and realize that these types of films were made for tax relief. Avoid at any cost.
