Dead Man's Bounty has the look and feel of a classic Italian western world. The camera, costumes and sets look great. Casting is a rough, not pretty face between them. At the beginning I was preparing for a pretty cool movie, but what I finally witnessed was a total disaster. The script was horrible. There was nothing exciting at all and very few acts or valuable drama. Despite the great result, cast spoke with heavy European accents that were often incomprehensible. The final final of a nail in his coffin was a wide stripe of conceit that paints most of the image, with a strong focus on the character of the barmaid that appears in several very unpleasant sexual scenes. Also her speech at the end was quite disgusting! The only novelty comes from the stunt casting of Val Kilmer in the role of a dead man who continues the recent DOA series!
