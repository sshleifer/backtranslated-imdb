Larry is a perfect example of the Democratic Party in the United States. The King was somewhat fair and impartial and had different guests. The party was also centrist, but it was another era. Like Larry, it's far left. At least 90 percent of all guests at the Royal Exhibition in the past year or two are Liberals who sit there and bash President Bush and every Conservative can think ..... night after night. Bill Mahar, one of the more viscous ones, is - and you can see it - the most common guest in the history of King's TV show. Every week you can count on other open left fingers to be at the royal show, but don't hold your breath waiting for the conservative. There are few and far away. King was also one of the media innovators. All this started with O.J. Simpson's trial. Night after night after night, that's all you've ever seen in the mid-1990s. Whether it's the latest gossip about Anne Nicole Smith or the case of Petersen's murder, or Paris Hilton, Britney Spears or some other tabloid subject, you can bet that Larry will beat him. Unfortunately, all other networks are doing the same thing now. Larry was the leader in this regard. The king also has the courage to give advice, for example, about marriage. I am not joking; I heard her say it. The joke is that he was married and divorced half a dozen times! This man has few scratches, trust me. As for morality, he is clueless. Maybe that's why he has Dr. Phil to regularly explain some facts about life to him. Larry nods but doesn't understand more than when Billy Graham talked to him. The king also became famous for his "softball" interview, which means he doesn't ask any hard questions. That's because most of his guests are out of his political beliefs. People know it's at the royal show they like to have an hour public relations concert. <br /> <br /> What it all meant is a serious drop in ratings over the past five years. People through him and his Liberal-and-tabloid-TV mentality and switched from King and CNN to Fox News.
