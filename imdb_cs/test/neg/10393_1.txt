I'm not sure if it's a comedy or not, but I find it's pretty comic. Isobel is obsessed with the devil. Somehow a perverted priest and a gardener would reverse it. Part of the exorcism and part of the soap opera, you will laugh at least a little. There's a paranoid jealous dad, a satanic sister, Valley of the Dolls mother, and then a cowboy friend; they all helped the skirt chase the priests to fight the demons from dear Isobel. Sometimes it seemed like Jerry Springer's episode, but I paid for it. Instead of the cold head, the twisting, the curse of the sailor, and the crucifixion crucifixes that Regan made in the Exorcist; You get a lot of Isobel, who is bent on her bed, like a trampoline, hiding in her closet and jumping from hay. Yeah, it's Chuck E. Cheese. So, if you want to follow the quote of an uncovered horror movie that is worth a few laughs while you wait for a predictable ending ... this is your movie.
