Writer and director Jay Andrews, aka Jim Wynorski, serves more of his characteristic shocks with a dignified cast endangered by reptiles from computers generated by Grade Z in "Komodo Vs. Cobra", as a general rip-off "Mysterious Island" meets. Jurassic Park as you can imagine. The main problem with this predictable yarn of monsters dining on humanity is the incredibly false special effects. The Cobra and Komodo are cheerfully horrible. However, graphic designers work fine by integrating monsters with their victims, not that any of this is in the least believable. Obviously, the "Komodo Vs. Cobra" had a budget that was so low that virtually everything that was not human looked fake when everyone got out. This episode of shabby monsters takes place on a remote island, where the US military performs animal testing at the highest level. As a result, the vast Komodos and Cobra thrive in this tropical island paradise. As the event opens, the primary scientist is swallowed by a cobra who likes to swim. We are then introduced to the Greenpeace group, such as environmental demonstrators and journalists. Planet organizer Jerry Ryan ("Hellbent" Ryan McTavish) pays five thousand to Captain Jim Stoddard (Michael Pare of the CBS-TV "Houston Knights") with a promise of five more if he takes them to this forbidden island. Meanwhile, the US military suspects something is wrong on the island, so they send their own team of men who ate the predators. Our heroes get to the last scientist on the island of Dr. Susan Richardson (Michelle Borth of "Wonderland"), the daughter of a scientist responsible for this crazy science project that tells them that the army will focus on the island. destruction. The title match between the two overgrown predators takes place in the last quarter of an hour after our heroes, who were consistently overthrown by monsters, found a helicopter and took off in time for the army to crush the island. There is no tension, tension, or anything that pays off in this non-standard being. The best of this yawning is the orchestral soundtrack of composer Chuck Cirin; It gives "Komodo Vs. Cobra" an epic feel. Jay Andrews usually writes and manages tolerable drivel, but this is far below his low standards. Sexy women have better survival than boys. In one scene, our heroic band drives the river and we don't see any wet shirts. Wire! There is nothing in the way of unforgettable dialogue or relationships. I think military guys are doing too much salute when they get to the head of a conspiracy. Hopefully Michael Pare got a good paycheck from this garbage. The end, as one of the scientists acquires the characteristics of a lizard, comes strictly as an additional thought. It's not so bad, it's good, it's just bad.
