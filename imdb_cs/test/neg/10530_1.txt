Seagal Fans Watch Out - He won't do any action scenes for nearly an hour in this disaster. Instead, Seagal RUNS AWAY from numerous battles, let Ja rule convincingly lose every battle. Actually, I rule could be up and upcoming action star, but Hollywood needs to at least hit puberty (which should happen in a few years ...) Also, what kind of commandos / terrorists wear a plain suit? The chick in this cruelty looks like a backup singer for Christina Aguilera. Let's get back to Seagal- When he finally relaxes, it's his double sensation (HEAVILY PADDED, which resembles the inflated Seagal), which does a lot of work and falls. I don't even remember any aikido. It's just your standard kicks and punches that you would see in any martial arts martial art. Neither "so bad - it's funny". Just boring ...
