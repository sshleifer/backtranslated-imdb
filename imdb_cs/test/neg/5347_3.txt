Chip Foose is an absolute genius and the end result of the projects is really amazing. Co-founders do a good job. I especially enjoy watching the project. The final results are much better than when they came from the assembly line, what about today's mechanical and cosmetic advances. However, I get annoyed somewhat by the fact that "projects" seem to be the property of already rich and / or famous. It's too bad that those who get repaired can afford the business. Now, Vince Neill of Motley Crew gets a car for his friend. Hi! If he were (Neill) a real friend, he would have paid for his car to be restored. But that's a joke! Another episode shows a middle age seemingly well-to-do gal getting her '56 caddy named Betsy done. The husband for 30 years was behind all this. The couple looked like money was not in short supply. What a shame. I think lunch buckets guys like me will have to save for a day that never comes. I am the owner of the '53 Ford Chip project. Will anyone choose me?
