Unfortunately, this is not one of those films that make you laugh at the incredible stupidity at least. It has no fun value at all. It's just plain simple. I don't know where to start explaining how much the movie upset me. I think what really takes a cake is an unbearable soundtrack. It sounds like someone took a simple blow and then for the rest, letting a 5 year old child run amok with a synthesizer and record it. It's really so horrible and as if it's not enough, there's no scene in the movie without "music" (= noise). By the end of the movie, you are either deaf or have already cut off your ears before. Which would at least prevent you from falling asleep because nothing happens in the movie to keep your attention. Just a lot of bad games, a few cheap and unconvincing kills, no story at all (it just jumps from one scene to another and you as a viewer can make sense of it) and in the last 30 minutes or so, can witness the worst "special effects ‚Äù. It's very boring. Don't Watch This Movie! You could do something much more fun like looking at the wall or reading a phone book. Did I mention how much is the soundtrack sucked?
