Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! <br /> <br /> Think movies like this have been made, and probably thousands of people have enjoyed it, and that's fine. How innocent we were in those days. To put it bluntly, this movie is stupid. The hero is so wet that you can hear his dirty wet steps in every scene. My lord, but it's just one of the whole terrible, terrible actors killed in this turkey. No wonder MST3K chose it. The story, such as it is, centers around a stock car driver (who is so incompetent, you really believe it is an actor to drive a car) that he surrenders and "gets with the wrong crowd" Oooooh! Scary things. However, the bad crowd turns out to be the equivalent of cyclist The Three Stooges and their hand-me round biker slut. As an example of how this whole thing is lame, writers obviously waved brains to come up with a scary name for a biker gang - if four people can be called a gang, that is. Result? The Gang is called Satan's Angels! I'm not you. Such sinister action and dialogue, along with ridiculous scenes, make the amazing movie beer and chips. But otherwise it is just the worst kind of waste. <br /> <br /> Like I said. Once it could be considered good. But today it just makes you laugh (and crouching) with every minute that goes. Avoid it except for a good laugh. And make sure you're more than half drunk too!
