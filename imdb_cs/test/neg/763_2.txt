For a scientifically-prepared super-dog to answer petit crime, CHOMPS was a chump. Everything I've ever seen of Chompsa was to sit, walk or run. Or run, then walk, then sit ... and then go back and stretch, and then walk, and then run for K-Tel dance hits. And sometimes he had all the answers to Jumbo. But mostly it just sat a lot. All I say is: In Celebrity Death, Chomps couldn't take Mr. Bigglesworth.
