SCREAMING is a very low-budget horror movie that was shot on video. It features open-air acting, poor lighting, a weak story, and some of the worst monster effects I've ever seen. The story has a college student under pressure to join the cult of his attractive landlord. Cult is a parody of Scientology with a book similar to Dianetics. That would be a funny shot of the group if it weren't for the stupid script and the cheapness of production. Monster effects look horrible and image quality makes it feel like you're watching a home video or public announcement. I think everyone who sees it agrees that films should be filmed on film.
