According to "Lucien Rebatet" in his "Histoire de la Musique" (Robert Lafont, BOUQUINS 1973 page 338) Beethoven's character was not very compatible with women. He had quite a number of "platonic passions" with female members of the "Vienna aristocracy" to whom he dedicated some "sonatas". But musicians, even composers, didn't qualify for the "Fine Ladies". Haydn was a "servant" by Prinz Von Esterhazy, Mozart died of drinking or Poison and Bethoven was according to Rebatet a frequent customer of "street prostitutes" in Vienna. A British biographer, Newman says that Beethoven listed syphilis until he was 40. It he became deaf because it is possible, but not certain. The Ninth Symphony premiered on May 7, 1824 in the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna, along with the consecration of the Overture and the first three parts of Missa Solemnis. This was the first composer's performance in twelve years; the hall was packed. Although the performance was directed by Michael Umlauf, Kapellmeister, Beethoven met him calmly. What remained of "female fantasy". Ed Harris's interpretation and characterization are quite good, but too linear, based on dating of 1823 by Ferninand Waldmüller. It shows a man who despises the world (perhaps he hates). For good reason.
