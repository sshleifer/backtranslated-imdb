This sponsored and sloppy spy melodrama featuring two buffoonishs (one idealistic, one cure added) Californian children dealing with KGB secrets never seem to have enough steam to keep tension and tension before a very slow death dies more than two hours later. John Schlesinger's finished product gives the impression that most of the time he sleeps in his director's chair when the film lags behind and the actors sleep, except that Sean Penn is very annoying. Child Altars Boys and Friends Chris (Tim Hutton) and Daulton (Penn) suggest a plan to sell KGB secrets when Chris lands a job that allows him access to secret government materials. Disillusioned with what he sees when he sees the US interfering in foreign affairs, idealistic Chris and drug hunger Daulton associate with the Russians and begin to flatter them with classified material. When Chris decides he wants to, things start to fade at a rude pace. The 1980s were not kind to a significant director, John Schlesinger. In the 1960s and 1970s he had a series of critically acclaimed films in both England and America, but in 1981 Honky Tonk Freeway came and marked the beginning of the end. The Falcon and the Snowman were putting a lid on him more or less. Lacking Marathon Man's tension and high-quality performances (Hoffman Voight, Christie, Jackson, Finch, Olivier), who was at the forefront of the Falcon, led most of the way into circles. Sean Penn chews the scenery from start to finish in such an unpleasant way that you encourage your torturers to do more for him. Tim Hutton is driven by his limited gaming, and most of his scenes show the need for more rehearsal time. Lori Singer as Hutton's girlfriend plays what silences most of the Schlesinger content trip to record her vapid expressions. When he does, you'll understand why. Only David Suchet as a KGB handler with a keen look and restraint keeps himself well.
