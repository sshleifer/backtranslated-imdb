Apparent customized vehicle for Ryan Philippe. It seems that the studios hoped he could play a hard cop leader and not seem to be 16 (can't). Heavyweights Jason Statham and Welsey Snipes serve as booklets for Phillippe, but when Phillippe flounders isn't on the screen; His shallow acting style has nothing to bounce. The script is a typical potboiler at the end of the 20th century a good cop / bad cop with a ridiculously predictable plot and a dialogue picked up from the 1970s TV shows shows, such as "Streets of San Francisco." Snipes reprising his role as an eternal black villain, playing a slightly less crazed lunatic than his Demolition role man. But for Snips and Statham, there wasn't much to chew on. Statham's character announces that he has given up nicotine and caffeine - something that the film needed to inject. A Truly Forgotten Moment: Ryan Phillippe Based on Buddhist Dogma: Galloway: Are You a Buddhist? Dekker: No. It's just something I picked up on the way.
