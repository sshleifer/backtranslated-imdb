Now don't get me wrong, I love a good movie, and after watching the Thin Red Line (and loving), I was eager to track down two earlier movies to Terrence Malicks, and when I was watching the Sky Days, my enthusiasm to see the Badlands virtually disappeared. I noticed that I was very interested in beautiful photography, but I saw this movie on a terribly old vhs tape that looked terrible. All I can say is the hope that the photo was excellent because it would be one of the few attractions of this movie. Not since the substitute film returns fell asleep during the film. This film felt so long (and it wasn't!), The cut was choppy and discontinuous, the story didn't exist, the voice was incoherent splashing, the characters evolved slightly, and the whole thing didn't evolve. I know Malick wasn't sure how to do it. Subsequently, he shot a lot of shots and then spent about two years editing in an effort to put it all together. This is very obvious on the screen. Everything looks chopped, every time the scene seems to gain some momentum (or some character development) that bothered the boring scenes of people doing boring things. It was as if someone had tried to divide the story from the footage of people from the farm. The few good points are the music and the chase scene near the end, but those things aren't where it is enough to keep interest. I would normally let a bad movie go through without being too loud, but when it's so highly reassessed something has to be said. Maybe the farmer would like it ...?
