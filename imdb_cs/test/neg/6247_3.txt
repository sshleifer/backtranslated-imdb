Hmmmmmmm - Cheerleader Massacre. Let me think that girls in high school are slicing up, except for the cute ones that survive. I have it. Another movie. I was actually surprised that this was made in 2003. I really thought they stopped doing these movies in the 80s. It was indeed your run of a mill slasher film with teenage eye feasts, stupid male horn dogs, even a silly male adult and a hot teacher. He goes on a list of dark and stormy nights and a deserted cabin in the woods. We've seen it all before. However, this has had some interesting twists that put it above normal slashes, so if you have a few brain cells to fry and 2 hours to kill it - it could be worse.
