This film was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unreal movies I have seen in a long, long time. To be fair, I did not expect any revolutionary comic formula, but I expected to have some fun. With such low expectations, how could I be disappointed? Jim Carrey, perhaps my favorite actor (not sarcasm), has done a bit more in this film than treading water. He seems to have temporarily returned to his roots with a funny face and created a character that does not differ from his Fletcher Reede of Liar Liar. This new character, Dick Harper (a.k.a. Fletcher 2.0) is poorly rendered and unhappily written whelp. If you find yourself smiling while watching this pitiful and basically boring character, it is most likely because Carrey is trying so hard to make a third dimension to him. Carrey's exotic image becomes witty embarrassing - and finally sad. Leoni Tea as Jane does a little more than provide Carrey's Costello to Abbott. I typically find Leoni tea refreshing and underused, but not in this case. Jane Harper could easily be played by an actress from the age of thirty to forty-five, and this is in this non-specificity that the character of Jane becomes uninteresting to watch. She simply has no defining feature other than her following general theme of the movie, which seems to be that ... Wait, no, this movie has no theme. If you don't count "big business is evil" as a topic. I thought it was more than given. Richard Jenkins and Alec Baldwin both provide a credible (though tired) support performance, but no one seems to be really investing in the role they play. It is very clear that Alec Baldwin has made so much effort to play his role as sinister C.E.O. as she plunges into a sandwich (which seems to have been doing a lot lately). Slightly tangent, but Alec Baldwin has played some roles over the past few years that didn't require him. to be a mighty jerk in a suit? By the way, take my advice if you haven't witnessed horror for yourself: save money. This is the one that catches HBO in a few months. Dick and Jane are present, but there's no fun.
