Being a huge street fighter fan and looking forward to the previous movie Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie, which I really enjoyed! However, the film seemed to have no real sense of purpose or purpose. Most of the characters I couldn't get in touch with and lacked the intense action that made the aforementioned street fighter movie so great. But there are some good points, but the animation is great !!!
