This movie is so boring that I spent half of it on IMDb while it was opened in another tab on Netflix and tried to find out if anyone thought it was one of those boring, grim, imaginative movies they've ever seen. Warning: Actually, I couldn't finish it, so these are my impressions until minute 54. <br /> <br /> Keira Knightly gets a lot of time on the screen. As others have already mentioned, her mother wrote a script (perhaps during some kind of drug-induced daze, where utter disagreements and emotional statements about emotions sounded like an interesting dialogue) and the film seems to be a show for Knightly. Oops! Even though I agree that she is beautiful (with unexposed teeth ... her teeth with anxiety cause anxiety and fear), I found that her reactions were forced and poorly timed. Like William or Dylan doing something cute ... beat ... HAHAHA from K with holes and playful arm. As a minute too late. What? And she can't match the intensity of Cillian Murphy. Somehow she could really look at her and look as if she was fascinated and fell in love with her because she seemed totally disconnected, almost like her with a mirror. It must be torture, it is opposite someone who does not deliver the same level of energy as you. Do you know what else is torture? This movie. The Knight looks stunning during his cyclical expression "I have curls of 1940 pins and hot clothes. Watch me sing!" shots, but what's the point? Is it an altar or actress? When he talks, it's bizarre, "Ooow, Mehster Deelan. This leads me to confusion because the accent is so mixed and apocryphal, but sometimes so strong that I have no idea what it is saying (or maybe falling asleep). If no one knows who Vera is, or is little, was it so important to give her this supposed Welsh accent? It distracts from the rest of the action (just kidding). This movie looks like someone dreamed of a movie, maybe after reading little Dylan Thomas before going to bed. But instead of adjusting to the wakeful world, it was like, "Man, that dream was so interesting" and he tried to repeat it. Then someone else warned, "Your script needs a job. Nothing that happens is a story or a necessity," and the writer is all: "But I dreamed!" It's like a child's fantasy, one of those wild and meandering threads that revolve to get your attention. And then William went to war and then Vera had a baby and then some blonde chick drank too much and there were so many planes and pin curls and they all had ruby ​​red lips and ... <br /> <br /> As for the character Dylan Thomas (so that's all I can tell him), why didn't he have any lines in this goofy biot? All he does is drink beer and smoke cigarettes and move with Sienna Miller, who is so wild and artistic to make a public brush in public! Get out here, fools crazy! (I realize he's not a poet, but she and Thomas are like one of those crazy units of crazy guys who are spreading crazy times like lukewarm Sailor and Lula of Wild at heart.) Someone asks in the bulletin board if they should have this film buy. I say it. Leave it on the shelf and use it only as a weapon to narcotize children, the elderly, or persistent home guests. <br /> <br /> P.S. to the character of Murphy ... if someone asks if you were "in sh **" you can say yes because your war scenes seemed to be shot in a dump.
