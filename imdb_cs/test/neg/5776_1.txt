When I saw the envelope before I watched it, my expectations were not high, especially because it was one of those horrible horror movies on the blockbuster (in addition to the junior movies). Well, not only does the film have thoughtless stereotypical characters (a rich bag, a bitch, a sheriff, a locator who knows what's going on in the city and so on), but she has such a divine dialogue, acting, directing and efekty cg. The Dude Jeremiah Stone was cheerful. (* SPOILER *) I will never understand why he bit his finger from nothing when he held the baby hostage. The assumption for a film is as severe as other shortcomings. From what I could get, Jeremiah Stone was a golden excavator during a gold rush and a notorious outlaw. He had a crapload of gold (* SPOILER *) and cursed anyone who went after his gold before local people shot him after killing a girl, but not only survived, bit his own finger and ran away. So today's group of clueless morons will learn about this golden mine and, of course, the locals warn him of "Curse of the Forty Years". And what do they do? As expected, he ignored the warning and was eager to seek gold. They get gold, and all sorts with ** t continue. Fortunately (* SPOILER *) the bitch gets her head cut off. This is about it. If you look at the film cover, you can find out what the film will be. It's so horrible it's fun. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 stars out of 5.
