please re-watch all 3 series and don't go see this movie, the trailer is totally misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a poorly thought out 25min TV episode to the most painful 2 hours of my life, a really horrible movie. tubbs and edward are in it for a few minutes, micky has 1 line, and her lipp just winds up the same tired old puns, also Mr. Brissa's accent changes only about five times in the tons of badly bred extras, and really a couple laughs that It seems to recycle for 2 hours even honestly feel that this series has been totally destroyed by this divine-awful piece of crap .......... batman and robin all is forgiven
