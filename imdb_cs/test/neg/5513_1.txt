Roger Corman ripped the line up for what seems to be a virtually zero budget. All special effects were originally used in "Battle Beyond the Stars," and I suspect that a number of props, costumes, and sets have been reused from other sources. It seems that the story was written around these elements, so it is not really a movie as well as a recycling project. The third course "Star Wars" did not require then or now.
