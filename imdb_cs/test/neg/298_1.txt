How can you make a mafia joke? It's not a subject to laugh at! A close film can't make me laugh because I compare it to Jane Austen's mafia! Mafia! wasn't a good movie, but Hoods is really worse! In the mafia !, there were some good jokes, but in this one maybe two or three ... Not too bad actors, but very bad script! We certainly prefer something serious like the Godfather. I'll give it * from *****.
