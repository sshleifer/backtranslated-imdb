'Tweety's S.O.S' opens with some apparently reused shots from 'Kit for Cat' and fails to fulfill a classic cartoon. Instead, we get an example of Friz Freleng's Tweety and Sylvester series in his most general execution. Unlike the Chuck Jones' Road Runner series, which tried to introduce new jokes to the same environment, Freleng's series seemed so happy that they recycled jokes while the characters were in a different place. Then "Tweety's S.O.S" is basically equal to "this time on the boat". It's not a completely weak cartoon. There are some good jokes, mostly involving Granny's goggles, but the gags that you can see on a mile away (sea sickness routine) are predominant, and this is the next of those ends where someone other than Tweety says, "I tawt I taw and putty tat ", a joke that worked well once but has a declining return." Tweety's SOS "will probably please kids who have virtually any cartoon, but for big kids like me who are looking for more than the same tired gags, it's definitely one to avoid.
