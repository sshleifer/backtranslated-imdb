I fill in this comment because I couldn't stand the fact that a positive note was posted on the "Complete Information" page. I really think it's the worst movie ever made in my country. It is not just because of a terrible plot, poor English and a tension curve that is as flat as our country. No, it's because it was a serious attempt to make a good action movie, conforming to the Hollywood standard. It must have been a "European Action Film of the Year". For this purpose, they also hired Fejda van Huet, an actor in the award-winning film "Karakter". I don't mind bad movies, I can even enjoy them if they're reckless b-movies. but I can't build movies that are horrible, but they should be type movies.
