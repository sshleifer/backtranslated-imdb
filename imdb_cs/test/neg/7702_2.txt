The problem with this film, like many other films that fail, is the script. <br /> <br /> The script is so out of focus that it's all around. What is this? OK, it's biopic, but I think everyone will agree that no way all life can be condensed within 100 minutes. Selection and editing required, but this script was not selected or modified enough. This did not mean that Hoffman's life fell into one or two definable key moments or themes with which viewers could identify themselves and “get” a bigger picture of the whole person through them. The film roams the fact that it is a straightforward biological "problem genius", a semi-dock / mocu-mentary (using new shots of false to archival footage), to strange movie stories about "Life on a Saturday" (a whole "son who doesn't know I'm his father" shtick ", a film about political conspiracy, etc., etc. He just never sees what he wants to be, and a half-hearted citizen Kane as a narrative structure with Hoffman's past) is soon abandoned, leaving the film even more unstructured and more flabby than it starts. The film is full of moments and incidents that don't contribute to the story. cut let the space expand something more important. The whole scene in the psychiatrist's office after Vincent D'Onofrio screams the window screaming, "I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman! I'm Abbie Hoffman!" ("I play! I acted! I acted!") He could easily be cut. All that happens is a psychiatrist says, "You have bipolar disorder here is some lithium.", And two women in his life say "We could see you weekends more often." and the bang! And it is done. No more mental health problems. It is such a nonsensically absurd token scene that would be easy to throw away before being shot. A scene where everyone gets high and watch news reports from Vietnam and Hoffman GOD phones? Unimportant. Nothing tells us anything. However, when a momentous moment, such as bust drugs, occurs, film production is so rushed that the situation comes from the left field and makes the viewers meaningless. Suddenly he deals with heroin? Where did it come from? Why? What's going on here? I, who was a middle-aged leftist, would guess I'm sitting in the target audience in this movie, but I was poisoned by the "The Man," "The Pigs," "Fuzz," and so on. As brutal, inappropriate, unthinking, hippie-hating androids. Maybe it was in America in the 1960s, I don't know, I wasn't there, but in film terms it was a cheap clumsy controversy. When I said Vincent D'Onofrio was convincingly charismatic as the younger Hoffman and I could watch Janea Garofalo in something, even reading the bus timetable, though it was just not right for that amount.
