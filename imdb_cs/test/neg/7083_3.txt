Scarlet Dawn throws Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as a Russian baron grossly displaced by the forces of the Russian Revolution and now has to take care of himself in a world that is not terribly hospitable for former aristocrats. It is also not very suitable for any kind of real work. Perhaps Doug would have caught the Reds, but for his ex-servant Nancy Carroll not taking him away. Nancy has a great old crush on Doug and they marry once they arrive in exile in Istanbul, which after all the film is referred to by his former Christian name Constantinople. They got married and settled with Doug, who is now limited to washing dishes. But Fairbanks' former mistress Lilyan Tashman, who always plays bad girls on the film, notices him and offers him to return to some style. he was once used to as part of a fraud against father and daughter US tourists Guy Kibbee and Sheila Terry. The good thing is that this movie has an incredibly short run time of just 57 minutes, usually it was B Westerns because it's both boring and melodramatic. The end is somewhat incredible. Doug knew he was in special thanksgiving thanksgiving and really overlaps the flaws of an incredible story. What I didn't understand was that Fairbanks was trained in the military profession, why not. become a mercenary soldier after leaving the new Soviet Union? That didn't make any sense to me at all. I'd see it if I was a fan of all the major players.
