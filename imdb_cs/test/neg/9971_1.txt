One of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Three immature young people have sex and speak very little, except for their "love". They do not seem to be interested in much, but each other and only passively. I felt closed. Most exterior scenes take place at night, so we can't even enjoy the well-lit sights of Paris! I gave up after an hour and ten minutes.
