I was sitting at home turning channels when I came across what sounded like an interesting movie. I like Destruction movies and decided to watch it. I don't know why, but I watched him for 2 hours. We saw this type of movie, I don't know how many times. From 1998 to 2000, there were dozens of films dealing with global destruction of some kind. The best on my list is Deep Impact, which was more believable than this one. Here are my problems with this movie: 1) cheap special effects like something from an old computer. 2) no background or explanation of the weather. If you are going to make a film about the weather, at least be sure to enjoy the technical details with the audience. 3) How does she find out that only 2 or 3 people find out that the storm is approaching Chicago? 4) Where are some interesting characters? I really don't care about anyone except maybe a pregnant woman. I felt there was no character development. 5) No thought provoking moment, what so sometimes and factually wrong topic. And that's just the first part of the movie. I bet the conclusion will show us several scenes of destruction and search and rescue, as it did before. And judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie, I can only imagine what to expect. Of course, in the end, the main characters survive and life goes on ... as original
