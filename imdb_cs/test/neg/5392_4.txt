Dear SciFi Channel: How were you? How was your summer? I was fine, but I feel that our relationship is no longer the same and we are growing. I don't understand why you don't love me anymore. I just finished watching your SciFi Channel Original "Skeleton Man", and again, you have shown a blatant lack of respect for my feelings by DRAINING EVERY HOT GIRL in this movie! I mean, I understand you're just in this for immediate satisfaction. The only thing that matters to you is to create a movie where people cut and chop up a murderous Indian spirit / creature / legend / anything. So you really don't have time to put some thoughts and effort into something else - like finding a Skeleton Man costume that doesn't make him a skeleton gay lover of "He-Man." Seriously, his robe looks like a bed sheet and his skull is as smooth as a baby behind him, almost looking like a Halloween-killer-for-6-year-old when he marches through the wild to murderous fury. So we're throwing you a bone because we're not looking for performances that wouldn't seek Oscar winning, interesting land, or realistic responses. Because we realize that although Michael Rooker, Caspar van Diem and all the girls are to be trained by Special Ops agents, they are all mysteriously transformed into Keystone Kops who can't shoot or see directly when Skeleton Man appears. And we also fully expect that nothing - bullets, explosions, electric shocks, nothing - can kill the Skeleton Man until one minute remains in the film and we need to find a way to make things happen. We expect to see blood and guts. But you have the talent to take the least attractive actress in the cast and make her the only woman to survive. And honestly, I think you're doing it just to antagonize me. Since this movie is just as stupid, it has the potential to be "so bad - it's a good" classic and just kill all the hotties will destroy everything - and force me to lower its rating. All I ask is that once, just once, you consider my feelings and let those sexy girls survive the movie. Please.
