Ever wanted to see how low a movie can drop? Well, look no further! This movie has it all! Racism jokes, handicap jokes, overweight jokes, suicide jokes, joke jokes, drug jokes, animal abuse jokes, dirt jokes, old wife jokes, cancer jokes, gay jokes , jokes with ties, jokes with crap, falling jokes flat on one's face over and through jokes, overuse of blood jokes, jokes rape, pee jokes, alcohol abuse jokes, anal rash jokes, bunch of people yacking their coffee back jokes, nudity jokes, see Who can say the most oath of words in one scene jokes, lesbian jokes, girlfriend abuse jokes, and the list goes on and on people! <br /> <br /> The worst part is: none of this is funny! (Not that anyone would find most of the funny ones to get started.) It seems that if it just can't be the worst, it pushes your expectations into a new bottom because it always seems to find another to make the viewer feel worse. There was one scene that almost threw me out and almost completely depressed. I don't think I have to point out which one is, but then I'm sure there are other scenes that give people the same feeling. At the end of the movie, which actually made sense and was somewhat realistic when suddenly one character in the scene had accumulated with the worst remains of a garbage bag and tossed a few feet to the ground just to throw a pile into his head of beer bottles. All this probably when he least deserved it. So all thoughts of another 1 point redemption were quickly considered. This is a really horrible movie. This is the one that needs to be studied and divided into small parts at a film school to learn what to do.
