But that's pitiful. One good actor after another turns in a pitiful dialogue in half-hearted fashion under what must have been incredibly pedestrian-to-be considered acceptable. I like Robert Carlyle and Joanne Whalley is one of my favorite actresses, Tom Courtney can do well when pushed, and David Suchet is the highest integrity professional, but they all roam like a fish in a watery gin barrel. I swear Courtney was drunk, for painkillers or both. <br /> <br /> Has the performance been good? Yes, David Hood, as a younger underground engineer whose friend was gone, seemed to be taking it seriously and attributed it to him for that. his scenes were directed by the director's assistant (if he was there), I just don't know what these people did in a movie that was so poor (except for paying bills, of course) I can't start saying how disappointed I am. I SHOULD BE ASHAMED! Any other positive results than David Hood third ... yes The aerial photographs of London were largely submerged very well and the responsible artists deserved better results than their fine work. if you forgive an expression, like the few people who see that they do on a much smaller screen than it would be the best advantage. <br /> <br /> What's going on here? why British filmmakers are trying to emulate such insignificant genres, such as disasters, fairy tales, tabloid films and movies that are even worse than Americans. Gritty realism, character integrity, capture real emotions in such a way that you feel and care ... Family Way, Spring and Port Wine, Get Carter, Long Good Friday, Trainspotting .... Don't get me wrong I like a little escape. Real "Italian work", the adventures of Tom Jones; but oh, that should come, Carry On Camping was a more realistic drama.
