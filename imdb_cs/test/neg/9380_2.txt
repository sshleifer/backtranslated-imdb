The only good thing about Persepolis is the shadows created in German expressionism style animation and a hint of history. This movie bored me. It was a woman dissatisfied with her culture, trying to do everything else and then returning to her roots. Here again, he will find great dissatisfaction and eventually go to the finals so that everyone else in his country can find out about the situation and what they will do, not to be there to support them. There is no conclusion and it leaves us feeling that this woman has no loyalty. Be aware that it is torn between cultures and does not have enough background that seems important and real. So many voices are still listening and most likely end up with a world citizen than has any ties to his native Iranian culture. All I got from this movie was anxiety.
