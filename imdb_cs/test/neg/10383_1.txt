Let me tell you something ... this movie overcame all the laughter of Troma and gore movies that are being presented as it happens when it is a serious film. From a terrible act ... "I knew it, I knew it was obsessed!" ... a priest who accepts sexual favors and gets into showers with naked teenagers ... this piece of dung takes a cake. I'm in a loss and I'm trying to compare it with another movie just as badly. This can only be in your own classroom. The kicker is reportedly some cardinals overseeing the production to make sure it corresponds to reality. I didn't know that the Backwoods USA people acted like absolutely imbecile. I'm not sure I'm upset that I rented it or I stumbled upon a gem of comedy. It was a very guilty pleasure ... so horrible that I was looking with my hands over my eyes for half the time (when I wasn't so strong that I was crying). The end just made no sense at all. If you want to watch something so horrible, it's your movie. If you want a scary movie about exorcism .... keep going.
