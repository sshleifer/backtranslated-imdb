Where should I start? First, the story sucks. Acting sucks, the effects really suck, I think I'll start with the story. Story for Komodo vs. Cobra: number one, doesn't explain how or when Komodo and the cobra got there. Or on how it was created. Playing: TERRIBLE! The director seems to have just pulled a few people off the street (which is probably what he did). And last and least, the effects: they are so horrible that the commodo doesn't even look like a commodo, just a dinosaur that looks incredibly unrealistic. When the cobra appears, the water does not move. All in all, terrible bullshit bits, or think about renting them.
