Savage Steve Holland wrote and directed his second film, One Crazy Summer with John Cusack and Curtis Armstrong, in a supporting role. Cusack and Bobcat Goldthwait are the latest graduates heading to Cape Cod to stay at Grandmother Goldthwait for the summer. Along the way, crashing into Demi Moore is watched by John Matuszak and a motorcycle gang. Soon, three will join in an effort to save the house from turning into another lobster restaurant for a delighted, spoiled family that regards "work" as a dirty word. The film contains several funny medallions such as gags of millionaire dollar radio competitions and Godzilla parody. Just like Holland's first movie, Better Off Dead, John Cusack adds immensely to the film. Otherwise, it is a fake movie filled with fictional situations and idiotic characters (as opposed to unpredictable). Moore even sings several bars in the nightclub with some terrible synthesizers. Goldthwait's gags wear out and Armstrong was never an actor of any caliber that would appear in something other than the Z-class stuff. This is rather a hit or miss, kitchen sink comedy that could use a better scenario and direction. * 1/2 of 4 stars.
