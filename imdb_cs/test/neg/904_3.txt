A 10-year-old boy and his parents argue that he will decide to go by car and embark on a surrealistic journey across America to find the Motorama cards, which is a gas station card game. has a chance to win $ 500 million. On the way, she meets many bizarre characters. No one can create "instant cult classics," Joe Minion's previous "After Hours" has made it a complete achievement and an amazing director, but it wasn't instant. This film, on the other hand, is just bizarre to be bizarre. No rhyme or reason for any of it. The storyline is at best random and seems to exist only to show off different portraits. It's not just a fun movie or a thoughtful movie. It's too slapping. I've heard a lot of comparisons between this and David Lynch. This is a damn close heresy, because even Lynch's "worst" movie (the worst in quotation marks, because he doesn't really have bad movies) is still a few miles above this wood.
