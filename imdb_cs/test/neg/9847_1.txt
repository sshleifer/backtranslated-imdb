This film attempted to capture the naive idealism that many young girls have for fun, friendship, escape, danger, sex, maturity, etc. The problem was that they couldn't create these things at every level; therefore, they failed to build a decent story around them. I could not follow the point of any part of this story, nor any reason to care. This film is not a survey of pedophilia at all. It's basically about a girl who is in love with her sister, and her sister is in love with the idea of ​​"men." While the other is trying their love for men, the former is trying to win his sister back by not being "settled". The plot is weak, the characters are weak, and the reality was all similar to an amateur porn movie (without sexual content).
