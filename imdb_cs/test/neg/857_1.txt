Even those of us who like cute animal pictures - and I disgust them - would find it hard to find merit in this extremely bad film travesty. Perhaps inspired by "101 Dalmatians" with their clever and loyal dogs, his stupid and sinister people and his absurdly "happy" and predictable ending, the alternative name "101 Turks" comes out of mind. This would involve anyone involved in his unfortunate production. I rejected it as a shameful Hollywood perversion of British habits before I learned in horror that it was a Canadian film that takes place in Victoria BC. equally fake pits of Canadian mediocrity. Let me calculate how bad it is. Dragon? Asinine Script? Desperate Performance and Sophomoric Direction? Thievery Smart Animals? Endless clich√© and predictable slapstick? In the second consideration, neither me nor those who go through IMDb have time for a complete catalog of their shortcomings. However, I was more detailed in his merits, and this space would be left empty. Believe me, it's bad; a memorial in a huge pantheon of a truly horrible (Canadian) cinema. If you have already seen it, she has condolences. If you don't, stay away from it as you would SARS or drum plague. Or other movies with cute animals. Don't let your children see it so that their tiny mind is not distorted by the even more subtle minds of those who have funded, invented and filmed this terrible craziness. Maybe tonight, when I retire, I will have a nightmare with ghostly confused animals that come out of the bed table when I run a frantic flight. I hope. It will be a much better thing than looking at this brutally banal boondoggle. But then I could dream that I had to watch it for the second and utter horror and the cold sweat of wanting me to stay all night, shivering about seeing it again as a bad dream. I could even find something to watch. Maybe "Godzilla" or "Attack Of The Killer Tomatoes" Maybe instruction video for my built in vacuum cleaner.
