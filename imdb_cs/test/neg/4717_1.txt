Do you know those movies that are so inexplicably bad that you have to laugh? Half-caste wasn't one of them. Sounds good, right? But no, it's not. It's not a bad horror movie that is fun to watch because it's lame or not working well, or it has bad special effects or something like that. No, the half-caste is just boring. They don't even try to be scary until the last 20 minutes. They are just kids running around in an African bush ground and getting high out of elephant droppings on the first 75% of the film, and it's not even funny. But the last 20 minutes are HILARIOUS. I have no idea what happened, but it was really fun to watch that the CGI leopard tore out the throats of all the white guys I couldn't make out. If you're in the mood for a bad horror movie, don't rent this because you go to sleep before they get to the fun stuff. If you accidentally rent this movie, I recommend a quick redirect to the end and skip any scene that happens in daylight. You won't miss anything. You will have no idea what character is or what exactly is happening, even if you are watching the whole story.
