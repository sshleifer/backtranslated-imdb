It's important to check your expectations when you see HATCHET. * Buzz that was created on this site far outperforms the actual impact of the movie. What can help someone to see a movie is to realize it's - it's not scary--. It is a clean camp and an attempt to entertain. It's not - funny--, just campy. Don't expect something like SHAUN OF DEAD; not something like Friday the 13th (part II over infinity). HATCHET has passable actors. The camera is direct Ed Wood. Face and makeup effects are stupid - probably intentionally. Gore and Blood is something between Romero and DEAD ALIVE. HATCHET is a film about reciprocity. It's between SHAUN DEAD and LESLIE VERNON. It's between camps and comedy (there's a difference). It's between extremely violent and violent comics. Instead of "capturing the essence of American horror" or any other silly jargon that has been used to describe the film, he's trying to capture something between the semi-finals -American-- Horror like Friday the 13th and a new horror like SHAUN. Fortunately, he will stay away from Torture Horror. In the end, HATCHET is between a bad movie and a decent movie. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * At least there is a campaign going on for people associated with colleagues to leave positive feedback and evaluation. There is no other reason why this film should look in high 7 with 600 voices and fall quickly after a broad release. This film is slightly better than the HorrorFest release and should not be so inflated.
