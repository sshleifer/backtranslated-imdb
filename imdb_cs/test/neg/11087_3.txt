I start by saying that I like Japanese cinema, literature and culture in general. I have seen many Japanese movies and enjoyed them, but "Portrait of Hell" (aka Jigokuhen) makes itself ridiculous. The two characters who dominate the action - the "evil master" in his privileged bubble and the "stubborn, crazy artist" are pure types with zero subtlety or nuance, and all their actions are based on caricature extremes. The film wants to show terrible scenes of violence and raw emotion, but many of these scenes are so high that they actually become ridiculous and the overall feeling is that it is a film made from a TV set that went from the tracks. If this rarely projected movie falls into your hands or comes into your city, you'll save yourself and make it through.
