After Kenneth Opel's angry story refreshing me returned to the pleasure of reading during class, I had great hopes for this series. The story of a bat bat that sailed all over the country to meet its colony took my imagination and deeply resonated with my growing imagination. When I heard this series, I started browsing Bardel Animation and liked what I saw. The character design looked impressive, and the seemingly fast-paced plot was politely stretched after thirteen episodes. Much of my disappointment was when I decided to watch a rerun early in the morning. The opening episode shows our hero, Shade Silverwing, chasing a tiger moth at night. Chirreping echolocatory song, we see clever if the raw CGI effect illuminates the moth, and the persecution takes on a frenetic turn when a small insect creates numerous illusory copies of itself that deceive their pursuer. As a biology lover, I had a decent understanding of the principles that work (tiger moths can perceive the sounds their predators use for echolocation, and make a sound wrap for themselves), but without such an exposure I would certainly be lost. I thought it was a little guessing. Certainly the director will fill us for a while. I waited in vain. Once our protagonist turns down with some of his colleagues, we'll treat them as the darkest dialogue I've ever seen on television. Chinook, Shade's child rival, starts mocking with the dumbest hero I've ever seen on the show. I can understand that writers do not produce Shakespeare, but one would think they would have some social contact in their lives - certainly enough to make communication look natural. Oh, how I was wrong. A voice that is not horrible has hardly been a shining example of human success. "Oh Shade, you broke the law!" Mother Shade sighs empty. "You have to come with me, young." Croiss Frieda, curious older of Silverwing's colony. The actors are trying, but it hardly matters at this point because the story becomes less and less convincing with every minute. While each episode deals with the problem of the week, as is typical of most television series covering storylines, they have penetrated the saga for better and worse. While the main point of the story is Shade Reunion with his family, later tack tackles on other story curves, including cannibalistic bats from the Southern Jungle and brewing war between birds and beasts. Writers are trying to do too much at once, struggling to compress as many promising ideas as possible in the hope that the audience will be interested enough to keep the bloody show on. Unfortunately, these attempts are futile for all but eight to ten years on which this exhibition is focused. Although it is nice to see the Canadian media that would be preserved, it would be even sweeter if the nice series were not limited to the immediate family of animators or Kenneth Oppel's fan-book fans. There are worse things there your kids could watch than Silverwing, but far better programs are there too. Go to mediocrity and read the books instead.
