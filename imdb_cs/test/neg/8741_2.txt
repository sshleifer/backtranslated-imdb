I started watching this movie at t.v. a few weeks ago, but gave up after the first 10 minutes. Initially, a person on a witness protection system, located on an isolated farm, becomes nervous about the outside of the guard, and then asks the guard inside the house to make a phone call - just to see that the line has been broken. Shortly thereafter, Roy Scheider appears as one of the witness killers and properly witnesses and his wife - on which figure Roy Scheider properly picks up the phone in the kitchen, dials the number and then speaks: It's done !!!! That was for me!
