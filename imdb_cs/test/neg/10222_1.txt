Now I am a great animation fan - I love Svankmeyer and usually I am in all stop motion applications, so I had great hopes for this. Then I came to IMDb and stopped --- I'm always a real suspect from movies with a bimodal split of IMDb votes. Here we have another --- a lot of 10s (shill someone) and then some real low. I'm also a suspect of 10s with the word "visionary" in them. Certainly there are visionaries, but this character is not one of them. Despite my concerns, I saw this movie and had to deal with it. The motion stop animation was fine, but the lands were banal, and overall they seemed to be amateurish. Treat yourself to a real deal and get Svankmeyer and let it run on the shelf.
