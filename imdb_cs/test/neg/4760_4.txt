Susan Slept Here it turns out that Dick Powell is a swan song as a performer on the big screen. Of course he directed several other films and appeared frequently on television until he died. It's a pity he didn't get along with his performance in The Bad and The Beautiful. Frank Tashlin made so many better films, I'm still not sure what owned him. The assumption is absolutely ridiculous. Dick Powell is a screenwriter who tries to do more serious things than the fluff he wrote. He had an idea for a film about juvenile delinquency, so two friendly cops at Herb Vigran and Horace McMahon imposed 17-year-old Debbie Reynolds. It's not really a bad kid and they don't want it in the system. They gave it to Dick Powell for Christmas time. <br /> <br /> I think there's someone out there who doesn't see the problem? The term jailbait comes immediately to mind. In addition, Powell has a girlfriend, a young and a sexy Anne Francis. Why Debbie Reynolds is any competition here is out of me. Susan Slept Here he received one Oscar nomination. The song Hold My Hand, sung by Don Cornell in the background, was nominated for Best Song but lost to Secret Love. Powell and Reynolds have some funny moments together, and Alvy Moore like Powell's factotum and Les Tremayne as his lawyer will also get some laughter. But that's not enough.
