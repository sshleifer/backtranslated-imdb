I read about every big Manhattan project book. Most people know what it was, but few people understand the depth and breadth of the project. Its scope was enormously massive - perhaps in the American history, it was only the space program of the 1960s that competed. In many locations (mostly secretly) across the country, each involved in a specific and different aspect of the project that they could not talk to a person sitting in the cabin next to them, much less than their family. Logistics is overwhelming, especially considering the considerations of war communication, security and transport in the 1940s. As an example, my colleague's father was a carpenter who worked for one of the companies that had a contract with the federal government for the Manhattan project. His job was to supervise the crew of about 30 other carpenters who were responsible for producing concrete molds for massive research facilities in Hanford, Washington. That's "all" six days a week for almost two years. These carpenters needed food, housing, sanitary facilities, hospitals and materials as well as Oppenheimer and his crowd at the top of the pyramid. Think about it! That being said, it's just impossible to do justice to a two-hour film. However, in defense of Joff, I would say that they had impossible tasks, especially because they decided to have a diverse multi-graph scenario, more angles, and more characters. What exactly did he think and how could he be so arrogant to think it would work? That's Hollywood, I think. FAT MAN AND LITTLE BOY has so many drawbacks to take a book to name them all. Terrible casting. Terrible (and politically motivated) writing. Bad science. The images of Groves and Oppie are particularly inaccurate and downright ominous. Despite the fact that the script is too obvious a program, STILL is incredibly weak and sloppy. These errors were listed elsewhere on IMDb, but I was particularly hit by the fact that scientists had so much time on their hands - softball, horseback riding, parties, semi-formal dinners, ballet, etc., not to mention romance and, of course, the circulation of political petitions. According to FM&LB, if these big brains were out of their fights and spent some time in the lab instead of seducing Laura Dern, we could have won the war before D-Day. One final gripe - - FM & LB says "Fat Man" and "Little Boy" were code names for two atomic bombs, but they don't mention that these names were semi-good-natured blows at Groves ("Fat Man", for heavy characters) and Oppenheimer ("Little Boy" for his mild figure). Another reason Paul Newman wouldn't be in this movie ...
