AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WHEN DOES STOP STOP? That's what I said somewhere between the start and the second part of the movie that was really sucked. This movie almost ripped my life out and I was sitting in some really bad movies. I come from a real puppet master fan and expect to say it, but it's true. The storyline is unusual, the special effects of scary, the soundtrack of most benawl, infernal tootling I have ever heard. Oh! I almost forgot about acting, it was so bad that I forgot it was there at all, said Nuff. The only redemption factor in the film is the puppets themselves, which are really stars, and could behave completely differently than Guy Rolfe himself (he's a puppeteer), and although you can see their wires and strings they carry me after the painful start of finishing Retro-Puppet Master . Finally, PM7 is recommended for true fanatics who become masochists. Roach <br /> <br />
