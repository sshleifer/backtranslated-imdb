Such a film makes me appreciate the work done by professional actors. I think movie viewers are generally too arguing for professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most inconvenient reasons. Watch the Cheerlader Massacre for a few minutes and believe me, you'll change your minds. Razzie would be almost a compliment for these talentless actors. But then it's Jim Wynorski. Wynorski is a popular director of these ultra-low-budget B-movies (having worked with Roger Corman on many occasions). The problem with this movie is actually trying to develop a conspiracy. And when you have actors who make lines, as if they read letters from their eyes, how do I care? Wynorski's "Bare Wench 2" didn't try to develop a conspiracy. He just tried to make an erotic porn / goofy takeoff on the "Blair Witch Project." It was fun and it was titillating. "Cheerleader Masscare" is no fun. There are a couple of compulsory women nude scenes, but they are few and far away. So it's not even worth enjoying at erotic level. I must say that the worst scene is where Nikki Fritz walks across a bridge that is about to collapse. First, her character didn't have to go over this bridge. Secondly, because the bridge starts to squeak rather than go through it, it just stands there and acts helplessly. And above, we don't actually see the bridge breakdown because the filmmakers did it for a budget of $ 2 !!! Unlike many B-horror movies, this is actually boring. And that's what makes him the worst of all the bad movies. One of the few bright spots was Lunk Johnson, who is probably the most natural actor in the film (though certainly not more than halfway). He was funny in "Bare Wench 2" and had some funny scenes in this movie too.
