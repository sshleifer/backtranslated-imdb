I've seen this movie about 6 or 7 times, and it really gets funnier each time. What I like most is the tired character paradigm that the movie offers us: a dark American-wide male protagonist, his blond girlfriend, a theater nerd with glasses, a brunette girl, an adversary and a brunette # 2. However, we are then introduced with two mullet magician martial arts experts driving a convertible. If anyone can explain it, contact me. Other highlights include Bobby Johnston's Jock, Dell and his trademark line, "That's why I'm holding her." Not surprisingly, while watching Johnston's performance, his career has quickly descended into soft-core porn. (SPOILER) Even after multiple views, I have no idea what the big demon in the end says at every point; it's just electronically muted sounds. Well, that's better. Finally, why are all the demons so slippery? Is wetter skin? It certainly did not help in this film.
