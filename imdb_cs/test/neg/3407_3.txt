I like watching a good bloody giall. Unfortunately, SOLANGE is definitely not one of them. Its long time. Very long. The story is cheap and makes little sense, though it is very obvious. The script spends so much time on murders and girls, but spends almost no time on the killer. This leaves a big hole in the story: we could look at a lot of young women who shower together, but we get a zero characterization of why the killer decided to kill these girls. Yes, what happened to Solange is terrible, but we are still in the dark when, why the boring killer decided it was worth it, those who were angry decided to make he tried to overcome these naughty girls. It's all so fancy that I couldn't get into it a bit. <br /> <br /> It's boring again in terms of film appearance. Nothing unforgettable about it. Actors? Boring. Screenplay? Ridiculously boring. The whole "love" love affair between a teacher, a blonde and a student was really embarrassing. Which planet do they live on? Music? Boring. Skip it.
