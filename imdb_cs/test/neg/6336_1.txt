This film must be one of the historically lowest values ​​of Michael J. Fox's generally recognized career. I should have known how horrible this movie was when I rented it and found that the film was initially seen and not rewound by an earlier tenant. There is never a good sign! Fox plays a grown-up star that is now an agent for other kids in show business. His character is deceptive in that he still believes everyone should love him for being Mikey. His big break comes when he meets Angie Vega, a talented child. Vega is abrasive and unpleasant at all. The only likable character of the film is Cyndi Lauper, who is accentuated by the agency on Brooklyn. One of those movies that makes me keep a post-it note in the box warning others to not waste time!
