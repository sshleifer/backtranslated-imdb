The film is based on Jacqueline Susann's best-selling novel. It's about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law), a ruthless TV berth that sneaks to the top. He describes in detail his love life for Amanda (Jodi Wexler) and Judith (Dyan Cannon). It also shows his overall inability to commit to anyone and instead sleeps with any woman he can get. The novel is not a work of art (it's not even good literature), but it's a quick, stupid, kitschy read. But this movie looks like "Gone With the Wind"! This is a textbook example of how NOT to make a film adaptation. First, they condense the novel terribly. In Stone, there is an inability to commit, and why is revealed. Here it is brought up ... and ignored. There is also a really rebellious scene in which a woman is brutally beaten. It's in the book - but that's the reason that was completely left out of the movie. And the book dealt with three women - not two. Don't even understand me about homophobia. The gameplay adaptation is pretty awful. The law is just as horrible as Stone - VERY Wooden and Boring - you are seriously wondering why all these women are after it. To be fair to the right - another actor was cast but had a very bad accident before the shooting and the law entered the last minute. Wexler is terrible as Amanda; Maureen Arthur is really incredibly bad as Ethel Evans; Shecky Greene is unbearable as Christie Lane. Only three performances will be highlighted: David Hemmings (with Eternal Time) camping as a gay photographer; Cannon is actually very good and Robert Ryan is just great. Also Dionne Warwick sings a catchy opening song ("He's Moving"). It's bad, but I watched the whole thing and it's (in a stupid way) a lot of fun. I give it 3. <br /> <br /> Also Jacqueline Susann has a portrait as a journalist.
