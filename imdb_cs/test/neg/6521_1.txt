This film is by far the worst movie ever, the story is weak and never shows what happens to people after 20 were left in the hands. That really beats me. It goes on and on with some sense, very boring. The only good thing was casting, WOW, lots of great actors and actresses in it. But besides being terrible, terrible and repulsive, do yourself a favor, don't look at it. <br /> <br /> I gave him 1 out of 10
