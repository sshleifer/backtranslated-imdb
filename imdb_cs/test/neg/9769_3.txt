I'll be generous here and I'll only give it 3 because I live in Huntsville and it was great to see how well the city was filmed. That means this movie was pretty bad. It is as if it had just begun with a script and the director had just told the actors to look at each other meaningfully with a lot of music. And Billy D. Williams seemed to be anywhere else than in this movie. It's just a mess. I think I could write a script better than disloge for this movie, and I'm not a writer. There is one thing I have seen mentioned in reviews and reports - everyone is under the impression that the film begins around World War II and actually looked more like it was supposed to be beginning in the late 1950s / early 1960s. While the army was not segregated, I am sure the soldiers waiting to board the train will still be separated on site, such as Huntsville, Al. If the film was to be in the early 1940s, then Billy D, Lesley Ann & Rae Dawn would have to be in the 1970s and 1980s instead of their mid 50s or early 60s. Don't waste your time if really, really like actors because the story isn't very interesting.
