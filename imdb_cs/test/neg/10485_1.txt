This cheap and trash movie is about a NASA test rocket that is sent to space with a cargo of animals. It vanishes for a moment, then returns unexpectedly, crashing a landing in the forest and emitting a sinister mutant creature. Like many other films of this type, Night Fright presents silly teenagers boogieing up to the 1960s. to be killed. But none of the murders is remotely remembered because we don't see anything. One thing we see, though, is that one of the teenagers seems to be about 40 years old and the sport is quite an impressive stupid hairstyle. <br /> <br /> In order for a creature to function, it must really present its monster correctly to the viewer. However, in this film we only get the shortest views of the monster. It looks like it resembles an alien from Robot Monster. But I'm not sure; because the photo was so dark, I just couldn't figure out what the hell was going on. Even though I felt like I wasn't missing too much.
