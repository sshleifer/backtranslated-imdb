The beginning of a voice through sounds like "The Wind" could be quite an interesting movie, but as the story unfolded, I knew it was downhill. The main things about this film that blew were terribly bad acting works all the main characters did, (except for a few scenes involving the inner confusion of Mic), there was a complete lack of character development and absolutely no point to the plot - What did the writers think? Michael Mongillo won 2 'horror prizes / sci fi' for 'The Wind'. HUH? What was so scary about the movie? NOTHING! With the exception of resident 2 bad video footage, the rest was rather "crafted for t.v thriller" - nor would it be edited. If you want a much better film about "murder among landlords," it should instead become a "shallow grave." <br /> <br /> 'The Wind' * / *****
