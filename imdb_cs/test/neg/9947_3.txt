Seymour Cassel gives a great performance, tour de force. His work as a supposed washed-out Duke Slusarski beach well will always have a place in my heart. The film is centered around a nerd who has just come to the beach in the hope of honoring his dead brother's dreams. What he gets is lame surfing hijinks. Guys are cheating, guys are fighting and guys are getting drunk and watching surf documents with the whole LA city on Friday night. Duke marries a nerd and tries to teach him how to play volleyball as a woman. Next time, when my wife comes back, I'll pretend to be watching the ball. Back to Seymour Cassel. The end of the film becomes a good drama, as the first half of the film made no sense. Duke plays a great volleyball game, the best he has played for over a decade. The way the scene is shot is beautiful. You can feel the heart that this man has for the game and the love of being on the beach. The five minutes will go down as one of my favorite times. 3/10 Bad to Fair, the rest of the movie was lame.
