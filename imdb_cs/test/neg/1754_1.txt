Another tiring hole from Anthony Minghell, who seems to be thriving on these big inflated superproductions, lasting more than two and a half hours to do what a reasonable filmmaker would do in ninety minutes. The Inman Stories Center (somnambulent Jude Law), who goes to the Civil War, just barely started romance with Nicole Kidman, the Preacher's Daughter, who recently came to a nicely photographed town. The story goes between Inman's trials and tribulations at war (which is, guess what boys and girls? HELL!) And Kidman's trials and tribulations at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring). Renee Zellwegger appeared at Kidman's Farm to help Kidman get back into shape after Kidman's daddy dies of an uncomfortable character disorder. Zellwegger behaves in this Granny Clampett in such a way that he releases enough Tough Love and Homespun of Wisdom to turn the stomach of Touched An Angela's hardest observers. This movie is, simply, unbearable. Avoid it as a big bloated Oscar-bait Bogus Pretentious literary adaptation nonsense that is.
