This movie is terrible beyond faith. It's a low-budget, poorly written piece of garbage. But Saturday afternoon I stumbled over it on TV still holding in my mind as one of the funniest I've ever spent in front of the TV. The badness of this movie is epic - maybe not Ed Wood, but close. The assumption is hysterical (men are forbidden to be too dangerous and imprisoned - football stadiums), pseudo-dyke culture is ridiculously bizarre (there's an underground women's shop that dresses like men to serve deviants) ") and" the last man of the title is the pitiful reincarnation of Rocky from the Rocky Horror Picture Show. I couldn't see the end that I must assume is the dripping drip "what did we all learn?" nonsense that would bring the urge to brush teeth, but everything in the first two thirds was so remarkably bad, although the last third proved to be a pale imitation of the rest, it is still appropriate for anyone who gets a kick off campa, stupid, headless science fiction B-flicks.
