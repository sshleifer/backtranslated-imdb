I don't understand jokes. I believe it is my problem with modern cinema or with films that are made with millions of dollars in the hope of becoming the next biggest feeling. Isn't it strange? people just don't laugh so much, and I believe one of the diseases to this problem is the movie "Showtime". There was nothing at all from the beginning to the end of the credits, with all the crickets, and even the standard clichés, that caused the general population to disappear with programmed laughter between Murphy and De Niro, Russ as a feast for the eyes. nothing in this movie that made me laugh. There were no breakthrough physical jokes or calculated mental vocals in this film debacle. From the beginning I did not buy De Niro and Murphy's match as anything more than Hollywood excitement, during the commentary does the director talk vividly about hijinks and laughter that happens during filming? where was the movie? Does that fall into two problems? the director doesn't really have a sense of comedy or the editor didn't understand the value of the movie. Either way, they both condemned an hour and a half spent on the Hollywood nightmare "Showtime". Beyond finding any reason to laugh, there was no reason for these characters to follow the film every moment. There was humor with the desire of De Niro to pick up the pottery as a hobby (but the director had to write KILN on the machine to make the audience understand who did it?), But it was dropped and never developed. There was a thought that Murphy was an actor, but besides that one opening monologue, no one would understand. Does he rent a room in a producer's house where he can afford a police officer's salary? This was not even for Hollywood standards. Was there a bad man who wanted a big gun, but the weapon was never developed, nor was there any real weapon test? even at the end. It has become a bigger joke to make a laugh accent than to remember weapons. Where was the TV show? Russo had to get permission from this random boy at the beginning, but there were no consequences. In the middle of this film there was nothing more than other questions and meaningless dribbling. Random characters were introduced, forgotten, reintroduced and forgotten again. The director and producer laughed at it, while we, poor viewers, have to suffer from inner jokes and cliché stereotypes. Was he interested in love in this film? Was there really a sinister evil guy who broke away from a comic duo to bring real evil to the screen? Were there any references to pop culture that didn't return to Robert De Niro? Was there random chaos in this movie? If you need answers to these questions, of course, you won't find them in "Showtime". The fact that I am arguing this question with the question only means that this sub-paragraph (in fact, far below the subchapter) did not fill in any quota or resemble anything of value to the film world. Sure, she had big names and one really clean explosion. It was almost as if the director had said before he fired that he wanted a cliché, but not a regular cliché? go wrong. The plot did not have a linear structure. The jokes were boring. The characters were drab and underdeveloped. This files under even the best of "buddies" movies. I like to give movies the advantage of doubt, but nothing worked in this movie. Even Shatner could not save the film and even tried hard. <br /> <br /> Overall, I can't, nor will I, propose this movie to anyone with a pulse. The commentary merely confirms the pathetic nature of the film with apparent defects, horrific jokes and creators questioning the validity of their work. If creators can't stand for "Showtime", why should we? When I watched it, I didn't want a "deadly weapon", but I wanted something like that. I understand that there was some form of criticism of "television reality" and the corrupt nature of the media, but the news didn't come out of it. In fact, I think I saw the "media" leave the theater when I watched it. Shame carries his heavy hand with this film and I can't blame it. Murphy used to be a big star, comedy was his middle name (see "Coming to America"), but lately it seems to have lost its edge. Of course, De Niro wishes to get out of the picture that haunts him, but to make such films just push him back. One of these films equals one Scorsese. <br /> <br /> Skip this. I promise your last movie days are worth it. Oh, and if you laughed at some joke in this movie? I'm really sorry! <br /> <br /> Class: * outside *****
