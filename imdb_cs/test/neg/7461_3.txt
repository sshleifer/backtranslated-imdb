Mostly I am not the kind of person who would give the film less than 5 points. Mostly just for the efforts of actors and directors. 3/10 for Keyman from me. If someone thinks the main character (or anyone) deserves an Oscar, I deserve the Nobel Peace Prize. <br /> <br /> Seriously. I can't believe this movie came to Europe. Acting was terrible, the conspiracy was terrible and what horrible music of the 70s. Give me a break. <br /> <br /> "Popeye" eg What about him? Why he's there has nothing to do with film. And what Keyman is talking about. One day he can't say a decent word the next time he gets all the talcs. He also almost dies when he wakes up and his sunlight shines through his bunker. But when she walks down the street, the sun doesn't seem to do anything. Watch this movie only on the edge of boredom dying. I regret not seeing how my roses grow, which in any case is more fun than this one ...
