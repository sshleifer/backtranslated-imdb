When I first saw this movie twenty years after its release, I don't have enough. Why was it such a huge hit in 1986? His amateur drop drips from every scene. Jokes are lame and predictable. The sex scenes are exploitative and upstairs (that doesn't mean Miss Rudnik doesn't have nice breasts!). Singing is "schrecklich". The only really funny scene is the big filming when the gangsters stop dancing, a feature that makes the film filming until the mid-1980s. It is quite mysterious for me how incapable of understanding what caused the enthusiasm of encouraging viewers in 1986 (and probably still today when I read my colleagues' comments).
