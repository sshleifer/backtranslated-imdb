This movie has good intentions, at least in the report "Don't worry, no matter how hard it may be. Fear will kill you at the end" It's good news, but the container is so flawed that the message gets confused by bad behavior, a complete lack trust in feelings, a dialogue that is delivered as if it was loudly recorded, stereotypes instead of breathing, by living people. <br /> <br /> Abuses effects such as slowing motion to compensate for the total lack of credibility in acting and hence the lack of emotional strength ... <br /> <br /> The suicide part still reminds me of a low budget movie from the 1990s, when lesbians seemed (at least to celluloid) to have a complete inability to live a good life, a happy life, and a tendency to seize into the worst dramas that often included separation, death, or prison. Focusing on the rewards of living life as we feel it (and not how others think we should live), it would be less dramatic, more inspiring. But that does not mean that it focuses on pain, loss and leaves a message only on the theoretical ideal. I don't see how this film can be an inspiration for anyone who could come or overcome fear and rejection. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a really good movie that talks about overcoming fear and courage to live what you feel, go back to the beautiful desert desert (even better: read the novel!)
