About one step above the film of Olsen's twins, there is a surprise here in the store, besides how repulsive, inflated, Depardieu looks as though he is walking across the beach without a shirt. This guy was supposed to be a heart? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, whatever. Katherine Heigl is a great actress whose career over the past few years has shown her potential as a comedic and dramatic actress, but this film has definitely done nothing to offer her a role. Her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self-esteem, spends her entire vacation and crushes a cute boy who thinks he's the greatest guy in the world (basically because he's a cute boy) but can't be honest with him seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something. If there's really a guy in you, he won't breathe because you tried to pass on your father as a friend. Maybe he's a little confused as to why you're doing something so stupid, inventive and um ... cruel, but in the end it'll be something you'll laugh about. The storyline and dialogue hits every wedge directly on the cue. No originality and no joke ... but it's rilly, Rilly SWEET and Ben's rilly, so cute, so viewers who think Titanic is the biggest movie he ever made will, of course, say this movie is great because they don't notice it's not having a brain in their heads. One star.
