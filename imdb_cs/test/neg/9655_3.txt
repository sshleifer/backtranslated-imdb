This movie is definitely weird. The basic plot is 3 old business companions invite 2 aliens to their home for the return of the lost wallet with $ 10 in it. Two who fall in love fall in love. Three older business men are dying and returning as ghosts to help two younger guests. Okay, so it might make sense, but then we have 3 old boys who seem to have some bread living together ... slightly weird here ... sting. I mean, I think I can handle it. Then there's Richard Carlson playing James Houston from Texas .... hmmmmm, Sounds more like a gentleman from Kentucky than a guy from Texas. This one isn't so close. Then we take 3 spirits that would be more likely to help New Orleans Saints win the play-off game than actually help ... In fact, they don't really help and why they are even in the movie is beyond any knowledge range. in which the cast of characters behaves completely out of character .. You can avoid it.
