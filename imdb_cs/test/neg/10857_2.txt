This movie is a juxtaposition of various super bad hard guys characters, loosely linked, but without a real story. Some scenes are nicely filmed. If they took the same cast and crew and made a movie called Ghent, which was the most amazing character in the film and came up with an interesting and continuous story, it might be decent. As it is, get ready for a lame line of tough intros guys, all of whom do nothing but ride a bike around the desert all day long and cause trouble while everyone remains tanned and keep their hair and clothing perfect and never need Look for a home or money, etc. There was a kind of background story about characters around different people who were killed and a treasure that was probably supposed to be a conspiracy.
