Although I could sum up this pathetic episode of Night Gallery with two words, these two words are "horse manure", I have to write at least ten lines. This is a very sophomoric episode, not worthy of the standards of Rod Serling, but rather a clumsy attempt at some sort of ironic black comedy. The assumption of giant rodents who inhabit the moon, lifeless, is certainly absolutely ridiculous, as is the construction of a giant mousetrap. I suppose we should also assume that the moon is made of green cheese, and so these absurd creatures will survive. I can only assume that this episode was presented as a fill to replace the other two episodes that were broadcast that day. All in all, wasting film, actors and air.
