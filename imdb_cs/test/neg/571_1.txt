** Maybe Spoilers ** From Dreamworks and director Peter Chan, "The Love Letter" is a romantic comedy set in a picturesque, new coastal village in New England where Helen's own mother (Kate Capshaw) owns a quaint little bookstore. One day at work, Helen becomes over an anonymous letter (the "love letter" of the title), which somehow got under the cushions of the sofa. After reading the love story, she believes it has been written to her, deliberately placed on the couch to find her, and for her own reasons she thinks she knows the identity of her secret admirer. But inadvertently Helen leaves a letter where her employee, Janet (Ellen DeGeneres) finds her, believes it is for her, and of course she thinks she knows who wrote it. The circumstances then bring it to a young man named Johnny (Tom Everett Scott) who thinks Helen wrote the letter. And before all this is solved, you can only imagine the cheerful situations in which all the participants have been cast; and I think, because the way this movie plays, viewers get more out of it than what it brings. There are two specific areas in which this romantic comedy fails: It's not just romantic and it's not funny; and this is a powerful combination that will make this film virtually out of the opening credits. Once the settings and main character (Helen) have been set, it basically goes nowhere for another ninety minutes or so. Before you finally know who actually wrote the letter and to whom, you can take less care of it. The cast is Tom Selleck, Blythe Danner, Julianne Nicholson, Gloria Stuart and Geraldine McEwan. It is a shame to see that such a talent is wasted on such a flint as this one, and looks bad in balance. Kate Capshaw, who usually brightens the screen just by appearing, looks tired here, while Selleck seems to have just lost a three-day bender that lasted for a week. Ellen DeGeneres is actually leaving and looking for the best of the bunch. It is said that the journey is often heavier than the destination. However, in the case of "The Love Letter", it would be best for everyone involved if everyone were to abstain. I rate it 1/10.
