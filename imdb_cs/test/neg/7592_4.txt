"House of the Damned" (also known as "Specter") is one of your low budget haunted house horror flicks, full of average performances and cheap effects. It is a family that inherited an old Irish chateau, and after moving it began to experience a strange phenomenon and ghosts, including the spirit of a young girl who was murdered and buried in the wall of the castle basement. The couple's young daughter is then taken to another dimension and seek help from a group of paranormal investigators for help. The ideas that this film borrowed from the 1982 film "Haunted House" are obvious. I'm going to say that this movie has some slightly spooky sequences, but sometimes it's very boring. There's nothing special about that, the mood is fine, the score (which was mostly this dramatic Irish opera music) was somewhat annoying and CGI special effects are really terrible. It was in 1996, you think they could do it a little better than they did. The end where the house was on fire was the poorest special effect I saw, very cheap. But look, it was a cheap movie. Also the translucent monster wolf their daughter sees looks terribly false. And what was it in the movie? What the hell does a wolf monster have in common with a haunted house? Special effects here are what this movie really destroyed. Also, acting was bad enough. I usually like many low budget horror movies, but not this. "House of the Damned" is nothing special at all, just think if you don't. But you'll probably want to pass it on. 4/10.
