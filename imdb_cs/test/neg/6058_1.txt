I don't know how expensive it was to create this movie, but the effects were terrible. Half of the film was filmed on stage in front of the movie screen (it is certain that the blue frame will not look so artificial). As they traveled on the ship, the background screen moved like a wave motion, but the figures did not move. CGI effects: horrible (I'm not sure but I think the effect was created with Paint and made GIF sequences from them - the next time the creators should hire a professional CGI creative team). The CGI creator seems to draw a picture strip with shaking hands. Terrible, that's for sure. When I first saw the trailer, I thought it was created in 1983. One of my friends told me the correct date: 2005. My jaw dropped, I was so shocked, I thought he was kidding. People, I suggest you skip this movie, the story is also twisted, you won't enjoy it.
