I attended the premiere last night. The film began with a bang (possibly due to pre-premier excitement). The audience laughed for about 15 minutes, then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting the sleep. This movie cannot be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any guest work, unless you say _Sons of Provo_ is a desire to be gone terribly wrong. He just fell, died, it was painful. The story went nowhere, jokes were bland, even though you were Mormon and you could get all the inner jokes, it was like a waste of time. There were two redeeming qualities: Kirby's acting was in place! And the songs were very clever (LDS viewers only). So, my recommendation ... Avoid the movie. And if you're Mormon, buy a music CD.
