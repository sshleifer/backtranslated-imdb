Val Kilmer is almost nowhere in this movie - unhappy for him! It plays about 30 seconds of screen and its role is completely irrelevant. After watching the movie I couldn't tell you what role she plays in the movie !! OK ... in the first hour, they're sucking you into the dark underground tunnels. Scary films shot in dark underground tunnels easily suck in most people to last the first 30 minutes to an hour. Then you start to think, "Why did I follow it?" I remember how easy it must be for a director / writer to use dark underground labyrinths to create a film. Simply film people traveling in dark tunnels and have instant "tension". But this is where this movie goes on! We are all wondering what's going to happen at night, but there's nothing in the darkness of this movie, but more darkness. The story is even worse. Apparently there is a basic story to the movie that I learned about "after" watching the movie. But the film uses such bad dialouge that it never met clearly during the screening. I still don't understand what the writer / director wanted to say. Some children trapped in Russia underground? Why? Are they in our time - just like characters? Are they ghosts? That was a horrible movie that led me to write the first IMDb review to warn others to avoid it.
