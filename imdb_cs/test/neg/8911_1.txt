Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who talks to the armored car driving for a bank that holds on to whatever goes through his way. However, the police appear to be appearing very quickly on the scene, and Seagal smells of rats who have given the police a notice in advance. The story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the holder has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner. Poor Seagal gets a little framed into this hold and naturally is out looking for a person or person who is trying to put him off for a long time. In this film, Seagal tries to be a good guy, but the forces of evil are against him. Unfortunately this is not a great movie and rather boring and too long.
