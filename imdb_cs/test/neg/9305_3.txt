I know that everyone said this movie is totally stupid and I agree with them. I spent a few years after I saw it telling other people that it was stupid. I recommended not to see it. But when it came on TV, we saw the ad. I turned to the family and said, "I know it's sad, but I think I'm watching it." The nurse turned to me and said, "Yeah, me too." And you know what? It was funny. It is by no means a good movie. It's a waste of time. But it's a good waste of time. You may still think it's stupid and fair, but I thought it was a really funny comedy. I didn't like a few pieces like a fish hit a car, but besides, I thought it was good. I loved to sit there and choose all the famous Australian faces: Flacco, Elle McFeast, Garry McDonald, etc. <br /> <br /> If you want to waste time, watch this movie. Otherwise, look at the drama or something.
