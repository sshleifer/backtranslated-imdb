I first saw it when it came out in the theater. Though only 13 at the time, I was a passionate reader of "hard science" science fiction stories. The technical gaffes of the film are burned into my memory. <br /> <br /> Some of the following may have significant spoilers. Even as a young man, I knew the assumption was stupid. The rocket launches on a lunar mission, in space, where there is always a gravitational effect on the crew (even though free objects float as in zero gravity) and because of that "cabin" (a control area, no matter what happens) called it. ) was gyrostabalized to maintain a "correct" orientation (so that when they landed, why did they land on their heads?) and where, at least in near-ground space, rocket engines had to run continuously - with fuel firing without an oxidizer. When the engines were over, the rocket stopped in space and could not begin until the PhD doctor showed that it was needed in a small oxidizer. This time the rocket remembered that it had momentum, and another thing that our heroes know is near Mars (even a 13-year-old nerd knew that such a minimum energy trip would take more than 200 days). Landed, they find that the air was breathable (though scientific data at that time showed that the pressure, even if the atmosphere was pure oxygen, would be too low to be good). They decide to camp outside the ship and even build a campfire. They come armed, even though they reportedly went to the moon where they didn't need firearms. They get a glimpse of the collapsed civilization, encounter stray martians who look like humans, develop against the philosophy of nuclear war, and try to get back to the home planet for those who survive, and die while trying to crash on Earth! This would require such a long period of circulation that they would starve long before they approached the target. The film that preceded it, Destination Moon, used real science as effectively as possible (even if it is their "rescue") with an oxygen tank forgetting the moment hand from the tank's center of gravity to the output nozzle. Ignoring even the most basic sciences, only the most advanced illiterates should imagine it as a sci-fi movie: it's on the same level as the old Flash Gordon series, where their rocket ships flew off their belly and climbed into spirals, and their engines were always on . <br /> <Br /> I thought this story was trivial and I can only recommend it as a film that will be shown to students to choose technical gaffes.
