This movie was really bad. They didn't even watch it first. Half of the film was created and it was more about a representative whose mother was one of Ed Gein's victims. Acting was horrible except for a guy playing Ed Gein, but his hard to mess with playing a weird guy. Although I think it was horrible, I gave it three because it started with real crimes photos. it was the best part of the movie. Once the movie was finished, the film went downhill. The writer of this film tried to taste it, but it didn't have to be. Ed Gein's story is quite interesting without falsifying information.
