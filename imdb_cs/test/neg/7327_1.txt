Studying at BAD. Bad Direction, Bad Gaming, Bad Writing, and f / x that will teach you that you would upgrade your computer before filming. It's the kind of movie you made in your basement drunk with your dad's camera when you were young in your heart. But you wouldn't show it in public when you're sober again, would you? You wouldn't even see it. Avoid at any cost.
