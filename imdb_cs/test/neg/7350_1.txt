Free Willzyx (Stupidest name / title ever) is the worst episode of ANY of the TV shows I watch, including X-Files, Aliases, All 3 Laws and Orders, All CSI, Family Guy, Simpsons, Chappelle's Show, Colbert Report and more. South Park was my favorite comedy show for a long time because it is a shocking obscene content and a distracting black comedy. Free Willzyk NONE content I mentioned earlier. It was so tame, so unofficial it could have been well was the episode of Sesame Street. Kyle goes to Sea World, where several workers play a joke, so he thinks a whale is talking to him. WILL BE PUBLISHING WHOLESALE, actually BEFRIEND IT. Hi? This is South Park! the same show that brought you "Canceled", "Chickenlover", "Hits The Fan", "Death Camp Of Tolerance" and much more! No SpongeBob SquarePants! Ugh. I actually watched the whole episode, which is 30 minutes of my life. Anyway, I was extremely disgusted with this episode and I can't believe that the shocking decline in Matt & Trey's work quality is.
