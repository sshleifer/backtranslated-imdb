I adore Hedy Lamarr. I think she was extremely underestimated as an actress during the 1940s. At that time, Nastassja Kinski was not taken seriously by critics. After all, that ... this movie is BORE. When I first saw it, I was shocked by the lack of continuity, not only in the story but also in makeup and costumes. Hedy's makeup changes from shot to shot. Like hair length and style. Reason: This thing had so many writers and it took so many stops and starts to be amazing. Her "Lady of the Tropics" began filming after this started, but it was released before "I Take This Woman." In fact, at the time, it was known in Hollywood as "I re-take this woman." It should tell you something. I'm also a Spencer Tracy fan, but there's AWFUL. I have read in various film history that he totally disdained Hedy Lamarr, and that looks absolutely obvious on the film. No chemistry. The story wanders around the reel and finally just strangely stops. I can't recommend this at all.
