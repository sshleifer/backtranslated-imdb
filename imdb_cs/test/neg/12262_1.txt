This movie could be great, but it wasn't. Some of the talented hopeful enthusiasts and friends of filmmakers who wanted to help are some mild miracles of talent. The main star of the film plays a major role. He is convincing and has those scary Italian eyes. However, he is associated with the worst rejection of actors anyone ever encountered. The opening scenes of the film are among the worst and most embarrassing. Looks like Gay Porn. Fortunately, no one has withdrawn. The rape scene still mentioned is waste. Prison succession was the best part of the film - though insignificant. The movie soundtrack (if you can call it) sounds like teenage boys who first tried to use coldit and some sample CDs. It's boring, repetitive and extremely lame. In fact, the whole movie is lame. Get out if you can still!
