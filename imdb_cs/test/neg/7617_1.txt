I was a fan of Jim Henson and his characters from the beginning. Most of all, love, innocence, and friendship. Kermit was a model of deep thought and problem solving. Spiritual character, yet sweet and credible. All the other characters were somewhat eccentric, but showed how different kinds of beings can coexist, respecting their difference. The following films kept the same atmosphere somewhat. Yet "It's a Very Merry Muppet Christmas Movie" would make Jim Henson spin in his grave. These characters were completely rewritten to be horny, ugly, selfish, and curvy. The cast continues to portray God as an unimaginable corporate head, with an average smudge. Angels as soulless, spiritual corporate staff and film was so bad that I had to stop watching. I bought it for my great nephew, but fortunately I looked at anything I give the baby. Instead, this film has earned baskets and has no socially redeemable content or magic. Shame, shame on people who re-wrote characters and left Jim Henson's original heart-centered, socially conscious version. It is a terrible diservice for a great man who is no longer able to defend his creations.
