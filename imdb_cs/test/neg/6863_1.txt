I would be one of the few people to own a copy of this classic. But I dont just own 1, actually own 2. Its good. Well, when I say well, I mean wrong. But I'll try to do a thorough check. I even watched a ninja born, one of the other reviewers compared to it. And born ninja is actually worse, but not so funny. And it's sometimes funny. Everything about this movie is bad. ALL. The plot is completely stuffed (note that you will have to keep me alive if you want to know where to find your wife). EVERY ACTION sequence is also full. Our hero is more than just a hero; can stab people with twigs, take 3 bullets into the heart at a distance of 50 cm without even bleeding, and tie the rope to a tree that, when the enemy enters it, connects the knot around the enemy's foot, picks it up, and throws it 50 meters into the game spikes. The deal is so bad that it is impossible to comment on it, but it should be rolling, especially a jump of dantons from the ground and growling at the evil guy. Oh yes, and the bad guys: somehow, he seems to resurrect five times in the film. Maybe it's just that there weren't enough actors, but in the movie of this caliber? I doubt it. 'The storyline' is about how danton was a soldier in the Vietnam War, and now his colonel is hunting real people for training his mercenaries. The colonel just happens to pick up the danton, then the danton returns. This is just an excuse for the Rambo clone, with most of the film being danton killing soldiers. And I really can't explain the plot more because there is nothing else to film. Still rocks. <br /> <br /> What else could be asked? Don't get me. Hand grenades that actually hit the actors' feet because the blast is the size of the match. \ TScenes where 5 people chase danton, then the camera cuts and back and there are 7. The way that every time danton loads the grenade launcher is against the same background, i when it is in completely different locations. And worst of all, danton shifts the plastic boulders to enemies, and one enemy is totally untouched by the boulders, so he doesn't know what to do, so half the heart dies without touching him. It's ridiculous !!! But funny. Very, very fun. This is one of the few movies I can thoroughly recommend to anyone because if you dont find it funny, you have 1 in a million. And for the rest of us, it's magic.
