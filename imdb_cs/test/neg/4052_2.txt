My friends and I have just seen a preview of this new Australian movie. Anyone who was in the cinema agreed what was the meaning of this movie? It was not a good story, the characters were undeveloped, and the plot seemed unmotivated. I find it bizarre that this film, which is probably in high millions, is funded and made. It makes no sense for the theater community, adding nothing to the range of Australian cinema. It was really a waste of time to create this dramatic unemployed piece of work and more time to spend on scripts for shopping and creating good stories without creating such a mess. Hugo Weaving and Rose Byrne were all right, but they made it hard for them to make a bad script. Pia Miranda's character was unnecessary and abstract from the plot, and her lines were on average at best. Real waste of talent. Geoffrey Simpson's cinematography, ACS, was a remarkable grace, which was, like most Aussie films, excellent. Come to the boys, think about it next time. <br/> <br/> 4/10
