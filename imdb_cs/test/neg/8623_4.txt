George Sluizer's remake of his own - the superior - film is a waste of time. Why did it even try? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who has only a small amount of screen time) is kidnapped at a Barney Cousins ​​gas station (Jeff Bridges). Barney is now portrayed as the kind of guy nobody trusts on Sunday - he's like a Frankenstein Monster, but without sympathy and Bridges' acting is absolutely awful. Sutherland gets a little better when his character turns his detective with the new love interest of Rita Baker (Nancy Travis). The main problem with this version of "Consolation" is its apparent need to satisfy Hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak end of the original film. Here, the end is happy, which seems to be forced and incredible and completely destroys the story. But by this time the damage has happened, because Jeff Bridges turns a bad guy into a huge laugh.
