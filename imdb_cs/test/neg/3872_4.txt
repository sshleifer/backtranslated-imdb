B. Kennedy tried to make a continuation of exaggeration and intensification of the gargantuan left-wing western (not as left-wing as the Kennedy sequel that came after that). This is the ugliest movie of two sequels - very ugly. It's slapdash. B. Kennedy got stronger, but without genius. Hundreds of peons, hundreds of Mexican _computers, hundreds of women, desert, barren landscape, storms - the largest scale. Everything in this clumsy sequel, sympathetic only in a strange way, is false. The film itself is very ugly. Brynner, who was the best on the first film, doesn't look good at all. Rey plays the priest; he will be the political leader, Quintero, in the next sequel to the series. It is true that if you have many characters, you do not need a very interesting story; sometimes. For example, Brynner meets McQueen; then select other 'compadres'; or B. Spencer meets Coburn; etc. It's fun to see where and how they meet the rest of the crew, etc .. But you need at least these few characters. Unfortunately, Burt Kennedy's installment is not very good. The Return of Seven (1966) begins with a bullfight. Vin and Chris meet there; they decide to rescue the third survivor of the original Magnificent Chico, which belongs to a vast group of 300 peons kidnapped by Mexican bandits. We'll find out the name of Chi's attractive wife - it's Petra. Chris must recreate a small army? and here is Dirty Dozen Treatment? Chris chooses his men from the convicts. Another member of the commando is a woman who will take good care of the women who will remain married. Sexual humor is particularly dissatisfied and disgusting in this film. They try to look smart and spicy; It is simply boorish and stupid and rude. The election of a small army was one of the greatest joys in McQueen. Unfortunately, the first sequel is the most inimitable of the three crews gathered under the name Magnificent Seven. Robert Fuller makes a lousy "Vin", Oates is a smiley womanizer. <br /> <In this fake attempt, the Mexican revolutionary has a leading plan - carrying 300 peons and using it to build a village and a church in the memory of his lost sons. (It is pointless to say that this mad Mexican revolutionary does not equal Wallach's part in the first film.) Huge battle between emancipated peony and revolutionary vaqueros. Of course, The Return of Seven (1966) completely abandoned the good meaning of McQueen. What's particularly shocking is that this sequel came quite quickly after the original movie? a way of making westerns. <br /> <br /> Both sequels look weird.
