This is by far the most pathetic movie Indian cinema or some cinema has come with.it is completely a piece of crap. The story line does not discourage any water. It is shameful that such a respectful actor collapsed to such a low level that he made such a shameful movie. the little respect he had is forever lost. he had long since retired instead of making himself mad and losing all self-esteem. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. I would also suggest that Amitabh should retire. I wonder how IMDb gave this movie some recommendations. there are no films so horrible that recommendations can be made. seeing such movies as Devdas in the same line as this movie makes serious injustice to a decent movie. his overall I could say shameless.
