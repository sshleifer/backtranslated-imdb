"Do you have any beans? The beans are good. You just eat them and you go." I couldn't help but laugh at the dialogue. Beans are musical fruit, you know. The more you eat, the more you will toot, toot, toot. Hmmmm ... OK, I can understand why the actors were in it because they needed payouts to pay their bills, but I'm not sure what the director and writer's intentions are. Even after watching documentaries in DVD add-ons. I saw him in other films much better than this one. What this film would greatly improve was to throw everything out, keep the Rooker and make another entry into "The Substitute" instead. Rooker would do for a great substitute teacher who would instruct the naughty and morally affected youth in terms of the mistake in their ways and how they could become more useful and productive members of society. Casper, you really shouldn't be just pushing through the undergrowth like you could get poison oak. Oops. Does not matter. I think poisonous oak is the least of your worries. Well, at least this time your cruising didn't become a giant python tail. There are few things that are more embarrassing than when a giant snake sweeps through his chest. At least the death scene in this movie had a little more dignity to it. As well as the more liberal smudge of karo syrup and red food dye. Nothing says sad and tragic death like liberal use of karo and red dye! <br /> <br /> I first saw a monster wearing a shiny silk cloak with a ruff fur collar. For the first time, everything. Just to be nitpicky if it was an Indian spirit, how come it looked like a monster of European culture and folklore? Wouldn't the monster be more kind of indianish? Although I look at it all the way to the end of the credits, I do not realistically believe that I could in good faith recommend to others.
