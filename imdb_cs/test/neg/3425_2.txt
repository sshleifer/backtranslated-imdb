An interesting concept turned into bloodshed ... <br /> <br /> My first feature from Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper), When I was interested for the first time, it seemed like an interesting concept at the time ... Shakespere + Aussie Film + Gothic Environment + Melbourne Gangland <br /> <br /> A very strange mixed that turned into a disastrous piece of Aussie cinema that gives my country a bad name ... <br Pros: -Basic concept <br /> <br /> Cons: -Waste from a good cast -Burned and stupid plot -Closed camera angle -To many different places -Crap usage Shakespearian diologist <br /> < br /> Overall: Australia's Worst Attempt at Shakespere's Film, Keep Baz Lurhman ... or Romper Stomper (WARNING: The Movie is Dangerous)
