Being a huge fan of Laura Gemser, I took it in a rental shop just to see another Emanuelle movie. Boy, I made a mistake! <br /> <br /> EMANUELLE The EGYPT has nothing to do with Emanuelle. Laura Gemser is with her husband Gabriele Tinti, but that's the only connection with Emanuelle. Here Laura plays "Laura" (original, huh?) A beautiful supermodel who goes to visit her rich friend Pia (Annie Belle) in Egypt. Her photographer ** Carlo (looking Gabriele Tinti) and some blonde woman who is never named is in tow. Living also in Pia's mansion is Horatio (a sexy but stupid Al Cliver), a mystic who speaks only nonsense. Two daughters, one short-haired lesbian and one brunette, are coming for the weekend. Lots of sex is implied, but hardly shown. One handsome actor plays Ali, an Egyptian servant who is lucky with three women in a mansion. Laura has sex with a lesbian, lesbian has sex with Horatio, Pia and blonde have sex with Horatio in Egyptian orgies, Laura drinks goat blood and is obsessed with the Egyptian ceremony, Carlo rapes Laura. Everything happens with so little feeling that EMANUELLE IN EGYPT is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not nearly erotic, even the actors themselves look bored during their sexual scenes. Since there were two famous couples in this film (Laura and Gabriele & Al and Annie), the number of available sex scenes is countless. . Instead, a movie that offers top Eurocult cast and never delivers the goods will piss every spectator away, except hardcore Laura Gemser finishes. Otherwise, avoid EMANUELLE IN EGYPT!
