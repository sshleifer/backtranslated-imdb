what a waste of time! I expected better from cameraman diaz! I think it wasn't her fault for being in a horrible movie. the film does not capture the beauty of Europe ..... and was not successful in leading viewers to tension or wonder. weak attempt at narration and narration - dialogue is boring and unable to tell what I think simplicity is beauty. no love, energy, electricity on the screen. too bad !!!!!!!! 1
