Sigh that the stupid government tried again to create an inexhaustible and indestructible soldier, and of course, the experiments were terribly bad, weighing us half a mutant half a man who breaks a lot and stabs like a little girl when she's angry. Lance Henriksen acts as an honorary scientist who immediately terminated the experiment when he heard that it was a military project, but was returning (bringing the whole family with him) when he found that his beloved guinea pig had become a deadly spree. "Mind Ripper" is certainly a watchful horror movie, but it's very unoriginal and presents almost every clich√© you can think of (including an estranged father / rebellious teenage son ...). Characters are like wooden puppets, the stupidest things are said and done and there's a totally useless sequence of dreams coming from the monster !!! There are some interesting scenes you can enjoy and some of the isolated desert places are really scary. Lance Henriksen is adequate as always, even if it is another worse production he plays, and Giovanni Ribisi certainly deserves a better film to make his debut. For some reason, this anonymous thriller of the 1990s is also known as "The Hills Have Eyes" part 3. "It's because he cares for members of the same family who are terrorized in the desert? Is it because Wes Craven Or maybe it's because the monster is coming to an end as a bald Michael Berryman in the 1977 original? Who knows ... Who cares? Wes Craven apparently funded this project because his son wrote the script and He is always on the move to find that your offspring is as unreserved as you are.
