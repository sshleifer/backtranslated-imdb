First comment on the movie! I'll start by saying, "Come on! It wasn't bad ... was it?" ... No, it wasn't that bad. I laughed and giggled in the movie so I can't say with my hand that it was waste. It's completely different, this epic movie sucked bad. "As?" people would ask. I'll tell you how. This movie is not nearly as unnecessary, not to mention that stupid (and I say stupid because it is, but is stupid doing it funny) things that happen around and with characters is actually nice in this movie. Not the best around, but hey ... what would you expect - check out the poster! Some people said it was stupid, I found that when you write a comment, it should be more objective (my own opinion), but yeah, of course it was stupid, it's a "stupid" movie! Look, I'm not gonna tell you to go and watch the movie now, otherwise you missed a century event. What I say is that if you find yourself in a movie somewhere, don't take your eyes to the opening points. See what this is all about - who knows, maybe you like it a bit. I give it 4/10 because I wasn't so bad that I laughed and some unexpectedly good sex-related jokes.
