I was so offended by this movie that I had to write about SOMETHING so please humor me. Her only virtue, which is redeemed outside some good deeds, is that it will not go over the last 107 years. minutes. Even this length is about 30 minutes too long. The comparison here was made with the brilliantly dark 'The Grifters', but I don't see it. They are two different movies together. The closest "Swindled" comes to the existing movie "The Sting", which was produced in 1973. From this wonderful fun "George Roy Hill", which is exactly what it is, borrows (sorry, STEALS) liberally. I liked it because it wasn't pretending to be something else. <br /> <br /> There are so many reds in 'Swindled' that I thought I was in an aquarium. It's very confusing, but that's just one of many of his problems. The main thing is this: if you make a movie where everybody lies to everyone else, where everyone is conceiving, we have no "anchor" to ground us. The inevitable result is mish-mash of very sloppy seconds from other caper films. Almost everyone in this movie is pleasing and uncomfortable. Certainly, Elementary Class 101 would tell us that viewers have to "take care of" someone. We can't take care of someone here: they're all swine. It could have been a burrowing comedy, but it's playing right from start to finish. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this movie, DO NOT READ MORE. LARGE 'SPOILER' COMING. SORRY, but I have to do it. There's so much fake blood and so many fake murders that it doesn't mean it's hard. The end is absolutely ridiculous - "murder" at a crowded airport that is not really "murder"? And the "murdered" guy, blood drenched, just gets up, snorts and leaves, blood falls, with prey? All the time when the police and the horde of people are looking for and no one is joining? The director must have a lot of cojones if he thinks we should buy it. Noirish B-movies from the 1940s did better. I'm a big fan of European movies, but this confirms that Schlock doesn't always come from Hollywood. As for "Swindled," my judgment lies in the famous line from Samuel Goldwyn, the vowel producer, who knew everything about Schlock: "Including me.
