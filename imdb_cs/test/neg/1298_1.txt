This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen; I gave her one star simply because it's the lowest possible score. Whoever thought Flood was a good movie? The director and the cast should be ashamed, and then it might seem to me that it could be part of a shambola scary tactic. Only such propaganda could be so bad. The refuting feature of the Flood is that it is the horror and shamelessness of the formal happening to make it funny. If only the characters had the same depth as the flood itself, they would still have to hear from the sound bite to sound without the slightest emotional reaction. The sad thing about this movie is that it could have been much better, informative, imaginative and tense. The flood has an amateur lane, which is found in many recent British movies, where the use of resources for better entertainment would be more targeted. Where was Smithee?
