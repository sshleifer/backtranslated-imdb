A ridiculous film where two college graduates move to California and one becomes a movie star and the other his manager. a TV show where women will compete for his affection. The film is unpleasant and ridiculous. Girls who compete for a boy lover look foolish. It seems that the choice of a show producer is only one girl. She is really an amateur against some of the other women, but she is healthy and brings good reviews to the show as well. <br /> <br /> You realize the third scene is that the manager is falling for her. Br /> <br /> We know that Ryan was a bachelor. While the end is somewhat cute, you really know where it went.
