This film is in a dead tie with the original for the worst movie ever made. I think this may be a little worse, if anything. WARNING: SPOILER !!! Here are the survivors on a ship that has been knocked over for a long time. Improbable? No - DANGEROUS. The whole space is so ridiculous that it's not funny. There are some big names in the movie, and they couldn't save it. I consider it a waste of good celluloid. Unfortunately, after I saw it, I also decided it was a waste of my time. Don't bother with this. Or the original for that! I gave it 2, mainly because they threw 1 voices out.
