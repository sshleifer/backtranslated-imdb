After watching this movie, I felt like I just ate a box of stiff, chewing cracker jack to find no value inside. This movie has a real promise: porn stars in skinemax! Unfortunately, someone forgot to tell manufacturers that we love T&A in our stores !!! Sure, we'll get a few quick flashes and a couple of "bathing in the bay". But where is the sex? How can you have four girls, "girls' clubs" no less, in this type of film with a single, lame 5-second lesbian scene? Good Night, USA Up All Night provides more titration! Look, we're not looking at this type of film for great cinema, screenwriting or action. We want to see some breaks! What a drop.
