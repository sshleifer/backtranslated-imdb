Leonard Nimoy directed Star Trek III, which wasn't bad. Maybe William Shatner thought Nimoy did it. After seeing this film, he should reverse this decision. Star Trek The Finest Frontier is the worst in the series. Negotiations from all involved, including those like Shatner and Nimoy, are bad and scrubbed and makes them as old as they look in real life, special effects are cheap, like when Spock must save Kirk on a jet pack when he falls. Humor's attempts were pitiful and the story is so terrible that we can't think of what basically means the Vulcan steals the Enterprise to find God (seriously). Taking care of any of this movie and oh not to mention Uhura doing belly dance to distract male guards. She seemed to be participating in a grandmother's competition. If they wanted her to look sexy. They were wrong. She looked grotesque. <br /> <br /> How it got into production, or even wrote ... but it doesn't think about it. The only good place for this movie is in garbage. Worst of the series.
