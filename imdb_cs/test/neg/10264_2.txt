This movie SUCKS !! Looks like they decided to randomly place the scenes together. Good gore, but a little conspiracy. Sally whines and complains about everything until she becomes a demon. I thought he had a PMS. It must have been. Dubbing in this movie is terrible. One scene a woman spoke and a few seconds before we heard a sound. At that moment, I knew my suspicion was right, it wasn't from the US. I tried to move on, but I lost about halfway and found it hard to believe, even for horror. Some good characters, but not many. Not worth losing time.
