Although I do not recommend this movie, I do not recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie. Although I didn't give away the end or most of the plot twists, this movie would be best seen without any prior information. It is difficult to identify the main problem with Donnie Darko because there are many. Richard Kelly, in his first feature film, seems to have gathered enough scenes of adolescent rage, late night stoner diatribes, self-righteous justifications, and inhospitable, banal philosophy to inspire twenty teen engagements; then crushed them into one two-hour sci-fi twist pack. The result is deeply disturbing - for all the wrong reasons. The film seeks to guide viewers down through intricate paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning to sympathize with one-dimensional characters, and above all hopes to ignore a backward chart, full of dissenting free ends, hiding under the veneer of CGI effects and neo-surrealism. The main character, Donnie Darko, is a young man, dedicated to therapy, misunderstood by his friends, and rendered hostile and dissatisfied by his suburban life. We want to feel that he is more intelligent than his classmates, although sometimes this is a difficult assumption. For example, when one of his friends comes up with the absurd theory of Smurfs and Donnie struggles with his own theory, his friend complains that Donnie acted "all clever". But Donnie's speech is no smarter than his friend - just angry. The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his main account of his standardized test scores as 'intimidating;' but due to the director's inclination against the simple categorization of human elements (as shown in the FEAR-LOVE sequence), it's a bad replacement for character development. Donnie takes prescribed medication to fight mental problems that are not directly addressed in this film. In fact, the whole issue of drugs is underestimated and one of the first chances the director has to redeem is lost. The ambiguity of Donnie's strange fate, the possibility that all this may be the result of his imagination, is pushed into the background and makes the film 100% science fiction. That would not be bad in itself, except that "science" behind "fiction" is very uncertain. The explanations of time travel are weak, sounding like separate, uninformed wanderings at best. We get the idea that a film writer once read a book about traveling in time or a few chapters, and can't remember how it worked, but he was sure it was really interesting and wanted to work on it. The scientific part, as a result, depends more on expensive computer animations than the actual development of theories (at one point, a teacher who discusses time travel, states that if he continues to talk on the subject, he will be fired). no further explanation). Donnie's behavior with a visitor from the future leads him to commit some bad actions. Justifying these actions is a complex matter. It harms his school, but it's okay because his school doesn't work with him like a man. His punishment of the fearsome self-esteem advocate (somewhat similar to the character of Tom Cruise in Magnolia) results in male public humiliation. But the audience should believe that Donnie is a vengeful angel. He does not seem to know himself the effects of these actions until then. In addition to these shortcomings, the film is riddled with a flat, uninteresting generalization of humanity. The story takes place in 1988, just before Bush / Dukakis, and the director touches on the film at this point. The focus, however, spreads exactly this far away: Donnie's grumpy, blue collar father votes for Bush, while his free-brave, rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis. There is no remote reminding of a political statement; simply a statement of obvious. The first ones are not necessary to make a good movie, but those should be left out. Likewise, Donnie's sincere speech about not being able to throw all human emotions into unheard-of categories of "fear and" love, does not require viewers to make great leaps of understanding. Kelly honors several of the 80's pop culture symbols in their film: ET, Stephen King, Smurfs, Back to the Future, a collection of his own experiences, interests, personal heroes and adversaries, affirmations and disillusionment, roughly stitched with untrained hands, all over the songs are played in music video clips to characters, seemingly because the director likes songs, characters that have little conspiracy, or archetypal tyrant, fat girl and right-wing idiot teacher, because the director wanted to really pack them Somehow, the clumsy mess that Donnie Darko is letting us think about Mr. Kelly enough ideas in the head to create another film, or wasted all their creativity in one nonsensical, overcrowded and meandering effort. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/10.
