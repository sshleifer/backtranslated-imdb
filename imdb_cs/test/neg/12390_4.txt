The name doesn't make much sense to me. I'm not sure which door in the movie should not be opened. The film begins smoothly, with a conversation between a man and a woman in a room that looks like a richly equipped train car, complete with the sound of a train. In fact, the man's house is a train and has a cassette of train sounds. Woman leaving and calling young woman. A young woman tells her friend, a doctor, that she has been told that her grandmother is sick and that she must return to her hometown. She wasn't there at the age of thirteen. Lightning back in thirteen years. A shadow figure enters the house. He strokes the sleeping young girl, then goes to another room and stabs the girl's mother. The girl wakes up and enters her mother's room and finds her dead with a knife in it. She screams, and her arms come out of nowhere and put her hand over her mouth. She looked up in fear. The early scene in the murderer's film damping the scream and the girl's look is one of the few fancy shots in the movie. <br /> <br /> It doesn't really help him in the visual department. Sometimes there is some special use of sound, and there is a strange lighting in the attic scene where there are many red and blue glass sheets. Back to the present. A young woman comes to her grandmother's house. There's an old doctor who doesn't trust him, along with a man from the opening scene of "Judge" and Kearn, the city's museum operator. They do not trust any of them and it is true that they do not trust any trust. She is rather ugly in the whole movie. She wants to check her grandmother in the hospital. Men in the city want her house and the museum operator wants things in it (his museum is already full of many grandmother's things). Inexplicably, a woman wants to keep her house. A young woman starts receiving phone calls from a man speaking a sinister whisper. He makes various threats and wants him to do things to wake him up. Such scenes are often repeated. Unfortunately, there are so few characters in the film that the possibilities of who can be are limited. Worse, we see who's on the phone right from the start. While a young woman does not know (although the caller sometimes falls into a normal voice), viewers always know: no tension. Every call comes across more and more. The end was unexpected for me, so maybe he'll get points for not being obvious, but I'm not sure I took care of it.
