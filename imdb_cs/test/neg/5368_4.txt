The atmosphere in this show is great. There's plenty of great buildup, but that's where this show will fail. There's a way to stand up for nothing. You will constantly see the creepy setting that makes it like something really strange coming right out of the corner and then .... nothing. Again and again nothing. You hear many stories of people talking about strange events, but you see nothing. They appear with these people, talk about their deep and emotional pastes, prepare lame equipment and find nothing! There is nothing at this show that leads me to believe in something paranormal. I may laugh every time they need to perform "a terrible spirit" that we have seen nothing as spectators. He gets rid of the spirit that has never been and everything is put into a neat little package. The show that looked so strange and had such great potential leads to one thing ... Nothing!
