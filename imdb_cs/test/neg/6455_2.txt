Yes, this review may contain spoilers, but you will thank me for that. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I came to this council with the expectation of the same answer as I had, but inexplicably, there are a few people who love this movie and especially the performance of Spacey. Kevin Spacey behaves quite limited despite the admiration of the world for him. I felt like I was watching a major version of Kevin's "American Beauty" role. His character in this film is ridiculously reworked, until his laughter insults that fit his assistant. Same place Sweat and Low. Somehow I suspected that this scene should be funny, but this time I was ready to press the stop button (that's about 20 minutes into the movie). And what about the false homage to "Resevoir Dogs"? Whaley claims, "I think I saw it in the movie once," as if to cut off Spacey's ear. But what uses it to cut him? Envelope! That's right, he'll give him paper pieces! This must be one of Hollywood's worst scenes, and the fact that actors and directors have tried to do it with a straight face is even more frightening. I don't see the end of this movie (my DVD has mercifully shut about half an hour before the end), but anyone who wants to say it could save me the lines I missed, and that would make sense. Well, I don't care what happened at the end because it never succeeded in replacing the bad deal and tirelessly over-top the dialogue. I even felt that the actors wanted to get out of this movie as badly as I was.
