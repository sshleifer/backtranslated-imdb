Okay, here's a really short review: this movie was blowing. I wish I could only have a review that would introduce this simple principle, but I have to carry you with more bad reviews, such as "terrible" "clich√©s" and "unknowable". It's the type of movie you're watching when you're drunk or you're stuck in a desert island where there's nothing else. Here is the assumption: the vice president is captured by a terrorist group in a play-off hockey game and only Van Damm can stop the madness. Really, really terrible, but then again, I didn't pay to see it for the first time around and only my father felt the absence of circuitry in his wallet after this movie. I hate the fact that he's a Republican and everyone, but then he spared me the horror of paying for this piece of garbage. Okay, that's enough room to be recognized as a review, so I offer adieu.
