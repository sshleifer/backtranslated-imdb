<br /> <br /> Playback has been greatly modified and the order of the scenes has been completely mixed. Acting is terrifying (especially by Helena Bonham Carter) and film poverty. The result is a slow, confused, boring film that puts Shakespeare in Shakespeare instantly! If you don't see a play, then you will see at least Olivier's version (1948) instead of this drivel!
