This film is pathetic in all respects. Bad play, horrible script (was there one?), Terrible cut, crazy cinema, cheap humor. Just terrible. I saw 'The Wishmaster' a few weeks before this movie and I thought it was a dead bell for the worst movie of the year. Then I saw 'Pest' and suddenly 'The Wishmaster' didn't seem so bad at all. Bad Bad Bad. Unbearably bad.
