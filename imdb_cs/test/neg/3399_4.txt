This is just a long advertisement for "The Death Tunnel". While this is an interesting history of the Waverly Hills Sanatorium, the whole theory of spirits is up to your interpretation. More "Ghost Orbs" that you can duplicate with dust before a flash camera, and "Ectoplasmic Mist" is just one's cigarette smoke lit by the camera flash. I didn't see any "Shadow People" until they came across a blurry picture. No scientific explanations have been proposed for phenomena, only paranormal. Maybe these are just events that one would have to believe, so plan to visit the Sanatorium on your next vacation in Louisville, Kentucky.
