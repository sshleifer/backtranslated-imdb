One of the worse gay movies I've ever seen. Since they are not characters in this story, it is hard to comment on a real movie. Therefore, since Colton Ford (aka Glen) put his life open to everyone to see, I think it's a fair game to criticize. And that's not difficult. Here he goes. 50 Something Glen is a great time porn star that wants fame and luck as a great time singer. (I think 11 movies make him a "star") To be gay and forty, I saw porn and I didn't recognize him or his lover. They personally look at me with different hairstyles anyway. Face to face, guys, it's not Jeff Stryker, Jim Bently or Casey Donovon. It's alright. The purpose of these films is about 6.5 minutes, so everyone has the same requirements if you know what I mean. So Glen wants to be a serious (legit) singer to launch his porn industry, but he can't get anyone to take him seriously. I wonder why? He was so stupid that he thought he could choose clothes and have sex on film. And according to the film, it's not just a porn movie that it indulges in, it lives in a house with other "stars" where people can plunge into their bedroom, bathroom, and anywhere via webcams. It's $ 500 an hour to have fun at a private party. Strip concerts on clothing optional "hotels". Doing something called meth that I suppose is a drug. And then you have the balls to get angry when someone tries to touch you at a club concert - because he's now "legit". Oy! The only interesting, non-cardboard figure is the Academy Award winning gay writer who wouldn't give his name. And because it's a documentary, it's porn like porn. You can say he's the most amused stupid porn star. Glen has one hyper-nellie manager (Kyle) who wants to "sell" him as a porn-participant in the hope of getting him gay. He's trying to do Svengalli-rutin. "Use this" "Don't smile" "say" in what amount of control problems, but our anti-hero won't be controlled or say what to do. I'm not saying Kyle was right, but if a budding singer started to ask a manager, they wouldn't get far, a little: The one who's his own lawyer has a fool for a client. It wouldn't be bad if it were a small little piece of information, drumming, please, is bad, sucks, his singing talent ranks there with Ashlee Simpson. Hard to Root for Someone - When They Try to Make His Dream Meet --- in 50! --- doesn't work like normal people. No work. Can you say lazy-ass? And whining, and "Why don't they accept me." Song and dance After a few months of scratching the surface of the music industry, "Why don't I have a record deal now." What? The actors are waiters. "That's right. He just wants his success now because he decided he wanted it. Whine Whine Whine. His lover lets him go back to the nurse, but I'll tell you that I wouldn't want Moron to give me The two are useless, Airheads, the film is useless, if you really don't like Whine and Cheeesy people, stay away, don't waste your money on the miserable lives of useless people, there are more interesting things at the bottom of the shoe.
