I have no idea how accurate it is to view Flynn in this movie, but as a fiction work, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> The script is everywhere and leaves. You wonder how he got from one scene to another - you just don't get the minimum information needed to maintain some continuity and understanding of his current situation and it's difficult to understand Flynn's motives and other characters behind their behavior. Br /> <br /> Add to this a series of stupid and unlikely situations and you have a movie that appears as one of your dreams that makes sense when you sleep, but when you wake up and try to remember it, it's just weird , incoherent and totally unrealistic. There are many long, boring musical parts of the film that are either bad for me or a bad director trying and not artistic. None of the characters is even likable, and Flynn's character meets as a self-service liar, criminal, thief, thief, killer, fist-fighter, gigolo, and cheater to do anything and step on anyone to support his own dreams and so, despite all this, great opportunities seem to fall miraculously into his lap. <br /> <br /> This movie is neither entertaining nor unsatisfactory, nor is it historically accurate in all accounts, so why watch it? In order to mix salt in the wound, the DVD had one of the worst transmissions I have ever seen, not even in widescreen or Dolby 5.1 mode, it had horrible telecine and many, many artifacts from what looked like a film disc that collected dust and somewhere. scratches.
