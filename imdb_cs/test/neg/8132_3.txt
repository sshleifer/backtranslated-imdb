I really wanted to like this movie, but I hardly managed to. It is surprising that the same number of votes was 10, the other half 1. All the characters were fun and even talented, but as a whole the film didn't pay off. Sebastian Hernandez is appealing; charismatic and sympathetic (even physically reminiscent of Marc Anthony in a more accessible but eventually conscious way ...), but even he couldn't save this film confusion. The scenes stretched too long and the points were finally defeated to death. The banana scene trembled on self-absorption, seemingly showing how much it moved in its boxers. But in his defense it was his first film as a director (which I am aware of) and I appreciate his love work. He just left me empty despite what she was trying to say. Finally, I think that a more experienced director would better handle this story. From what I have seen from "extras", there is a real story behind it, and maybe when I watch them, I will appreciate this experiment more.
