Dreadful! My friend (who apparently thought I had a senseless sense of humor) recommended it. <br /> <br /> They're coils. I almost turned him off. It's just my anal desire to leave things unfinished, which prevented me from doing it. This was apparently a British attempt to make a film with a bunch of also running TV actors who used some lame script from their business friend. I'm trying to figure out something close to the lack of this film. Less funny than global warming. I am not normally so violent, but I have observed it more than a decade ago, and I thought I had spent an hour or more of my life destructive on it. Puerile, conspiracy less, useless tosh. I'd rather eat my legs than watch again.
