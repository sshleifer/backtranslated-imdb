Extremely slow movie.There are good performances from all actors, which is why over 5 score.Surya and Jyo are supposed to be this ideal husband and wife and we have shown that up to the point you start asking there is a story. Then One day Jyo discovers Sury's diary to find his failed love story. The college love story is totally unconvincing because Surya is an arrogant Senior who always collects on Bhoomik, beats his friend, screams at her in public and despite being scared of him. she fell in love with him. After that she continues to control her with a rough tongue. Certainly I could not appreciate the humble figure played by Bhoomika. Jyo decides to get together and what happens after it's peak. The story is extremely weak in his characters. And the extremely arrogant Surya to Bhoomika is the exact opposite with Jyo (and there is no reason given for a sudden change of character). if she turned so super certainly why she didn't try to find her love when she was afraid of anything.
