This one and the previous "Toulon's Revenge" and others seem completely different from the first two, where the puppets weren't so nice. It's basically to choose a series, the first two go together and paint the puppets as killers, while the other three are a series of them are good guys. This one happens like an episode of serious TV series, which was as good as the third part, and I never had the urge to try and watch part of the series. Essentially, a child gets puppets, while some strange obscure lord or something sends his evil puppets out to kill, this dark lord looks like an enemy from one of those live Japanese actions as Ultraman. The film is over before you know it, so it has to be credited for not causing you a very painful watching movie. Just for many holes and things in it to be considered a good movie. You will see the guy who played in the last Toulon movie, but then you have a very anti-climate battle and wham the movie is over before it really starts.
