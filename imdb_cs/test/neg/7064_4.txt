This is a cheap biography of a black and white minstrel show, sure Dixie Boy Johnson. Whatever this person really is, I don't know, but given the cast of certain "Lee Lasses White" and Roscoe Karns who also play the character, I suppose that man existed and that it is a white (apology). version of his career. The storyline, such as it is, follows Dixie's boy from career heights to depression at his wife's death in childbirth, his child abandonment to friends and his return to his sixteenth birthday daughter and stage debut for reconciliation. Another forgotten man, Benny Fields, plays Dixie Boy. The man has a beautiful baritone voice, but no acting talent and it's a boring piece on screen. Gladys George is bravely trying to revive his works without success. Judy Clark makes the best personification of Betty Hutton I've ever seen, though I believe she thought she was herself. A score full of many music numbers in a short time of 70 minutes deserved a well-deserved Oscar nom. It's worth a look.
