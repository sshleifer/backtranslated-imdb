This difference must go to DUNGEON HARROW. At least Ed Wood's mistaken attempt to make a quality science fiction film had a dubious "star" power of Bela Lugus, Vampira, Tor Johnson, Criswell and Lyle Talbot. DUNGEON HARROW has no quality at all. What could be an interesting and exciting plot about an abandoned aristocrat on a leper colony, perhaps in the style of the DR ISLAND. MOREAU or MYSTERIOUS ISLAND is destroyed by heavy dialogue and mono-tonal action by amateurs whose lines fall like lead scales into the sea of ​​stupidity. The "special effects" that took place in one's bath make this film a pile of manure. Even the leprosy treatment is something of a Victorian interpretation of the Bible. The fact that leprosy cannot be confined to an individual at its last stage is at odds with the conspiracy line that aristocrat Fallon and his wife Cassandra infested with disease and ended up as indigenous residents of De Sade Castle, doomed to madness and inhuman cruelty. It is interesting to note that none of the cast members created another film. No wonder talent talent; the lack of talent forgets the oblivion, which is where this film should find its pitiful end.
