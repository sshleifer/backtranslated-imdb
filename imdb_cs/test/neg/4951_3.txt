After the "Still Life" show, a short film directed by Jon Knautz, I was really excited about his feature debut "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer". The "Still Life" perfectly captured the essence and feel of the episode "The Twilight Zone" and I was eager to see what Knautz could do when he took the horror comedy genre. Campy's name character and promotional materials suggested something along the lines of "Evil Dead" or "Dark Army"; funny, cruel, 80s horror with lots of monsters. Though it was what Knautz was going on, he wasn't quite able to capture any fun or entertaining value these movies had. The problem with "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is that it completely lacks understanding of what made these horror comedies, trying to evoke, so big in the first place. Two-thirds of the run time is primarily dedicated to the film's hero, Jack Brooks, a plumber and a college student when he goes to class and tries to deal with his uncontrollable outbursts of anger. There is no monster to see for most of the movie, barely a drop of blood or the slightest attempt at something horror. Even if "Evil Dead" or "Dead Alive" had more gore cut out, they would still be fun. "Jack Brooks" is not. It's boring, which is the worst thing a movie of this kind can be. Jack Brooks himself is not that interesting, at least not enough to justify the screen time he gave him. Everything he needs to know about him is revealed in the movies for the first ten minutes and from now on whenever he doesn't win the flesh of the monster (and rarely does it), it's not worth watching. The film goes nowhere, follows him around on psychiatric sessions and scuffles with classmates. Finally, things get up. Jack Brooks fights several monsters, some heads are crushed, several people are defeated and then over. Just like that. Everything in about fifteen minutes. It's been a good fifteen minutes. Monsters are quite resourceful (and they're done exclusively in the camera) and there are a few big gore gags (the best zombie head is crushed), but after seventy-five minutes of pure tedia, fifteen minutes just won't be cut. This is really all there is to it. I could roam about acting, which is quite well done (especially Robert Englund's horror icon in an unconventional role) and how the creation prosthetics are a nice return to the days when movies didn't use CGI, but that really isn't. t thing. "Jack Brooks: Monster Slayer" is totally boring and while Jon Knautz seems to have a talent to make a good movie (again, the last fifteen minutes is a killer and "Still Life" was amazing - look at it), "Jack Brooks" completely lacks the brand "She has her accomplishments (acting, make-up), but it doesn't change the fact that it's not fun at all. The screenings I've captured had a director and cast. One of the information I picked up was that the sequel was in development and that this time it would focus on fighting monsters rather than "creating a hero." My advice: skip this and wait for the sequel.
