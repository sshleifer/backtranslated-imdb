Well, the name in summary should tell you everything. FRED OLEN RAY - a modern low-budget king, whether it's TV or video (I doubt it produces for the silver screen anymore - with the deaths of the double B-movie features and all). > <br /> The creator of such classic (?) classics such as Hollywood Chainsaw's Hookers and Dinosaur Island .... <br /> <br /> Well, I'm such guys. Its mostly fun (in distinctly cheese, campy and especially cheap way) and if it's one thing, it's a professional - something you can't say to all people in the biz movie. But this movie is among the weaker in his oevre. Insipid acting, an uninspired scenario, and lame jokes conspire to make your brain dull in minutes. If you are on a real F.O.R. goodness (or rather badness), watch out for the above, and generally his stuff from the 70s and 80s (I think he recently lost a bit of his edge).
