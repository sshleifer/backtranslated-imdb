The famous Edward gets into the world when his superior tells him that he can launch those dirty Swedish drama movies and head up the stairs to the Spraying and Gore departments. Excited, along with his great prerequisites for a new type of movies he will soon be editing, he asks all sorts of questions about the wage, his work space, and his lunch break. Well, not exactly. Perhaps Edward is the opposite. Quiet, stuttering guy, plus glasses. Except when she's crazy. I think it created a much more terrifying atmosphere. Evil Ed is a Swedish film for all reasons, but some magical power has hit good actors and turned its beautiful Swedish accents into stereotypical American voices. I think this is some of the actor's expertise he needs these days. Acting is very wooden because it is inflexible, inflexible (well, what did you expect?). In addition to having a techno jamming techno theme song, it sounds like its E-Type. In any case, it makes the film worse. Since I am still pretty rough against this film, there will usually be a break point in which I will profess happiness. But there is not much to say. The plans look good, but some "Hanz's" spelled over him and partially destroyed. So I watch this movie. If the film ended up where Edward is taken to a mental institution, and the parts of the place where he goes crazy, kills and kills people, the result would be much better, but that's just my radical look. I would also like to see more shots from movies about lost limbs. There are also illogical things to discover in this piece of film. Let's say actors are really Americans living in America, why would they work on a Swedish film like Edward? And also the delivery man, why never use a bell that is right next to him? Instead, he leaves the door with a tap. Good old Edward really got some good ears to hear it all while he edits. Anyway, this movie had its moments, it's just a pity that there weren't so many. But that doesn't mean I wouldn't recommend it. It's a relatively inexpensive movie, go ahead and buy. It's almost like seeing a price and film pattern. On the other hand; If you like to watch dubbed movies get crappier by it could be IT. My verdict would then be rock solid 4.
