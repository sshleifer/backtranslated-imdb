I am quite surprised that someone has found that this film touches or moves. The basic assumption of the film sounded like an excellent, if provocative, idea to a film about a rare type of relationship, but one (if I can judge by the real examples I knew) is extremely deep and loving. However, the film is cheaply written - poorly written - and although it has a number of very nice looking shots, I found nothing special. Probably the biggest problem is that it is too short and poorly folded to give your viewers enough time to invest, emotionally, in characters: we don't really care about any of them, so their stresses and obstacles they really don't touch. I think to remember - from the script up-- with some character development some really good writers - could make a big difference. It is instructive to compare this film with Brokeback Mountain, which the screenwriters have taken to a much higher level than the script writer, who was clearly aware of how to write a classic tragedy and perform their task with care, planning and excellent workmanship! However, it seems that people just remake those movies that don't need it! You are not really missing anything if you miss this: I have found it very disappointing really, and it is just saved from getting a 1-star from me on the basis of a brave and gitting it took to make a film on this sensitive subject.
