As mentioned in other notes, working with the camera is ridiculously bad. I am tempted to say that the director of photography is seven years old, but that would mean - up to seven years old. Well, what about the topic? I was looking for a look at the state of the wine industry around the world, you know, Mondovino. The film is about a very close look at one intrigue in this world: the struggle between Mondavi and the French and Italian wineries they would like to buy. There is no enlightening narrative that puts the whole agreement in context, leaving the director's selective process and conversations with different characters in this little psychodrama. There is no lack of despicable characters or even despicable dogs in sight. But there is a lack of balance. Is the director a Marxist? I wondered how I tried to keep a semblance of focus as the camera plunged, turned, and brought the chaotic flourishing. Little grower in France: good. Huge US grower: very, very bad. Forget hundreds of small wineries across North America, Australia and South America. There's a dead horse that has beaten here for over two hours. <br /> <br /> If you want to learn more about intrigues, you can find out elsewhere. So you will be able to taste your favorite wine without feeling bad. I propose a new award at the Cannes Film Festival for the best American play Diatribe.
