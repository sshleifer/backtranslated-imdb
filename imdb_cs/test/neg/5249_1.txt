This film is painful. This is probably the best way to describe it. It is 93 minutes of your life that you will never be able to return. Well, actually, it's more than 86 minutes, because there's no way anyone wants to sit through credits in this stinking pile of dog excrement. You can immediately say that the movie comes from "Mortal Kombat", thanks to its exciting and annoying techno soundtrack. This drains a few ridiculously pleasant moments that this movie can give you. The rest is exhausted by totally uninteresting and annoying characters, "Freddie Prinze, Jr. School of Acting" acting abilities of all involved (including miscast Christopher Lambert), and non-existent directing. Did I leave something? Of course. Let's not forget the suicide scenario, it's a funny dialogue (??). Yes, and let's also talk about how they embarrassed the original poem with this sad and useless futuristic / medieval translation. Costumes and weapons (were the giant pizzas I saw?!?!) They're just stupid, that's the best way to describe them. And the last culprit of the night is always a terrible CGI. When do filmmakers know that CGI gets angry? When will we see the amazing effects used in the 1980s? Probably never, but movies like this and "Star Wars, Episode 1: Phantom Threat" don't want to bring us back. Finally, avoid this movie as Freddie Prinz's latest movie, Jr. Then again if you like Freddie Prinze, Jr.
