I give it 2 because of the beautiful Mediterranean Greece, otherwise it would be 1. When Nicholas Cage came up with the first lines, I thought he was kidding. Cage as Italian? I'm sorry, but the very bad actor who is acting is also BAD, not to mention his Italiano accent. The story is very free, maybe it was good, but with other actors and of course with a different scenario. The camera is great, also taking photos, but why the hell did you cast Nicholas Cage and Penelope Cruz on the role. Please don't get me wrong, I have nothing against Cage, she has some really great movies, but apparently not for every role. It's really a pity that the cast wasn't better because the story has the potential.
