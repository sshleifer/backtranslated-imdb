DeCoteau must be one of the worst "directors" who work in any genre today, and has nothing to do with his films, which usually contain homoerotism, and have boys running in matching boxers. Remember that anyone in tight black underwear is satanic and evil and wants to exhaust your blood / soul ... so deep symbolism here). I just sat in the Sisterhood to give him his fair trembling. I'm trying to watch every horror movie I can, and this was Barbara (FROM ANOTHER, RE-ANIMATOR) Crampton in it (I was sucked into the world of DeCoteau thanks to Linne Quigley, Adrienne Barbeau and some other actresses I like). Lemme tells you what about The Sisterhood ... Like the second reviewer stressed, the supposed plot includes lesbian vampires on the university campus. But she never has a show of hot young babes ("actresses" if you want to) run around dressed in bra, panties and bikinis were so boring. The film has no conspiracy, no gore, no nudity, and the dialogue is ridiculous and it looks like they did it when they go together. Parts are slow moving and repeated many times to increase start time. About ten minutes of this consists of characters just walking on campus (oh, excitement!), Which looks more like a resort hotel than any college I've ever been to. And hearing is the absolute worst. All these girls do well is to lean forward and bend to show off their bodies. The cast was so talentless that I would be shocked to see one of them getting a one-day role in Passions in the future. Ditto for boys. Yeah DeCoteau squeezed other hot boys in his underwear ... Boys who should be in some K-Mart brochure instead of trying to act. Do these people really audition, or just appear in Dave's office and take off their clothes? I think the answer is obvious. I'm willing to give every film a chance if 1.) it's intelligently written, well-directed, original and competent (or hell, even ambitious and stylish). Or 2.) is full of wedges, nudity, various trashiness and / or is unintentionally cheerful. David DeCoteau's films bring NO of this and do better production values ​​than those directly on video. What a shame! So what is the attraction, especially with the advent of a soft and hard porn porn that is easily accessible to anyone who has a computer? I just can't answer that. DeCoteau is a gay horror director and could use his resources to make a unique spin on the genre. Instead, it produces insensitive drivel without showing any talent or intelligence. Ironically, when you think about it, his films are something but pro-gay. In fact, homosexuality seems greedy, mysterious, and sinister. Apparently the gay characters in his films always try to corrupt, seduce and / or kill innocent, sexually confused leaders. There is no shading to make it interesting. The protagonists are naive and seldom turn out to be strong, assertive, or confident in who they are. I'd like to understand if Jerry Falwell, Fred Phelps or Dr. Laura started making movies directly on video, but from a gay director, it just proves that she doesn't fit in these beef pasta.
