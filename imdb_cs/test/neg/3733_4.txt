Not even two years since I saw this film for the first time and I can barely remember this film. Needless to say, I found it very forgettable. What I remember, nothing stands out as particularly good. The talented cast is unnecessary in what I should have considered a dark comedy, but if it does, it will fail miserably. At best, this film is slightly interesting. In the worst case, the seemingly ubiquitous overcast sky is more interesting than the storyline. If you like watching movies where it always seems wet and cool, then I think you can find something similar in this picture. Just try to ignore what's going on because it's barely observable.
