This is a comedy version of "Aliens on the Train". It works pretty well. I'm a rough grader, so 3 ratings are mainly reflected in characters and conspiracy. Performances are very good, all. Two stars, DeVito and Crystal, of course, shine the most. Every performer behaves well enough to play. The comedy works at a level that is short. DeVito characters work best when they are spoiled. His character, portrayed as writing a hack, would probably be more real if he was published and praised as much as most hacks are. His character would have a great agent and multiple requests in real life. The characters are one-dimensional, which is fine in comedy. However, the character of the Crystals is not written very well. His desire to kill momu suddenly makes no sense. It looks like a pitiful attempt at humor. Sudden attempts are not very frequent and the film flows quite well.
