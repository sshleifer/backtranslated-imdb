I can not believe that! I thought it was a good sequel when Jim had a baby in the movie, but instead a movie with lousy actors, a stupid storyline and stupid scenes. This should be in the most beautiful sh * t movies in the country. Thank goodness that the same director didn't do it because it is so stupid with some cartoonish parts like fart not funny, no pee and no dance! I laughed at it because of how stupid a person did it like Homer Simpson making a movie about donuts! I wish someone would remake the mask son with such a conspiracy! Mask (Jim carry) and his wife have a son who is a normal baby. When the child finds another mask, he also became a mask and the mask tries to get his mask back! That's very stupid, so I'll give 1 out of 10. Fu * king sh * t!
