Not sure if it's just a lousy movie or whether it was intended to be a mockery of "B" Western. The story line was so-so but filming, editing, and playing were simply mean. And background music was uncomfortable, too loud and uninterrupted. Many times you couldn't recognize the dialogue over background music. I'm at SASS (Single Action Shooting Society) and take some pictures from the Old West with them and many actors are members of this group, so I bought them. If you are not interested in this group of people or this sport, you certainly would not be interested in this film. Even veteran actors (especially Stella Stevens) have left a lot of wishes.
