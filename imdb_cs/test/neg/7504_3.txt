In the near future, zombies are troubled by some South American city. Settling with a group of friendly faces The inhabitants of our alien are learning the hard reality of urban life. There are two groups of people; the upper classes, which live safely behind the concrete walls of the city, are provided at the right price by the state police. Then there are our friendly face residents. These lower class people live next to zombies. The only means of survival is to trade the goods they dispose of during the day with the police in exchange for cans of food. Our stranger will find out why his world is a plague. The basis was a new diet pill that suppressed the desire for carbohydrates. The desire of the human race to get rid of fat has caused the company to fall as we know it. These pills increased the desire for protein, ie, Masu, even the pet poodle. However, there was one more serious side effect, after death people became reanimated with an even stronger desire for protein, especially human flesh. With what I feel is an imaginative introduction I felt that this film made many realize some resourceful material. What better way could explain the cause of zombie death than the current idea of ​​people 's desire to sacrifice themselves for changing their bodies without the hard work of the gym? However, this idea soon came to an end after this show. This film falls into an old trap "I can't imagine what the world will be when society collapses". When you look at this movie, you will not escape into a world like you when you watch the Planet of Apes (Original), Alien, Mad Max or Texas Chain Saw. In this film, an alternative society is defined by people with colored hair orange and green. Facial colors and charity leather jacket store. In this alternative society there is no cruelty about life, just about healthy faces and through fancy zombies. Movies should let you escape without reminding you that you need to clean your wardrobe and take your old clothes to a charity store. Forget some of the pitiful games or zombies. This film fails because it is too polished, too likable and too predictable. I've had such films since the early 1980s. If you're going to shoot a movie of this kind, I suggest you look at movies like Dawn of the Dead, Threads, or Fulci Zombie again to see and experience the feeling of despair in a destructive society.
