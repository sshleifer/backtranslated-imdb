This film was bad, but it was so bad that it could get into a cult position in the distant future. Some film-noir implements Plan 9 from outside space. The story was, well, there was no story. There is a place reserved for Ed Woods and Russ Meyers of the world and this film proves it. "So bad that it could be good" is the best way to describe it. I seriously doubt whether this movie will be picked up by any legitimate distribution company, so it is unlikely to see a wide release. <br /> <br /> I would expect to see more actor Ron Carey. He did the best he had. The rest of the acting, if I can call it, was quite forgotten. I've seen worse from big studies with huge budgets.
