"Tank Girl" was supposed to be "Buckaroo Banzai" of the 90's and as such was sold. Although the comparison is appropriate; Both movies have so many things that are happening in the frame of the movie that, as it is impossible for the story to be resolved, it certainly isn't boring. "Tank Girl" is a fun ride if you turn your brain off before the movie starts. Otherwise you end up with a skull like a cracked head.
