Posters once again cried. The marketing of this film was deeply at odds with the content; 'explosive'? When I read the synopsis of this film, I expected to see a small town of slapstick, every man with blood and being inflated with alcohol, dotted with heroin needles and bent twice with chronic masturbation; to such a "break" would come a pure bare hero, glowing Gabriel. Instead, the film was the complete opposite of what I was expected to expect. The first few minutes of the movie showed us that Middletown is a simple little place full of poor people who do the best they can, whether you're messing around to meet, drank the pain, or watching fighting cocks (chickens, not penises) to avoid boredom. In other words, the townspeople were desperately ordinary. The only (deliberate?) grotesque work was Gabriel, a fanciful Presbyterian preacher playing Macfadyen, whose face is built in such a way as to indicate a constant air of confused fury. If I were kind, I would suggest that the Paisleyit scream of the preacher be a humorous commentary that would despise Gabriel and his faith. Unfortunately, Brian Kirk is such an inept filmmaker that you despise the film and let the audience wake up to eighty plus minutes of dark, hacked tedia. My only response from this waste of celluloid was the game of "guessing the accent" divided with the wheels of "place in place." Are we surprised that Gaybo ends up stealing his brother and choking his father? Of course not; he is a preacher of bible-bashing and therefore psychotic. All of the city's inhabitants are shocked at the end of the movie, but I think they just realized what their name was for Turkey. <br /> <br /> Northern Ireland's Film and Television Commission, but there are better projects than this weak business. The only thing I can say in favor of this film is that it succeeded in replacing "Superman Returns" as the worst film of 2006; one infernal success. <br /> v1 / 20061114 v2: 20080107
