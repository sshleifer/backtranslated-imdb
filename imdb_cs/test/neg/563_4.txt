This film should be called "The Eyes of Alexandra", and they were to have gone with the Bogart concept altogether. The film began with a slight approach to Bogart's legacy and some comic moments with an operation-oriented face, but after the first 15-30 minutes he turns into a more serious thriller, where two palm-sized sapphires, allegedly laid as eyes in the marble of Alexander the Great's head, for him, and seen by him before death. Gems are therefore of great value not only because of their quality and size, but also because of the link to the Greatest Conqueror the world has ever known. Being an expert on Alexander entitles me to say it's totally and totally fiction, but it still makes a good movie. The film is filmed around the early stupidity and stumbles along with all kinds of Alexander's allusions, both in the foreground and in the background (which I really liked), ending an attack from an old shark (you can't go into the '79 - '80 movie without a shark that threatens the audience). Is there a yacht called Euridice (young Alexandra Alexandra's wife), a man named Alexander, Philip, Cleitus?, (It's been about 5 years since I saw the movie so I can't remember all the details), Olympias, some street names and many more. It was fun to watch a movie just to try to capture all the background details that the director had said (apparently Alexanderphile himself). When everything is said and done, the eyes are loaded and the camera throws on them as a bed of credits. A kind of neat end. What would be more fun would be if they went Indiana Jones and had an action adventure. There have been many, many real artifacts that could have been used to make this more interesting, or an example, a hand-annotated (Aristotle) ​​version of Iliad that Alexander kept with him all his life, even on his many travels through Asia (\ t would be found today). Olivia Hussey (my favorite b-movie actress) is killed too early and was to be a major actress in the world, not a Mommy and Poppy girl ... though she was easy on her own. If you can find this movie, it's worth looking at historical things and seeing Olivia Hussey a little earlier in an extremely humorous humor, but I would pass it on to something more fun. > <br /> Sincerely, Nick
