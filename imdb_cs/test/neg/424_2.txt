EXPERT, in the lead role of Jeff Speakman, is the definition of DULL !!! Blunt, characters, boring situations, boring direction, boring actors, boring cinematography, boring music. I don't really understand this movie. Is it supposed to be an action movie? It's almost as if Speakman wanted to be in a serious movie, but the level of acting and writing found in EXPERT is below your average TV drama. There are some typical "Speakman pummeling bad guys" scenes here and there, but the main aspect of the film relies on some sort of believable drama that is absolutely bad for Speakman or is so badly directed that it just doesn't work with an action star. In the end, this confused film looks and feels very indescribable and indistinct. The worst aspect of EXPERT is music. The composer is a would-be Jerry Goldsmith, with his pompous and melodramatic score, which simply does not belong to this kind of (boring) movie. It's as if the manufacturers knew they had a very dull product on their hands, and asked the composer to make the film more convincing and dramatic with its score, making the film look even more confused, goofier and dim. > <br /> Don't waste your time watching this, even if you're a Jeff Speakman fan.
