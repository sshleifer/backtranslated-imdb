This movie has absolutely no improvement. It is not even worthy to be in the category "so bad is it good" - it's just bad. Wrong, badly filmed, misspelled, badly directed, terrible audio, and the whole thing is just incredibly amateur. Quite as my release is beyond me. Oh, and could anyone say that the main actress that if you're playing 'crazy' that doesn't mean you should constantly fiddle with your hair - in a movie that was generally irritating, it was probably one of the most exciting things of all. On the plus side, I think it's the only movie ever featuring a Nazi carjacker ...
