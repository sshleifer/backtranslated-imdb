Several people have recommended this movie and after reading all the positive comments from this site, I continued to buy a copy of the movie from eBay. The movie in the movie is a moderate and a bit of a hammy, especially a cannibal family, one sequence coming to mind when Jupiter boasts and waves to a burned corpse and speaks directly to the camera. It's one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for the poor actor. It's also proof of some of the worst adjustments I've seen, it's a terrible jump right in the middle of his "talk". But there are a few scary moments and the music works fine ... but overall the movie isn't so great and I don't know why people think Wes Craven is a great director. So far, it has shown me nothing that is, in my opinion, brilliant, the only thing that has improved with Cravens' films, production for sale was his budget.
