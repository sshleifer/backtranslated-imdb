First and foremost, I would like to say that I came back from retirement and wrote deserved comments on horrible films. Only the movie called "Scarecrow Away Wild" could bring me back so I'm here. With this, as I said, I like to start with this commentary. OUCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This movie was really awful, I think I know it will be bad. But I didn't know I'd spend 60 minutes from a possible 90-minute movie of laughter that I thought was a horror movie. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the biggest movie mistake (for me). Ken Shamrock. If memory serves me well, Shamrock is one of the world's most dangerous men. Now that my memory is serving again, it was also in the silly movie that it was a silly comic relief (or it looked like me). I mean, how else would you explain all his lines. My favorite line of his in this so-called movie was "It's been a long time since it comes". OK ????????? The funniest thing on this line was that, not more than five minutes before he'd said it, he was sitting on the beach talking to early dead children about how the scarecrow couldn't be killed. So if he has the knowledge of why he would try to fight on the ground as soon as he sees it (scarecrow, that). As I said, he had to be a comic relief, except that I didn't think his UFC friends were laughing. Now that I have finished the deserved paragraph for the movie. /> <br /> I admit that I can't remember a lot of scenes, and that's not good if I think I'm watching the movie more than fifteen minutes ago. So what I will do is write the first five things wrong with this movie 1. Usually, when a horror monster has its own musical theme, the victim doesn't even hear it. So why was it just about every person involved in this film to this pathetic whistle. I saw the faces of the scarecrows and said nothing about it as a whistle. 2. Why murder was on the beach on Earth. I'm sorry but fired from the history of the beach are associated with party time and holiday type feelings. But I think this horror movie thought it would be such a success that it would change everything. Plus it was me, or the beach seemed to be some living room size. Every time an actor or actress ran around on the beach, it looked like they were running in the same place. 3. Girl runs in gray pants. This really worries during the duration of this film. I think she looks so ridiculous. Moreover, it didn't help that she seemed to be the youngest of the group. I mean, what's twelve or something. There is no excuse for someone who would be so thin on the camera. I don't think the camera adds ten pounds or something, so what was her excuse. 4. People try to get record deals on camera. Just when I thought this movie couldn't get any cheese, it came to want to be Gorth Brooks and oh man was lame. I don't remember the whole scene, but it wasn't nice of what I remember. This man starts singing this song about something that has nothing, and I have nothing to do with what's going on in the movie. The funniest part of the whole story is how everyone seems to enjoy it. I mean the only person who doesn't know how to answer it is "token black black". And that's sad, because if I'm not mistaken, it was the one who encouraged this latest addition to the American Idoal. But here it is funny. While this guy is in his new song or something. In the distance we see or the villain aka the scarecrow. And the boy looks at it. I think it's actually the moment he looks at this guy. So what he does with this jealousy, I'm glad you ask. He waits for the guy to finish his song, and then finishes the guy. I don't want to take the scene of death, but I can tell you. If you are not smiling at this scene, there will be nothing on this earth. 5. This movie was much longer than I expected. And it didn't help that they tried to pull out some pathetic twist bulls ** t at the end to push another 10 minutes out of this movie. I admit that I didn't see it spinning, but it had a lot to do with the fact that I was hoping the movie would end and end. But not they had to make it twist with ** t. Needless to say, when I say it comes, I just turned off T.V. and said f ** k it, there is no way that the movie could get any worse. With my relatively quick judgment, I can say that I will never know what happens next. But I promise I don't care !!!!!!!!!!!!! Everything and all movies are good for laughter, but don't buy it. Just imitate it on one of your friends and watch it unfold.
