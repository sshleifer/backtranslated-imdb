OK, it's awake when you're sick in bed, or you have nothing to do. However, the suspension of distrust needed to obtain this film is important. First of all, in today's modern society, do you think college college teachers get THAT they commit to someone in a short period of time, even if you're a "virtuous" volunteer who likes autistic children? And two weeks of romantic flowers into a letter exchange that leads to John's "conflict" about whether to re-enlist the right after 9/11/01 ... Really? She asks her what to do? Everyone we know has NOT been sitting on the sidelines after the towers have descended (my husband was one of them and I love him and I'm proud of him for going) John's character is so flat. It's almost a blank film. It is good looking, but not Spec Ops ... it seems that you are not sure, calm, instead of the hell, without a tattoo, gets into a "fight" with preppy boy who is nothing more than pushing the game really ... almost all the movie goes around without a cover ... and everywhere there are technical technical errors (epaulettes upside down?). War scenes are stupid ... John and the other guy leave alone ... huh, then another guy shoots and John takes him 10 feet and starts giving a friend some help before securing the area or backup arrival or even having a back against the cover .. It's a shootout for God's sake, you keep fighting until the end ... Damn I wanted to shoot John in the back. He returned home when the truth was revealed and the wine was spilled ... we hated her for taking off his shirt in his presence ... WTH? to break his heart and then tease him into adultery? It's a trollop. The best work of the film is to leave her ... at least there was some self-respect and honor. The total incredible story and we didn't care about these characters or their love at all. Depressing!
