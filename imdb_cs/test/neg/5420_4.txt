TANDEM is special in the Japanese pink genre because it has the necessary sex scenes and a misogynist tone that is necessary for these types of films, but it also throws in a discontinuous drama / dark comedy story that looks like it was more appropriate for another type of film. The film begins with two lonely boys at the restaurant - everyone dreaming of a previous sexual encounter. One of them is the mutual meter of groping, the second quite typical (for this type of film) semi-rape scenario. Two pervs meet and start talking after one lends the second cigarette. They set out for the evening and talk a bit about their sex lives. The film is an inter-cut with flashback scenes of both men interacting with women who are at the center of their lives. Both men drop out and the movie ends on a strange but predictable note ... <br /> <br /> I really don't know what to do with TANDEM. That sorta comes as a soft-core, 'special pair' type of anti-buddy-movie, but in fact explore the subject-to some satisfying degree. Also in these kinds of films, extreme sinister is not very typical - so I can't figure out what it was. I also can't tell if the film was supposed to be funny, depressing or both. I think TANDEM might have had some potential as a more serious drama movie with a dark comedy, but as a soft-core sex movie that tries to be too "smart" for its own good - it just doesn't work. I can't say I hated this - but I can't say there's anything remarkable about it. 4/10
