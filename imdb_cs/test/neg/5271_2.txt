Well, <br /> <br /> First, as many reviewers pointed out - this is the rip off of Martin Cahill's story - first represented by the BBC and John Boorman's "The General" - which is a great movie and far, far better than this one. Speaking as a British native, Kevin Spacey was very good at British and Irish acting talent, especially Peter Mullan. it was totally useless. The characters were c ** p! And as far as Kevin Spacey is concerned, they were not seen as a dear rogue, but as nothing significant or significant. It's not much that this movie would buy. The best pieces are gags and tricks from other movies that will tear. Compare notes to this movie and "The General" - I wonder what others think. <br /> <br />
