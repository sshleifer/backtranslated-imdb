Words cannot express how poor this film is. There is no storyline, acting is scary, basically the whole movie is a joke. <br /> <br /> With a running time of 97 minutes, it is about 96 minutes too long. It could have been just like a short sketch for a comedy show, but the assumption is too fragile to be able to work for so long without boredom. br /> <br /> Avoid this, borrow a good movie instead!
