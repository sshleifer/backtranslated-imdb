You would be convinced that this game is about a man with a number. And certainly, it is an interesting subject - can a person be so obsessed with something marginal as a simple number that completely loses contact with reality and becomes hopelessly vicious and paranoid? Well, maybe someone will ever make a movie about it. Unfortunately, this one has nothing to do with the above, it doesn't matter what your trailers (or even the movie itself) would like you to believe. I would like to say that this number is just MacGuffin, but it is not so much. It's useless. T-shirt. A hook for an unsuspecting audience. What is the movie about? A boy (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a cheesy book of criminals because he feels he somehow reflects his own life. Push. Sure, the character in the book - Detective Fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23 and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and begins to see the number everywhere .. but it's just upholstery and totally irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut out all 23 links and have the main character (characters) possess cheese or something and you will have exactly the same story. It is painfully evident that all things "23" were written in waay after the story has been completed, rejected and sent to "rewrite". <br /> <br /> What would be fine. the movie was not boring, boring, boring. Half of the film is told, for chrissakes. You are not watching the movie, you are listening to Jim Carrey's movie. About a quarter in Carrey starts reading the book and since then until that horrible clich√© we are forced to watch "real" scenes from the dog's life (where nothing happens) scattered with the narrative noir-ish scene that will either let you twitch or simply plain depression. " It's like "Sin City" of a poor man, with all the violence cut out, told by Carrey and shown in slow motion. Ugh. <br /> <br /> This is a simple case of the C movie, which is somehow filmed with A-movie .. probably because the "number 23" hook that I think sounded interesting on paper guarantees first-class Hollywood treatment. Since - as I said - the film is about number 23 as well as about cheese making in Switzerland, no one can feel anything but cheat. I give "Fingerling - the movie" 3 out of 10 because I think it wasn't insulting my intelligence, just like "Forsaken" did, or I totally suicidal like "Battlefield Earth" and the bottom of the scale it must be reserved for abominations like you. But don't worry, that's still a pretty bad movie.
