I broke my own rule, buying this movie from $ 5.88 bin on Walmart. If a movie has a big star in it and you've never heard of it before, it's usually for some reason. Well in the case of this movie, the reason is that SUCKED! They attach the photo and the name of Sandra Bullock all over the DVD cover as bait and put this little fish inside. I was thinking about donating a disc to charity, or putting it in the library, but I don't think I'd like to put someone else in the world. Worst rows: "What do you mean, Army friends?" "What do you mean by your father?"
