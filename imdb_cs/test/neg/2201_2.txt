SPOILER ALERT !!!! <br /> <br /> I don't have to go to 'high-tech' movies that expect to be 100% accurate on all computer related issues. But somehow the average user "I have a computer" should believe that: <br /> <br /> 1) A computer professional with top secret special data <br /> <br /> 2) is to keep a primary copy of this data on a floppy 1.44 <br /> <br /> 3) and absolutely NOT to show these special secret sake data. Also this is the worst representation of computer nerd ever. Although super cute, we should believe that he has no friends, neighbors, extended family or co-workers who could identify her. Even the bomber had a family that could turn it around. points that powered the storyline. Characterization was terrible, the plot was indestructible, and if you didn't see it, don't bother.
