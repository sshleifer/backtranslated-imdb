I had to watch a movie class movie, I suffered all the time. I am not Asian, but this film has always strongly offended me. The basis of the film is racism, the overall minority (Rex Harrison is not even Asian!). The ban on film in Thailand illustrates the inaccuracy and subjective depiction of Asians. In addition, critical attention was paid to Anna's biography. Many critics argue that Anna has added many fictitious events to her story to reflect well. Some film critics and biographers have even said that Anna is making the whole story. A terrible movie, but suitable for discussing biofuels as a meta-narrative fiction rather than a work of non-fiction.
