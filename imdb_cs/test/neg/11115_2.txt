"Chupacabra Terror" is rescued from the "1" presence of Canadian cutie Chelan Simmons as a heroine, it's a pleasure to watch, front, back and side, otherwise it's your standard monster; and a senseless monster is just a man in a suit who commits about 100 senseless things. at least killing blood, so the body is pretty amazing about this thing, at least the formula. I like the moment when Simmons sinisterly tells someone what Chupacabra means: Goat Eater! Oooohhh ... scary!
