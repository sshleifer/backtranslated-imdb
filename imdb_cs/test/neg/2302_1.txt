So I rented this film and hoped to learn about the Democratic Republic of Congo and the beginnings of its independence from the Belgian government. I was thrilled to be familiar with the personalities of her, especially Lumumba and Mobutu. I wanted to see how the new Congolese government tried to unite the various groups that opposed colonial rule, the political motives behind each, the reasons for Belgium's decision to give the DRC its independence, and how the United States and the former USSR were. involved. Sadly, all my questions were largely unanswered. I believe that this film was created by people who, through familiarizing themselves with the DRC's struggle for freedom, introduced a story filled with drama and emotions and decided to use it. They then went on to try to stuff all the dramatic points into the storyline, briefly filled them with dialogue, went to the set and shot it. I might be wrong, but if it is, it is all the more sad because then the creators just have to get too tied to get everything in, and end up trying to get all the details in order to create a comprehensive history. Whatever the reason, the fact is that the movie could be a timeline of sentences and long sentences and facts printed on the screen. The film goes through every significant selection and tells the viewer that this is the main idea of ​​what is happening and completely wipes out the real details in favor of getting to the big stuff. For example, there is a scene when Lumumba is captured by an increasingly rebellious army controlled Mobutu. In the situation, the soldiers have three possible points of view: the one who sympathizes with Lumumba, the one who defies Lumumba, and the one who stands in the middle, sympathetic and yet listening. Accordingly, there are three soldiers who speak in the scene, chasing lines that casually show their views. Then, to avoid dealing with the real tensions that these contradictory views arouse, the screenwriters simply put some random firing, more army boys appeared, and finally ended up defeating everyone. This is the extent of the film's reflectivity. Most of the time, each character simply states their basic motives, the other characters react with theirs, and that's it. There is little through action; Even the things they say are a direct point of pain. It is hard to believe that such people are acting like this. Also in the trend of this directness, things like political tensions between factions are limited to simply acknowledging reality - we never know what these factions are, what they are fighting for, their power, basically anything but that they exist. Likewise, the characters are one-dimensional and flat; Unfortunately, I do not know whether Lumumba was actually a freedom fighter passionately devoted to the ideals of Congolese unity, but after an hour or such a film, I certainly did not believe it to tell me that. The Democratic Republic of Congo, like many developing countries, has a complex and important history, especially in the aftermath of independence. But the story of this history will not be useful unless the complexity of situations is recognized. Lumumba does not pay due attention to these details and ends up giving the viewer little, except the most general outlines.
