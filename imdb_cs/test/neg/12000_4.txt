Wow, what a cheesy movie! It looks like it's going to be an ass, and the camera watches dogs running through the woods. Then she gets bored and follows the story of some girls moving to a house haunted by Indian spirits. Then we get a lot of shots of one partially clad girl and another naked girl in the bath. It suddenly gets really cheesy when "Zombie Indians" arise from the ground and start terrorizing girls. We even get a samurai Indian. This movie starts pretty boring, though I found the story of four Indians who were buried alive quite interestingly. Once Indian zombies (or what you want them to say they aren't technically zombies), they start terrorizing girls when all the fun starts. It's not a strange movie and can't be taken seriously, it's just something fun to watch when you're bored or when you drink with friends. I can't help it, even if it works better as a story, because the first half is boring boring.
