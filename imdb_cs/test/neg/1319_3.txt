A truly amazing cast and a very talented technical crew have squandered their precious career and our equally valuable free time by bothering to support this absolutely predictable and clearly worded piece of commercial waste. The film is based on a really good and very topical idea, but both the producers and the director simply applied the Hollywood 'disaster movie' standard to destroy any potential production value. Unusually High The tide and very strong storm conditions combine the production of a record high storm surge that overcomes London and floods most of the Thames Valley. The story focuses on the heroic scientist (Tom Courtenay), who warns authorities of the dangers and eventually saves the day, the charming female police chief who runs the show, and the engaged deputy prime minister (David Suchet), who is trying to look important. But it's so unreal that after 30 minutes you feel like a prolonged tea break. A young charming female police commissioner demands complete authority over the army during a declared emergency and gets it (as if!). An experienced general is simply pushed aside as a complete fool who has to lick his shoes for her obviously higher capacity. The trouble is that our supremo woman, who is now responsible for millions of lives, spends most of her time worrying about the fate of her two daughters, who went on a trip to southwest London and not phoned to say they were okay. So our mighty wife puts her employees to look for them, and has decided that South West London, and not another city district, must be the only priority for all armies and emergency services. Of course, the minister, the army, and the entire escort accept her prioritization without a doubt. It can be assumed that everyone has property there. When her children finally end up with endless reports and the efforts of their employees, our male hero says, "Thank God they're safe, that's the main thing." It doesn't matter to millions of others or to all the other duties that they should control; if her children were safe, everything was fine. This film is just another excuse to push the same old female chauvinist sexist pasture that women are clever, mindful, caring and clearly capable leaders, while men are good at nothing except physical bravery, mindless strength and expertise. Yet the only simple instruction she could give to the people; to go to the nearest tall building and go quietly up to the 4th floor or above and wait for instructions when the water was retreating was never given by this female superhero - or anyone else. The whole problem was so simple to solve, and yet millions of people probably didn't think they just went up! Pathetic waste.
