If you liked William Hickey in "Prizzi's Honor", he will resurrect his character as Don Anthony in "Mob Boss". This is a very weak "Godfather" satire with a few laughs. Stuart Whitman looks confused about what he's doing at this schlock-fest? The performance of Morgan Fairchild is one of the better endeavors in the film, and that is not a good sign in itself. Eddie Deezen moves between grotesque "Three Stooges" and a copy of Woody Allen. "Mob Boss", which is fatally wrong, is so derived that boredom quickly overcomes comedy, and the film stretches by car, hidden weapons in the restaurant's bathroom, and many other nonsense. - MERK
