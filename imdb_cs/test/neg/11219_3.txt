Although the movie was just like that, closed captions were by far the best I've ever seen! Most of the time, spellings are horrible and subtitles out of sync. I use closed captions, although I can hear well, but finding a lot of actors mumbles. Also, many times the audio track suppresses the dialogue. Thanks!
