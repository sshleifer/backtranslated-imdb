I found myself looking at Sex Lives Of The Potato Men with disheveled eyebrows, confused as to why so many talented and humorous comedians decided to engage in such a completely humorous film. Poo and wanking jokes are funny when eleven. Eighteen plus and start losing friends around the water cooler. Maybe this movie might be a pleasure if you are the kind of person who often plays practical jokes about dog mess, brown sacks and matches, or maybe participate in 'male' Compete at night-out by imitating vomit / urine companions when you are not back in your parent's basement, punching my teenage wife. Even "Sex Lives ..." is hard to recommend, maybe if you're really curious about masochistic cranial surgery and spend your evenings slapping the elders or watching flush toilets, you might think the close-up The chassis deserves a film distribution. <br /> <br /> I 'd discuss characterization, narration or performances I didn't zoned completely out after a long comparison of tuna-pasta / vagina.
