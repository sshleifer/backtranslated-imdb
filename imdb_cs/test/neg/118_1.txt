Honestly horrible movie, poor editing, awful lighting, horrible dialogue and scrappy script. Lighting is so bad that moments that can't even be seen happening, I even tried to play with contrast and brightness, so I could see something, but that didn't help. <br /> <br /> They had to find the script in the bin, the character development is just as awful, and while Jean-Claude hardly awaits Van Damme's film, which he managed to hit all the time. You can't even laugh at cheesy'ness. Direction and editing are also horrible, the whole movie follows an extremely tired routine and fails on every turn as it slams through the plot that is so. weak is just unreal. There's nothing else to say than it's really bad and nothing like the earlier work of Jean-Claude Van Damme you could enjoy. Avoid the plaque, frankly, the words fail to condemn this "movie".
