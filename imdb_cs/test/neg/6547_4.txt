It was the first action film made in the forbidden action style of the USSR. It is not even close to Hollywood action movies of that time. The storyline is childish, directing is so-so. This film succeeded because it was the first of its kind in Russia. Although I have watched it many times, I must admit that it was a little naive and I didn't like it. This is not the best example of Russian action film. That's just the first experience.
