Crash is to be a film about racism in Los Angeles. But in fact, it's just a couple of coincidences among several characters that unite in one of the world's largest cities in one day. Who the hell will he believe? There are unrealistic situations one by one. On the other hand, this film pretends to show racism between Asians, Iranians, Latins, Blacks and whites. But the big mistake is based on preliminary racism from the writer. Mainly because the white characters in this film are usually a portrait as people with a better socio-economic status than the rest of the other races. Iranians are poor as well as Asians. And Latinos, as always, is a portrait as a housekeeper, policeman, or with a very low profile profession as a locksmith. Jesus!!! Don't you think it's time to change these stereotypes? Like blacks, a portrait as a gang member, with the exception of Black TV director, who was the only fresh character for me. This film is so hard that I'm so disappointed about how the cinema is based in Hollywood today. Always with stereotypical characters. No realism. Nothing to identify with. It's just a big waste because it could have been a great opportunity to show Latin, Koreans, Iranians and blacks from a different perspective.
