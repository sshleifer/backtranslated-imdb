I watched for the first 15 minutes, and I can say that there was no consultation with military personnel. Charithor Judith Light (officer) has hair behind her shoulders! One of the first officers to greet her when she goes to the medical facility she works in is so excessive that his pantie pockets are fine! No - there was no army in this movie. Even an ex-military NCO could help here.
