Do I agree with one commentator who says it's really impossible to review Glen or Glenda? objectively. If this happens, a film about his merits would have to be judged to be quite terrible given the cheerful, intricate dialogue, generally average to bad casting as well as zero production values. However, such an evaluation does not capture the absolutely impressive viewing experience of this film as it unfolds. It is not the fact that the subject of the film is transvestitism and that it was a controversial lifestyle choice in the 1950s. Nor is it a plea for tolerance for people who accept alternative life choices that fascinate, in addition to a historical monument. No, what's Glen or Glenda doing? The still fascinating film after 50 years is that Ed Wood has laid his psyche so that so-called authors like Hitchcock or Godard never did, despite their superior talents. At Glen or Glenda, Wood is not afraid to reveal his own deeply felt feelings of being a transvestite, despite asking for tolerance. The film's conclusion suggests that Ed Wood's character will be able to "kill" his female Glenda counterpart by converting the feelings of love and affection Glen has for his female counterpart to his future wife, Barbara. The psychiatrist even assures Glen and Barbara that as Glen does the psychic transmission, Glenda disappears. While Wood could generally promote transvestite tolerance, he wasn't so sure he wanted it for himself. Moreover, Wood was not afraid to throw everything else that occurred to him. screen. He did it with any traces he could get his hands on. If it didn't, then what? Especially in Glen or Glenda, the viewer saw Ed Wood's imaginative world in all of his basic weirdness. The only comment I would like to add to the above comment is that my two-star rating is based solely on objective evaluation criteria referred to in the first paragraph. Extremely memorable effect, which the film has despite its technically incredible qualities that I can't evaluate.
