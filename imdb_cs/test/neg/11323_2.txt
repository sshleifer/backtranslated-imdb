Trites and tiring, having a single liner, almost made me cry. My 4 year old left the room and ended up making a puzzle. I do not know for which age group it was written, but the writer himself did not want credit either. As for the song, it's slightly fun. At least ten years ago. There are many Christmas movies to watch. Although I have seen several times more than that, they are still enjoyable. Whenever it comes, I try to encourage my child to watch something else. The positive message that has allowed 2 to vote 1 is that it promotes good moral values. That would be encouraging if someone was watching him.
