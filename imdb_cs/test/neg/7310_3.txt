That was a movie that could be great if there weren't so many unnecessary historical inaccuracies and if the actors were chosen or looked a little more like real people (not too difficult). Sissi didn't go to Mayerling to see her dead son, she didn't die in the street either; They took her to the ship and then back to the hotel, which was much more dramatic. I am not sure of the wedding night, but it is exaggerated that the lady who waited to undress the Empress and leave her completely naked (in the 1850s) or that the Emperor announced very proudly "yes, I finally laid it down on the assembled court . As far as I know, it was the first night and nobody rewarded her like she was a streetwalker. Saving the grace of the movie is really Stephane Audran, an excellent actress and true character.
