The legendary Cameron Mitchell turkey about the actor / make-up man who is burned by the head of the studio when the drink is thrown in the face when the cigarette lights up. Reduced to scarred clutches and wearing Mitchell patch works at the Movieland Wax Museum. He also kidnaps and kills people using a solution that paralyzes them so he can turn them into displays. Really bizarre bad movie that resists the description. Watch as the various wax figures try not to move, see how the entire tobacco that is destined for several southern states is consumed. It's a horrible train wreck movie and you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen. A classic bad movie that will amaze you, even if it leaves permanent scars on your psyche.
