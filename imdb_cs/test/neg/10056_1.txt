"Nightkill", shot in Arizona by a mostly foreign crew, is one of the most endangered crimes I've ever seen. Robert Mitchum (in a cowboy hat) travels with the recently widowed Jaclyn Smith, hoping to figure out if he has a hand in the death of her husband. Jaclyn's wardrobe is from the Dale Evans variety and her dog is called "Cowboy" ... it seems as if someone has certainly bought into American myth that all Western people are talking and dressed as descendants of John Wayne! The scenario Joan Andre and John Case may have worked better as they approached as a parody; This mysterious thriller just plays tame, with director Ted Post sleeping at the controls. Don't be drawn into the video box art Jaclyn screams while showering. He really takes a shower in this film, but it is not revealing (nor does it make another oblique plot). NO STARS of ****
