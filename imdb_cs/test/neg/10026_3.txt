Supercraptastic slasher fare that feels too long in 80 minutes. A few years ago, a bunch of "Gypsies" who lived in mountain caves were burned in a forest fire. A few years later, campfires are missing in the campus. Of course, a bunch of horny children are on their way to this area, where they organize their own tours. Despite the sinister welcome from the Forest Guard (Jackson Bostwick), the children headed up to the mountain. Before long, children begin to get picked up by a monster who remains invisible until the very end of the movie, probably because the makeup was so embarrassingly bad. No surprises to talk about: they are killed in the exact order that the formula for these films dictates, so the "last girl" has to take care of herself, although in a refreshing negative denomination the final girl ends up trapped and impregnated monster. The story itself could not maintain the weight of the feature length, so it was stuffed with seemingly endless shots of wildlife and insects that were apparently shot for another movie and were accidentally inserted as a means of filming the movie. On the plus side, wildlife images are pretty nice. Among the most significant are Bostwick, who talks to a deer, a decent rock sequence of death, OK gore and Great Jackie Coogan in his final film role as a shocking local sheriff. That's far from Charlie Chaplin, but it was nice to see him. This is for slasher only.
