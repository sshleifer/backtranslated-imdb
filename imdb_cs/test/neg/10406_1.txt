And of course I didn't see it! But when I look at the cast and see that Doug Masters is back from the dead, I know now to avoid it as a plague! I hate it when hollywood, producers, writers, directors, or all of the aforementioned things think viewers are stupid to miss continuity errors. Probably dead Doug Masters, who is coming back, is a big giant, won't you say? And I can't believe anyone like Louis Gossett, Jr. would come back for something like that. Did Jason Gedrick really refuse it? I hate to say it, but even if it took over again, it would still have the same continuity error. I bet (if he really turned it down) he had to be disbelieving that his character had died in the second movie. I probably catch it in late night air on some channel, but I'm not going to rent or buy a DVD!
