I felt like the two hours I spent watching this movie could be better if you could go to a local bookstore and look for old fashion magazines and Halston ads. Or perhaps by observing the dry color. At least, these two jobs would be a little more for me than the "India Song". The most frustrating part of sitting through this was that I saw what moods / atmosphere they were trying to create and the idea of ​​them could be interesting if they were more complementary. Instead of what happened, the introduction of a disparate, silly nonevents chain - with the same scenes over and over, to beat some point into our senses. I didn't like to devote more time to this movie by writing some kind of review, except perhaps warning other people against this waste of time.
