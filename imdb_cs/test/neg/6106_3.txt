My mother told me not to see "Kadosha" - but who ever listens to one's mother? I was so off when I watched that I had to lose my feminist credentials on my way to the theater, so I checked the feminists carrying the cards the next day. No, they also thought it was much more anti-orthodox fry than a pro-feminist statement, painting Orthodox as a straight Taliban. While this Israeli film is cautious to show that the sect of the story is about being ultra ultra-orthodox messianists, it's so ugly that it's incredible (plus that non-fanatical orthodox rock- n'-cylinder (!), one of the sisters is in love, is incredibly sexy--) Even in Israel that must be fantasy). The theater was pretty crowded, so there's a curiosity to see Israeli movies; Too bad this vicious movie is one that spreads widely. That was almost enough to take me back to crazy Hollywood romantic movies. <br /> <br /> (originally written April 29, 2000)
