One of the most scary movies I've ever seen was Carrie (first!). Now, as with other films, they have completely destroyed Carrie's permission with The Rage: Carrie 2. From the beginning, the film moves like a geriatrician in a vanished van. There are hardly any scares and this film is crowded with all the different colleges-sterotypes (ie Football Athlete, bitches cheer-leader, followers and of course black nailpolish wearing misfits). Another sad thing about this show is that you know what happens the moment you see the opening credits. Sure, sure, the girl humiliates and then turns into a crazy psychic ... yawning ... <br /> <br /> They were there. Done. <br /> <br /> Even the actors seem to be forced to do this movie. Emily Bergl is just as scary as a cabbage doll, while Jack London ... let's say I didn't pay to see the Wood Act. In addition to actors, the flasbacks serve more tease than connect with the first film. The Bottom Line, If you can transfer objects around like Carrie, then for the love of God the ray of yourself is a theater ......
