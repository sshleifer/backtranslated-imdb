My wife and I saw it in the theater when it first came out. There were only 3 couples and we all went out at the same time. This is the only movie I've ever gone to. It was just a painful sit. Actually, the theater stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted to return the money. It has never happened before, or since Pleae has not borrowed it. You will really regret it.
