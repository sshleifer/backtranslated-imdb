Granny is definitely one of the worst horror movies ever written in the history of cinema. The script was devilish, so bad in fact that I almost laughed at some of the things they came up with. . Behavior was almost as bad, it would be better if the traffic cones were thrown to play roles (they would do a better job). The murders were ridiculous, the tension did not exist, the camera work was ineffective and the "main" plot at the end was disgustingly inappropriate, just getting worse and worse. "Grandmother" Perhaps one of the most endangered "villains" who have been captured on film seems to be wearing a cheap supermarket mask (nylon hair has caused endless laughter) and a tousled nightgown. Would you be scared of that ??? I'm definitely not. <br /> <br /> If you like watching bad movies (see Manos, Troll 2, Michael Bay Movies ÔÅä), then you need to see it. Those who do not like bad movies and do not like to laugh at the shocking bad dialogue, avoid like a plague.
