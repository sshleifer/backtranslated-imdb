When I went to see this film with me and my GF, we didn't know what to expect, but she assured me that she had good reviews. So I went with it. We entered the cinema and bought tickets and went to the screen. Nobody walked through the door after sitting there waiting for the film to begin. I was very suspicious because you usually get at least a few other people in every film screening. The film started eventually and we sat there. After a moment of very little dialogue and very "false" types of moody scenes, I began to realize why we were the only people there. It was incoherent with random cuts from the main story to the kids in the skate park, the story's that own didn't make sense. The boy was supposed to commit a crime when he didn't, and if he did, writing a letter to no one is the answer, and you shouldn't feel guilty just because you wrote the letter, it should be punished. This film didn't make any sense. I have no idea why we didn't go and put some of the money back in the movie. I tried to give her a chance. There was a small concept for this movie, and the execution was shameful. The writer and director, and almost everyone else who made the film, should have realized what they were doing and stopped. It's an hour plus I never come back. I'm sorry for everyone who liked this movie, but ... it's so bad, I mean, really bad. Oh, at least I never had to be subjected again.
