While it's not really terrible, this movie is still largely a waste of time, and it paints an incredibly inaccurate and revisionist picture of the history of the Beach Boys. Basically, this movie would have believed that Mike Love was the brain behind the band and Brian Wilson was just a pathetic psycho. In fact, none of the characters is developed for a one-dimensional parody, but that's a TV movie, so what do you expect? Unpleasant Odor Mike Love is all over Turkey trying to rewrite history with himself as a band and resident genius. Yeah, like ... <br /> <br /> On the plus side, music is excellent. Unlike the previous Beach Boys, which was made for television bio-pic "Summer Dreams", this film actually presents the real Beach Boys rather than the anemic cover version ... It also presents a surprising number of rarities related to the Beach Boys and rarely - Listened Songs - "I Live for the Sun" is just one example. This film was originally shown in two parts on American television. The first part is superior to two and documents the Boys first days and rises to the top. At a time when two roles are being played, the character of Brian Wilson has become a mere caricature and the actor seems to be playing for laughter - but how could anyone take it seriously? Unless you are a Beach Boys fan, you probably won't have the power of this movie, except for an extremely distorted and one-sided view of the band's history. But then again, why would you watch it if you weren't a fan?
