When a group of stupid children (including unlikable. Racist bitches) stay in the old house, they wake up four murderous Toltec spirits. Can Lash La Rue save the day? You will be able to watch until the end because of the terrible comedy on display. <br /> <br /> "The Dark Power" is a kind of really bad horror / comedy hybrid Troma uses to release regularly. The thing is, no. release it. This does not excuse the whole thing because it has a terrible synthesizer score (including bad attempts at native American music and even worse "comedy" music), bad makeup effects (basically Halloween masks) and harsh games (Ok, fat guy was fine Although everyone else is horrible, and La Rue, a western film veterinarian, seems embarrassed not to be there - not that I blamed him really. But the worst is comedy aspects. Certainly, stupid teens are one thing, but when the film is still talking about Toltec spirits as if they were the worst evil, just to show that they are terribly poisonous, dull fools, all hope is broken. The combination of horror and comedy has at least some skill. There is no skill on display here because it is all just stupid and not "so stupid it's fun" either. I mean "smoking pots and listening to bad Punk Rock I'm not stupid" stupid. Even a decent torn face and a cat in little clothes can't save this catastrophe. Terrible movie, and not worth renting.
