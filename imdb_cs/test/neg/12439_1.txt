Once in a while I came across a movie that is so embarrassingly bad why movies are there. That's one of them. This is a terrible attempt to parody the Godfather with annoying sounds and bad dialogue. Eddie Deezen is just as annoying as Tony, an annoying fool who asks his father, Don (William Hickey), for a family business. Tony, as I said, is an annoying little jerk. This makes the whole film a mess. The movie is terribly daffy. It's too cartoonish. The main point I'm trying to make is that you can't parody a recognized drama like the Godfather with so much cartoonism. That's not how it works. Believe it or not, you have to take a parody of a dramatic movie seriously. If you don't take it seriously, it will feel like a parody. The point is, you are parodying that you can't seem to be a parody. You have to make it look like you're going to take the movie a little seriously. It's also a feeling that they're just mocking Woody Allen, and that's what makes this movie absolutely awful.
