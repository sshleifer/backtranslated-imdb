If this is not strongly stated on every "no-watch" list, it should be just because those who keep that list are not aware of its existence, which, if it is, is an acceptable alternative. I'm not kidding, that's a bad movie. Joseph Meeker returns from the dead, with various indeterminate, undefined supernatural powers from which he most employs, seems to appear in new, still comically looking and ridiculous (and never scary or haunted ... in general, when it comes to you) of them, that's just bizarre, and attempts at the former just don't work, period) clothes and stereotypes / archetypes, and he is portrayed by David Keith (whom I respect in ... well, at least Daredevil), doing more often than not terribly contradictory ( which could also have to do with the script) and often over the top performance. A character or two have personalities so incredibly irritating that they are painful to watch. Editing thinks it's a lot smarter than it really is (and what on Earth was with a red tint for flashes?). Camera ... oh, dear. Framing, coverage, effective use of the angle (that could possibly be attributed to adjustments), please, guys, stop me when I say something you've ever heard about existence. As for the technical side, it is a pretty bad excuse for something that would be better suited to the projector than an unexposed film. But why stop there? The plot is bad. The basic idea was completed and it was done much better than this (Crow would be one). The way it is said is unusual, and while there is some explanation for the flashes of memories, it still does not satisfy. Stimulation is about non-existence. Leadership is clearly unlikely and there is more personality in the barn door, not to mention that they are also much less wooden. Kelly Perine and Thomas Ian Nicholas? What in the name of everything that is good and just (pun) do you do in this? Perine, you were fun before, at The Drew Carey Show, Nicholas, well, I didn't see you in anything that preceded American Pie, but if nothing else, you were * fun later and in those productions, amusement it was intentional. The dialogue is ... the less so, the better. Language is unlimited and tends to be stupid. Violence is imperfectly done, nor does it seem to try to hide it (suggesting it could be a smarter strategy). Characters, don't get me. Why spend so much energy on displaying insensitive, sometimes totally illogical events? The more you think about it, the worse it will be. It's not even passable as a "bad horror swing" or B movie (it can very well go through the rest of the alphabet, and go further), it couldn't scare you to the scariest day of your life if it had an electrified machine. I only recommend it to people who want to disprove how bad it is and don't say I warned you. 1/10
