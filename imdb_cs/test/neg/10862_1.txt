This movie Oh My God, this movie is so poor, I'm impressed that I managed to watch everything .. <br /> <br /> First I want to say that Vinny Jones should only play London thieves, that's the end of the story Pisttolero is so unconvincing with his almost comedy .. Banging in Dennis Hopper and David Carradine didn't save this movie .. in fact, I think it's a complete comedy and as a comedy it deserves it. 1 star .. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost .. Vinny Oh my God I thought I saw it all when he played the Irish Tinker: P <br /> <br /> I think the average viewer will realize that this movie is probably never going to be a movie type .. I can't see how anyone could actually fall into this crap
