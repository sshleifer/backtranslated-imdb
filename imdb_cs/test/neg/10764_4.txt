Back in college, I studied marketing, and although I missed a lot of courses and never paid any attention, I always remember the main and most basic principle of marketing: it's not what you sell; it's how you sell it! This principle fully applies to "Devil's Triangle" because it is basically a beautifully wrapped and tempting but empty package. Writer / director Richard Winer knew exactly that he had to distract the viewer from the main inaccuracies, so he cast some elements that will never succeed in providing a spooky atmosphere, such as the sinister voice of Vincent Price's narrator and the quirky music of King Crimson. And I guess the dirty tricks of Richard Winer worked very effectively, because in the mid-1970s, a huge triumph of the Bermuda Triangle and virtually every film production took place? whether the documentary was inaccurate or modest exploitation? Covering the topic earned big money at the box office. "Devil's Triangle" will overwhelm you with data that is unstructured and often irrelevant, but the dramatic factualization and, of course, the intimidating sharp voice of the all-powerful Vincent Price creates an atmosphere of fear and scary. The narrative keeps going back and forth in time, covering a vast array of "strange events" and "mysterious disappearances" of ships and aircraft in the Bermuda Triangle for almost a century, but the news remains very vague, and the telling Mr. Price always ends every chapter with a sinister word "just another unsolved mystery of the Devil's Triangle? ' After a few instances, the whole formula simply becomes ridiculous and almost pathetic, but I think it has caused true mass hysteria as early as 1974. The document extends somewhat to the most famous secret of the Bermuda Triangle, such as the five aircraft of military flight 19 inexplicably disappeared and the strange case USS Cyclops, but only in these chapters is the minimum of information that could be operated. Cameras never go underwater in one place to explore, for example, the depth of the Bermuda region, and the testimony of the allegedly real life witnesses of the drama suspiciously looks like staged acting scenes. If you are looking for an informative and objective document about the Bermuda Triangle, I would definitely not recommend this movie, but if you want to sit and listen to the hypnotizing voice of Vincent Price for almost an hour, this is your chance!
