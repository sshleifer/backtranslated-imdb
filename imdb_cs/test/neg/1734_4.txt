I rented this movie with a friend for a good laugh. In fact, we laughed at the video store clerk for our dubious film tastes. Unfortunately, I don't remember the first half of the movie because everything I did was staring at the giant metal braces Jane wore. and I didn't hear anything about the incomprehensible lisp. Another thing that was able to grab my attention next to her metal mouth was her questionable fashion. This film was made in 2005, but the wardrobe seems to have jumped all the way back to 2000 for clothes. If you remember the days when Aaron Carter was considered a "popstar" and you like high waist jeans, ankle socks and skirts to your knees, then this little memory trip is perfect for you.
