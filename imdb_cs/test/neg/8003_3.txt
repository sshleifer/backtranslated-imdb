Boring, cliché and predictable. The only original piece was Brighton's location for gangsters. This is certainly not "Lock Stock etc ......." Hannah was likeable in "Sliding Door". I didn't develop any empathy with his character in the "circus" and I couldn't give what happened to him or his girlfriend. Although this movie was so cliché and the foreseeable end was not a surprise, I was so uninteresting, nor did I care about why the movie got the name "Circus" ....... Booooring ....... Don t visit this great peak.
