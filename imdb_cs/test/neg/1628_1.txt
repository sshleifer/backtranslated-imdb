Nobody wanted a sequel that nobody asked for a movie. There is probably too many mistakes with this movie to name it, so I'll just focus on acting. Miles O'Keefe would be more appropriate to play Asian sidekick Thong spitely, mainly because he would have no dialogue. Lisa Foster delivers her lines showing one emotion, numbness. Charles Borremel brings life to his part by stopping every five words. And finally the amazing, John Saxon-type guy ...... no need to comment. <br /> <br /> Check out "Conan the Barbarian" if you need to, but don't waste time with this low. -ztracen√≠.
