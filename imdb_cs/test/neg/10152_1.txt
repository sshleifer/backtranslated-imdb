I will not even comment on what piece of waste this film has been created ever since. However, observing it with my friends we all laughed out loud when the leading girl did a Shelley Hack link on the phone. We sat there and tried to find out why the writer put her in the mix. We can only assume he had Charlie's Angels fixed. Based on this reference, we assumed that this film must be created around Charlie's Angels, which took place in 1979 or 1980, but from what I read here was created around 1987. you don't know. It looks like a college student did it for a film class. And although in any case I would not expect a low budget like this to be politically correct, it would certainly like this movie to direct the derogatory gay comments. Even so, I still thought it was the second worst horror movie ever made, the second for "Nail Gun Massacre".
