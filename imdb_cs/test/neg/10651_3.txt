No matter how serious the logical gaps are, never mind that this is a cliché of character, despite random writing, and you may like this movie. The main character Alyssa was supposed to be a cute, heroine you preach to be saved (or in this case to save yourself), but instead she just grows, and makes one miracle, are they all really stupid for ballerinas? Her busby mother was obviously only needed to further spread the illusion that ballet societies were evil monsters ready to rip your poor, innocent, young girl out of your grip, with the ever-present, biting artistic director / villain. And cliché! Not only does it become anorexic, bulemical, drug addict and pathological liar, but over a few months. It's like a writer reading every horror story that could kick out a ballet and decided to figure out how much he could get in two hours (with ads). Believe it or not, but I'm a dancer. This "rebellion" or "resurrection" of anorexia and bulemia that happens does not exist in all the dance schools I attended. In fact, the teachers are so frightened that they don't even think that a girl could become a better chance by a few pounds, most of the dancers in my class would actually be considered a little overweight. I'm not saying that eating disorders will never occur, but not to the extent they were displayed in the movie. Another unpleasant problem with this movie was the style of writing at the end. Her once again out of boyfriend apparently had a full half hour of total screen, all in the first half. Other supporting figures were only props, decorations, to keep this story going. Given the proper dialogue, this would be a very difficult study of a psychological problem. As it is, it turns into one woman show, and Kimberly McCullough doesn't chutzpah pull her away. On a non dancer, this movie should be "insight" into what really goes behind closed doors in a ballet company. The dancer is a very offensive film that portrays the ballerinas as stupid and parents who are tricky and sick. These adjectives more accurately describe people who got it first. 3/10
