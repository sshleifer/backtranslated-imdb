I was looking at this movie a few days ago and it was horrible! <br /> <br /> Amazingly Long - Even though they've managed to skip most of their lives! The horribly boring - the parts that included were windy for a long time and for some reason the director decided to cut off some of the events and left huge parts of the film inexplicable! Awfully inaccurate - the whole "mystical" side of this movie was a joke and the last time I checked Ghengis Khan wasn't a very nice guy! He behaved terribly - a few characters I couldn't believe found out that they were very two-dimensional and lacking and kind of depth! The film's cinema was an economical grace. That's why I gave this movie more 2 stars than the bare minimum! But if you want to look at something nice, I would recommend buying a picture instead! Overall, this film was a terrible waste of my time and money! Please do yourself a favor and give this Mongolian turkey a miss!
