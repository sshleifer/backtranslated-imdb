Dennis Quaid tries hard to prove that Jerry Lee Lewis was a stupid guy. And it does too much to prove it. TV sequences are very good as photocopies of old black and white shots. Music is also fine because Mr. Lewis himself sings. But the rest is just a Hollywood B-film style, with the Happy Days fifty. I think the only good thing about this movie is to see young Winon Ryder.
