Imagine it: high school. In addition to boarding school, children have no parents around them. And it's in Malibu. And the kids are all thin, white and gorgeous, with an exceptional token minority or fat guy playing a "weird" outcast. And there are no reasonable rules such as how they have shared housing, nuclear weapons in their dorms, coffee stands, sushi bar and a free laptop per student. Here's the story: A girl, Zoey Brooks, attends a PCA, formerly an all-boys school. She is absolutely perfect in every way she is smart, beautiful, skinny, athletic, creative and everything a perfectionist wants. Almost all boys in school want her and every girl wants to be her girlfriend. It's the one that everybody comes up to, the one who saves the day with a simple plan, and it's just amazing. Too bad none of this is her liking. We should believe that if we don't even get close to Zoey's perfection, are we bad people? In the show, nothing is her fault, and if someone contradicts her, they are depicted as a bad man (Logan). It may be a jerk, but at least she has a brain that she thinks is instead of always agreeing with the princess. Her loyal group of blind followers is: Chase, the average stupid ass who has a secret love for her, Michael, the black boy token (and the only decent actor on the scene), Lola, would-be actress and anorexic, snob airhead, Quinn, a clever but clueless girl when it comes to teenage stuff and Logan, a rich jerk who has a soft side. Yeah, this show basically spews stereotypes. But what bothers me is that everyone is trying to pretend to be normal children. They complain that Logan is getting too much money when they have to work on their own, even though they go to too good a school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can't afford. They drink coffee and eat sushi regularly, barely having homework and sunbathing almost every day. Wow, it's hard! Any other problems? I'm too good looking, rich and stress free! I think Zoey 101 (what is 101?) Is Nick's attempt at a realistic picture of teens. Except that they saw reality, he didn't like it, and they decided to give children lives like donkeys on the hills. But hey, at least a nice set.
