I wouldn't deny that I enjoyed watching some Japanese horror movies, but each of them has to be crushed enough to see the same thing over and over again. The film follows the story of Grudge. Audrey, as her mother asked, gets her sister back. But when she comes, something special happens to her sister and then her sister is killed. He wants to find out the truth behind the curse and later a photographer (Eason) joins her. On the other hand, there is also something going on with the family and the three girls, but they seem to realize it too late ... \ t finds in movies as they are not (quite) related to the story. The reason why a woman holds resentment still kills people is still not very clear (it seems to me that they say the same things I saw in spite of). And Audrey's sudden appearance in front of the boy is undoubtedly special, which in my opinion is an attempt to create a family story. The murderous scenes are a mixture of those in the ring and the shibuya kaidan. Behavior would be another bad point. As Hong Konger, I would really like to support Edison Chen's first efforts in Hollywood, but as a movie lover, I really can't find any point to promote bad acting. Other actors like the father, although appearing in several scenes, should also do better. The atmosphere of the film is also good, especially when I watched it in the middle of the night alone. If you have the time, really enjoy the horror movies and have seen all the possible horror movies. Besides, like me, you can go for it to kill some time. But if you really like Japanese horror movies of this kind, you should spend some time watching the Japanese version of Ring.
