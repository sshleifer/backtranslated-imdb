The video box for 'Joyride' says "play second generation superstars", and one can't help but feel sad. It is true that Melanie Griffith continued to do bigger and better things ... but who cares about the rest of the cast? So with the fact that it's a pathetic attention grabber to the box I was foolish enough to buy a movie for a dollar thinking I'd be in the country 'so-bad-they are-good 70s' movies, not so much. While so many aimless 70s young films (or films from the 1970s) have tried to say something deep and meaningful, "Joyride" doesn't even try. It's just aimless. It is of no interest. Every character is so poorly conceived that it is no wonder that these actors look so helpless. In short, the film is about thirty-two hours who go to Alaska to start a business, but instead they robbed and then have to find a job. They break up, eat dog food, steal cars, rob banks. It's all very typical, but it is done in the strictest way possible. There are no surprises and the flow is so bad, and the action figures so ambiguous that you can miss a few scenes and never mind. But if you're a fan of Melanie Griffith's breasts - then it's visible. This is not yet enough to be above the lowest possible rating. Best Line: "Jesus, everything is biology with you." * outside ****
