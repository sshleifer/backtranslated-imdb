The best way to have fun in this movie is to calculate how many clich√©s are rehashing. A snarl of Chinese gangsters. Female Vice President. A ventilation channel that is big enough to fit on a big Caucasian man. Shooting through the wall to kill the wrong one. A situation where some innocent people need to be thrown out to prevent Armageddon. Independence Day scene where you snort some memorable landmarks in a fireball. Vice President in a nicely lit room surrounded by subordinates while a Chinese prime minister practically alone in a dark room with a little faint light shining, snarling as ominously as a slimy gangster. The lone hero remained alone in the ship (building, plane, anything) that triggered a baffle on clueless bad guys with large automatic weapons. Etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> The second best way is to calculate how much zero you need to accurately determine the probability of a movie scenario after the decimal point. I added up to 45. The President agreed to a meeting aboard a private vessel. Incredibly unbeatable command from the nuke box. The part in which the Chinese decided to fire. Etc. Earth man is most likely to fall into the sun to make this film. I admit that the film was interesting until the criminals of Taiwanese gangsters kidnapped the president. Then boredom surfaced. Stopping disbelief and I started thinking about the fun I would torture this movie ...
