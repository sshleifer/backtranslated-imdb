I've always loved horrific movements. From some usual known as "Exorcist" to some of the more underestimated as "Black Christmas" or "Just Before Dawn". But those who are kidding do even call this b-film waste. It's upside down Z-grade. Acting is the worst on the film. I really saw better on the episode "Young and the Restless" ... SPOILER ... Lookout Tower, when a woman tells them about the Jack legend. Sometimes she stops for a few seconds, as if someone is blinking her cue cards and she is trying to read her lines. INSURGENCY! Oh, and besides bad acting, absolutely no gore or F / X. And Jack-o looked like a plastic pumpkin. Watch Linne Quigley in "The Night of Demons", or "Silent Night, Deadly Night", far better moves.
