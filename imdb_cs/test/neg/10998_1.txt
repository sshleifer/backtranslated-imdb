If you like really shocking movies, it's for you. Acting is the worst I've ever seen, and the storyline goes no-where. If you come across this movie in your video store, don't even consider renting it. The chick on the front cover isn't even the one in the movie. I just gave this movie 1/10 because I couldn't vote 0. Avoid at any cost.
