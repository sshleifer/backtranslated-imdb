As a New Orleans native, I can say that almost everything in this film, from the ghostly N'Awlins dialect to the highly creative "manipulation" of Crescent City's geography, is terrible. This is another of the big Hollywood movies that opt ​​for the New Orleans stereotype as: 1. A city full of French-sounding idiots 2. A city full of people who sound like they have just returned from a summer home Blanche Dubois 3 The City of Drunkards where it is Every day Mardi Gras 4. A city of deep mystery where almost everyone is practicing or is a victim of voodoo (I admit that maybe we are a drunken city, although Mardi Gras is NOT every day). "The Big Easy" is one of the worst movies about New Orleans. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
