Meh, it's really all for me. Boring story, bland dialogue, boring action scenes (HOW do you do something like a fight or boredom shootout? Do you really have to try to do it?), No real characters, etc. Just boring. Snipes is a talented actor and physical artist, but none of this has come to the surface in any of his DTV work, when there is an opportunity for viewers to get a much better product than they are used to. Imagine a decent scenario with a few solid characters you care about, and some damn explosive action, fighting, firefighting, etc. How can it be difficult to handle? My personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions don't care. There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they do. Look at Snipes in the first 2 blades, passenger 57, rising sun, new Jack City, demolition man, etc.? An amazing, intense performance complete with decent (if not always excellent) scenarios, good support casts and bad actions. None of this is yet apparent in any of these versions, which is a great pity. Distributors hit Wesley's face on the cover because they knew the audience would be on the bike because they hadn't realized they hadn't seen him in the theaters for nearly two years. <br /> <br /> I'd like to see Snipes working with someone like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most of DTV production and work with Alpha Stunts who are just one of the best events. Together, they would all make a great team and a Snipes action vehicle that we would all be proud of. The detonator is on suction. It's not as bad as the Sagittarius who chews, but it's still really shit.
