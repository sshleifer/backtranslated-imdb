This is one of those wonderful martial arts movies that begin with two owners of hard gang members who are in front of them in the park; and when the deal goes wrong and the battle begins, it turns out everyone knows karate and kung fu! Still-Wooden Cynthia Rothrock plays (as usual) a cynical, dead, good cop, this time in Los Angeles. She and her police partners are trying to break the fake, and when the conspiracy is exhausted, the story switches to something else and Cynthia becomes the personal guardian of a rich, great-looking mogul. As part of the film's apparently rock-bottom budget, there is some helicopter action, some boat action, some car chases, a brawl where Cynthia beats everyone in the country-west bar, some pools of scenes with bimbos in thong bikinis, and a surprisingly good ride on horse. About a dozen and a half cops are shot. There are lots of twists that don't make sense; don't worry about them. (And the currency counterfeiting is a federal crime, so where is the FBI hell? I think they were too busy.) The choreography was done by Cynthia Rothrock's frequent teammate Richard Taylor, whose elegant and witty presence in front of the camera Honestly, this better film. He also tended to make Cynthia a better actress when they appeared together and, frankly, could use it; She seems to be tired and bored, and she does her best at GUARDIAN ANGEL while playing opposite the dog she gives bitter drunken monologues. The dog will bring her out! She also wears some of the most god-awful clothes any leading lady ever wore in every movie: loose, baggy-pants-pants with pale sour-washed areas above each buttocks were the most shocking. The other actors are all over the map. You can imagine that many tiny characters are occupied this way: "Look, I and some other guys I know will be in the movie. Do you want to be in it too? No, buddy, I'm serious! ‚ÄùThen there are slumming professionals: Lydie Denier, the stunning French model and veteran of the Red Shoe Diaries, Baywatch, Melrose Place, and many, many other variations on sexy french bomb; Here he plays a psychopathic killer, as if she were in BAISEZ-MOI or in the episode "Alias" and not some kind of basket. There is also a tall, dark and handsome Daniel McVicar, now regular on "Bold and Beautiful," John O'Leary, who played a dignified old man in dozens of movies and sitcom episodes and does it again here, and Aharon Ipale, a veteran Arab actor maybe best known as "Pharaoh Seti" from MUMMY and MUMMY RETURNS. For these professionals, GUARDIAN ANGEL must be the most ridiculous entry to their resume. I gave this movie a better rating than it deserved because my daughters, who are thrilled martial arts students, wanted to see a woman who kicks her ass and has big action scenes to change. They are still too young to care for what is a poor picture, and they just enjoyed cheering on Cynthia when they were doing spiral, high-hockey stuff. If you like this kind of movie, you can probably enjoy it at this level.
