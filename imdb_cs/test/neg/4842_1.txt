I mean, come on! Now my countrymen have started making westerns! Isn't it enough that our cinema is already sucking in? Now you have to infect films in English with Polish acting and no meaning? Please stay away from this movie, don't lose sight of it. A five-year-old could make a movie that makes more sense. I'm from Poland and I'm ashamed of watching this title. Please, please DO NOT LEAVE this movie and if so, DO NOT UNDERSTAND Polish people and Polish movies based on what you see. We had some good movies in our history and we had some bad ones, but this - it's like nothing worse than I've seen in my whole life. Stay away !!!
