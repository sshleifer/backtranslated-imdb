Ladies and gentlemen, let us introduce you. Toltecs! This ancient Latin American tribe, even the previous Aztecs, reportedly had the most deadly and bloodthirsty wizards, yet the donkeys scared a couple of strollers and a one-seven-year-old lawyer with a whip! But before you look at it, you have to fight over 40 minutes of total boredom, infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that contain no real sleaze. If I haven't been quite clear: "The Dark Power" is an indescribably kitschy and clumsy piece of horror that is getting worse and still having fun because it has a totally enchanting factor of stupidity. Of course, writer / director Phil Smoot's intentions were admirable, but he? as well as the rest of the cast and crew? he lacked the talent and money to add half. Smoot watched "The Evil Dead" and other similar demonic movies carefully, and somehow he thought he could pull it out. The film opens with an old Indian man dying in his isolated country house; barely speaks of his last word over whisper ?? Toltecs. His grandson instantly rents a house to a lot of college chicks, including typically 80 year old aerobics, cute black girls and racists. Soon he finds out why exactly this old Indian lived as a hermit because he was actually the guardian of the ancient Toltec burial ground. The Toltec sorcerers were buried alive, only to reappear thousands of years later and to live a living body. And honestly, is there any better tasting meat than bimbos? As already indicated, the first half of "The Dark Power" is terribly lame and causes sleep. The clich√© of jokes, retarded dialogues, and the ridiculously elongated shots of Lash LaRue, which swing around his whip, seem to continue forever. Then the film loses the last smidgen of credibility when the Toltec sorcerers emerge from the ground. Instead of menacing, they look like dazed hard rock stars with imbecile masks and drunken gestures. Exactly ONE Gory's moment is worth noting when a person's lips are stretched over his entire skull, but overall, the massacre aspect of this film is disappointing. The only remotely valuable moments are absolutely nonsensical, like when a 9-year-old child (named Cletus!) Meets his uncle truck or when a vulgar naked chick drinks beer in a bath after work. Seriously, if you don't get turned on looking at a western 1940s veteran who doesn't move around the whip, I'd like to skip this movie.
