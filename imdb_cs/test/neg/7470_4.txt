This film was nothing more than an exploitative gay cheesecake. It was not an "artistic" film; just an excuse to show a few gratuitous, exploitative, over-the-top scenes with extensive male genital nudity. There was a dressing room with more than a dozen naked men involved. The camera approaches the male donkeys and penis because they are displayed for a few minutes with their birds in full screen. There are several scenes in this film showing the penis after the penis. It is a redundant REAL fast and makes it impossible to take this film seriously. I wonder if I accidentally watched a Playgirl video. If these scenes were filmed with women (eg, Absolutely Naked and Repeatedly Showing Their Vaginas), it would be quickly rejected as just erotic pornography and an excuse to show a lot of eye candy ... which is all this movie Yippee. Any artistic merit disappeared by the outflow of gay mentality. Topics of class discrimination, homosexuality, desire for desire, etc. were simple and superficial; not more developed than what one would expect from a student of the first year's philosophy. Just cut the chase and rent gay porn instead.
