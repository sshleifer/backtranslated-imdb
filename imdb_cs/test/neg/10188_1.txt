This movie was the main bait and switch. I rented it for Rebecca St. James, a popular Christian singer. I met her and wondered what she would do in the UFO movie. Well ....... <br /> <br /> I think she played in this movie to help a friend or friend of a friend. My first idea was that this film wasn't what it was meant to be when I witnessed the special effects of a UFO meeting. Raw! As the film went on, I noticed how the plastic actors were. It was funny, as almost everyone in the film wore solid colors. (There are several exceptions). Rebecca disappointed. She is always found in the house and does not show the realistic facial expressions of the man whose husband has returned to the fold. Doesn't he leave the house? <br /> <br /> I had to turn the movie off several times to finish it. I hope Rebecca does not believe the message of this film - they believe in what we believe or suffer and go to hell. Jesus spread the message of love and hope. His message inspired others to change OUT OF LOVE.
