WARNING: I recommend to anyone who has not yet seen this movie to read this comment. <br /> <br /> If you're planning to watch this movie, SHOULD NOT! I warn you ... this film is boring and basically scary, not in Horror, how to watch. I mistook this Piranha movie for another Piranha movie, and when I noticed that I made a mistake, I decided to see it anyway. I wish I didn't. This film is so awful and so unbearable in every piece of material that I couldn't let anyone say that this movie was halfway. For one thing, this movie should be called a boring conversation about wilderness instead of Piranha. They only show the pirates ONCE! At the same time, as this movie sounds so bad to hear, I'm sleepy just 20 minutes to the point. Finally, my mouth was wide open and I looked at the blank TV screen. It is a very badly directed and badly filmed piece of junk that I feared after following a brain dysfunction ...
