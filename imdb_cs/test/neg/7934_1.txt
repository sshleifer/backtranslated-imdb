I was looking for ATTACK in precinct 13. There is the movie that is unforgettable. Who's the star? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can't say who the main actor is, that's a pretty big point against the movie right here) Gabriel Byrne (who couldn't have needed the money so badly, could he?) Drea De Matteo is overwhelming but just for his amazing body. It took me ages to finally develop Joey's sister from "Friends". I agree that the so-called SWAT people attacking the station are tactical enough in terms of tactics. We even learned better basic skills than in basic RAF training. <br /> <br /> Avoid it, not even the snow wants to drop on a bus full of prisoners! Very bad continuity really. <br /> <br /> Avoid the plague!
