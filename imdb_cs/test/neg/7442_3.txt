Unfortunately, producers do not know when to leave themselves alone, or are recycled to the point that any pigeon waste generated by Hollywood is to get to Alpa. Every sci-fi action adventure film seems to have to endure a sad list of follow-up movies and Robocop is a tragic example. The first film, led by Paul Verhoven, was a wild, stylish ride, even time for a little social commentary on what the dark side of biotechnology can transform into us. This film has none of that, except that it may tell us that drugs are bad for you and could make you feel sorry for being sober. Robocop 2 lacks a vision, a deeply frightening vision of what we are becoming, and instead clumsily takes us on a boat trip to how truly unhappy drug dealers and their victims are. Social commentary is damned. This one is really the big one for me. If you don't care about anything other than SFX, go for it, friend. Otherwise, do not waste your time with this yeast acid cake and store the precisely measured, heavily weighted pumpernickle hot foil from the oven. It's so simple.
