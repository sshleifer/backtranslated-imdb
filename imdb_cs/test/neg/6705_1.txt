Despite the fact that "The House of Adam" is intended as a mainstream gay film; it Anthony (John Shaw) who is gay curious and the main cutie-hunk and Adam (Jared Cadwell) who is openly gay, and close second in appearance; that there is a whole minute of wonderful, compelling and nude lovemaking (sorry, no frontal) between Anthony and Adam for 41 minutes in the movie (that alone can be enough for many of us) --- no matter what (to which I am to put a thumb up), "House of Adam" is a terrible movie mostly by some other film standard. Big thumb down. Shaw's and Cadwell's acting abilities are either sophomoric, or otherwise they really suffer from a bad script, direction and cut, or rather lack. However, their loving scene is convincing, and may have more in common with their actual being, with the rest of their scripting and playing. as far as his film skills are concerned, he is out of the wall. So the script and its lack is thumb down. Overall, acting is the thumb down with the smallest exception for Shaw and Cadwell. Alexis Karriker as Nina could be the best, with the exception of the above limitations. Far and far the absolute worst, and unbearable, playing was Thomas Michael Kappier as Albert Ross, Anthony's father does not even have an elementary school of acting quality. Indeed, it is a colossal casting failure. <br /> <br /> Actors playing new cabin owners are also worthy of really bad acting nominations. <br /> <br /> As far as production, editing and postproduction are concerned, as well as the trailer, this movie would be quite different. The trailer presents well-assembled clips of scenes that have dragged me into the movie primarily. That, and the hope that this gay-centered film, was reportedly played prominently and offered at gay film festivals. Overall, the film is a big thumb down. Is it worth buying / renting and watching it? Only if you have an irresistible yen to see the naked love that makes the scene, and a few minutes of semi-convincing dialogue between Anthony and Adam. Or if you really just enjoy watching bad movies.
