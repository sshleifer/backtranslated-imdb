Cops Logan Alexander and Debbie Rochon escort five black teen cross country offenders and end up stuck in sticks when their van breaks down. After a deadly run-in with a racist, white fake bitch with a shotgun (played by the director), the surviving refuge in the house is a blind voodoo priestess. One of the teens unreasonably uses a spell to call Killjoy, who finally appears halfway through this hole in the make-up workshop and bigger, greaser that looks like she could ever slip out of her head. He then continues to kill silly characters while spouting some of the worst one-liners heard because Hee Haw has been canceled. Playing from "Teens" is terrible, the dialogue gets worse, FX stinks and looks much cheaper than the first movie. Although I enjoyed it in his earlier films Troma, Trent Haaga (trying to emulate Jim Carrey here) is a terrible and no hyper overemoting match for Angel Vargas in KILLJOY 1 (which had at least some silly laughs). Yet another nail in the Full Moon studio coffin, whose reputation as a live direct-to-view series disappears completely from TRANCERS / PUPPET MASTER days.
