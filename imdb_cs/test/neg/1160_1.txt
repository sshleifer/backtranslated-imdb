PLEASE people! Don't bother with this badly directed joke. The direction was completely wrong from the beginning. Where is the history of mother's emotional disturbance and the general madness of the original family? Why is ED portrayed as this great, revolutionary, formidable figure full of anger and hatred? What's that bullshit? The writer and director apparently did not do any history research and wanted only cash on the infamous name of Gein. Fools who made this film took so much freedom with the truth, it is ridiculous. If you want to see a great Gein movie. Go back to the smaller classic "Deranged" to see how Ed really was. There is humor in that movie, and Ed is portrayed as the more sad, lonely gentle man he was, according to HISTORY. Where is the background story? There are only poorly set-up shocks (which are not shocking) that we have seen before, and more perfect as well. Take the worst Texas Chainsaw Massacre and add this to this list. I had to put the ONE out of ten because it wouldn't accept zero. I want my money back. If someone considers this movie "overwhelming", it can do so.
