This movie was terrible. It's not something people should pay to see it. It looks like a Christian group has turned it into people. I don't understand why it was released to theaters and not to television. About 30 minutes into the movie characters start talking about "God" and "Do you believe in Jesus?" He quickly moves into a purely religious territory. <br /> <br /> I thought I was going to Sci-Fi. The film has a bad effect; wrong camera angle and is amateur. <br /> <br /> AVOID THEM!
