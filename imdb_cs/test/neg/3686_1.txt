Last month I suffered from watching this film at Sitges. If there was a possibility of an "unfilm" movie to prevent it from being, it should be the first in the list. María Lidón is not a director, she is just a stupid woman who pretends to hold the camera with her hand and shout "action" makes her a professional filmmaker. What a mistake! The film itself is meaningless and it is a complete waste of good actors who could do something better in another project. Val Kilmer does nothing but just puts his face in front of the camera. His character in the film has no specific weight. The same can be said about Joss Ackland, Vincent Gall or Joaquim De Almeid. It's a shame how the figure of Rade Serbedzije was built. SPOILERS WARNING <br /> <br /> Spends most of the time alone in the tunnels where he talks with himself (now I'm doing it, now I'm a little bat, I'll be looking in the bag, now I turned left, now I turned right .. .) just to give viewers a clear picture of his actions. It's just nonsense and proves the director's lack of talent. THE END OF SPOILERS <br /> <br /> The usual joke about this piece of garbage among the audience was that the title of the film itself brought the notion of rating everyone should give: ZERO
