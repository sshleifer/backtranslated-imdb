It is hard to imagine what they were thinking about when they made this film (ie Writers, Directors, Producers, Actors, Editors, etc.). Christopher Plummer, a veteran of 129 movies, frolics together among dozens of other actors with apparently not more motivation than collecting paychecks. I think there's nothing wrong with that, but once they're paid, it doesn't mean anyone has to follow it. <br /> <br /> I miss that there are really good reviews for this movie here on imdb. Art? If you want to see the art of going to the gallery, don't watch this movie. Comedy? Watch the re-run Flintstones, about the same plot with less waste time. Dabney Coleman gives his usual performance for better or worse. And some of the young actors may have had some good experience with this movie. Ale Plummer ???? It was embarrassing to watch his performance, in fact I was positively transfixed to him throughout the movie because I knew it was Plummer of Sound of Music Fame! I see from his bio that he called the Sound of Music "the sound of mucus," so guess he didn't like the 100 million people who liked him. I wonder if today he asked him how you rate the Sound of Music compared to where the heart is, what would he say .....? Probably something like "Where is the money".
