This movie is sooooo bad that forced me to create an account with IMDb just to warn others about it. I've been using IMDb for a long time, and many movies have come close to wanting me to register with either praise or bash's, but none have ever been so kind. Until now! I'm a huge Matt Dillon fan. all I could ask in this movie is "how did Dillon choose this scenario"? really. I mean, there's holes larger than Vredefort in it. I mean, this is a modern day heist film, not one set in the seventies. For shouting loudly, even a child knows that armored cars have GPS tracking and kind. Makes you wonder what it means to get a script made in Hollywood. I could go forever, but I'm used to it. Trust me if I say so. save time and skip it. Sorry Matt, I'm still a fan, but this movie is being sucked.
