This is one of those "family" movies that I can't imagine being much liked by anyone over 9. A group of siblings is discovering a "sandy fairy" (yes, indeed), located at the end of a secret passage in their country an eccentric uncle to whom they were evacuated from London lightning. ... and there you have it, all in one sentence. The story is about the role of magic in childhood and the danger of fulfilling wishes, but neither of these questions is examined in a way that is interesting to adults or informative to children (or vice versa!). The only reason I think I'm looking at this is to see how the outstanding talent of Freddie Highmore stands out from the rest of the average performance.
