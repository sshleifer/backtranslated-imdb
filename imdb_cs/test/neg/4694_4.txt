First Viewed 12/26/2008 - (Dir-Eugene Levy): The Secret of Corny's Comedy Murder with Very Little Laughter. The film seems to be based on earlier Italian film credits but was re-written by two quite popular American romantic comedy writers. But this from Charles Shyer & Nancy Meyers does not break this compared to their next effort. The story is about a couple of down-and-out traveling Americans, played by Richard Lewis and Sean Young, who stumbled upon a lost dog and hoping for luck in rewarding money after seeing an ad in the newspaper for dachsund return. When he tries to return, he sees a hand protruding from the garage door in the lady's residence, which they think is attached to the rest of the woman's dead body to give them money. They look and instead turn to the police and tell them the truth of how they do it, as a scene that expects to be ready for murder. Other characters in the film meet on the train before that and hang around Monte Carlo, where they do different things to be drawn into the story. Other cast members include John Candy, James Belushi, Cybill Shepherd, George Hamilton, and others. After the police learn about the death, they start asking about the main characters and, of course, they will have to work through their goofy lies to find out what really happened. None of the actors mentioned earlier can bring this film out of its average state, despite some funny moments that are usually provided by a couple of Belushi / Shepherd. It's not a horrible movie, it's just not that good. There is a lot of average movies out there, and that's just another one for the pile. Try it, maybe you will, probably not.
