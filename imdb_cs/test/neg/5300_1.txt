Uma and Travolta were very good together, but - unfortunately - when they left the screen, the film was nothing more than a lot of very boring and stupid secondary characters wrapped in some extremely bad writing. Occasional views of size, such as the dance scene between Uma and Travolta, quickly eroded when the lovers of Harvey Keitel and similar uninteresting criminals appeared. And that white dude, who was trying to act black, got VERY, VERY tiring after too much exposure to the picture. He weighed fairly good performance by Rock, the only secondary character who you couldn't wait to see the screen leave. Bad, stupid land. Apparently the writers couldn't figure out if they were writing on Generation X or the 12-15 year old rap crowd, and this combination turned into a movie that I watched on watch!
