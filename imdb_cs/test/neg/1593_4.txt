I think I was ready after all the years of hearing about it. First, Siskel and Ebert heard about it. When they said Divine Edible Feces, I had to find it. Then a friend told me in 1991. She also said that her parents had seen her when it came out for the first time, and that her mom almost threw her father out! When I caught Pink Flamingos today at Sundance, I was ready. Largely. I still couldn't help but be surprised by anal close-ups and blowjob scenes. The only characters I sympathized with were Edie and the Egg Man. Her screaming scene soon in the movie, though, despite something frivolous to normal people, actually makes me sad. Although she wasn't sure she was beautiful, she had a cute voice. I was happy for her and for the egg man, and they actually touched me. On the other hand, negotiations on this production at the level of poverty were not good. And as for the scenario, how does John Waters come up with this thing? At least it's different.
