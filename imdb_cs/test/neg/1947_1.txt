This is really bad, the characters were unreal, the story was boring and there was no sex scene. In addition, it lacks drama, the conflict is minimal, making it extremely slow. Nothing happens in this movie, you expect a sex scene, but they only have a kiss. The plot revolves around three characters, a man, his wife, and a stranger who pick up the highway. The couple invites the stranger to stay with them because he is homeless. At this point, would you expect a stranger to have sex with his wife correctly? Not just a kiss and that's it. Also, this movie has no action, no comedy, no drama and no tension. Do you think that the studio may not have read this script !!!!
