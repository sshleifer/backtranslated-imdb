This is a bad movie because its central message is very confused and the story appears to be the result of merging several disparate scripts. As a result, it often makes absolutely no sense at all and is definitely not a Miss Dunne movie or Mr. Huston should be proud of it. However, the film is worth watching if you are a fan of "Pre-Code" movies because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that pretty girls are doing out - even if they're not married, even if their IS partner! ! The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker helping the troops heading to Europe during the First World War. In this process, she meets a scalawag (Bruce Cabot) who finally convinces her to sleep with him. She gets pregnant and then goes on to another unsuspecting woman. However, Miss Dunne doesn't want him back because she realizes she's not worth it, but later her baby dies at the birth of a baby. While all of these highly controversial plot elements are used, they are always mentioned - almost like they wanted adults in the audience to know, but hope that if they phrase it or film it in the right way, the children in the audience will be clueless (after all , movies have not been rated and children can participate in any film at this time). Surprisingly, this whole conspiracy with a dead child and Cabot ends about 1/4 of the way through the film and is never mentioned or mentioned by him. It was as if they were shooting a part of the movie and leaving it - attaching it to another movie. In this second phase of the film, Miss Dunne unexpectedly starts working in a women's prison (though we never actually see her do something). What we see is the myriad of terrible scenes of serious abuse and torture that have probably been designed to titrate. And as a result of this violence, Miss Dunne embarks on a crusade to clean up the prison and become a reformer and famous writer. But then another type of film emerges, and women's business in prison reform goes on. Dunne meets a judge (Walter Huston) who is married but desperately wants her. Now in the entire movie, Dunne is portrayed as a very good girl - though she made unmarried sex with Cabot (she was more or less deceived into it). But now, single Irene, who is a tireless reformer and a good lady, is beginning to sleep with a married man. She tells her that he and his wife are alienated and are only married in the name, but they never think it would investigate, if it is true, and with their assurance, they are leaving their clothes and being in children's shops! But when she is pregnant with her lover's child, she is indicted for being a crooked judge. She assures her she's innocent, but she is convicted, and it sounds like he's a villain - using inside information from people who came in front of his bench to accumulate wealth. Then, at the closing moments of the movie, Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and promises to wait with the baby until Huston is released. The film ends. So we basically have three separate movies And a bizarre early idea of ​​what a pretty girl should be. I found out that there should be a strong-minded working girl who immediately becomes an idiot in her personal relationships! It really condemns all the pros about the character of Dunne and it's really hard to imagine that the movie would like it. A strong women's rights advocate could be easily offended, how weak-sighted and needed she was, and religious people might consider her completely amoral or at least morally suspect! With a decent transcript, it could be a good movie or at least an interesting movie like a bawdy and hoarse movie, but couldn't imagine what it wanted to be, and it was just another boring movie Pre-Code.
