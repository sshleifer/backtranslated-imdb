The only reason to see this movie is Sung Hi Lee, a stunning model / actress from Korea playing "Muka Laka Miki" (give me a break) in this otherwise crappy movie. In this film, she is given a fairly substantial part and seems to handle it well, though none of her parts are really interesting or well written. Even for National Lampoon, it's really stupid. Stupid humor is one thing, but another is just stupid. Maybe I laughed once and that was just polite. Warning: Watching this movie can be bad for your health in two counts: 1) It's totally upset. 2) Sung Hi Lee is so crazy gorgeous that at first glance she could blow her brain off the back of her head. So don't say I didn't warn you ...
