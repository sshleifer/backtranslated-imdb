I watched this TV production yesterday and I was very disappointed. I had no great expectations when it was TV production, but the whole movie was a pain without end. I felt it took 3 hours, but it was just me who was bored to death. There was a long struggle every minute and I fought hard to stay away from the "off" switch. The film is about a doctor (Dr. Verghese) who gets a lot of AIDS patients, and most of them die during the film. It's hard to live for Verghese, so his family is punished with their frustrations. However, this film has problems with both sides, mostly focusing on its patient interviews and sometimes we see a flick appearing from his home, but we're not getting enough. Problems with showing more than one part of Verghese's life with Naveen Andrews, a poor man, whom (hopefully) I don't see in any good future films, doesn't improve. <br /> <br /> I believe he got 7.6 because of the theme (taboo?) but I'm sure there are better movies about this topic on the market. Stay away from this movie, it doesn't deserve more than 3/10. <br /> <br />
