For a long time I tried to understand why people like Shakespeare do so much and every few years I give him another way. I was hoping this game / movie (my 6th different game of Shakespeare) would unlock the luck of the coffin and take me to the wealth of this literary Demigod. Bah, I clearly chose the wrong key. Once the phrase "pound of meat" was spelled 10 minutes into the movie, the main parts of the plot were transparent, grinding along with a weak script and lifeless. At each step, the original is placed in two scenes in advance. The concept that a dying aristocrat convinces his daughter to choose his future husband through a lottery is unfaithful. Not surprisingly, who wins the jackpot in marriage because Bassanio is the main protagonist in the game .... and he is the third person to try it ... and there are three coffins ... and his friend risks his life paying dowry. The only real surprise I watched this movie is that it didn't stop right after the court case was decided. But once the treachery began, it was immediately apparent what would happen. OK, so I know that millions of you love Shakespeare not for surprise in familiar stories, but for the character's depth and passion. But I didn't feel anything for the characters. Instead of encountering tension and admiration during the court scene, I sat there without hesitation, hoping it would end soon, please. One day I might find a game of Shakespeare that does something other than the boredom of me.
