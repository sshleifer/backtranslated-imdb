Since Wesley Snipes descended (or Ascending) into the world of DTV action movies the result was Miss, so-so, and miss.Unstoppible was weak. 7 seconds was fun. Sagittarius was the proverb of the septic scraping. /> <br /> What about the Detonator? We will be something that would be beyond Marksman's suffering again. But the Detonator holds a small amount of merit that is defended by the lazy star and low budget. Sonny Griffith is a not-so-by-the-book Covert op, who busts illegal arms dealers in Poland. ; Nadia (Still Silvia Colloca) to the US. Sonny is deceived by a traitor in his own organization that keeps his footprint hot for Gangsters with Nuclier Ambitions. Snipes delivers in the action department. well in the first 15 minutes of Detonator, before descending into pure sleepwalking mode, which destroyed Marksman.Colloca does more than look pretty. \ tThere is some belief in her scenes. movies.Its always good to see Michael Brandon again. The action is wired here. But never bored.Running, car chases, Fights.Director After-Chih Leong seems to have gotten better after Seagal's farce, Out of Reach.He does a credible job. constantly constrained by a low budget. Enough with the East Euro-location. Is the price of the movie's look.Vancover can't be so expensive, right? Br /> <br /> The detonator ends on average. He doesn't have the bad aspect of Seag al 'Mercenary for Justice. But it is nowhere near as fun as Second Damme's Second in command.Nor as exciting as Dolph's Mechanic. Perhaps Dolph should direct Wesley's next Eh? His High Time Producers draw a little more money and have thought of these DTV titles with the kind of money they make of them. Is it just fair. Snipes would be advised to try to make this his latest DTV flick event. It is sad to see another waste of talent from this talented actor.
