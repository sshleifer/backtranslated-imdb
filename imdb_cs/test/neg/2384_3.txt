Marketing talk. The cover of "The New Twenty" in a poster / home broadcasts a half naked man in "Wolfe Video". For those who know gay-themed movies? this broadcast must "see". (I loved reading one reviewer (from another site) who said they were "deceived" to see the movie "Sodomite." Are you serious?
