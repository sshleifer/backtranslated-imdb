This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. It's been a few years since I saw it, and since then nothing has touched and I doubt there will be a movie that is as bad as this one. He's trying to make fun of different movies, like 'Nell' (!) And instead of being funny. Whatever you do, you do not want to rent this garbage and if someone throws it on you ... turn and go in the opposite direction!
