COULD CONTAIN SPOILERS I have been an enthusiastic fan of Ali G in about the last four years. tells people. Anyway, to the movie. I didn't bother paying money at the cinema; I suppose I didn't expect much, but when I recently hired a DVD, I found the whole thing quite sad. The biggest part of Ali with mickey from others was largely missing and the scenario on which the conspiracy was made was pretty damned. hook up all the car batteries together to blow up the safe - really !! <br /> <br /> This movie goes to show I think some things can run too long and you don't translate to a big screen. The film also had the syrupy sweet ending that I came to expect from British films. Where are all the good british movies making ideals? That said, strange moments such as the dog in Ali's bed and Ali's audience with HM Q with the note "Shaven haven - RESPECT" were strange. So in summary, Ali G and Borat fans and I have enjoyed many of his interviews (especially the one with Anita Roddick of the Body Shop), but this movie fell really flat with me. If there is another film, I hope it is much better than this number of old tricks. Weasel100 <br /> <br /> Canberra, Australia
