Obviously, this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have a clue about Charles Bukowski's work. Henry Chinaski's autobiographical character in Bukowski's stories was brilliantly portrayed to the perfection of Mickey Rourke in 1987 in "Barfly," starring Faye Dunaway. Anyone who has seen 'Factotum' should definitely see 'Barfly' to look at how Bukowski wrote his character. 'Factotum' lacks the oily seed of Bukowski's script and his hero's fearless hopelessness. Unintentional humor that bubbles in the dark despair of Chinaski's misfortune doesn't work for Dillon so admirably for overweight, dirty blood-soaked Rourke. Rourke's character causes pain and pleasure from past night riots, a place for another grueling ugly day in the life of a drunken unknown writer of misanthropy. Dillon's character lacks these marks in favor of a prancing, handsome, relatively purely-looking writer who hardly passes into Chinaski's story. Dunaway's sleazy heroine Wanda is the perfect complement to the ne'er-do-well Henry. Women in 'Factotum' can't hold a candle at Dunaway's "desperate goddess," and the use of a more profane sexual subject in 'Factotum' turns out to be a rough distraction than the tip of Bukowski's raw and reckless depiction of dysfunctional relationships. I was amazed at how many of the exact same scenes were used in 'Factotum' (Marisa Tomei buys all the stuff and charges that old man's exact rebound from 'Barfly'). If you want to see the best Bukowski stories on the film, see 'Barfly' and 'Love is a Dog from Hell' (which also goes under the name 'Crazy Love').
