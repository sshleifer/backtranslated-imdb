Incredible. Great cast, fair acting, interesting plot. But this film has such graphical atrocities that aren't tense or exciting, just a purely disruptive unruhe. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Everyone has seen coming when the lunatic returns to his habits. And that Robert Englund acted (was he?) Like an idiot; forbidding your daughter to sleep with a footballer but trying to kill an idiot and like kiddypr0n is fine?! The policeman who's daughter has been kidnapped - has anyone felt he's a cop and not an actor? I do not. This film stretches and closes with the end we see in other horror movies: if it comes back, part 2 can be made. Bad, really bad things. Could give you inspiration ...
