In case you are curious about buffoonish Loren C ***** n of (Cryptozoology Inafame) is a living idiot and all the information he provides is to be thrown away with trash. The guy's just a paper clipper. As for the story, it was a predictable wreck of the train, the actors were mechanical, the lighting was terrible, and the props / clothes were cheap. Bobcat Goldwait was supposed to play clowns in this movie. After ten minutes I was physically ill. There are crazy / retarded monkeys who are still in charge of the movies I see. Dan
