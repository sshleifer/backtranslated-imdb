Not long ago I bought a cheap VHS cartridge called "Just Rambling Along" allegedly representing Laurel and Hardy. Being somewhat familiar with their output and not recognizing this title, I made a torturous decision to divide and buy the whole dollar. When I played, I called the movie HOP TO IT. Of course, Mr. Laurel was nowhere to be cast, so the packaging of this product was criminally deceptive. Worse still, the quality is terrible. Looks like he was burned out of an 8mm film. It had a somewhat appropriate musical score. In fact, in all seriousness, tape is worth a buck if you want to get an idea of ​​what a movie is. In my opinion, it is decent but insignificant short. IMDb should add JUST RAMBLING ALONG as an alternative title for this movie, which by the way was the title of the movie 1918 Stan Laurel!
