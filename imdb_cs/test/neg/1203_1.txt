I remember seeing it for the first time in the 1980s as a teenager. Man, I read reviews of this waste and I'm voted surprised. This movie doesn't deserve four stars !!! This movie is no better than Topgun. Topgun has its own problems; Don't get me wrong. This film should only be banned for its own stupidity. So many stereotypes, so many loop holes, so bad dialogue. I can't think of one redeeming quality of this vomit. This is not an action / adventure. This is a bad joke on the movie. Kinda likes watching Plan 9 with the tracks of the F-16. This film not only defies logic and common sense in the context of a military environment, but also sends a disturbing message. The army will not save your father from the impending evil of the Middle East. So go out and kidnap a million million gun and throw it out of those sinister clutches back, anti-American Arabs. You can't understand those animals. This is Bruckheimer's film without a budget. Blandish direction, weak playing, lame music, idiotic plot, ... Iron Eagle.
