It is a drama and seemingly comedic cases are pitiful and some of them seem to be forced and invented.

Loved Carole Lombard is my man Godfrey because it is comedy and, while acting is wonderful, the story and the script itself, wins the day. Carole Lombard is a beautiful and beautiful actress. I'll try to follow Fred McMurray's features.
