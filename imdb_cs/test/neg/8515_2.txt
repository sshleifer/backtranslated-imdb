I'll give it two because it has a lot of music, otherwise it would be one. Tonight I saw this movie for the first time and it's the first Road Road picture. I waited better waaaaay. Robert Osborn says it's the best of Road movies. If that's true, I don't have to bother to see others. The best thing about this movie is that it has a lot of songs in the first half, but it is only balanced with one production number with dance throughout the movie. I didn't like the movie. Neither hope nor Crosby found it well, their characters were not very charming, the film was not funny at all, most of the dialogue was just a lame fill, there was not much action, there were not many theaters. The movie wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting more "Road" but not much. They quickly get into the palace and then most of the film takes place there to the end. I also expected a much more famous "road" style when it broke the fourth wall where the characters speak directly to the viewer or comment on the story. It was only about 4 cases. One of them is an example of the non-witty humor of this scenario: <br /> <br /> (Hope Recaps Crosby's Story Today) Crosby: I Know All That! I hope: Yeah, but people who came in the middle of the picture, no. Crosby: Do you think they lost my song? These are two weak lines, but at least they're actually jokes. Much of the rest of the script doesn't even have jokes. An example is: Crosby: Remind me to throw a piece of cheese in the morning. (Indirectly calls Hope and Rat). It's not funny at all, hardly qualifies as a joke, but that's the kind of non-joke dialogue that carries most of the movie. Many of these scenes don't come so close to a joke, just by generic, uninteresting dialogue like: Crosby: Hey, I want to marry me? Do you think you can throw me to dogs? I hope why not, you did it to me, didn't you? Crosby: Yeah, but that's because I was looking at us. You're not looking at anyone. I hope so? So why did I pay the check? <br /> <br /> (only from my memory. It's not accurate, but it illustrates what I mean). And so on .... just a general dialogue without jokes. <br /> <br /> My mark: a waste of time.
