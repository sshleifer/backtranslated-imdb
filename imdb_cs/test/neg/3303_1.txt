Above all, you must not take this film seriously. Unfortunately, it is taken seriously, but it cannot be helped. This anime ninja flic must be the ultimate achievement in spoiling what might be cute if unoriginal, a story with bad plot twists, ridiculous time-killing cutscenes, and one outrageous guest appearance that will either make you laugh or moan (or both, just like me). Although I am typically a fan of the ninja / samurai anime (Ninja Scroll and Rurouni Kenshin, to name a few), this must be the exception. For recording from a technical point of view, this film was very well animated and constructed. It's just a conspiracy that is stuck. The authors of this film clearly decided (for what reason I do not know) that they could somehow replace the lack of a scenario if a figure halfway around the world was looking for a treasure that he (his learning) fought and died. In this process, he rescues a black slave named Sam, meets a French girl who lives in the village of Apache, makes friends with a ninja clan whose members try to kill him, meet more family members, and then know he has the strangest places and circumstances (and whom all subsequently die at some point in the film). Even so far, these ridiculous plot plot could be excused, but then come two "guest appearances". # 1: After having a ridiculous clich√© of showdown with two cowboys, Jiro meets a man who introduces himself as "Mark Twain". At this point you may say, "What is ****? !!" This "meeting" serves one purpose: it totally discredits a film that seeks to add an educated historical background to itself. I found it disappointing that the authors went into all these problems to explore the US in the 1960s and could not realize that Mark Twain's real name was Samuel Clemens. # 2: When Jiro finally finds the treasure, he turns out to belong to Captain Kidd. Now I hear the moans of disgust. Finally, there are scenes running. These scenes show different characters running, with the landscape moving statically behind them, for a few minutes, and there are plenty. It is these scenes that make this movie, 2 hours 12 minutes, to seem to last a week and a half. <br /> <br /> If you and your friends are looking for a bad subtitle movie that asks you for fun, that's it. Feel free to poke fun in every possible aspect, and have fun. Don't take it seriously. 3/10
