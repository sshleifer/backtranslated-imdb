We are in the not so distant future, globalization seems to have reached a high point, the languages ​​mingling with each other (even if they predominate over the rest), races have merged, human cloning is a fact, and the whole territory seems to be divided into two zones: for a valid and the second for a void ... a brave new world (in the style of Aldous Huxley) in which people are genetically stored and blood relationships are strictly forbidden (for health reasons - this is the title 46 code-). In such an environment, two souls who are not meant to meet each other fall in love. Winterbottom had an important story with quite a lot of potential. A nice recipe that gives the ruin such a slow rhythm, tells it so tired, removes all the emotions ... Cold, that's what Code 46 sends out. Cold and Boring. Not even the presence of Samantha Morton and Tim Robbins (both play their roles beautifully), nor the visual and sound power of some sequences can do anything to save the film. Damage. Code 46: what could have been and never was. <br /> <br /> * My course: 4/10
