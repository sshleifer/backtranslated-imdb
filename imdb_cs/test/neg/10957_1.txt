Unreal !!!!!!!! After reading the introductory reviews published by the alleged reviewers, I was shocked to find that almost all the initial reviews, 38, all rated this movie and 10. Based on comparison with other great movies, these reviewers felt that Quick and the Undead is a better movie than The 6th Sense (8.2), Saving Private Ryan (8.4), The Lord of the Rings (8.7), The Godfather (9.5), Gladiator (8.1) and Dawn of the Dead (7.8). Hopefully these shills will use their next discounted lasik procedure they hear about because it's obvious that these reviews have been falsified. <br /> <br /> I was convinced that this film has a unique concept of making Zombie in the genre. Sadly, when we watch Speed ​​and the Undead, it is clear that these reviews were created by people who were either involved in production or interested in the marketability of films / financial success. Nothing is bothering me in my mind more than hearing that part of this movie was shot in Texas, it was, by coincidence, an early broadcast of the praised film. The film Zombie / Horror B on the whole is a forgiving group, but unfortunately this film is beyond any redemption. The characters are recycled and the plot is bad. The quality of the film wasn't bad enough to be tagged with a video camera, and at least used a camera with movie quality. Acting is terrible, the star is trying unsuccessfully to leave as Clint Eastwood, who wants to be cloned. Christ on the bike !!!!!! Even the main actor's name is Clint. He was just terrible. The only resemblance to Clint Eastwood is that leadership uses "wood" from Eastwood's name in his acting style. Make-up Zombie was above the quality of a Halloween party, but not fully applied to full-fledged members. The amount of zombies was not on their hands. The story was so hockey that I was hoping for a power outage, a DVD defect, or that the zombies would turn their attention to the director. Maybe the movie is worth some viewers, but not for my hard earned dollar. Fortunately, I used my free voucher to rent this DVD. Maybe this movie will be rescued by Nott Entertainment (aptly named) releasing special DVD collectors that will tie loose flaws, and deliver promised goods ??? Some, I think, NOTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!! Lets just hope that their next release, The Flesh Keeper is really a "goalkeeper" of the movie .. and not a 5th generation recycled version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Massacre. Fingers crossed over here ... but only if you care about it.
