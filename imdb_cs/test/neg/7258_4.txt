GOOD MANTIS certainly won't scare anyone, but science fiction programmers go better than most. The volcanic eruption at the South Pole expels giant, prehistoric preying mantis at the North Pole. The soldiers disappear. Dr. Ned (William Hopper - son of Heddy Hopper and best known as Paul Drake on PERRY MASON TV) is called i.d. Creation - but by this time, the creature was born several Eskimos and is on its way to the Washington Monument. About a third or more of the film consists of footage: old government educational films, Soldiers in Radar Rooms, Aircraft - and would you believe the Eskimos go to sea? Which of course explains why Eskimo is attacked in Eskimo. ("Hey, boys! Do you think we can do that?") Mix some negligible special effects, some clumsy dialogue and some sexist attitudes and you can go. Not as original as MONSTER, CALLING WORLD, but fans of the 1950s "big bug" schlock will enjoy it - and kids will have a good time throwing popcorn on the screen. Gary F.
