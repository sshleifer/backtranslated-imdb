If there was an EPA for the film, then this film would have received their sincere approval. If we all recycled our "things", we would never miss anything. Funny as I reminded this movie when I first saw Starwars I: The Phantom Menace. At least Lucas didn't recycle his old shots. But he's a nice guy. Cute in spots (I liked it when the boy said "damn rocks"). And if you like explosions (even those recycled), you get your fill. <br /> <br /> Actually, for the movie "No Budget", it does pretty well. Behavior is weak, but here and there is little characterization. The story is predictable, but it will lead you in any way. It is a movie that "everybody chases a child", who will most likely appeal to younger audiences. I gave this 2 of 10. <br /> <br /> I dug my old copy of this VHS. I don't think it's on DVD.
