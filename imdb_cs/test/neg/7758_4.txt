Sixteenth with a children's show with ex-vaudevillians playing on the hand of a man. How can you expect them to be a disaster in everything they do. During the 11-minute episodes (leaving 4 minutes for 15-minute ads), they do things like set a fence between competing neighbors to help the magician on stage and deal with the found suitcase and wallet. I grew up never ran through this show (which seems to have been shot in New York). I thought I had heard or seen most of the children's shows since I watched them as a child, or viewed them in nostalgic conventions. Until Alpha Video released on DVD, I was totally unaware of whether its existence. The show plays as three Stooges mixed with Abbott and Costello as they make people aping routines. (Indeed, one of the couple claims to have created the legendary "Slowly Turned ..." routine that Abbott and Costello perfected). It's not bad, but it's not really good either because everything seems to be watering. The timing is often gone (though it may be due to the wrong direction) and jokes have been recycled years before the show first ran. The odds are all seen before. On the plus side, his type, which would be perfect to introduce very young children to a vaudeville-style comedy, but will try to make the parents come together with short episodes. <br /> <br /> nostalgia only. All the others should see how they see the original Abbott and Costello or Three Stoogs.
