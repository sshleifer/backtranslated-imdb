Dresden had great expectations due to its grand theme and high budget. I was really looking forward to it and I really wanted it to be good ... but it's not like that. The only good thing is special effects that are very well done, but just like in a really bad Hollywood blockbuster, everything else is missing. It is badly written, the script tries to meet the genre rules with standard elements of tension / love story, but there is no depth or originality at all. It's below average. Another thing: It's also badly directed. It has this uninteresting TV-directing-style with lots of close-ups and want-to-be-great-action quick edits where in fact no action or tension is. The actors are not bad, but there is no performance to touch. I don't know ... apparently, he's trying to make a typical TV movie and not a movie for a movie where it's always good to have some edges and a clear visual style. But why are they trying to meet Hollywood's typical commercial rules? It really feels like a writer has made a weekend class with some American screenwriting guru and then added that mess. There is no producer who is responsible for a project that is interested in dramaturgy / visual style or simple in these magical moments that make some TV movies great?!? Does he think the television audience is stupid and doesn't need to get a good film experience? The decline was a very good example of a good TV movie, but there was probably a manager or producer who knew what he was doing. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time with this, rent a "fall" instead of ...
