Yes, the video of this movie made me watch this movie as a child. It was called "Screamers" on this particular cover with the slogan "Men Turned Out". It even represented this distorted skeleton on the cover that had all the amazing shots in my mind. Maybe some movie about a strange virus that caused a man to burn a body, maybe a movie about undead zombies that are more bloody than what you usually get, a scientific experiment was incredibly wrong, and now weird men with their bodies are dripping their bones on rampage. Yes, all these thoughts came to my mind, the one that was not on the fish on an island with virtually no stiffness and everything. This movie is really more like a Dr. Island Moreau, than anything else, and frankly, the movie also bored me, it's a journey to many scientists and not enough killing for my tastes. These movies are a lot of character and not enough blood for my cravings. Yes, I know, I have weird tastes, but I can't help it, I like my horror movies either really bloody or fast moving and this exciting movie really isn't.
