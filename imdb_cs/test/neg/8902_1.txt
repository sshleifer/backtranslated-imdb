The endless repetition of the evil World Bank, the IMF, globalization and the Americans is blamed for all the problems of Africa and the film is long, about two hours, but it seems longer. Indeed, for centuries, the French occupied Mali, the country in which the film takes place, but they are just peripheral evil boys. They are absolutely marginal sermons that go on and on and on. There is no conspiracy, no character development, no humor (with the exception of a few penalties at Bush and Wolfowitz, but it's almost cheating, it's so easy) and the production values ​​are average - no redemption there. It's amazing that a movie can spend two hours preaching about such a big topic and conveying absolutely zero real information. The Irish ballad "I am dying and then famine" has more content. The movie is boring, the subtitles are hard to read, there is no real content about the subject of the movie and the propaganda is relentless. <br /> <br /> Skip this.
