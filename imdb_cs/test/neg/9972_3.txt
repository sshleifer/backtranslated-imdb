This film is about a woman who has fallen in love with her boyfriend's friend. Since then he has to divide his time into two boys: Jack during the day and Joseph at night. <br /> <br /> This movie feels like it was created with a minimal budget. Most of the film is housed in an apartment with minimal furniture. There are only three main actors, all the other actors in the credits do just a momentary performance. The wardrobe designer doesn't seem to have anything to do, because the actors wear very little clothes on the ground, and they're actually naked most of the time. The film is very heavy, which is the drawback described above. But the dialogues sound too complicated and embarrassing. At the beginning of the movie, most of the dialogue is a person who says a very long sentence, and then the person says 'me too'. After the deal's madness, the dialogue descends into the disorder of incoherent and confused word salad. The only merit of this film, which I think, is that it serves as a feminist outlet that indicates that it is not only men who may be unfaithful. This film is a big disappointment.
