My mom, my cousins ​​and I are quite big fans of Jane Austen. We know all the words for Pride and Prejudice Masterpiece from 1995 and we watched Emma Gwyneth Paltrow worry. I read all the books and even sat several times in Sense and sensitivity and persuasion. Mom and I thought it would be nice to see Northanger Abbey on the movie. Bad Idea! It's just about the worst movie I've ever seen. It's even worse than the 1998 Alice Through The Looking Glass version, or the Nancy Drew 1939 movie I bought at Wal-Mart for $ 1 (my previous "worst movies"). The first thing you'll notice in the opening scene is that Catherine's "heroine" has a horrible and strange imagination inspired by the crooked novels that Jane Austen's heroine would never touch. Throughout the novel, she has dreams (day and night) in which she is abducted by a gruesome man with a greasy wig, dragging across a field led to God who knows everything and suddenly rescues a lively man. White horse. The second thing the viewer immediately notices is the high-pitched lamentation and saxophone music to be the soundtrack. There is no classical music or English dance here! It is also obvious almost at first sight that the actress (for lack of a better word) that was chosen to play Catherine is completely gone. First, it is somewhat unattractive and its behavior is disproportionate, and even more so. Her looks and movements are just hideous! Moreover, they are completely hit and incredible. This sad lack of gaming skills affects almost all the actors in the movie. Even Mr. Tilney, the alleged "lively young suitor", is not decent. <br /> <br /> As more and more characters are introduced, there is a special taste in the costumes of the creators. Huge Marie Antoinette headgear clashes with (largely) the properly styled Empire dress. A French woman, apparently a friend of General Tilney, is made in black as some ancient nightmare - bears a striking resemblance to Michael Jackson in a black dress. Her appearance is even stronger on the huge crescent moon of beauty on her face. I also had to be interested in the historical accuracy of the red-red lipstick that almost all women wore. Another anomaly that kept my mother and I laughing for about ten minutes was "bathing" the scene. The first thing we noticed was that men and women bathed together in a large bathhouse Probably not at the beginning of the 1800s, then we saw that all women wore large porcelain or plastic plates worn around the neck with strings, and the plates floated horizontally on the water and contained some mysterious pieces ... something. it was soap, then aromatic herbs, then finally, when the mysterious substance began to disappear between the shots, we figured it was food, but I'm still not sure. <br /> <br /> And that's not even half what is with Northanger Abbey My warning for anyone considering renting this movie: stay in your hand And if someone is considering BUY - well, I don't even know what to say. <br /> <br /> Do you think when actors and others who do they got the movie, they have about a 1/4 of the way they would realize what monster they created and stopped, unfortunately, they didn't, and Northanger Abbey was released into the world.
