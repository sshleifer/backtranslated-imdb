This movie is really BAD, there is nothing appealing or worth commenting on, except for the beautiful setting: Chilean countryside. I know I have to add four lines to comment on this movie, but the thing is it's a bad movie that I can only say it's actually BAD. Michael Ironside is the only one who saves money in the movie.
