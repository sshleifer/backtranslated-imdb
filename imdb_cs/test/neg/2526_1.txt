Root channel without anesthesia is more fun. This film is disturbing and absurd. There is absolutely nothing credible about any of these characters or fence lines. What in God's Name were these people thinking when they agreed to play in this movie? Acting in this film is so incredibly bad - even from actors who are usually damn good. "In-Laws" is a funny movie. "The Birdcage" is a jolly movie. "The Big Lebowski" is a funny movie. This movie is just stupid. I can't even begin to understand what a sick mind is, to write a "novel" on which this film is based. I honestly can't even think of one nice thing to say about this movie. It just doesn't make any sense. Please, please, people don't see this movie. You will regret for the rest of your life. This movie is not the worst, but it's definitely up on the list.
