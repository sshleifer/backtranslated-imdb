You get an hour and a half braindead, I have to save world action all the way, one line and a woman somewhere in the equation. This time he plays a guy who helps people in the witness protection program. quote film cover. Clears his past to save his future. Woppi, this must be great :) I bet the younger people will like it, but that's a bit above the top for my taste. And one liner is really something else and I don't mean it in a good way. After killing a crocodile, he can tell. "You are luggage" If you are in the right mood, you can enjoy the movie. And as far as braindead is concerned, it's not too bad. But almost before the film starts, you know exactly what will happen. But if you like this kind of movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. I rate this film 4
