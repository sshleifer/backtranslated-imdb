I am a passionate film watcher and enjoy a wide range of movies. However, in this film I have not found any pleasure. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't feel that it had a lot of story, the characters were not sympathetic and the relationship between the characters was at best inoperative, and the end forced me to dislike the film. It's definitely not in the same category as "The Cave", which in my opinion was the best cave movie. Even "The Descent" was better than this movie. It was a waste of rent of $ 3.79 and my time to watch it. Do yourself a favor and avoid this.
