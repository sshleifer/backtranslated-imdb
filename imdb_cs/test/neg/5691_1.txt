In a world where people can live forever, you'll spend the whole film wishing they die. First, if you insist on watching this movie, first give it two things, you shouldn't worry about the lack of a plot. he must now hurry forward until the chick dies, don't worry, even if you pay attention, you won't know why or how she died. Once you get to the "good part", take it down. As you know the good part, wait for the elevator scene with two morons in space suits of World War II weapons. These weapons don't seem to be so big until you realize that the first protagonist had a gun with a laser label and a bandoleer of CO2 cartridges. The only remnants of the conspiracy are between the glowing sphere and the hemisphere, which seems to have been attacked by Wolverine. After listening to the "conspiracy" you will want them to come back to not talk. Of the four people who are in this movie, none of them can act remotely, not even a bit, you'll be more fortunate to be witnessing acting in a kindergarten theater. Effects, Let me just say "Wow", don't really spend the whole movie saying on your own "Where did this movie's $ 1.8 million go!" It will really leave it in a huge range of clumsiness. The best "sets" are basically window wallpaper backgrounds. Ships are basically flying keys, wait some are boats that look like whales. I've never heard so many words in my whole life. They have buttons on their wrists (big pedometers) that can put them in "combat mode" and super-run mode (making them super blurred). This seriously drains their power reserves, but finds pieces of wire that will chew to regain their strength. The blasts were less impressive than my fourth of July, I only had sparklers. So the plot, if I can find out, is something like this "mother" is the captain of a spaceship and goes to the desert for a while riding a rocket dies. Then her daughter 6000 years in the future (not exaggerating) remembers her mother's memories through a capsule. Anyway jabber for the next 10 minutes and then cause a big bang. Yes, the same "Big Bang" that launched our solar system. This is explained by how it comes back in time or something, it doesn't matter that it happened. Roll Credits Overall, the whole scenario was merciful on one sheet of paper, unless it was actually edited by any of the terribly scenes. After watching credits, I was laughing more than the whole movie, jobs created as a food supervisor of "galactius sarcophagus" and then a special thank you to George Lucas was just the best. I really didn't expect to pay 99 cents for the movie, but some really owe me the body for it. The most frequent comment he heard after the movie "I want my life back". You have to admire that some, but put the time and effort into this movie, but seriously, why?
