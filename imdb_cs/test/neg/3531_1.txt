I saw this movie at Temple University. I can't imagine anyone seeing this movie in the theater (projected on film). Acting is similar to Saved By The Bell (TV Show). The storyline is simple and unimaginable. The sound recorder likes the sound of the wind and the DP needs a light meter. Vampires, vampires, vampires. <br /> <br /> Don't waste your money.
