There is only one word that defines the whole film, that is: terrible. How the "Martha Bridge" was overhauled is terrible. The movie's name is terrible. The actors are terrible. And the idea of ​​combining good cooking and the US is terrible. If you've seen "Bella Martha", well that is the original name and that means "beautiful Martha", this is a punch in the stomach. Mrs. Jones's action is so bad and unnatural that Jessica Alba, considered one of the worst actresses (http://www.razzies.com/history/05nomActr.asp) would do better. Not to mention a chef who should play a different role. And the girl ... not worth mentioning. Bella Martha was a very nice movie, authentic ... why was it revised? There was a story .... here they took it. There's no story ... What does that mean? In one way, this film was perfect. Do you know when all the ingredients fit together? This is the case here. Perfect bullshit.
