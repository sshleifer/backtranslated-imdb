Why I didn't like the movie, besides the utter ugliness of the actors themselves, is that someone can actually believe such a shit. First, the Second Coming of Christ will be at the end of words, and when Jesus Christ comes on Judgment Day, He will not come as He did before, in human form. He will come in His full glory as God, and we will be judged not only for our sins but also for the consequences of our actions. Everyone will! Secondly, I have seen the eternal Gay Pride illustrated in this movie with all the undeniable "Yesterday I read the Bible and is not written anywhere". Well that is. Moses quotes on three different occasions that men who love one another, or women who love one another, as if man and woman should be killed because they never inherit the kingdom of God because they are a foul! If it were for us to follow the word for the word, now there would be executions, right? But I think that disinformed people do more harm than it would be ... That was in the Old Testament. In psychiatric wards there are a lot of freaks who think they are the Son of God, but to make a film after it really does make you think how many idiots can make a film there.
