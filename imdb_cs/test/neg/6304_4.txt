I like all the main actors involved in this bizarre film. Terrance Stamp, Guy Pearce & Hugo Weaving all proved to be one of the best and most capable actors in the area, but I couldn't get into it. I don't know if it's because I don't understand lifestyle or what, but I couldn't get around this movie. Worse than anything else, the actors have done some of the ugliest cats I've ever seen. I think it was part of the thing, I don't know. I realize it's probably an insult, but I don't know what else to call them. I have to say that I bought the boys as performers (correct term?), But even the story wasn't very good or very interesting. I will say that I usually do not appreciate costume designers very well, even if I notice them when they are bad or else, but I was very impressed with them. Very creative at the very least, just not attractive, but I don't think they should be. I do not know that I am definitely not a target group and I would never have met the performances of these artists, but I would not want to go to ballet or opera so I do not know. If this is your kind of movie, then you'll probably like it, but if you don't miss it because it's ... not for most of us. I just checked that he won an Oscar for costume design and I rightly say it. I have to say that Ebert really cared about this movie, even though he liked it better than I did.
