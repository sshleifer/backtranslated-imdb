I watched this movie a few months ago when the stunt first appeared on the shelves. It's officially the only movie I wanted to go back to. I'll start by saying I like "B" movies. I consider "Ice Pirates" one of the best EVER comedies. I will also notice that I am a writer and that I have met the director / writer of this film miracle. Acting Evaluation: If I wanted to choose a bright point, she must emphasize that Dion Day had an admirable acting debut with his role in this. For those who do not know, Dion is a boxer who is not an actor, so we forgive his lame death sequence. Why doesn't he fire a shotgun he holds once? Budget? Emphasize the bad deal would be the site, so I'll keep the egotistic leadership, Ryn Baskin. Ryn (which looks like a comic book name because it sounded cool) has the maximum time in this movie, probably because he was a producer. His appearance is perfectly fine, but his delivery evokes memories of SNL ripping on soap operas. I suppose he could do so much with what was written for him, but part of his guilt is definitely his. Special Effects: It's not my specialty, but for a low budget movie I assume that makeup and weapon were acceptable. It didn't bother me, but it didn't make any impression either. Writing / Direction: The Oscar for Best Screenplay is not something I could predict for Gerald Nott, who has ever won. Not only is the plot a foundation, but the dialogue is flat and spaced. I understand stylized hokee-ness, but this was bad writing. I was most concerned about theft. Nott stole the scenes, shots, and Viggo's hair on his face from other movies killed. The scene where Russel Crow crosses the wheat field in the Gladiator, All Sequences from Good, Bad, and Ugly, doesn't cut anything like that with me. I decide not to comment on the filming because I don't know what it means to make a good shot, etc. Conclusion: Don't lend this movie or the pirate it. It's too bad to waste time. Good reviews may be completely fake, after meeting with Gerry It seems to be more likely to broadcast them himself.
