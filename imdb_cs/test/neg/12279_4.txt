This movie is very violent but exciting with original dialogues and great characters. It has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life. The film starts with action star Leo Fong as a cop who is approaching the end of his career when he encounters a big case involving corruption, black mail and murder. That's where killing begins. From the start of Fong in this must see action caper. This film also includes teammates Richard Roundtree. I really enjoyed this movie as a child, but as I got older, I realized that this movie was nice and not very good. I would not recommend this movie and the action is very, very bad.
