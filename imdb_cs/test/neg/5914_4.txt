Dane Youssef <br /> <br /> I'm looking forward to this one. I enjoy Eddie Murphy and I love it when a star-hand makes a vehicle for herself, or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut. But when the star's head gets into the rest of the body, there's always the danger of big-budget Hollywood production. Will the filmmaker keep her alright? Or will he just waste his money (studio, ours) and time (studio, ours and his own), patting his back for half an hour? Sadly, it's the other one. Another thing I like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into a drained and dry genre. None of this here. The nightclub films that had fought had become so worn that his parodies were bleak and deadly. Murphy won't do one. He will do the most classic: He engages in a routine conventional gangster formula and plays it as seriously as it would be a "Godfather". It's like a scenario where more design, jokes and new ideas. But someone who looked at him seems to have looked at him and said, "No? It's okay." Probably Murphy. This is all he owes him. In the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets, his name captions over credits about five times. PLOT: The young orphan saves Pryor's life and Pryor receives a little ragamuffin. 20 years later, Pryor's listing became a top-notch hot spot. They pull big money and the gangster wants their action. He even has a dirty cop in his jobs. But Pryor comes up with a plan, "STING". Murphy's scenario takes place as an unfinished first draft that no one could call him. The actors are really not allowed to stand out, if at all. It seems that the all-powerful Murphy is on autopilot. Pryor shows classes and gentlemen's behavior as Sugar Ray (maybe it would be better to name his character BROWN Sugar Ray - more evidence that this one needed Polish), but everyone here is basically just for vacation. The Oscar nomination for the film is well-deserved (The Best Costume Design by Joe I. Tompkins), but production values ​​are the only part that makes the "30" feel authentic. Some sets look somewhat fake, but it's supposed to be a comedy. It's a rare one movie gets nominated for both Razzie and Oscar (if it's one of the new Lucas "Star Wars" chapters). It's 1938 and everyone's talking like 1988, especially comedians. This is the recipe of prehistoric white man. And with all those black comedians and satirists, you expect to cut this genre or at least bring new life. No way. Murphy is pretty much just running around here. Big Roger Ebert summed it up when he commented in his review: "Murphy treats his story more as a costume party in which everyone looks great while fumbling over land that hasn't been fresh since Jasmine Guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging in his role, and Michael Lerner has all the looks, evil, and prototype boss downstairs, and there are times when Pryor gives you an idea of what would be a more interesting character for a leader and authority, giving every scene a sense of dignity. Would it be too much to ask Della Ress to sing? Or at least stop embarrassed with all her "Kiss" My Ass Talk? "<br /> <br /> And the late Redd Foxx here won't leave many swan songs. He's got some back-and-there with Resse that might be some great stuff. . <br /> <br /> Murphy's Quick she is charismatic and sympathetic, but these moments are few and surely in. Murphy never looked better and was never more boring. His character made me laugh twice throughout the film. Stan Shaw's boxer with a terrible obstacle to speech is not just painful and embarrassing, it's unpleasant. There's more comedy than just showing something unpleasant. You have to incorporate some light touch and a funny situation. Watching him, though some of the simplest words just excuse us and regret Murphy. Can Murphy write a script? Good?? There was a "Raw" but it was really a stand-up material. Certainly he wrote the outline of "Boomerang" and "Coming to America". But she didn't have the last word. Maybe a team of ER-like script doctors could revive it. Murphy's direction is so slow and silent that you swear he slept behind the wheel. He has too many static shots and doesn't seem to know how to build and release tension. At some level, I think Quick is a real Eddie Murphy. Angry, young, hot and ambitious. But sometimes charming. Now that he was sometimes just funny. There's a scene in which Murphy has a femme fa-tale in bed that she plans to love with him and kill him. You can probably guess what's going to happen. Like everything else in the movie, it could have been better, but ?? "Surprisingly," Murphy has not directed another film ever since (he has been nominated for Razzie). He doesn't even write the finished design of his movies (WON Razzie for writing it!) <br /> <br /> It's great to watch and the music is beautiful and there are some really nice scenes. But it just falls into the category of "gems of all the junk." Not enough. <br /> <br /> You could have been. I should have been. It wasn't. Yeah fine. <br /> <br /> by Dan Youssef
