This is the second addition to the personally produced Oz trilogy. It is basically the same childhood as the other two, though I think it is more appropriate than the other because it is shorter. As in other films, in costumes of animals, the adult woman pretends to be a boy, and characters and conspiracy jump all over the place, while working with the camera is static. This time there is a magic cloak in the center that grants a wish, and the boy the woman plays is the king. Most special effects witness at the beginning. Fairies are represented by multiple exposures. And there is a man on the Moon who looks like the ones created by Georges Méliès years ago, most famous in Le Voyage dans la lune (1902). Impressive fantasy fantasies and creative trick effects made him the leading pioneer of early film and the films he made at the turn of the century were much better and even more technically advanced than this triple Oz series.
