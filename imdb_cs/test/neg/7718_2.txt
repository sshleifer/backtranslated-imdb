The terrible, boring zombie sequel is only marginally better than Uwe's horrible first movie. It consists of a group of soldiers going to a zombie plagued university campus to find a type of blood that could help find a cure for infection. These soldiers are typical lambs for slaughter and none of them are pulled out (or at least not very interesting), so you don't feel sad in the pit of your stomach when they are destroyed. The film has typical zombie biting people and blood splatter. He even has the same chewing guts. It just does nothing for the zombie genre to give it memory. And the culmination of the story is more anti-climactic and ridiculous. One wonders how two people can dive into a zombie army and not a bit (because they are the main stars that always seem to be able to handle escapability), while others seem easy enough. The only motivation of the film is to show people how to get somewhere else. Just look at the Romero movie for a lasting effect.
