Beyond understanding, Lumumba HBO is a catastrophic representation of what looks like a decent movie. Some scenes have no meaning in English and actors bring zero energy to read the voice. Add a self-censorship to CIA operator Frank Carlucci, and you have a film stripped of both his drama and his power. I hope the subtitle version gets on the American TV screens.
