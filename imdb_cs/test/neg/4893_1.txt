This film was ridiculous from the beginning. Let me save you time from watching this movie. A woman who sells corn liqueur to local residents marries her cousin or nephew and convinces her to open a caf√© downstairs. She does and she and her cousin are coming. There is a scene later where she is locking her lips with him. Later, the woman discovers that an old friend is returning from prison and their tension between them leads to a fight in the cafe. The man's cousin / nephew is in love with a man. The end was terrible, the story was terrible, and if I could get the time I spent on this movie, I'd appreciate it. Unique skip.
