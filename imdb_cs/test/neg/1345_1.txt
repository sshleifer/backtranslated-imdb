Imagine a movie that is the opposite of Lawrence of Arabia, instead of having all the male cast, has all the female cast. Instead of being set in the desolate deserts of Arabia, it is set in a bulging metropolis of New York. And instead of being one of the biggest movies ever made, it's one of the most pointless, boring and forgotten movies. The film concerns Mary Haines (Meg Ryan), a perfect woman and mother, envy of everyone else in her social circle Manhatten. She is painted as a woman carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders, despite the fact that she needs to live in a nanny and a housekeeper to cope with one child. But I don't want to be too hard on her, Mary does it all while she takes a liassez-faire attitude to the work her father gave her. However, this idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever and things start to crash in a very real way. Mary's husband is cheating on her and her father sets her on fire that she doesn't work hard enough. She is quite naturally angry and a little falling apart. But Mary has to come back because of her pregnant child and herself. She does it through rehabilitation, straightening and designing her own line of clothes; though amazingly for this kind of movie, not mounting. Mary succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides she loves her now. She decided to take her cheating husband back after realizing that it was her fault he had cheated because she didn't get enough information on him. Films that save mercy are that they don't fall down. All men are evil way.
