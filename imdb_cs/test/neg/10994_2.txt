It seems normal in the 1990s to play with clichés. Some do it with great talent. Hervé Hadmar not. On paper, the film seemed interesting though: the faint plot could have been rescued by great comedy moments, dark humor and a very "décalé" style. Unfortunately, director Hadmar kills his direction with camera angles and a complete lack of rhythm. Every joke is embarrassing because nobody in the theater reacts. The movie is incredibly slow and the actors seem curious about what the hell they're doing in this ridiculous mascarade. What could be a stylish funny thoughtless comedy ends up as a cathedral of boredom.
