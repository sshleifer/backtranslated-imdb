Visible but pretty horrible. How shocking that it was the great Gregory La Cava's last overhead credit! Even in his better known roles, I don't care about Gene Kelly. It seems to me that I am smug, hostile and self-sufficient. Here, in conjunction with a minor actress like Marie Wilson, she seems to show these qualities in a spade. Marie Wilson, playing an heiress who falls on a soldier, is extremely hard and unsympathetic. The actors seem to be working hard to overcome the hard, unpleasant core of the picture and do it right. The know-it-all valet is apparently meant to be funny, but it seems to be widespread. Riff on prissy bits for which Franklin Pangborn was famous (and in which, despite their stereotyping, he was generally funny - unlike this guy.) Phyllis Thaxter is as always very appealing in a somewhat backward secondary plot.
