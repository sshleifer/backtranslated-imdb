I'm not trying to recognize Haneke's above-average film skills. For example, I appreciate his constant environment, which is extremely natural, a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism. As far as the content of this film is concerned, I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize relationships or feelings about domination (and / or BDSM procedures). The problem with the main character with her mother is incredibly topical, as is the alienation and misunderstanding that Walter feels (I do not mean the lover's frustration that is not loved in the same way, which is understandable; she looks at her as if she is crazy, or as if he were a monk, come on!). I think D / s is not something new in the world and I think it is somewhat stupid to treat the topic as if it is something that is "crazy" or pathological; It is not. In general, films that deal with this subject are really lagging behind. So for me, I feel that this movie ends with a pretty programmatic movie that fears very outdated theories of psicoanalitics (isn 't it almost embarrassing?), and it doesn't really relate to the real life of life and experience Those who deal with D / s relationships (personal experiences, forums, irc chatrooms as well as recent scientific studies will show it).
