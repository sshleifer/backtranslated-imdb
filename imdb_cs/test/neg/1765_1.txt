This movie was so bad, I thought I'd scream in the middle of it. It was all I could do to sit down. The beginning of the film in which they were at war was promising. All that struck me: "Saving Private Ryan" for me ... or at least an attempt at it. We just don't care about these people. The characters could not be built. The kid who dies, I think he made us cry ... but for some reason, it irritated everyone. Then we must listen to the line after the whimsical dialogue line, which desperately tried to emulate "Wuthering Heights", which was of course also quoted in the film. Go find out. There was nothing original about the film, it was like sitting in the secular parts of every war movie ever made, with a little humor that led you to hope it would be better. Unfortunately it is not so. 3 hours later I left the theatrical feeling of cheating. Anthony Menghilla should be shot to try to duplicate an English patient who was a time was a good movie, but now I'm interested .... I should rent it and make sure I wasn't caught up in HYPE ??? Maybe I was, but I was definitely not hit in this movie's hype. I really went to the theater that I like this movie. I'm a dead Nicole Kidman fan. Save your money, rent it on DVD and laugh as I did it.
