Did people expect Jurassic Park 3 to be full of surprises? Not one moment worth it. Many elements could easily scare people from movies ... and it's not dinos! Tea Leoni ... I think she's a great actress, but I'm sorry she reached the bottom line this time. I was wondering if the vocal chord struggled with the movie ... Laura Dern ... is fine, but why not notice in the movie, maybe exchange smart dialogues with Sam Neil. Alessandro Nivola - "Have you ever heard of something called face expression? Movements, emotions ..." ... it has to work harder! Sam Neil, no big deal. The soundtrack ... has to change the record, or it will make you tired. My applause is William H. Macy, a talented actor I have never seen playing a bad role ... unfortunately, she can't save a movie or a well-computerized dinosaur.
