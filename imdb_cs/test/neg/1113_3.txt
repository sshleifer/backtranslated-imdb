If you have described any of the scenes; the nightmares of the children who murdered you in your sleep, your little daughter talks to ghosts, searches for her lost child in an abandoned mine at night, so fossilized by the fear that you can't move, even if blood from the floor murder victim is dripping on you? then I'd say you had a horror movie. But some as 'Wicked Little Things' just wasn't scary. I am a horror fan and I loved the place, the plot in principle and I liked the three front ladies. I didn't want to see them get hurt, I wanted the "bad" to get only his desserts, the rest of the cast is always just a cannon feed, so I was indifferent to them and playing every clich√©. the book - even up to the torch torch that runs out in the dark in the dark, just as you start whispering the voices that are closing on you. <br /> <br /> I encourage you to view it, but if you're not new to horror movies or under 12, you've already seen it.
