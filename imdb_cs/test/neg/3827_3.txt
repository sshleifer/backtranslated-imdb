It turned out fine and looks interesting. However, as it goes on attempts to create emotions between characters it is so awkward that it really turns horror away and is an insult to serious viewers. The story, which is based on "I went with zombies", is probably much better, although I haven't seen it yet. The "ritual" looks so excited and could be a great movie about zombies and voodoo, but in fact it turned out very bad, which is a shame. It's hard to say what's wrong. I think there are just too many awkward scenes and it's hard to believe, for example, in Alice's lovestory (Alice Dodgson as a girl who supposedly inspired Lewis Carrol to call her hero Alence) and a younger brother. Absolutely nothing was created between them and finally they got married. Anyway, it looks great and it's worth a look - but the movie is so badly done. 3/10.
