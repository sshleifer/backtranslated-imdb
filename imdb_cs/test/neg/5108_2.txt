Man bites it! I'm sorry I ever sat down and watched it! Friedkin was insane for making a film that tried to win the audience's sympathy for this fool. If it were up to me, I would hate the audience for this low life instead of being noticed by everyone looking at it! He killed people! Pretty grizzly I could add too! And Friedkin wants you to excuse him because it's "not right"! I'll tell Friedkin to forget it! I hate this guy, this movie is partly based on and I hope to be wise up and give him a sorry ass juice !!! Don't waste your time in the nut shell! It's sick and perverted!
