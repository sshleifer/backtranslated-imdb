This film is a lengthy effort by director Buddha Boetticher and a nice but not yet intrepid actress Nina Foch, who, as one of the other reviewers notes, is the quintessence of a kind of film B. It's not just a good kind. A promising assumption and excessive fog machine is unnecessary. Basic Conspiracy - Nina, a nurse on holiday due to her nerves, has a nightmare. She meets a friend in the resort where she gives her nerves and realizes she's in a dream, though she never met him. Meanwhile, it turns out that our spirited guy works as a spy, and is preparing for another secret mission that must not be unsuccessful. Of course they are Nazis. And the plot of the hole. And clever people who act in fashion most likely to get into totally unnecessary scratches, so running time can be an hour away. In the end, the film becomes a duel between which a group of spies can act stupidly. If the FBI and the OSS behaved like this crew, we would lose the '42 war. The film itself is quite sharply shot (despite the best efforts of the fog machine) and acting. - It seems it is in many Columbia Bs TCM recently shows - is curiously unengaged. It's less stylized than what could be found from a similarly budgeted Warner Bros movie, but also less fun to watch. Of course, Boetticher's strength is more of a style that allows strong stories and acts in his western Randolph Scott to get to the fore. Perhaps the problem is that such a style will not work when the scenario is miserable and the actors are tired of their five annual plan films.
