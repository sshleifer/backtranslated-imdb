One Chinese gang is attacking and rubbing another gang at the beginning of the movie. Unfortunately, the patriarch of the winning family is killed in this process. Surprisingly and without any discernible reason, the gang asks the volunteer to blame the massacre and leave until the police decide to stop the investigation. Now, as ONE MAN ALONE is the one responsible for about 50 deaths, he's behind me, so this guy's mission just seemed stupid, but that's a conspiracy. Later, when this man returned home, there was betrayal and bullying, resulting in nearly one hour and fifteen minutes of continuous killing. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for a movie about Chinese martial arts with plenty of conspiracy, then perhaps you should skip this movie as its virtually continuous action and virtually no plot or character development - even compared to other martial arts movies . I estimate that 80-90% of the film are battle scenes - endless and reasonably executed battle scenes with knives. Again and again, fighting scenes! If you want a movie with a body count that can get into the hundreds, as people are mowing, kicking and mowing, then it's a movie for you. The problem was the end of the movie there are literally no people left to kill and the movie really lost my interest! It's not deep, but if you want to see the excitement and action ONLY, then this movie is for you! By the way, this film is currently taking place and no one thinks it would shoot the hero to the end. And when they finally do a logical thing, it's too late and the effort is really, really lame! Logical errors like this, and ladies suicide (why ???) make it "turn off the brain" type of movie.
