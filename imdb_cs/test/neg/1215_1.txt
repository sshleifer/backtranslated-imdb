It's amazing that such a cliche-ridden yuppie angst movie actually got first. The characters are so weak and so unnoticed that it's impossible to worry about them - especially Brooke Shields. The temptation to progress quickly through the slow parts is almost irresistible. If you like this genre, you should rather rent "Singles" or "Bodies, Rest & Motion".
