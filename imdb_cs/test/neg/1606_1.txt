The horror of doing it for a TV movie was that it didn't end up with this. It spawned a regular weekly series that was even worse than the pilot / movie. Most films about different professions have some kind of realism for them, and of course it is jazzed to be exciting. It didn't do any of this. If it was in Camp, then it succeeded. A few years ago, he spread out again on the cable and failed again. The performance of Richard Jaeckels as chief boss who did all this was the only part of this film. Campier than Batman Series 60s.
