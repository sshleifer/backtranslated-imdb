When a group of businessmen begins to die in the presence of mysterious Mr. Coulomb, an FBI agent Dick Martin is assigned to the case. Apparently, as Martin continues, Mr. Martin is not very successful. At the end of the film, a strange truth is revealed that I will not reveal. One of the other users who comment on this status "This is a classic movie and should be used and not separated". Sorry, I have to respect this opinion with respect. only being old, in no way affecting his quality, I enjoyed a lot of films with a low budget "B" from this period, but this is not one of them. <br /> <br /> , camera work is very bland, most of the acting is quite wooden (even Lugosi is not big in my opinion) and conspiracy, although interesting premise, seems to be thrown together in a very difficult way.
