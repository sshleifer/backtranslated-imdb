I had a bit of hope for this one-hour film made up of old Poverty Row movies. Surely it had the opportunity to seem more than the home video weight sold in the world. Unfortunately, while funny this film still feels like a home movie, but with traces of stores in. The ship is sinking and well ... it's a movie. The film promises Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney and others who are picked up from old movies to communicate with new footage. We'll get it right, but mostly we get a lot of new videos that look like a scratched black and white movie that new actors are interested in. Old shots are inter-cut mostly set up the scene, but very little of the old and new actually matches, so its just plain to put on. It's not very convincing and is very disappointing for someone like I was looking for a better built movie. Still, if you know and love the old Poverty Row movies, (its very spoofs) it might be worth viewing. I would like to warn you before buying, but it may be for about five dollars, the rental price, so the choice is yours (Although, if you can get away with not paying for it so). Disappointment.
