The trailer is so deceptive ... I thought it would be a good movie ... What was the point for women to be killed in Hong Kong? They could have done it in Paris. And a half-hour fist: <br /> <br /> -You love me! <br /> <br /> No, no! -You love me! <br /> <br /> No, no! -You love me! <br /> <br /> No, no! I repeat 100 times ... then ... Well, I don't love you ... So I'll shoot you! : D Here's why movie piracy is a good thing! Imagine even giving me money for this torture! Sorry for the time I lost while watching ... filmmakers should pay me <br /> <br /> for the inconvenience ... The worst movie ever seen ...
