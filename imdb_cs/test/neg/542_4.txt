Above all, I mean, I'm a very big Naruto fan. I love Anime and Manga stories. Also, the first movie just confirmed that Naruto is about great entertainment, great action, a great story ... But then came a second movie. I was greatly praised because the first movie was great. But it did not satisfy me a little ... The story was lame, the action was not so great ... especially compared to the Anime series ... the same goes for the quality of animation. I found it very bad ... Could the story get some lamer ... ANY ??? Where is Naruto Kyuubi? He won't do a demon once ... I mean ... I accept !!! My advice is ... see the series (until episode 140, then it's just a fill) and then read the Manga because it's still great. Ignore this movie and hope for something better in the future ... <br /> <br /> Everything and everything I gave him 4, just because it's Naruto ...
