many people said it was a great movie with Hoffman, which brings great performance. I went from mistrust to getting bored until he almost left. it's not there. Hoffman goes out. is committed to performance. but sometimes he plays a handicapped man looks like an affected actor chewing on the scenery. no characters in the movie other than the capote are much more than placeholders - nell, jack, perry, shawn, sheriff are all one dimensional. yes film shows a manipulative, preening, rogue capote party. it shows them so many times that I became interested in why - do the creators think that everything needs to be explained? and again? and again? It often refers to the capote is a genius, but it does not show it. It shows him that he is surrounded by fans and flatters, but never convinces us why. but my goal is not to deconstruct a movie. I'm sure others will have other interpretations. for me it was a two-hour movie that looked like five.
