Concorde ... The '79 Airport begins in Washington, where a man named Carl Parker (Macon (McCalman) combines with a high profile of television news reporters Maggie Whelan (Susan Blakely) to pass on secret documents that prove his boss Kevin Harriosna (Robert Wagner) ) The owner and president of Harrison Industries, a military weapon company, has illegally sold these weapons abroad, but Maggie sees Carla murdered and barely escaping her life, Maggie's next morning to catch Concorde to Moscow via Paris intends to whistle at Harrison who also becomes her friend to destroy him, decided to rescue and reprogram his hi-tech 'Buzzard' homing rocket to capture and destroy the Concorde during a trial run killing all those on board and destroying documented evidence ... br /> <br /> Renamed '80 Airport - Concorde for its film and introductory home Video recordings since it was released here in 1980, rather than in 1979's last entry to the franchise airport directed by David Lowell Rich & is a notoriously bad film that was apparently laughing during the press & test screenings challenge Universal to promote the film as an action comedy. The first thing to say is that the Concorde ... '79 Airport is a really stupid and downright daft movie, but on a purely entertaining basis I can think of much worse movies to spend 108 minutes watching, I really can. I really liked the absurd conspiracy of a rich industrialist who wanted to kill his television reporter before exposing him as an illegal arms dealer, but this guy doesn't do savvy and definitely the best way to do it is to throw Concorde out with his own guided missile & then he gets a fench fighter pilot to try and shoot it down before it finally sabotages so really there are three mini disasters swipe in one here because every time super pilot Joe Patrons can save the day. Did you know that Joe Patroni played George Kennedy appears in all four movies at the airport and goes from the mechanic in the first pilot extradinaire Concorde in this, I also thought it was a little jinx because at the age of nine he participated in four. disasters. I think the real reason why a series of airports stopped here was that the Patrons retired after this and jinx were canceled. Some of the things that are happening here are just stupid, Patrons are rolling with rollers, flying upside down, and maneuvering a missile in a gigantic Concorde, not to mention dropping it from his firearm window to destroy the rocket . keeping the head quiet. This guy is good, very good. Then there is a character, there is a saxophone playing a black dude who smokes weeds in the toilets, an old woman with a bladder problem and a team of Russian gymnasts with bad accents. Despite being shot down by a rocket and then attacked by a Jet fighter, the Concorde's passengers do not seem to be bothered the next day and returned to the deck happily. a safer way to travel and why don't the police or authorities question anyone? Why does the Captain of the Concorde Patronium just go out and sleep with a French prostitute? The Concorde ... Airport '79 is definitely not boring & is full of unforgettable moments and I was a fun way, although it's far from a good movie & a modern audience may not have the patience with the hell I liked what it was in silly way, but it's not any kind of classic. <br /> <br /> Although Concorde is no longer flying, it's still a pretty cool looking plane and there's lots of shots that are used here Concorde ... '79 was the seventh. This Concorde was also the same aircraft that crashed after a tire crash caused the fuel tank to burst and fuel leak ignite on July 25, 2000, while taking off in Paris unfortunately resulting in the death of 109 passengers and crew on board and 4 people on the ground. When it broadcast almost twenty minutes of new footage in the US in 1982, most of them were shot more than two years after the original production was completed. I know that most of the effects they have are reflected, but I don't suppose they're too bad, when you consider it in the late 1970s, I think they're getting right. The camera moves during effect shots, using real-world real-world footage rather than toy models, which I think would look much worse and I would definitely see what the creators are trying to do with limited funds and limited technologies. Strangely, they are quite impressive without it looking good if you know what I mean. Probably the most events packed from all the movies at the airport are rockets, exploding planes, a brave fall landing, assassinations, and a man named Robert Palmer (no, not a singer) who puts a woman's head in the hot tub. IMDb says it had a budget of about $ 14 million, which is actually more than I thought maybe these special effects aren't so impressive after all. Shot in Utah, Washington, Los Angeles and France. Acting is not great here, people don't worry about going to die. Goerge Kennedy gets some bad one-liners while Robert Wagner plays a bad guy. Concorde ... '79 is fun for bad movie enthusiasts everywhere & be brutally honest Rather watch this fun movie clutter than about two hours nominated for an Oscar.
