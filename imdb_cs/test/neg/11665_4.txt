It turned out to be more of a Romanesque film with the tension of women than soap than I was hoping it was ... just a tense thriller. Yes, the last 20 minutes were tense, but most of the previous 75 borders were just boring. Ruter Hauer was a bit too subdued and did not play his normal intense character. Natasha Richardson sport somewhat stupid look most of the time and her character was very annoying. The story is so-so. It's not as bad as I do, but it's definitely nothing to watch again, and the back of the VHS describing this movie was misleading.
