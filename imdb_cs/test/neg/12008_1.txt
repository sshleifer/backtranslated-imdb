That's a horrible movie. Full of clich√©s, confused scenes, very bad acting and a bleak scenario. It's hard to believe that the same guys who wrote People vs. Larry Flint and The Man on the Moon have written this waste. Man, this is my Top 10 Worst Movies of All Time. Did this guy, this director, if you could tell him, realized that the first problem kid was bad enough? Let it continue! Amazing that this movie can be shown to children, let alone released! 1 of 10 *
