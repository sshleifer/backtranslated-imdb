This is a little less frightening than the first two movies, but otherwise it is a business as usual: scuzzy, sleazy and an unbalanced slice of a sick cinema. Charles Bronson is back when his friend kills yoby by terrorizing the neighborhood. Crime, as you can see, is 11% higher in South Belmont ... so what's going to be done? A stronger police presence? Stricter Prison? Stricter sentences? No, the only solution is to send in a free cannon like Bronson to object to bloodthirsty revenge? Or, as the writers would do, justice: this time it is the personal killer machine of Chief Ed Lauter. The writers bend back to create a Kersey hero and send unnecessary cops to the area. merely confiscating a weapon from an older resident who holds it for protection, and delivering a scene in which Kersey stolen his camera and shot the thief in the back to applaud the crowd. Death penalty for theft? Good. The attitude of everyone in the movie is that it is a solution, and the dishonest twisting of the characters to the cipher that exist only for the pleasure of Kersey on or back to him is scary. Sure, these rascals are Scum, but shouldn't the film leave the audience to change their minds, rather than leaning the whole thing on Kersey and his mindless answer? Rich people are not afraid of gang charges or accuse Kersey of any violence that is strange because one character is killed just because of Kersey's involvement. At the end of the film, they all take their weapons from their sock drawers and rejoice in the massacre, never stop thinking about things or fighting the idea of ​​having to kill another human being. <br /> <br /> cruelly shallow performances don't help ?? Bronson has literally one facial expression all over the world and can't even say the right words. Are new stupidity levels being achieved? machine gun? Raketomet? ?? and new misogyny minima: the film seeks to desecrate every female figure in sight, whether by rape, explosion, or throat; and build them in a totally silly fashion, like one victim who sets off for a crime-driven, gang-controlled neighborhood to ask a stranger or another who buys himself at night. This is dreck, clean and simple, mindless garbage, stacked without style or meaning.
