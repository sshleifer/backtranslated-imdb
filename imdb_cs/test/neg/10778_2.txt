Yawning, this is my reaction to this movie. I really hoped it would be a good modern slasher, but it doesn't even fall into the slashers category. Instead, he tries to be something that's not, which is a psychological thriller, and that fails so badly. Even the name "Freak" suggests it might be interesting. Compare it to the DVD cover and think "OK, maybe I'll try." It's not worth the time. The story begins with a little interesting thing when a poorly deformed child with bandages wrapped around his head strapped by his fat mother. He screams at him and probably beats him, because in one scene we see her slapping him unreasonably. After all, he decides he has enough and breaks her face with (I believe) rock. Today he is now in a crazy asylum procedure and is being moved. On the way he breaks out of the van he is in and escapes. Also introduce 2 leading characters, a little girl and her older sister. They move and set out on a journey. So most of the movie is driving in the car talking to each other. But the "Freak" bandage is now freelance and is about going on a stormy murder! (That's because I'm totally sarcastic) <br /> <br /> I can't believe how boring this movie is. The budget was the smallest, with no special effects, and a dialogue I could take less. This is one of those films where the cover is better than the film itself. And compare it to Halloween?! Garbage! I'm not even a fan of the Halloween series (except 3.), but Halloween is much better than this. At least with Halloween, we have a great score and some really scary moments. With this, there is virtually no music except any piano here and there and there is nothing scary about this film. Perhaps this film would do better if it had a solid score, because even the worst movies are tolerable if the music is good. Well, that's just my opinion on the movie. I thought it was just a complete pass of time and money. But since the film has more than 4/10 ratings on IMDb, there must be people who like this movie. I'm not one of those people. 2/10
