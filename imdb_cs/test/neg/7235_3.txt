I would have to say that I saw worse originals of the Sci Fi channel, but this Nu Image shonker by Yossi Wein was still quite a bit. The big problem is that it's just not convincing, not just its creation, but playing, writing and any attempts at drama. The direction lacks any talent, and the scenario of Boaz Davidson and Danny Lerner never really works, predictably, often ridiculously, while delivering fewer magicians than the few such films that never offer anything to engage or increase the pulse. The actors do their best, but with such material, their workers' efforts have little effect. Matthew Reilly Burke is a crazy traceable hero, Meredith Morton similar to blandly traceable love interest. In fact, she was a little less convincing, but at least she was easy to see. At the very least, the film has a dignity to mix with a reasonable pace, but its biggest plus is that the octopus is not fully rendered by CGI. So even if it doesn't look good, at least there are several legitimate scenes of characters who come together in fun fashion with rubber tentacles. I also laughed at the differences between the various representations of the octopus, cgi shots of the creature as a whole varied throughout the film, differing not only in size, but also in the practical shots of it, and these are scenes where the tentacle action suggests that the creators have left the pretense that they make a movie about an octopus, and just imagine that their creature is like a bunch of different tentacles. Scenes attacking people are getting old enough, but there are some fun scenes where it insists on other things like boat and crane. Yes, these scenes are bad, but they make me laugh. The undisputed highlight, however, is the hilarious sequence in which an octopus takes a landmark on New York, the scene doesn't have to be much more than a minute, but it's really inspired and worth a look at youtube. In addition, things are uninspired all round, (PG level gore or ugliness stops this one from even off a lot in good times garbage) movie to turn into a half-accepting film territory disaster at the end, but I can't really afford it because the best shots of the last scenes were removed from Stallone flight Daylight (which I think is pretty good). Altogether it was pretty rubbishy stuff and not something I would really recommend to anyone except the feature of die hards. Better than poke in the eye with a wet stick, but not much.
