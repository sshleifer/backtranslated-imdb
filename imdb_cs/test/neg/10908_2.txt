Next First: This French film is my introduction to the world of Eric Rohmer. I may be a little hasty when I say it's probably my last film, Rohmer, but I was immediately turned off as Rohmer relies on monotonous philosophical talks that never get to the point. There is a scene in the movie where the characters discuss love that I thought would never end. Honestly, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't understand why Rohmer was so highly regarded among the Kaffels. He struck me as one of those unpleasant people who are filled with hot air. If it's a sample of what his films are about, I'm not interested. I don't care much about French cinematography (usually reflexive and speculative to error), so maybe I'm interested.
