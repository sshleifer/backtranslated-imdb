One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, I know I'm not a target group. The target audience is women, either college or middle age, or aged, I think. I am nothing of it, so manufacturers don't mind if I don't like it. But this does not excuse the fact that dialogue and conspiracy are terrible. The main character Phoebe goes on a trip to Europe to find out what happened to her sister Faith, who committed suicide. Phoebe is a human character with whom I hope no one is involved with her. Faith is also a character with very little credibility. Wolf is the only person who seems to be somewhat sensible. As I said, the dialogue is boring and uninteresting. Sometimes it makes absolutely stupid. The absolute worst part is that Phoebe and Faith's father are artists, but his paintings are absolutely terrible. There's nothing new, interesting or refreshing in this movie. If your guy, you'll pray for the end. If your chick, you will be able to sit but you will be unimpressed.
