I don't remember much about this film, except that the lights were clearly destroyed. Almost every battle scene involved unnecessary and reckless destruction of useful luminaires, even though it was equipped with 70's kitschy shades that kept up with the story. On one occasion there is a devastating destruction of the lamp in the home battle scene between the brothers in the residential and dining rooms of their home. However, the most dangerous destruction will occur somewhat later in the bookmaker's offices and includes, but is not limited to, the dropping of a ceramic horse base luminaire, which subsequently disintegrates, and the strong serration of a cylindrical shade as a guy falls back into it during further combat battles. Later, this lamp is also dropped when a person is shot, causing further damage to the plastic-coated shadow. Although this film promotes a particularly wasteful approach to lamps, it must be borne in mind that lamps, regardless of their cheap design or gauche, top-heavy appearance, are still valuable for the lighting they provide . However, if you ever felt the need to broker the lamp, I would recommend this movie.
