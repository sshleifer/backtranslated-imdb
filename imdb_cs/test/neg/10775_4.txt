As we are well aware, films are not trying to be a direct incorporation of history, but it is a shame when a film is made, which has no correlation at all. I wish the director and / or the screenwriter would do their research on this topic. All that this film does is create a forum for hate among people and at the same time cause a rift that shouldn't be there. This film depicted Sikhs and Muslims in a very negative dominion, while the third group (Hindus) looked as if it did not exist in the brutal killing of the people of both nations. The inaccuracies in connection with the contempt for the conspiracy to faith described by "Gian Singh" were shame in the highest format. Although in more positive positions, the actors did a great job in their roles. Both Kristen K and Neve C played their roles exceptionally. I hope that those who watch this movie do not see it or use it as a template for the current historical event.
