I rented a Matrix Revisited with my friend. We both loved The Matrix and we both love filming, so we wanted to see what was going on behind the scenes of the Matrix. The Matrix Revisited turned out to be almost nothing about the art of filming, or how The Matrix was created. It's basically a huge advertisement for The Matrix, a movie that The Matrix Revisited has already seen! <br /> <br /> If you really want to know about the process and the problems and stress and detail that went into The Matrix, look no further than bonus features on The Matrix DVD. There are things that show up in those documents that I didn't even realize had to be made or were made. Matrix was such a challenging and challenging movie that it deserves more credit than a "documentary" that is about as informative and interesting as MTV special.
