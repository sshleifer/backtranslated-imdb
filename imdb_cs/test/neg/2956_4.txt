Anna Christie (Greta Garbo) returns to her father Chris (George F Marion) after 15 years. He is the captain of the ship and remains with him. During this time, she meets Matt (Charles Bickford) and they fall in love. Matt and Chris don't see their eyes and Anna has a secret to admit ..................... <br /> <br /> What a boring story ...... it starts Wrong with George F Marion and Marie Dressler playing drunk at the bar. The scene continues forever and both are terrible. It's also hard to understand. In fact, it's hard to understand the entire cast. I missed all the sections of the dialogue between Bickford, Marion and Garbo because it is incomprehensible! Obviously, Garbo is something special because you are always alerted to her when she is on the screen and her presence gives this movie 4 stars I gave him. But nothing happens - it's a boring story with terrible accents. You'll do well to stay awake.
