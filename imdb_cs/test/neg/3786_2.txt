The most interesting thing about Anemic Cinema is its title: anagram, which is almost also a palindrome. Unfortunately, it only works in American English because anemic is spelled differently in Britain. I've always found Man Ray's dilettante and his artistic effort to be deeply conceited, and I never understood why his work attracted so much attention. In addition to his Rayographs (which he invented by accident, and which are only direct-contact photographic prints), his one real contribution to culture seems to be that he was the first photographer to depict female nudity in a way that was adopted as art rather than porn . But it must have happened in the end, and there is no real reason Ray deserves credit. The critical response to Man Ray reminds me of the story of the Emperor's new outfit. <br /> <br /> In the early sixties, the second season of 'The Twilight Zone' opened every episode with a shot of rotating concentric circles in black and white. Anemic Cinema has an image that is so similar, I wonder if the "Twilight Zone" borrowed it from this movie. The main difference is that the rotating image here is a black and white spiral. If there is any film that deserves to be described as a spiral, it is this one. Throughout 'Anemic Cinema' we are processing (?) Shots of a rotating disk containing words (in French) moving in a spiral. The effect is vertiginous, and the texts - about incest and Eskimos - are almost Dada in their absurdity. I laughed at one smart sex pun. Emperor is naked, people, and this film barely evaluates 2 points out of 10. Au suivant!
