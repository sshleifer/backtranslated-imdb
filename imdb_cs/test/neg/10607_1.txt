Pure crap, decent cinematography ... I liked several colors. Otherwise, it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Boring, lifeless, I was never interested in any of the characters. I waited for the real plot to appear, and the movie was going to rise. Nothing happened! I think they spent too much time working on their hair and wardrobe they forgot that there was a movie at that time.
