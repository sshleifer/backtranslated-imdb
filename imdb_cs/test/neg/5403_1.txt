As a useful warning to others, I believe that "Skeleton Man" is actually worse than "Raptor Island". I use RI as an example of the worst original movie on Sci-Fi, but SM is the most ridiculously incoherent and stupidly designed movie I've ever seen. Yes, I was watching almost the whole thing and I got about 35 minutes. It pulled me clean. What was science fiction thinking? Once the Skeleton Man and the leader of the surviving platoon (or whatever was - I am not good at the military unit terminology) reached the chemical plant, the film moved into a zone of impossible nonsense that was almost fascinating. I had the same idea as another viewer, wondering if more than one movie was modified to create one awful whole.
