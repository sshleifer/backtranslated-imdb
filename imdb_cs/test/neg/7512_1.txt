If you like it, I'll see it in a film history class or something like that in your school, try to convince your teacher to see something else. believe me, something is better than this movie. is slow, confusing, boring, poorly constructed, bloody, ugly, must I go on? It's good news, but I saw that they were treated better in several other movies. Acting is nothing good at all. This movie is even more tricky because it starts out as funny (though not supernatural) because it's a surreal story than in the end, just becoming unpleasant to watch. I honestly feel like 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life has been robbed. Why would anyone want to watch the girls describe 10 minutes before they watch the traffic jams for 20 minutes, listen to the hippie who may appear to be a sheep, witness some rape before a woman's main role sees eating her husband. Frankly speaking, this film deserves nothing but 1/10. And if your dissatisfied with my view, I'm seriously an open minded person and I like movies that protest through symbolism, but this movie was just terrible. make an excuse to avoid this movie.
