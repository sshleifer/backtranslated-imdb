Unusually cool and stupid drama by director Sydney Pollack. Soap drawing revolves around an adulterous couple who died in an aircraft wreck. Romance-novel writing is being healed, though I thought the performances of Harrison Ford and Kristen Scott-Thomas were all right. Slick production takes an interest even when the plot covers the same ground, and never creates any emotional momentum. As a result, the top of the airport is big "So what?".
