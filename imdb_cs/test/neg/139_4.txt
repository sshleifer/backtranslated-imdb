When I was young, I got up early in the morning every Saturday morning to watch cartoons, but to turn on a local channel for what was called Kung Fu Theater. It was not as if these films were works of art. It was not as if these films came from China, Japan, Korea or any other country; if the story had anything to do with the fight? is it swordplay or fisticuffs ??? and if the struggles did not resemble anything that was happening in any American gym then it was good enough. It wasn't as if they were really very good. They were simply great action moves with incredibly dramatic music, where the hero reaped his revenge for a number of bad guys and then returned the credits. "The Sword on the Moon" is very similar to these films of my youth, probably a little thematic return due to a welcome twist that muddled characters so much that it is becoming harder to say the wrong of good. Yun (Cho Jae Hyun) is known throughout the kingdom as a "human butcher". He kills quickly and mercilessly on behalf of the Chun Dynasty, the emperor's main bodyguard, who saved his men's life and life for his service. However, the equally ruthless rebel and his beautiful sidekick appear in the country and begins the murder of imperial ministers, and Yun agrees to find these rebels and kills them. His quest becomes one of the personal discoveries when he learns that both rebels are Choi (a friend of his past) and his former love, Shi Yeong. Sadly, the "sword" doesn't have much to do to distinguish itself from other action movies. Some overwhelming cinematography is almost totally unnecessary on clumsy editing with parts of the film put together so freely its hard to believe that what inevitably did it into the movie was what someone intended. While the atmosphere and story tend to attract a dark mood, the tone is almost sacrificed to a never-ending flashback show, because each of the main characters has a healthy story arc. What should be a quick and easy action movie gets weighted too much personal luggage, and the film suffers as a result. I read that this film marks the first Korean real foray into the world of art-house action pieces alongside "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". Next time, I will strongly suggest that manufacturers keep a bit of "fighting" and a little less "art."
