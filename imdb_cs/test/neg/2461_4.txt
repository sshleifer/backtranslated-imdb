I suppose this is about as demanding as a shallow director, as Joel Schumacher could do. A group of medical students turns to die for a few minutes; after the revival, they find that their sins have somehow manifested themselves. Because some of the characters are visited by dead people, and some seem to be persecuted by their guilty conscience, it is not entirely clear what the connection is, but the visions seem like the sixth form of art films. Why students consider their experiment to be some kind of magnificent journey that makes them famous is a bit of a mystery because the results are totally erratic and have been documented many times before. Yet it is nice to see Schumacher practitioner for his Batman wrecks with a bit of old neon colors and colorful bulbs. And William Baldwin is a board.
