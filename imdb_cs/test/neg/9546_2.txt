The Bone Collector takes place in New York and is one of the world's leading experts in crime and crime. Lincoln Rhyme (Denzel Washington) is involved in an accident that leaves him quadriplegic on the bed. Jump forward four years & Alan (Gary Swanson) and his wife Lindsay Rubin (Olivia Birkelund) are kidnapped, soon after New York cop Amelia Donaghy (Angelina Jolie) is summoned to the crime scene and finds a buried and crippled Alan body. Amelia notices some unusual evidence from the crime scene and notes what impresses Rhyme when asked to work in this case, quickly realizes that the evidence is actually mysterious clues to where Lindsay is. After the police got to the clues, the cops get late to save her, but that's just the beginning when a sadistic serial killer still kills and leaves forensic traces for Rhyme and the police ... <br /> <br / > Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night & I must say it's one of the worst big budget contributions The Silence of the Lambs (1991) & Se7en (1995) serial killers thrillers I've seen, actually it does Friday 13 . (1980)) look sophisticated and realistic! Jeremy Iacone's script was based on Jeffery Deaver & is so poor on so many levels, I hardly know where to start. For starters it takes fatally seriously & it does all the other flaws seem twice as bad. The characters are really horrible and I didn't believe any of them were real people. First we have Lincoln Rhyme, who is paralyzed from the neck down and there is nothing he can do with him, in fact, he is literally unable to do anything but lie in bed for the whole movie. Obviously overwhelmed by Amelia, because she stopped the train and thought a new footprint could be important near the murdered man, I'm not funny, but no cop realized that there might be some importance near the murder victim. ? Why is she so impressed with her? Then there is Capatin Cheney, who is not just relentless and screaming at all for no apparent reason, but is so incompetent that he could not combine several murders committed in a short period of time, with each victim having body parts and skin surgically removed from the body, exactly how the guy got into the police captain? Then there's a murderer whose motives are less than plausible, are you trying to tell me that they came up with a complex plan to kill at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did? If they wanted to avenge Rhyme, why they killed all the other people who had nothing to do with anything, I could probably buy someone who wanted to take revenge against the man who put them down, but not to kill a few other people who had no connection to each other. , the intended goal of Rhyme something else. Also, after devising a complex plan to kill these people and get away with being suddenly turned into the dumbest person in history, though holding a big knife and able to walk and use their weapons, they are actually defeated and almost killed by the quadriplegic who has no movement in his body under his throat! How did it happen? I should also mention Amelia, who is terrible in nature, she actually buys her own camera to take the scene of a photo and shoots rats for no apparent reason. In addition to some of the worst written characters, the story is sometimes, and the plot is not much better. We never find out why the murderer uses The Bone Collector as an inspiration. We never found out why the killer was taking the streams of meat from his victims. It never explains why a novice like Amelia is allowed to enter the crime scene before the right forensic teams. There is no reason why a murderer would choose his victims. Also, the killing of murderers is a bit unclear, isn't it? I mean bloody animal bones and shaved hair of a rat? Logically, how does anyone go from the bones and rats hair to the exact location of the next victim & has the whole of New York to choose from? There is some nonsense about the bird that sits on the ledge of the Rhymes window, which is just totally random & for almost two hours Bone Collector is really slow. There's so much wrong with The Bone Collector & it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever, it's horrible at all levels and has zero credibility. Angelina Jolie seems to have said she made the nude scenes for this movie, but they were cut out because they felt too distracting. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 48,000,000, the Bone Collector is well made with good value production and it's Hollywood shine about it. I must also add that I think Angelina Jolie is giving one of the worst performances I've ever seen, I think she's absolutely terrible about it. Denzel Washington is a bit of a lie there, Queen Latifah is terrible, and even Michael Rooker can't do anything clich√© and one-dimensional character. The bone collector must be one of the worst Hollywood movies I've seen in a while, I saw it last night free and I still feel cheated and torn. Is there only so many things that can be stupid, stupid, terrible or should it be awfully embarrassing? He works in both ways to be honest ...
