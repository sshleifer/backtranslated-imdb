Anyone who thinks this movie is great needs desperate for their head to see. It strikes me that this movie was created as a joke. He has no good points. Props cost around $ 10 and the entire set seems to fall at any time. Why do such films get first? It also had two of the most annoying characters I've ever encountered in a young boy on a spacecraft and a twentieth century weed. This film is almost as bad as "Cool as Ice", where the incredibly talented vanilla "misunderstood" ice plays.
