Okay, let's start with the good: nice scenery, Channing Tatum is easy to see, Amanda Seyfried has nice hair, that's about it. How much of this movie was on the editorial floor? Probably plot, action, good dialogue and point. Terrible dealings, terrible choppy dialogue. Let me tell you how bad it is: my friend, who always screams at movies, got into that part that was supposed to trigger tears, so she laughed that we thought she was crying! The film seems to want to take a stab at too many problems - war, loss, autism, cancer, but it fails so unhappily that it satisfies every topic satisfactorily. Make sure you have something to go on and your mobile phone will return text messages!
