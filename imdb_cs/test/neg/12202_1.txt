This is what I felt screaming as well as stomping from the theater, but I abstained. Yes, acting was great, not this typical Hollywood movie, but the dialogue just didn't end up (or didn't care)! And despite all the gabbings, you will never get any of the characters. Definitely the most boring film I've ever seen from Sphere, but I was expecting the boring one. I had to sit, but please spare yourself
