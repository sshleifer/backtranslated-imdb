Staying Alive has a very similar story to some Asian horror movies that include technology on the story. Some of these Asian horror movies are One Missed Call, Ringu and Pulse. So, the idea of ​​staying Alive is very cliché and obvious, but the filmmakers behind them did not know how to put something new or an interesting cliché at Stay Alive. But very big crap.All elements of Stay Alive belong to the worst class of 'horror' movies: shallow figures, nothing of tension, stupid 'horror' that makes laughter and light violence.It is easy to realize that '' director '' not being able to create something original or distracting. I don't want to lose more time writing about this pathetic film. I just give you advice: you don't see this movie. I really hated it.
