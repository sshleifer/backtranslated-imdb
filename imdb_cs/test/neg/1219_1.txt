This film is miserable across borders. It's incredible - very bad ripoff from jaws and other (better) shark movies. Really bad - everything is really pathetic. The story is the purest crap, the actors are bad, the effects are very cheap, no creativity at all. It seems that some really weakened children have taken Jaws's screenplay and arranged it randomly, then his parents have taken an 8mm camera and filmed a movie with their neighbors. Music is really inappropriate, just some "elevator" music, bland and too optimistic when nothing happens, then a little less optimistic when the shark is around or when children get depressed (again listening to VELD LOUD music). Carlo Maria (author) should be so ashamed to ask to delete her name from the titles !! The film acts as a perfect demonstration of how miserable music destroys ANY *** scene to be exciting. But there is one crucial difference to the jaws: There are comments about stupid people trying to kill dynamite sharks at the beginning of their jaws. Well, there's an attempt to kill dynamite shark. When it doesn't work, guys get *** BIG LOAD *** dynamite and spend as a 1/4 movie placing explosives in some sunken ship. This IS a really original way to catch fish I have to admit! They use so much dynamism as if they were trying to kill a battleship (I'd guess the battleship Bismarck) or dig another channel Panama. That's just incredible. I'm glad they didn't try to use a napalm-flamethrower or a tactical nuclear strike to eliminate this bad, bad, 2m shark. Well, there is also a mystical vanishing Indian (who looks like a German pensioner) in this mess. It's not a movie, it's a warning of how bad movies can be! It is useful as a warning. However, the public should be protected from this crap. Most of the Italian movies are bad, but this ... is really exceptional in the worst sense of the word.
