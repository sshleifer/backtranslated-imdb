it's just me or all the "horror" movies become nothing but titties, slapstick, and over the top villain who can't be killed. this film didn't make sense. What happened to the time when a man could escape from a killer like a hostel. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. Victor Crowley was the worst killer I've ever seen. He reminded me how a demon appeared between quasimod and leatherette. It was over the top that while the winner there lay on fire no one thought he was finishing the job. and the end was the biggest disappointment of all reminiscent of the soprano final. I had to agree with fella behind me when he blurted out ... CO F ***! if i could give the movie a negative score i would take care of it.
