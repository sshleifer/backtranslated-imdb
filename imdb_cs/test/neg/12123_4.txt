Think of Jumanji, but with the curse of death. A bunch of surfers gets their hands in a game that takes the life of someone playing it. Probably it was made from the skin of a witch during the Spanish Inquisition and carries a nasty curse. Okay, easy and just a little observable story is nothing you haven't seen before. real surprises. By far the worst thing SyFy runs, but it's definitely not the best. There are better choices out there, but if it's your only choice, you won't completely hate it.
