Without emotions. Bad music (and I'm a reformed 80th metal guy, so I would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) Everything is half finished. Brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us apart from what the horror of the 1980s will see. The tour leader is trying to bring humanity to the cause, but he doesn't have enough time. Wahlberg is fine and Aniston slumming. We know she didn't need the money. Is it the only role she could fit into the summer break? She must always slap her forehead when she appears on VH1 - a little less often than Ozzy. He barely qualifies as a television film. It's hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.
