This movie was terrible. You can't move fast forward to get to the end of this movie. It came to the last 20 minutes of the movie and I literally pressed the eject button right in the middle of the scene. It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Worse than all Dean Cain movies. At the beginning, the actions were terrible. I realize that the main actors were from the cast of the survivors, but one would think that every television experience would give them a little more talent. Another major problem was the film's visual effect and poor film quality. The theme of the exhibition was well-meaning in the defense of the films and the story was fine.
