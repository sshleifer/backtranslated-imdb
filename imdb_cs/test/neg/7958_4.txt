Deepa tried again to bravely develop a theme nobody wants to talk about. The story is fine, cinematography is excellent, the screenplay and acting are below average. I think the blame is for the citizens of Uttar Pradesh in India, where its original set was destroyed in 2000. The result was a completely different cast, I'm just wondering what a grand movie would be if it was the original Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das and Aamir Khan. Current actors Lisa Ray (who is simply good at bedding in Bombay) and John Abraham are pathetic need basic lessons in acting. Seema Biswas, Raghubir Yadav and Kulbushan Kharbabda have saved the film as much as possible. The kid did a great job. Editing and streaming a movie is also not something you would expect from Deepy. A great subject, it sends a strong message of practice that is still abundantly uncontrollable in rural India, but does not meet the standards Deepa has set for itself in Fire and Earth. Watch it once ... when it's on DVD, don't bother paying $ 10 for seeing it ... but its outbid will beat the average Hindu movie every day
