Look, I know Angel isn't a show type that gives people a happy ending, and I know they couldn't finish everything, but I couldn't believe the end was Angel. I absolutely love the show, it's maybe the best show ever. However, I really hated this ending, as did the entire journey of the 2nd half of the Angel Season 5 (like Buffy Season 7). My favorite characters died were almost insignificant and did nothing to conspire. Cordelia was one of the best characters in the show, and once she and Angelo finally got together, she turned all the evil and the demon. I wanted so badly to take her back, she didn't make me a bad episode where Cordelia came back, she was fantastic, but I was still really crazy when she was gone. Then he was on the ground with Fred dying, right after she finally got to Wesley? There was no sacrifice, it was unnecessary, she did nothing for the conspiracy and the girl with the blue hair of the demons was terrible, unnecessary in nature. They spent too much of their center and concentrated around it. Another big problem is that they did not connect the elements sufficiently. I know those guys in the black thorn wanted to bring the apocalypse, but there wasn't even a date to make it happen. Apocalypse should have been made and discovered throughout the season, rather than merely mentioning that one hour before the end of the season some evil cheaters are. One of the biggest problems is any character that the audience is interested in, is either dead or has nothing to live for. My three favorite characters have died and Angel, Spike and Gunn (who are not sure they will survive) have no office, are not back to their helpless help, are in the middle of a huge battle and have lost who they care for. Angel and Spike are never redeemed, losing the girl they care about, and just that they're all dead, and they still have to fight this strange evil army. I'll get a whole that you never stop fighting, but it was stupid to end up right in the middle. There could be no redemption, knowing that there would always be many more battles. I don't understand why this episode is so highly valued because I think the end of Buffy was ten times better, and I wasn't even a huge fan of this one. Why they had to slip at the end, season 3 and 4 and the first half of five were so amazing, then they went and spoiled the show.
