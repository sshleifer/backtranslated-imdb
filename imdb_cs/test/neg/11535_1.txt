I totally hated this movie. Although the film wanted to send out some sort of social message, it was in a clich√© that was and was melodramatic, like a Mexican soap opera. Also, acting was terrible especially for Charityn and her son. This is one of the problems with Dominican films, used by celebrities who cannot act only to attract the masses. Even more ashamed of the positive reviews, which unfortunately mean that the Dominicans are just condescending to what's going on here, instead of honest and critical opinions that will help our film industry stand up to quality.
