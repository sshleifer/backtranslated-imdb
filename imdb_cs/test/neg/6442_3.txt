In the second half of 1987, I spent three months in the East End of London when the exhibition was in the air for nearly two years. It was considered a running joke. Why? Because it had all the white cast. Each member and other member in the first few years was white. The street where I lived was long, with more than 800 houses, and to my best knowledge I was one of three. or four white faces living on that street. We were on the corner of the Indian and Turkish neighborhoods, and while you ruled out the two races, Asians and Afro-Caribbeans outnumbered the white people by twenty-two. In addition, of course, the very small number of white people who lived in the area * was the vast majority of Scots like me - the Cockney accent was never heard. It wasn't a racist rant, just a simple fact. The BBC couldn't bother passing through London London reconnaissance before writing this soap, otherwise only white actors were available and decided to do it. The East End of the time, we considered it a comedy show. :-)
