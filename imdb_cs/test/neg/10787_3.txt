I think the film's handwriting was written on a piece of toilet paper. No respect for the many important details the movie really does. For example, the names of some Serbian terrorists (which I remember) are Caradan Maldic, Ivanic Loyvek and Leo Hasse. What are the names? Definitely not Serbian! By the way, Caradan Maldic !!! What name, I laughed for days thinking about it. Probably implications on Karadzic and Mladic. Secondly, the Serbs have never done any cases of terrorism. The journalist, as the main character, should have known. Third, actors who play Serbian terrorists are neither Serbs nor Serbo-Croatian. All this is aside, this film is firmly acted on, but the story is paper-thin and full of holes. Sometimes it makes no sense !!!
