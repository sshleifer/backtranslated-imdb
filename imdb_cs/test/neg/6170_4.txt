Mickey Rourke Hunts Diane Lane at Elmore Leonard's Killshot It's not like Mickey Rourke ever really disappeared. Before returning to the scene, he had a steady appearance. He was memorable in: Dominoes, the City of Sin, the Man on Fire, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and Get Carter. But in his mighty dramatic performance at The Wrestler (2008), we see the full presentation of the character referred to in Get Carter. Whenever we meet him, Rourke remains a cool, but slim, thin muscle ball. This is Elmore Leonard's story and production. Leonard wrote such notable films as the taunt of the western thriller 3:10 to Yuma, being Cool, Jackie Brown, getting shorts, 52 Pick-Up, and Joe Kidd. That means we get tough guys, some good, some not so good. It also means that we get tight, realistic figures with characters that do whatever is best for them in every situation, weaving complications into violent conclusions. Killshot is no different. Rourke, a tough, slim killer, unknowingly married Lane. They think that the history of violence will not meet any country for the elderly. It's not as intense, bloody or bloody as the two, but it's almost as good. If you like the two, including David Croneberg's equally amazing Eastern Promises, you'll love Killshot as well. Director John Madden has not made many films. His last couple was pleasant, if not successful: Proof, Mandolin Captain Corelli and Shakespeare in love. Diana Lane did not have a powerful film role because she and Richard Gere gave unfaithful performances at Unfaithful. She has recently been charming and appealing in romantic stories such as Nights in Rodanthe, Must Love Dogs and Under the Tuscan Sun. Here she is right, balancing her sexy appeal with reserved tension. It's a small part for Rosario Dawson. But Dawson does a good job with it. You see a lot more Lane, including underwear scene rival Sigourney Weaver in Aliens and Nicole Kidman in the Wide Shut eyes. While you are in a criminal drama section, also pick up Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang, and Gone Baby Gone, and before the devil knows your dead. The last one has a wonderful performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and Albert Finney. Killshot arrived at the box office. More is our happiness. It's definitely worth renting a $ 3-4 dollar if you like this genre. 6/20/2009
