I say that I am a big fan of JJL and NIE one of Patrick. That's why I watched it to see her performance and of course it was great. I don't think the director was adequate for the film because some very bad decisions were made: the angles of shot, blocking, etc. If the director tried to give it a realistic feel, he failed and lost some good performances because of it. He almost always felt that the camera was too static, too far from intense reactions to the face - and so many times when the action depended on the leadership intimacy, the dialogue was slow and predatory. This could be easily resolved by shortening or changing the camera angle. But the impression I had was that the budget was too small and only one camera was used! I also had the impression that the scenes were shot several times and the energy coming from the actors was ... exhausted.
