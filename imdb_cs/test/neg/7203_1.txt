I rented this movie under the impression that it was "Scarecrow 3: Dark Harvest" because it was a continuation of the Scarecrow Slayer series (another immensely laughter and all the terrible series of movies). But I was not disappointed. It was just as bad, if not worse than what I expected. I laughed throughout the movie. Every bit of bad play, bad shot and clipped shots and horrible special effects is what this movie is worth to rent. Special features include a pathetic view of filming and a six-month shoot. br /> <br /> Favorite line, "The sins of my ancestors!
