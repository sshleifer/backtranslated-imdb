I don't understand why someone would waste time or money on utter garbage like this ... Don't get me wrong - I love good Western - Notice that I said "GOOD" - it's just waste <br /> <br /> Acting is terrible - Val Kilmer must know someone or owe a favor, or something for them, just to use his face and name in this ridiculous piece of crap ... <br /> <br /> Those of you who enjoyed this movie , I make a list of names to ensure that I don't follow anything you suggest - our taste is definitely different, yet it is your right to express your opinion no matter how far from the base it is. <br /> <br /> I gave this movie 2 just in case they blow up all of them and don't count .... Just bad in all areas is ...
