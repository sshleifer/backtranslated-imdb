Robert Altman's "Quintet" is a harsh, grim, hard-to-follow thriller where you finally give up after a while because it's so complicated. <br /> <br /> I remember seeing it at my local twin on the first full house weekend. By the time the picture was over, less than a quarter was full. I've never witnessed such a mass exodus without the need to drive people out. That should tell you how bad it is. I believe this is the worst movie ever behind and behind this camera.
