Steven Segal has made some scary movies, but this is probably one of the best because his career has been diving about ten years ago. The cast is better than usual, and while the storyline and storyline are quite a joke, at least most action scenes look pretty good. The storyline is probably one of the worst in film history. Someone is executed because he stole some money? Some kinds of mercenaries kidnap Supreme Court judges? Their aim is to exchange judges for prisoners to find out where he has money? Meanwhile, the Execution Chamber is full of scent doors and fake floors and looks like a set of one of Cirque Du Soleil's circus shows. Then there is the question of prison. Here, Warden's Homie, played Tony Plana. All prisoners have their gang colors and signs, and the guards are there to serve food and keep the prison clean. Nothing like a bunch of prisoners fighting and beating some guards while watching the guard. What happened? The Ranger gives them a strict conversation. He can punish them next time. <br /> <br /> There are plenty of moments in this movie that are good for laughter. However, Nia Peeples looks pretty good and Ja Rule tries to be an action hero. Lots of fun watches how all prisoners "do the right thing" and arm themselves to free the Supreme Court judge from their prisoners. Regardless of how bad Half Past Dead may be when you watch, keep in mind that this is the best movie that Steven Segal has played in 1992 as Under Siege.
