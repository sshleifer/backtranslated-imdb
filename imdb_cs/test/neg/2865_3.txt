I really enjoyed some of the films from Gérard Depardieu and I would expect that I would like this movie much more than I do. The biggest reason was that I didn't find the movie too interesting or funny - so I didn't care. Though she doesn't sleep with her stubborn daughter, the idea of ​​lying to telling her she's her much older lover is simply plain! Yes, I know there is no incest and I know that no one around them knows she is really her father, but I found that every boy who passes her as her sexual lover is too yucky and prevents him from the movie really funny. Besides, I didn't like this little dude too much. In addition to lies, she seemed to be very rude and self-confident. I'd rather have somehow get her "coming" and be somehow punished because I didn't like her.
