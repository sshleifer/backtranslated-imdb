Acting was horrible, cheesy, false effects of the CHEAP green screen were ridiculous and creatures were completely backward. The only good thing about this movie was the concept and laugh that I got from watching such a bad movie - then I was quite angry because I realized I was wasting $ 4 on it. Why would such a film be in theaters? I know this movie came out almost 5 years ago, but does anyone make any efforts to make films? I just write random things to fill the space - because I need ten lines of text to publish this review. This next line should do that. Annnndddddd there!
