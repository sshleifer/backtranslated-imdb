Since 2002, the Dutch cinema has finally improved again. This film is still a partial and textbook example of a bad period of Dutch cinema. <br /> <br /> The story is unnecessarily explained in the flashback style. All the "current" sequences that take place in France are totally useless and do not add anything to the story, emotions or power. European filmmakers often find it necessary to tell a story not chronologically. I've never understood why or what an appeal is. The story itself is not exactly the biggest. It is not always clear whether a film is trying to go and what it is trying to say. The story of a young inexperienced boy who falls in love with a wild young girl who later turns out to be quite psychotic can sound pretty good on paper and even show some parallels with Paul Verhoeven's "Turks of Fruit", to which this film was often compared before and in time of its release. However, the end result is far from comparable. The story cannot capture the right emotions, which is also due to the unimaginable performances of the actors. The way the story is told also makes the film far from uninteresting or persuasive. I lost interest in this movie for about 40 minutes in the movie. By the time this movie was made, both Antonie Kamerling and Angela Schijf had promised the rising stars, with great potential and ambition, but they almost now dried up both of their careers. Angela Schijf seems to give her family more attention than her career (this is not, of course, a bad thing), while Antonie Kamerling has tried to start a career in Hollywood. He never got anything but to play some little bits of pieces in 2 Renny Harlin's flops. To be honest, I'm not surprised. It's not that he is a bad actor and certainly has the right look, but his English is just not good enough to say it. Listen to him as he speaks English at the beginning of this film and you understand what I mean. They really aren't bad actors, but for some reason it doesn't show in this movie. This is probably also due to poor dialogue. I still like Beau van Erven Dorens. He was much criticized, but his actions seem natural. He always keeps the characters close to who he is. It is by no means one of the worst films ever made, but it's not one I would recommend. The bad and uninteresting story makes it a bad movie. <br/> <br/> 4/10
