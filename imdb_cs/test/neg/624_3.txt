I can't understand why many hate it. This film combines many overlapping settings of historical and biblical epics of the fifties, using pieces, props and costumes similar to those seen in other films. But the story tries to go through all human history, with a framework story of the human race in the process, with a guilty verdict, which means that h-bombs will go around the world. The prosecutor is a devil, playing Vincent Price with devilish joy. OK, so it's a bit of a hokey calling the defender of the "Spirit of All Men," but I think that's one of the things that gives this movie a sense of period charm. Spririt of Man is randomly played quite well by Ronald Coleman in his latest film. It is also the last film in which Groucho, Harpo, and Chico Marx all appear, but not together. Groucho plays Peiter Minuet buying Manhattan from the Indians, in a scene played purely for lobster humor. Chico is not at all funny as a monk who thinks the world is flat, and Harpo, as it is said, is supposed to be Isaac Newton, discovering gravity. However, most other performances are well done. Other hockey stuff is that the court is supposed to take place in outer space, which is shown as a cloud and bluish region. There is something called "The Great Clock of the Universe" that, when it hits midnight, can signal the end of the world. But in his heart, the film solves the problems with WMD and the eternal question of whether a person is basically good or basically bad; and it represents what I think is an interesting way. Also, one who likes the look of the fifties costume epics should like the look of this movie.
