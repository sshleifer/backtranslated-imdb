This movie should end as soon as the Bebe's Kids joke is mentioned in the introductory part. I like Robin Harris and most of his comedy, but really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could see. She liked one of Jerry Seinfeld's jokes and tried to push the joke as long as you could to make it a movie. This movie had to be self-serving because I can't find anyone who has found the settings or antics known. What is most funny about this film is the courage of writers and producers to pass it on as something of value. 1/10 stars because there is no half star.
