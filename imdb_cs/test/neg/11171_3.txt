It's really sad to see a once great director like Deodato, who's giall like this. This film was so terrible that he effectively ended his film career. The box is, this is not an "erotic thriller", hell during the 97 minutes of the movie, Charlotte Lewis barely shows us one nipple! I thought it would rise as soon as William Burger appeared (in one of his last roles), but his character was killed rather suddenly and deliciously. This movie will fail in almost any direction. Claudio Simonetti's music is a little more than noise, and the plot doesn't make any sense. For some reason, Lewis is terrorized by ghosts who attack by phone. (?) By the end, the characters all seem to have forgotten the previous 90 minutes of hell they have gone through, and laugh carelessly when the sick evil spirits of someone else, Lewis is an ex-boyfriend. What?!? This film has done little to me in anger. For real Deodato 80 entertainment, watch BARBARIANS or ATLANTIS INTERCEPTORS. Argento could do a better giallo than this!
