Problems: 1) Although they are billed as "loving Poverty Row tribute", many old records are not even from Poverty Row movies - most of them from RKO "The Most Dangerous Game," (1932), with some of the silent (!?) Versions "The Lost World" (1926)! 2) Much of the old footage is used only as a fill (old ship shots) or as silent shots (such as Bela walking, gaze or staring) often repeated; 3) Where the Poverty Row Master Thespians (Bela, Boris, Lon Chaney, Jr., George Zucco, John Carradine, Buster Crabbe, Tom Neal, etc.) are located, they emulate their lines as strike lines to 'new' characters jokes (as in Woody Allen's "What's Up Tiger Lily?" or Steve Martin's "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid")? Even Mike Nelson's weak commentary on the colored "Reefer Madness" is more fun than this. High Point: Long, but immensely instructive lecture by Gregory Mank that gives you new respect and admiration for Bela, John Carradin and George Zucco. It is worth the price of the DVD itself!
