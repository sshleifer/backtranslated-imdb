When you watch low budget horror movies like me, you get where you can tell who was involved in making the movie because every filmmaker adds his own taste to the cheese. That's what Jack-O does. When I watched this really horrible movie, I stayed with the undeniable feeling that Fred Olen Ray had joined him, maybe not as a director, but in some way, and as I researched, I found myself right. Only Fred and others were able to write something so poor, and this film just revived by Fred Olen Ray. If you don't like Fred Olen Ray (and God knows why anyone would), avoid this movie. If you are going to rent Olen Ray pic, rent the Chainsaw Hookers Hollywood, it is the only bright star in the dark space movie Olen Ray, which is terrible movies.
