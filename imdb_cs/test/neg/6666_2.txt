I bought a DVD of this movie because I am a fan of William Devane and I was really disappointed with "A Christmas Visitor". The story of the movie is so boring and slow in development that you just want to turn off your TV or DVD player after about half. Dialogs are really bad and belong to the daily soap opera, but not to the television movie. William Devane was fine in his part, and he was doing pretty well, but he did much better in other films and projects. Meredith Baxter was horrible and couldn't bring a warm, cordial mother to the audience. Instead, she played very cool and was no better than a middle class actress. I definitely can't recommend this movie. Save your time and your money for this.
