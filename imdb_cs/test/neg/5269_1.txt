"Common Decent Crime" is a species based on the exploits of Martin Cahill, already the subject of John Boorman's 1998 film "General". Cahill had a rough education in slums and graduated from petty crimes to honored robbery with honors. He justified his criminal career by pointing out his bad background at every opportunity. This is a common excuse for criminals who comfortably overlook thousands of slum residents who do not turn to stealing post offices and selling weapons to meet. Cahill did fools police and local authorities, not to mention the IRA, which earned him a sort of "folk hero" status as well as making him many enemies. However, he was basically an amoral, self-serving thief. My primary problem with "ODC" is that the protagonist is made to be a nice Irish rogue. Kevin Spacey is doing a good job as portrayed by Michael Lynch with a blend of greasy charm and silent threat, but the character is too amoral and selfish to be considered a hero, even a hero. The film is well shot and well-controlled by subtle cast, but what it allows is a script. Writer Gerard Stembridge can't figure it out; wrote the Irish "Lock Stock" or the harsh treatment of the thieving career of Martin Cahill? This is a problem when a writer bases his central character on a real person. It is also unfortunate that "ODC" followed the release of John Boorman's "General", a more accurate picture of Martin Cahill's story. Cahill was a crafty thief who knew about the value of good publicity, so it's no wonder his exploitation has cinematic treatment. What's surprising is that the studio was ready to take Cahill's story and give him a happy Hollywood ending. Charismatic-twinkly-bigam-thief Kevin Spacey Michael Lynch gets anonymous on his motorcycle in "ODC". In the real world, Martin Cahill was executed by the IRA only to prove that no one is making crazy out of an outdated, sectarian and corrupt para-military organization and leaving with it. The real Cahill would never leave his notoriety because he strengthened his own image of "human beings." Having Michael Lynch to give up everything to avoid death in "ODC" is a cop-out ending of a weak and shallow movie.
