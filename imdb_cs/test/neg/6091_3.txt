What the hell is that about? Kelly (jennifer) seems to abandon moral behavior as soon as she reaches the island. She finds this Juan P (Manuel) extant and exotic, though she testified when he slapped his ex in the face, which he also justifies later in the film, right or wrong? These two guys are the first to find on the island. Kellys are totally lost in every sense and the great Juan P can hunt and build a house. Mr. Maintenance. They seem to have a great time. Then Billy Zane (Jack's husband, Kellys characters) appears, and, of course, two days without knowing what his wife is doing with this wonderful Juan P is a little jealous. Billy Z is a stereotype rich guy and maybe not the most beautiful man in the world. He doesn't like Juan P (for hitting his girlfriend on the catwalk, who can blame him? The boy is also arrogant, but he has paid a lot of money to rent a boat and Juan P, who is a waiter / all he can't bring him a beer which might be on the spot Billy is probably the guy you want to meet in the face when you meet him, but at the same time he's not being blamed, the suspect in the diving glasses Manuel has Kelly and Billy just lost some expensive friends! For some strange reason, Kelly likes to hit this girl Manuel and hate Billy for being jealous, okay, Billy is exaggerated, that's for sure, but Kelly doesn't even do much to convince her. he slept because hes was so nice (and even though Manuel was shouting at her and calling her things to ask him some intimate questions. But Kelly is so forgiving ...) Yeah, right, and then he starts having sex st By Juan P. It should be said that Kelly and Billy seem to have a working relationship before this island incident, at least having intimate sex on the boat and talking like people when everyone likes them. other. Now you can think that this scenario is possible. But really? Are you cheating on your husband after two days on the coconut island just because he is jealous and acts like a drunk at the bar? (I wouldn't agree if the relationship was really bad, but the director doesn't like much if that's the case). For Lord Christ, Juan P did not appear as a good man. Catch some fish and build a wooden house to get into one's panties, is that good? She is by no means trying to make friends with Kelly's husband (which would be very simple by letting them alone at most island times, just being respectful). you want to have sex with Kelly. The Kellys character is not just credible (if she was imprisoned at Billy and other attractive girls, she wouldn't be upset or what?!). Or maybe he is? Billy Zane is not a very nice person, and Juan P is not really much better if you really think about it. And the poor Kelly is so confused and believes that sex with Juan P will solve everything because her husband is so strange and so aggressive towards poor Juan P? So ... for all of you who read it ... What do you think? If you are where Kelly is, you would be thinking of cheating on your husband when they knew that one day you would be back in real life, and suddenly Billys might not be such a terrible man. Hes just too jealous. And if you, where Billys character, what do you say, is completely wrong in his behavior? And Juan P, what do you really think of him. One thing is for sure. Manuelles exist! Ps ... Voodoo thing is so bad here! What the hell was that about?! Seriously! Somebody tell me?
