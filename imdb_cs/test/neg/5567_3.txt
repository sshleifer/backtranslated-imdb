In early 00, manufacturing companies had short-lived madness for paranormal genre films in France after "Crimson Rivers" and "Wolf Brother" turned out to be hits, so several films were green-lit or rescued from their "direct-to-video" fate . However, France, as opposed to the US, UK or Italy, has a small tradition of fantasy B-movies and it turned out quickly that "Samouraïs", "Bloody Mallory" or "Crimson Rivers" sequel was an unexcused attempt at re-creation. a kind of spell that never existed in French film in the first place. As they fell, the producers returned to their usual tariff: derivative slapstick or umpteenth self-referential tribute to the French New Wave by former critic from "Les Cahiers du cinéma". <br /> <br /> During this short window, "Brocéliande" could only glow green because it did not serve any other recognizable purpose. It's your by-the-book slasher movie mixed with a vague mythological element and references to horror and you will find bimboesque female characters, French universities look like an American campus and plot twists so lazy that you don't care because you guessed it an hour ago, before the movie starts. <br /> <br /> These elements make the 70's or 80's fun and you expect them in the 70's or 80's. However, we are not in the 80s and no one has warned director Doug Headline, because this tribute to the film genre slasher is nothing more than a derived film of slasher. The title itself is not a novice and since the early 1980s has written as a critic for this type of pictures, but as the first director shows a lack of skills and ambitions that make "Brocéliande" a hole. When you put together a cliché from a movie subcategory and pass it on to a skilled and resourceful director like Wes Craven or Quentin Tarantino, you get "Scream" or "Death Proof", movies that are imitations of old guilty pleasures, but also to enlarge these clichés and add a lot to them. This is called "talent" and therefore you cannot confuse these latest movies with their original inspirations that were made several decades ago. "Brocéliande" takes a lazy path and only reproduces the worst elements of past films (unfortunately most gratuitous nudity is missing for the male viewer. There are very strong similarities (probably unintentional) between the "Brocéliande" plot and the animated Halloween 3: The Witch Season "as they both deal with the supernatural Druidic evil rituals and some stupid attempt to take over the world on Halloween night. How even a" Halloween 3 "plot makes more sense than this, it means that something" bad "has happened to "Brocéliande".
