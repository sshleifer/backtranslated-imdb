OK, if you're a Mystery Science Theater 3000 fan and you love fake movies, then you'll have a lot of fun with that. Otherwise it can be really painful to see. Plot: Obsessed cryptozoologist creeps a huge crate containing Chupacabra on a cruise ship (apparently it doesn't have to be declared at the customs, or even mention it brings) aboard a live animal - "not really, it's a research facility, air holes are just an accident "). Some measures he hired to open them to find that he had paid a lot of money might steal something. Once WOOD SHORT is open, Chupacabra breaks STEEL BARS inside and continues to kill the rampage. Yeah, whatever. Marshall (I suppose it's American Marshall because he was in the Persian Gulf War, not just a kid named Marshall), he's on board, investigating some money missing from the ship. He acts as an insurance salesman ("Lady, I'm the best insurance you have ..."). Other scintillation characters include the captain (John Rhys-Davies, and unfortunately his dignity is the first victim of the film), his tae-bo instructor daughter (snicker - Tae-bo), annoying old blind lady with a small dog who should be fed a cat (guess , what does it ...?) and an incredibly unpleasant gigola that could be believed in a movie made in 1964, not in anything newer. Much of the acting was really bad and the characters were just so that you could laugh hysterically when they died. <br /> <br /> Overall - SCREAMINGLY bad. Bad at many levels. BAD BAD BAD. What??? Bullets don't even make Chupacabra click, but Tae-bo bimbo can hit him and scare him away ???? Hey Sci-Fi Channel, desperate for scripts or what?
