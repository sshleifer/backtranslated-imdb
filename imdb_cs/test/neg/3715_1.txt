'Til Tam was one of the worst movies we've ever seen. This will not succeed in every respect. Jeanne Tripplehorn was better (as an actress ...) at Waterworld. For comparison, this film is Dungworld. When a character encounters once or even twice during a movie, it can be understood. But Jeanne's character is dropping, trips, stumbling so often that she might have a little Jerry Lewis in it. In her defense, every fall (launder?) Was probably blocked, choreographed, and tested. And they rehearsed. Although this is bad enough for the movie, the actors (Dylan McDermott and Jeanne Tripplehorn) seem to spend most of the plot going "out for smoke" or trying to find a place to smoke. If the movie was a diatrib that you can't smoke - Ok - BUT, it's not. <br /> <br /> It is too long 10 minutes after running, whatever the movie is. Oh, Jeanne Tripplehorn, ALMOST performs in a public forum. SEE ALSO her broken life in the character. It's so convincing that her scene screams at Michael Douglas in Basic Instinct - hmm, the second thought, not really. It is a movie that you will avoid at all costs if you do not need a cigarette and are trapped in narcotic drug addicts who are anonymous or are forced to watch the HOOPER (Burt Reynolds). And then throw a coin or go to sleep.
