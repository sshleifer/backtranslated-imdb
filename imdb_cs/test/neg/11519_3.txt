As one of the founding fathers of my regions, the monkey film club (also including apes / chimpanzees and orangutans) reviewed this film from a monkey film perspective. In the end, it's a whole summer of monkeys, 100+ days for monkeys to do what they do best, cause misfortune, shenanigans, hyjinx, solve human problems and teach us about themselves. The story is simple. In a short poor boy needs money for the things he wants. Luckily, there are several chimpanzee monkeys who have a reward on their heads that could get Bob Fett or a dog (Duane Chapman) blood. When a boy tries to catch a monkey who learns about himself, his family, his grandfather, the local slave, he flirts with a girl who is twice as old and learns how the beast is bullying. There lies a lie. So much attention is given to the boy that chimpanzees just don't have the time on the screen they deserve. Chimpanzees are not as gifted as chimpanzees who play Jack from the M_P trilogy or legendary orangutans who play Dunstin or Clyde (1 or 2). So don't watch this movie waiting for the next big thing in the Chimp genre. The chimpanzees hit some sweet flip, which the film needed. There is an epic scene of chimpanzees breaking into a poor family house and destroying all the things that worked so hard. Serious lovers of monkey movies will want to rent the film only for this scene. So when closing this movie, it's not for a serious monkey movie enthusiast. I would not recommend this film to families because it supports the rising of children against their parents. I can only recommend this film as a rental for adult and monkey children who love monkeys.
