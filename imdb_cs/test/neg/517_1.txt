There is part of one sequence where some water rushes into a sunken plane, everything else that happens in this movie's footage for Airport 77. You can even discern Jack Lemmon and Christopher Lee in some shots. Full rip off? Almost by definition. There may be more footage in this movie than in Plan 9 from space. <br /> <br /> All new material, actors sitting on an airplane, speaks, is unreal and terrible at all levels. Dennis Weaver is totally unnecessary in a low-film career, though it is true for everyone else than Fred Olen Ray, who uses one of the many necessary fake names to work. <br /> <br /> the level of limited professionalism that makes this movie so wasted is really better if someone who has no technical knowledge shot him because Ray has enough knowledge of how to build a scene in The Worst Old School Television This film, like most of its films, is totally devoid of life. The worst kind of hack work. The worst kind of movie. Boring. This type of film is a waste of money, a matter where there are garrisons at all levels of ghosts who hope to get anything that pays off to them and that no one will see or know they have appeared . he participated in this rip. There are so many people who want to make movies is disgusting to see Ray burn money given to do nothing more than fill the time. His commentary track is interesting in that he has to start by explaining that he's really Fred Ray because he's not credited with the movie himself. That made me see that it won't let you fool you.
