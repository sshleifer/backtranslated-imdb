Like the previous two "Mad Max" films, "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome" is no exception to violence and strange conspiracy. Mad Max is in a post-war society where he has to destroy a blaster master and get the kids to "tomorrow morning." This is a generally distorted film with Peter Pan Links and Tina Turner, metane-pigs, and odd characters. I was very bored by watching everything, and nothing left me. After watching this movie, I didn't feel inspired; the only decent thing about this movie was an extremely strange character who caught herself in different directions during the film. It's too weird for me and it was too boring.
