I am astonished by the number of people who consider this movie decent ... much less great! Do most people even have the basic standards for the movie they're watching? I don't know anymore. <br /> <br /> This "commercial film product" does not deserve to be called a film. To call Dean Cain talented is a gross injustice for anyone who truly has talent. I had a lot of respect for Lori Petty, but most of it went down. At least her role was very small. Maybe she had an account that desperately needed to get paid. The ignorance I saw when viewing "Firetrap" was amazing. Let me start by taking it out of my chest: if you can't show the fire realistically then don't show at all. Good?!! It's embarrassing for everyone involved when you show the lame effects that don't even come close to simulating a real burning building. Some interesting things: 1. The manager opens the door to a large storage area and finds that the whole room has been swallowed by flames. What does? He tries to extinguish the fire with his broom! 2. The same janitor (who knows that the building is on fire) will later come to the door labeled "DANGEROUS MATERIALS". His brilliant mind tells him it would be great to open the door. Big mistake! 3. A woman gives a fantastically generous $ 100,000 donation to a greyhound rescue fund, but ... she has a charity event she holds! (Do people who care for animals would not like to frown on such things in any way?) 4. Some people in the film are forced into a vault of some kind with massive steel walls that even the electromagnetic pulses (!!) cannot penetrate. Yet they have a spacious vent that leads directly to the back of the thing that anyone could walk through. It certainly seems to be security. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on. Our "hero", who is supposed to be a fan, is a criminal who is soon trying to kill some of the policemen. What a fool! If the public wants to get rid of their thoughts on this drive, then they will have more power. I just wished I wiped it out of my mind. 1/10
