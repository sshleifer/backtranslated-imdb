How many monster tree movies can you see in a lifetime? Well I'll go out to the limbs and say one.This movie is better to watch late at night, with 12 packs of beer, sound off and you and your friends do On the Pacific Island, a young man is sentenced to death for marriage to "bad Americans". (It seems his loving wife is sleeping with a witch doctor, so doc 'can be a king.) Who promises to come back and take revenge. Before you can shake your wand, cracking natives run to the American scientists' shack, screaming "Tobanga to come!" The young corpse seems to have done just what Tobanga, a walking monster tree. Yes, his revenge is terrible (and so is this movie). It seems that these natives cannot run away from the lumberjack tree so they throw them in the sand, roll them up the hills, etc. Soon the new king wants to trade with his wife or kingdom for an ax or chainsaw. <br /> <br /> General issues with this movie are numerous. Comedy Relief is an annoying woman with Cockney's accent (as this movie needs a comedy). You want her to die of her first appearance. The leading lady is whiny.The leading man is boor.The acting is wooden (pun) Dialogue is tough and diligent. The natives have Brooklyn accents. Monster suit is pure giggling. <br /> <br /> Although it's a bad movie, it's still fun to watch. He gets 3 for unintentional laughing Your dog can only rate it a little higher, but only if the tree was not mobile.
