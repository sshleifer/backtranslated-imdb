Visitors is a hard, hard movie to get. It is so slow and I have been moving during the movie. It was about 11 hours on a hot, sunny day, maybe I would add, not midnight on a cold winter evening, so you have an idea of ​​how slow this movie is. The strange thing is it's not long. In just 100 minutes, it is only ten minutes longer than the average for the video, and it's only fifteen minutes longer than the best Darkwolf I've been watching for a while ago. It just pulls a lot, enough for you to lose interest. <br /> <br /> When it's not mistaken S-L-O-O-W development for the atmosphere, Visitors is good enough for the action to almost apologize for how slowly it is going. While flashbacks are both cheap and annoying as a way to round off Radha Mitchell's boats, women, aliens / anything that is actually pretty scary and effective, especially when her suicidal mother appears and starts moaning at night. Full marks for not making makeup in the store. A ship's only person is a spooky place, and occasionally the film uses the full power of placement and a deserted sea to scare the hell out of you. Yet it is hard for me to recommend Visitors. I came out not only feeling like I was watching a 4 hour movie, not 100 minutes, but also feeling like I was somehow cheated as well as offering many explanations as to hauntings (Mind Games? Real Ghosts? Space Aliens ?) Visitors do not choose one for certain. All that Radha Mitchell was watching was talking to her cat and Dominic Purcell that she had made no clear reason for any inexplicable frightening past, nothing? Tell me what you like about Shyamalan, but at least he'll tell you what happened, but crazy / stupid you might think. If you don't watch many of these movies, your new perspective is likely to improve things somewhat, but I've found it slow, boring and highly derived. If you want to frighten yourself, there's a much better place if you want a smarter thriller that's much smarter.
