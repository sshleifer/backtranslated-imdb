It is possible that the movie I saw was completely different from the movie that others saw, although the actors are the same, I can only think that the cut I saw in Europe was different from the one in the US. Anyway, it was the worst movie I've seen for the past five years. (Closely followed by The Waterboy ...) Why: Because in my opinion this director took elements from every thriller that preceded this, he mixed them up, put them in the wrong order with bad music and published it. <br /> <br /> (Examples: Nothing happens, music is frightening and nothing happens. "Grumpy" officer makes us annoying way to let an actor cast an acting class. Nothing, there is an unavoidable scene and all the problems are gone on the next scene.) <br /> <br /> If you want to see a smart movie: see Memento. If you want to see a better thriller, check out every thriller that comes to your mind. If you want to see Patrick Swayze: see Dirty Dancing.
