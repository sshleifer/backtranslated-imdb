... and the boy is a deafening collision. A lineman telephone woman is taken over by the spirit of a recently deceased ninja, undressing on her underwear, pours tomato juice on her body so that her boyfriend can lick her, perform a seductive dance, and then kill the police who killed the ninja she has. Just to be hunted by one of the ninja masters. Just like in real life, huh? Only revived by the choreography of Sho Kosugi's martial arts (and his declining crowd into this poisonous), you really have to see this to believe it. It is the ultimate mix of ordinary genres.
