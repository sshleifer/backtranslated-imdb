I saw this movie last night and after reading all the reviews I was expecting a good, emotional sports movie. What I got was something cliché and boring. Yes, I thought it was boring. I saw the star get hurt before the injury. I thought they might wait until they collapse until you know the game before "big" but I think the first game is pretty good. Parental relationships were also very cliché, dominated by a drunk father (but I would say McGraw impressed me) and a boy who wants to stay and help his (sick?) mother. I especially liked the random girls (Melissa and Maria) who had been in the movie for 5 minutes, and simply placed there to make the football guys jump. I thought "OK, now how does it work again on the plot?" Maybe I missed a point outside of "Well they play soccer in the city that loves so girls throw on their feet" point. The sporting event had some good points, but most of it was so hurrying! I think the first game took longer than assembling the entire play-off! And I wasn't so sure if the clock would stop turning in the final match. I think I saw this movie that won ESPY for the best sport movie if it was the only movie. Frankly, I found that it was a boring movie full of people who are indecently obsessed with pig skin. For a better football movie, see Remember Titans.
