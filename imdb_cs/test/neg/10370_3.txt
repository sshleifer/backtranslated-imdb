I'm a big fan of demonic puppets. Looking at this surface, it looks pretty good! You have Decapitron, puppets and a new villain in TOTEM! Unfortunately, the little punk that this project does, revives, does not live objects, cannot act. Smrd√≠! His girlfriend is worse. If they were left out, it would probably be fine, BLADE VS. TOTEM. I'd watch it for 2 hours. But instead, he plays the role of a puppet and the whole film suffered from it. The mystical skull that created the totem is at best vaulted and the appearance of Decapitrons is long awaited, short and truly disappointing. You should watch first.
