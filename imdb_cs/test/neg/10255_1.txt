I don't know why, why so many people love this movie: maybe it's funny, OK, but it totally destroyed one of the best novels he ever wrote. As the author himself said, this film betrayed the book: not only is the story shortened to about 1/3, but all symbols, all the complexity, everything is lost in a very 80-year-old fantasy / adventure film for children. Today we have effects, directors, new attention to books: I hope someone (Tim Burton, Peter Jackson, Hayao Miyazaki ...) will once manage the story of REAL Neverending. It deserves a great dead writer, a wonderful book and many literature lovers.
