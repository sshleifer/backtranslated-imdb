I saw only two reasons for this film. Above all, Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei were both good actors and I had nothing better to do. But while watching the movie, I immediately thought about something better: SLEEP! This film is a complete waste of time. It's a standard ex-cop. Ex-copper is the best, but it was thrown out. He does things on his own to dislike his former friends and saves the day. All big surprises (NOT !!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try it. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
