I don't know why they kept their name. How could they call the "Scarlet Pimpernel" series after deviating so much from the novels, I would have no idea. The names of the characters are the only thing they have kept, and even they have changed a few, and mixed them, and changed Percy's relationships with them. Sure, I only watched it for about two hours, but it was enough to realize that the show was nothing that Baroness Orzcy portrayed her characters, and she would probably be in the grave when it was filming and ventilation. Poor guy. I hope that when another person wants to make a movie / book series, he doesn't destroy it just like this series.
