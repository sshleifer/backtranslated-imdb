I saw this movie, but not in one session. What happens when he plays TV, I watch for a few minutes, find out that I took everything I can take and then I leave the room. I don't laugh once in those few minutes, I don't experience any pleasure in what I see, and I find myself more depressed to be upset. Interestingly, they tell me that psychological states are incompatible, that is, one cannot be both angry and depressed at the same time. This film tests this theory. I think part of the problem is that I spent almost ten years in Chicago, so when I watch the scenes, I think of my own experiences in this rotten city, so I decided to bring a lot of luggage to piece. It's quite possible, I'm willing to admit that if you're not a Chicago denizen, you'll find the piece fun. If so, I envy you. And yet. John Hughes set up his movies in Chicago and the movies worked for me. I think the difference is that Hughes was the first writer. I think it is obvious that he can comically equalize his situations, as well as his characters likeable and believable. In comedy (as distinguished from farce) this balance is vital. And it's not easy to achieve. If they were all, they would make great movies and we wouldn't have to worry about how we do it in the real world and think when the genius will ever appear. In "Adventure in Babysitting", it doesn't. I hated those characters. There is a difference, deep and real, between sympathetic and simply pathetic. <br /> <br /> For me, every scene in this movie is a clunker. There is no humor, no humanity, no one can recognize. Only actors who read their lines as if all they can do to resist screaming are, surely, finally the joy will follow, this time for sure! It's like watching the antiquity of very bad comedians. It is embarrassing and, after a while, usually when I get up and leave, I begin to feel compassion for all involved, a kind of emotional connection. Elizabeth Shue is terrible. It doesn't work, it's certainly not comical, and it's totally impossible that it can't. But, sir, as he tries. She looks older than 17 years old and works as a younger than seven-year-old tense school at school certainly sure it's the way one gets a prize. And she's not alone. It is as if everyone could not relax and tell the story. As if everyone just didn't know what they were doing. Now it was the first effort for Chris Columbus and he would clearly improve and have a better writer (eg John Hughes himself) certainly helped, so perhaps forgiveness is fine. But the film is just desperation. Still, I said that it can work for some. If any of the above challenges appeal to you and have made it clear to some of the reviewers, then take a DVD and knock. Otherwise, avoid this mess as if you had a dark aisle in Chicago where you can see only shadows and hear confused threats.
