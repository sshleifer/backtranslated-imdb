Predictable, bloody, exaggerated, average. Don't waste your time - there are many much better movies. Resurrection begins fine, but the chart repeats quickly. My interest rate steadily declined. By the end of the movie, I was just glad it finally ended. The characters never fully developed. Cinematography is muddy and rapid changes to POV rotation - although formidable in 1999 perhaps, now only serves to designate the film as attempting to replace gee whistling lightning for plot and substance character. Film tricks serve a purpose (mediate tension and anxiety), but they are constantly overused and eventually become counterproductive. Shame overall - the film / story, of course, had the potential, and of course the producers / directors and actors have technical skills. Disappointment.
