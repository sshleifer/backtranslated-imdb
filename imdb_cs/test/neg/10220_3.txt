There's almost a debut failure over GW, not because it's not without effort ... Actually, it's. It's all the more fun because he's a writer / director / technician Nick Gaglia has gone through the same rehabilitation cult he portrays in the movie. Sometimes for the first time a filmmaker, full of power that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students, goes headlong into a style that is too disjointed, uncertain, and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of a story, a very personal side, gets blurry for the purpose of telling a good story. Gaglia, who was 13 years old when she was put into a terrifying program that basically tortured and brainwashed her "patients" with crazy tactics of frightened groups, psychological sessions that could run for days, and attitudes from rehabilitation leaders who would do most of the Nazis cringe, fled finally when he was 15 years old. I'm glad he got out, though it could help if he went to real rehabilitation for his film skills now, if it was just a few days to learn something like, say, structure, proper lighting, moving liquid cameras, subtlety with actors and other foundations that are constantly lost. It is all the more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a topic that should be shown more publicly (recently Newsweek was referring to a similar AA cult-rehabilitation). Many times one wonders whether some personal character studies could work better than documentary films as opposed to narrative dramas. This is a pervasive feeling throughout the GW, where it almost feels like Gaglia wants to tell the truth, but does not know how to communicate it properly through her characters. The figure one would think is closest to him, the Bronx teenager, Teenager Serra (Gallagher), who is taken by his mother to rehabilitate in New Jersey, would be closest to Gaglia, being much more one-dimensional being where there is very little back -The story (we see a short freak-out, in black and white, in his old house) and a little connection with his mother (Moriarty), who has a greater potential that has never gone away from the cold stone that passes its children to another. But there's a story to go with his two-year crisis. Healthcare is more like a cross between management anger and some bizarre religious sect where Hiller (Insinnia) is a totally over-controlling loon. But soon, Tony's sister Sofia (Donohue) gets into the program and, unlike Tony's repeated moments of indignation and presumed non-compliance, she sets out on a broken three-step program and releases once. Sometimes there are pieces in this broken nightmare where there is one woman, a 22-year-old mother who is in the program for a year and a half when she finds herself a prisoner who is not allowed to leave and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an angry visit to Hiller when Sofia finally comes back to them, which contains some raw power, a very brief look at Gaglia, who is able to at least gain some leverage in pure melodrama. But these are little and far away moments. These are not just unsuccessful characters, which are usually limited to stereotypes that become hysterical D.A.R.E. rip-off (maybe some of them, such as angry black youth, passive aggressive counselors, or even Serra's older sister, who is siblings knocked out when they collide and almost throw into the program, would resonate more if there was more time dedicated to the development of any of them). That is, Gaglia is so restless in his multiple roles on his little $ 30,000 budget that neither side of any potential talent can pass. Excessively using shades, mostly with a shade that looks like urine-coated, he plays with a hand held by a DVX camera, as if it were intense ala City of God, sometimes a character just shoots in a frame, his choices music is like the worst choice possible from pseudo-indie soft-rockers, and there are even false hoax interviews with Nicholas Serra (inspiration?) and Krakowsky, who feel as fake as possible. Could Gaglia only get no conversations with the real victims he was with and resort to artistic artistic plan B? Bottom line, no matter how much from-the-heart true life stories can appeal to you, don't bother to watch it in the theater or even rent it if you love the last scene with two kids staring into the digital- hued Hudson River Sunset with Last Reading Reading: Dedicated to Children. Oy.
