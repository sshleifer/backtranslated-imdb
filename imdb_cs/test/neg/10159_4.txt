Well, now I know where all the boring TV shows come from. I believe they can be traced back to this movie. "Crime Scene" feels more like a TV episode, or a series episode. Complete with stock figures and situations - a hotshot cop who interferes with his superiors ... an aging cop who doesn't want to work on the desk, despite unsuccessful eyesight ... a ruthless newbie ... double cross, etc. <br /> <br /> I like many actors here, and they do a good job, but overall I found this film boring because I'm not a fan of the genre. When I discussed this case, I tweaked ... something about bookmakers and informants. And oh yeah, there was a stripper that Gloria DeHaven used to play before. What I want to know is: Why did Van Johnson call Uncle Wiggly? Wasn't Uncle Wiggly the Rabbit? Child Book Character? What the hell does that have to do with anything? I think I just don't get a rough guy Movie Noir-ish a bit of jargon. In fact, most of the dialogue made me murmur "nobody talks like that!" However, I could relate to one scene where the cop's wife (Arlene Dahl), who is afraid every time she goes to work, realizes she might not have made her husband the center of her life. Yeah, I know the feeling that I love someone so much that he's so dependent on them that there is a constant fear of their safety. So in this film there are moments of truth, under a stylized dialogue and an atmosphere that tries so confidently to be brave and REAL actually feels unreal to me. A little background: this movie was made when Dore Schary took over MGM from Louis B. Mayer, and began to end the healthy musicals that made MGM so big. Dore Schary was determined to bring more "realism" to the movies. I hate Dore Schary. Perhaps we could blame him for all the pretentious, bleak films that are being made today, who are ugly with the "ugly" truths of life and focus on (and in my opinion help) the worst of mankind than the best. We are no longer raising the way classic films have been designed - providing the necessary distraction during the Great Depression and World War II. Well, damn, we still need that kind of distraction today! There's still a lot of depression and a lot of war. And what are people turning to today when they want to escape? Trashy, the brain mortifying reality TV. Thanks a lot, Dore!
