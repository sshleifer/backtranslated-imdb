On many fronts, many ideas did not get into the story. That's a good action movie, but that's about it. - The film states that the Lycans were protected from vampires during the day. Yet they are kept in cages and have collars on their neck. So they cannot turn into their wolf form, nor do anything else another slave could do. How does it protect vampires during the day? Whom does he protect vampires from? Uncontrollable lycans? The slaves in human form are nothing more than peasants. My understanding is that vampires are immortal and old. Yet Sonya's age from child to adult. Will aging stop at a certain age? I understand that Viktor is old because he was turned (as explained in the second movie). But vampire kids age? Oddly. - I didn't realize vampires needed torches to see at night. But we see them carrying torches throughout the film. Wood steaks burned from huge crossbows also kill lycana. These are just some of the things that only show the lack of ideas that have come into the story.
