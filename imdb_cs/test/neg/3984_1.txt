'You're the Navy Now' is painfully bad: most likely the worst movie Gary Cooper ever made. It is allegedly based on a true story, but this film does not seem to inspire this film to keep the feature-length screenplay. I saw this movie on local television when I was home-sitting for my mother-in-law in Long Island, New York. There was a raging blizzard outside, and I was snowy. If I was able to get out of the door, I'd definitely stop watching this movie. There are some interesting names in supportive casts, especially Charles Bronson (under his original name), Lee Marvin, Harvey Lembeck, Jack Webb and Jack Warden. Forget it. Everyone smells in this movie. Even the usually reliable Millard Mitchell is terrible. Lee Marvin and Jack Warden are so brief on the screen, there's no point in looking at them. Gary Cooper plays a dark naval officer in charge of a ship that is powered by a new experimental steam turbine: basically the entire ship is a giant teakettle. Cooper realizes that the task is not prestigious: if it were, it would be a better officer. Cooper was a good actor in dramatic roles, but he had no comedy ability. He did some bad comedies and this is his worst. Jane Greer has always bored me and bored me more than usual. This ship went down with all hands and sank without a trace. Did I mention that this movie stinks? I will rate 'You are at Navy Now' one point out of 10. Toot! Toot!
