There's nothing wrong with showing an old man in love with a young girl. Lolita did it. The American beauty did it. But. They did it gently. From the beginning they did not make it so clear that the director prepares them to fall in love. Not as naturally as two people (not the bar age) would force them to be around, as if they were SUPPORTED to fall in love. Overall, chemistry should be. That would solve the biggest problem. People with reservations about this topic would also be interested and perhaps convinced. It would be a perfect love story, no matter how impractical. It was difficult for me to believe that Jia was occasionally. It's hard to see why Vijay - a photographer and a serious artist - should be interested in a girl so frivolous. If he himself has no hidden frivolity that has not come out at all. There are many uses of Dutch angles or angles in which the frame is tilted. It is generally used to show something unnatural or something that could lead to something that is not right. So RGV itself calls the relationship unnatural. Camera angles, background scores, editing and even composition of shots and symbolism emphasize and deepen their relationship. Is the Indian audience so stupid that we have to say something in 10 different ways to understand it? Especially when both of them danced together ... it was clear what was happening. What was the need to slow down the scene with dramatic background music? I feel that the topic was very well chosen. But Verma should not shoot the film knowing it is a controversial topic. If it is, then do it gently, why not?
