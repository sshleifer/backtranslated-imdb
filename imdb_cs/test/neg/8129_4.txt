Big (and we mean big big) baddie Sebastian Cabot is trying to get the ground out of the country to get to the oil rights. When Sterling Haden kills the ashes of the sea, how will Haden end TERROR IN A Texas TOWN, armed only with a harpoon? First it is not a B-western. There are no cowboys, no brave bits, no interesting action sequences. It's just an independent movie - you know, the ones that use unimportant actors to say "important things" and cover the general low budget of vapidity for interesting camera angles. Secondly, this film, in order to avoid compromises (one expects), which would cause the removal of important Trumbo statements about justice in America, and a somewhat sick relationship between a chief supporter and his girlfriend, is really a low budget . The main problem it causes is that acting is really, really bad. Sterling Haden is pretty decent in demanding roles, but it's the last one you want to play a sensitive Swedish sailor to find his wealth in the West. Sebastian Cabot tries to make Sydney Greenstreet as a (very) inflated plutocrat. It's not a bad idea, but Cabot doesn't have game chops for him. The one who plays a hired weapon with a missing arm and soul (Johnny Crale) has the best role in the film. She doesn't do anything about it. Third, the script is really not all. Trumbo gets some kicks about immigrants won't have a fair shake from the sheriff in a corrupt city, and people when against real oppression tend to fall down. This is a good news from 1958 - High Noon, Bad Day in Black Rock, Devil's Doorway - these are all Western people dealing with the evil eye of a Western eye to America in the 1950s. Trumbo, in '59, certainly had every personal reason to agree with these feelings, but he did nothing new or interesting with them. So, given all the negatives, why is this movie coming and 4? Mostly because there are interesting jokes in the movie. (The relationship between Crale and his girl is, fascinating.) And Trumbo, while the average writer in pursuing his political influences, is very good at creating interesting characters and intelligent interactions between them. Just when one is ready to go out of the boredom of Indy, there will be an exchange of dialogue or simplicity that one realizes that the one who wrote the script was not just a hack. <br /> <br /> If you don't have a Trumbo or a Western, give it to Miss. Otherwise, try. Maybe you'll like it more than I do.
