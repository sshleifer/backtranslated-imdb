Massive head injury seems to be a cure for the murderous tendencies that turn a deadly sociopath into a dog. The psychiatric hospital's front gate seems to be an overlooked place where potential friends meet. These are just two of the roughly 23 absurdities we are supposed to take to make this film meaningful. I love movies and I believed I suppose that many Americans do (forgive me when I'm wrong) that Hollywood has proven to be the best product. I came to learn how sadly naive and brainwashed I was and 2) how much more sophisticated the European / Asian cinema is compared to its American counterpart. I've been following this supposedly disturbing psychological "thriller" night after a Japanese movie show called Suicide Club. When the camera faded on the happy little family of Walter Sparrow, who enjoyed good time around the prison's guest table (not to mention the enthusiastic voice that pushed the "do the right thing"), I had a revelation. I just finished watching a movie that left me feeling like I had a glass of water when I wanted a beer. My thirst was saturated, but it was utterly utilitarian. The assumption was a slightly interesting, but the story itself with innumerable "coincidences." (How do we explain that she found the book? We'll just say something like, "... Or did the book find her? I'll buy it." take the skeleton with them?), predictability and a compulsory happy ending have proven to be another Hollywood work. In addition, casting Jim Carrey was just bad. At any moment, I felt he was able to break into one of his stupid comedies or In Living Color. Jim Carrey as a tattooed police detective who has slavery and rough sex? You didn't buy it for a second. <br /> <br /> Do you want to cancel? Deeply disturbing? Watch the suicide club. The story surrounds a mysterious mass suicide of 54 school girls. The film opens with a group of giggling high school students running on the subway platform. Then we look in horror as they compare, hold hands and happily throw themselves in front of a fast moving train. Needless to say, a lot of chaos follows. It is so far that I will go with the story because I encourage readers to see the film. In fact, I'm not sure if I could outline the plot, even if I wanted to. What starts as a straightforward secret quickly descends into the madness of grotesque images. Did I understand the movie? No? Ne initially ?? Like many foreign films my girlfriend introduced me. So naturally I thought it was "bad". But this was left in my mind. I went to bed thinking about the movie and woke up in the morning and looked at it on IMDb. I read some of the viewer's comments and I was amazed 1) the insights others got from the movie, and 2) the fact that I missed the whole movie so thoroughly. I realized I was so used to being a spoon-fed "news" from Hollywood that when I was confronted with a movie that really needed the viewer to really think about it, I was totally unbalanced. It's like I was conditioned to "check my brain at the door" of the theater. I say a suicide club is the biggest movie ever made? Of course not. It has shortcomings, many of which have been evaluated by IMDb evaluators. I say all American movies are bad and all foreign movies are good? Of course not. My point is that outside of Hollywood, the whole world of filmmaking is the work that attracts the viewer; forcing them to think and question films that do not follow twists, follow a strict linear sequence, and, above all, offend the intelligence of the person they are observing. I look forward to expanding my mind while exploring this new world of film that "don't say for me."
