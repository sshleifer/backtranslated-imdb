Herman has made the northern drama owned by Little Voice and Brassed Off, but the formula in this tightrope, the flat and fictional story of two teenage offenders trying to get tickets to Newcastle, is lost in this tightrope, flat and invented story. Truancy, underage smoking and drinking, underage sex, teenage abortion, school bullying, drug abuse, substance abuse, depression, child violence, child sexual abuse, theft, burglary, child theft violent attacks and armed robberies. None of these questions are examined, they only serve to shift the story from one unlikely situation to another. The film is not as acutely observed as Trainspotting, as crazy as the Full Monty, or as a reflection of the time as Wonderland (from which shamelessly steals music excessively manipulatively). I don't think any of the filmmakers are from Newcastle, and they have never experienced the social issues that film links refer to. I am all for fun and Herman's record shows that he is aware of the need to balance the social message with laughter and tears. Quite simply, he comes here incredibly briefly. The movie has a nice ending, but there are too many flat, banal moments to get there. Pretty shot, not very well done, and finally fails at three key points: script, script, script.
