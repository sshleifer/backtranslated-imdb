Stay alive, stay alive, stay alive, I think it was a trailer and not a cartel. The theme of the movie centered on the video I created by Countess to kill people and live forever is acceptable. First, that quite, bad movie of horror, blood sees more or less inflamed (crazy gossip), these scenes are bled out, they're more bad. But in fact (really) that bad is this movie, very, very, bad, but bad in all aspects. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this movie to anyone, trailer well, movie bad. I do not deal because (as well) they spend (consume) money and time makes these pointless films and too bad.
