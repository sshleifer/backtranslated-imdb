for everyone who read this book, Fanny Price matures into her own wife, a beautiful woman ... with her brain. Le Touzel seems to be on drugs. Terrible deal, just destroy it! Henry is a bit tall for his character. He's also too womanish. Mary Crawford is great. Edmond's a little old. Mrs. Norris is hysterical - OK, this casting decision works. Rushworth is also perfect. Yates too too effeminate. But Le Touzel is just terrible. This is not a good character for her. Poor Fanny! I would recommend this movie just because it contains an almost complete textual description of Austen's novel. The 1999 version is much more fun, but very incomplete. If they could redo this version with a more suitable actress for Fanny, it would be wonderful!
