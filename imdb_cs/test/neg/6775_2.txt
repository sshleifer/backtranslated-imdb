Let me say that this new He-Man caricature doesn't disturb childhood memories because I didn't like the old He-Man caricature either. I loved action characters, but I found the cartoon to be arched, and I hated the story (the He-Man I liked was one of the very early, pre-cartoon mini-comics contained in picture boxes where He -Man was a barbarian, the sword of power was split into two pieces and there was no Prince Adam, no Shazam-ripoff space, and no Orko). In any case, we will leave the old things alone. The new He-Man cartoon (or at least this pilot) is in itself a shame that represents both the worst cheesiness of the old show and the worst trend today. I watched it because I heard that your old face morale was (fortunately) gone, and it had more fencing and character development. But I came across a terrible mishmash of the worst clichés of this genre, a character I couldn't help but a hateful Matrix-esque visual style. I think it was a good idea to give a little background to the characters, as Skeletor showed in front of his face, but how far the character development goes, except for the usual garbage that comes in the following episodes. teenybopper Adam will learn the responsibilities of his newly acquired powers, blah blah. At least in the old show Adam wasn't a spoiled brat! I found out I hated his guts. This is what we get when they release an adventure show aimed at preschoolers: pretty faces and clothes that want to be cool and youthful. I should check for new episodes to see if N'Sync makes a special look. Man, this show reminds me of the Flash Gordon 1996 cartoon! <br /> <br /> Dialog? Ha! This follows absolutely every cliché in the book, from good lil-two-shoes Randor in the opening scene to Skeletor's immortal "Oh, and he-man ... I lied!" at the end. And Skeletor's voice is still as high as in the old series. 20 years and nothing we've learned. And certainly, there cannot be anything distantly related at the moment, which is not a Matrix style. Leave Anime to Japanese, people, think new ideas. And the vision of the characters in the fight did not help either. Of course we have the usual dose of PCness: Evil-Lyn (now I'm thinking who the hell is coming up with these names?) now has no yellow skin but gray. So no Asian people will be offended. I bet Jitsu won't show up in the show. The 1996 FGs, where Ming Merciless was green, a toad-like alien! People complain about Cringer's lack of speech. I don't think I liked it more or less if Cringer spoke that he was so careful. Plus, you have another dose of cheese with Orco! The shocking thing is, probably many people who (rightly) hated Jar Jar Binks, maybe they were huge Orco fans ... <br /> <br /> I was looking at a full-length pilot and had enough. Leave the show alone. 2 out of 10.
