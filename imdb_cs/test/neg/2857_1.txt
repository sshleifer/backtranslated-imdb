I've never seen a movie B like this ... on the side that nurse Sofia is killed ... the hand of a woman appears on a tape handling stick ... how bad is that ??? LOL, I really laughed and I wanted to stop seeing the movie, but I still watched it to see if this movie could get worse ... LOL ... that's bad for myself ... poor Pinocchio .. only nice the bit is the first time you see any special effects of Pinocchio's face moving ... except that the whole movie is awful ... it's not really your time if you don't really have much to do! But if you have nothing to do ... go on ... experience some movie "Z" cos B-movie is still too good for this ... LOL
