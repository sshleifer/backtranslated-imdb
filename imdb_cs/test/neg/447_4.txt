I cannot honestly believe that this is a continuation or sequel to the classic comedy horror film of John Landis of 1981. I assume that you cannot describe it as an original werewolf movie because the bare bones of the story steal elements from the one that takes place in London: the European capital, closely surviving a werewolf attack that kills a colleague, he releases (Pardon pun) on a sexual relationship with someone in the medical profession, he turns into a werewolf, he is visited by the apparitions of his dead victims, etc. etc. and reading the previous line I just found out how much the story has to do with the original that it seems to be very similar. The difference is how fun and fun Landis is <br /> <br /> There are no scenes that really stand out with this Paris-based movie. There is no naked man who wakes up in the zoo and wonders how to return home without money or clothes, there is no bizarre sequence of Naziwerewolves dreams and there is no magnificent peak. AAWIP is trying to be funny, but is there something awkward than humor failure? I mean the scene where Andy McDermott has to convince someone that he has gum in his pocket and not condoms! Perhaps the biggest difference between the two films is that there is no dignity associated with this dubious tracking. You really apologize for the fate and dilemma of the protagonist in the London film, here you feel that Andy is nothing but cypher, who goes through the literary movements of the script. There is also a large number of visible holes. Is this the first time the Lunar Club has done a massacre? If not, is there a large number of corpses with their hearts in the world press? Why didn't the police get in the lead? Everyone else mentioned it, so I - the visuals are bad. Look at the bungee jumping scene on The Eifell Tower, it's painfully obvious that it's accomplished through some blue projection on the screen, while the werewolf transformation is being done by some very cartoon CGI. I'm not going to put Anthony Waller in the same group as director Stephen Sommers, who will totally destroy the film due to excessive reliance on CGI (the main problem with AAWIP is the scenario associated with a high degree of expectations from those who saw 1981 movie classic), but I'd rather Rick Baker type special effects used for transformation. To be fair, it is reasonable to speculate that the budget has not spread so far. But at the end of the day it's a pretty bad horror movie that didn't have to be done, and DOG SOLDIERS is much better fun
