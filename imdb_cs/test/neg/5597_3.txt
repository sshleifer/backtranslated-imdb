After seeing the movie in my class and talking to the filmmaker, I found out exactly why the movie was bombarded the way it did. The filmmakers did not intend to call "8MM 2." Originally called "Velvet Side of Hell," it was changed to Sony Pictures on 8MM 2 at the last minute without the filmmakers being able to comment on the matter. By doing so, it was scraped out of the theatrical versions and condemned to release it directly with the video with minimal advertising. Again, it's from the mouth of a filmmaker, not my, so I really can't say what's true and what's hype. If you look at a movie like "Velvet Side of Hell," it's not bad. It's not great, but it's not divine fear. It would be basically just a B-movie that likes to show breasts. But as a sequel to "8MM," the movie fails terribly.
