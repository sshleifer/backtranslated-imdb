Lame. Lame. Lame. Ultralame. Should I move on? There is one, I repeat * one * funny scene in this whole, stretched, anti-entertaining amateur specialty hour: The Fares Fares Tariff Father, who knocked someone down with beer. And it is done. The rest of this shocking average pile of nothingness consists of the usual Swedish "actors" who look at boredom and bring a dialogue that goes into one ear and the other, a banal story, sloppy direction, and little to mention. Fares Fares, a non-plotist, is as charismatic as an authorized accountant and his nasal rivals, and Adrien Brody, in terms of total absurdity. Torkel Petersson should only work with Lasse Spang Olsen. The rest of the cast is, fortunately, easily forgotten, while Fares' humongous, titanic nose will forever haunt me in my dreams. Josef Fares helps to destroy the Swedish cinema. Don't support him and his nonsense. Jalla Jalla is for comedy what Arnold Schwarzenegger is for acting characters, Kopps would be much more polite if it was a non-budget Youtube video, and Zozo was simply the most challenging, pseudo-moving garbage ever launched by a Swedish director. Wake up and smell of roses: Swedish films can be much better than this, so stop pretending that Fares' worth watching simply because they are "good to be Swedish". Please.
