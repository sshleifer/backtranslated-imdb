Ok with this movie there are a number of ingredients at work: <br /> <br /> First, get a lot of trucks - good boys who have a secret desire to take the law into their own hands. Second place in the evil hills controlled by the Texas outlaw. The third in karate was a trucker played by Chuck Norris. The fourth put in a chump teenager like Norris's nephew captured by the evil hills of the villagers. Fifth Chuck Norris is fighting in slow motion. <br /> <br /> Now mix together and what do you have?
