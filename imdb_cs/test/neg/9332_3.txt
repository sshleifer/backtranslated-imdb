Mostly they do not know the biblical mumbo-jumbo that stretches for more than two hours. The only thing that will save this film from God's wreath (and there is only one God, remember) is an unintentionally witty dialogue and a good battle scene that comes too late in the movie. For most of the two hours until the action scenes are too much talk; The dialogue is so awkward that the film just begged MST3K to be spoofed. George Sanders is absolutely terrible; one of the most animated, too theatrical performances I've ever seen. Brynner is not much better; His stiff, wooden playing, combined with the horrific manifestations of happiness-cookie, is for a somewhat boring and stupid Solomon. It seems that every time Brynner opens his mouth something oh-so wise and ridiculously tall and powerful comes out. To some extent, it is not Sanders and Brynner's fault, because of the miserable, comical dialogue and the typically biblical one-dimensional characterization. Brynner's accent even reminds of a piece of Schwarzenegger; it's not a plus. Only Lollobrigida can avoid embarrassment by playing a role with greater conviction and in an appropriate way that fits the role in such a silly movie. Describing these biblical figures as one-dimensional would also give them undeserved credit; characterization is half-dimensional.
