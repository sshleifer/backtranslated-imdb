I wish I could find some good things about this animated sequel (but not really the sequel) "Atlantis: The Lost Empire", but this would be a very short commentary. the animation is pretty poor everywhere, the characters themselves are not very well drawn.the background and foreground are also not good.there is very little attention to detail here.and instead of a compelling and engaging story, we have 3 short stories that are boring and don't do a lot sense.i swear, even the characters sounded bored, and it would be somewhere else, which says that the voice actors were bored and wanted to be somewhere else, at least it's the impression.some of the same actors to come back for that Desperate effort, but integral to the success of the first one was Michael J. Fox as the main hero, Milo Thatch.i get a distinct impression this film was just thrown together to reap the success of the first So many thoughts or care.but at least Cree Summer returns as a voice " Kida ‚Äù. It is probably the only good thing about this movie, and even she does not seem to have her heart completely in it. you couldn't blame any of the cast for not giving everything yours, considering what they had to work with. or rather working with. thats right video video (and i use the term freely) that should go straight to the nearest landfill .anyway, the disgrace of Disney.consumers deserves much better than this.this gets 0/10 and well deserved one on that.pu
