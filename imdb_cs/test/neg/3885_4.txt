Well, you have: Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (The backbone of England.) She is killed in the first scene - that's true, people; this show has no backbone! Peter O'Toole as Ol 'Colonel Cricket of the First War and now emblazered by Lord of the Manor. Joanna Lumley as Lady Manor, 20 years younger than Colonel and 20 years for her prime but charming (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy on the boy's side. It's okay, they have full knowledge and agreement with Cole Cricket (they even come for a bike for Christmas!) Yet he is considerate to the colonel enough to say that her boyfriend said it's her own age (that's a girl!) David McCallum as a toy-boy, as well as absurdly charming as his squeeze. Pilcher couldn't come up with some cover for him in the story, so she gave him a quiet job in the circus. Susan Hampshire and Miss Polonia Teacups, Reverend Director of the Reverend School of Girls, in her office serving a dash of deep, dignified advice about living in the outside world before graduation. Her best advice: "I was once in Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England). I thought it was very beautiful, but somehow it wasn't part of the real world." Well, we can't say they didn't warn us. Ah, Susan - Time was, your character would run the show. They don't write it like that anymore. Our loss, not yours. So - with the casting and setting this way you're right "Brideshead Revisited", right? <br /> <br /> Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional support roles because they paid so well. After all, this is one of the oldest temp-jobs where it is (You're different!) <br /> <br /> The first warning sign: lots of backlighting. They're out there outside - "hey, it's just sunlight!" <br /> <br /> Second warning sign: The front lady is crying a lot. When she doesn't cry, her eyes are wet. This is the law of Romanesque novels: The front lady is "dewy-eyed." Henceforth, the main lady will be known as LL <br /> <br /> The third warning sign: LL actually has stars in her eyes when she is in love. Yet I will give Emily Mortimer a prize only for having to deal with this point of attention in her eyes (I wonder if they used contacts?) <br /> <br /> Finally, the fourth warning sign: not the screen character is on the screen "Mrs." It's either "Miss" or "Lady". When everything was said and done, I still couldn't tell you who and who was watching. I couldn't even tell you what was said and done. To sum up: they all live during World War II without anything happening to them. OK, at the end of the LL he finds out that she lost her parents to Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (there is always "meanwhile") some young guy LL has crushed (when, I don't know) comes home from some heavy war place and is on the street where Lady of Manor lives (there must be a Street if SHE finds him there. ) Both victims of war are taken away to recover in Nancherrow (SOMEBODY must be "torn off" SOMEONE in these romance stories!) <br /> <br /> Great Drama.
