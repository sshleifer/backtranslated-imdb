With a plethora of repetitive and derivative fall comedy situations, summer, winter, and spring line-ups, it's nice to see a show that takes place in more than one area on its own. <br /> <br /> 'Earl' has an unusual approach. It's not about "zzzz .." daytime thinking about the eccentric family, nor about the other boring things you see everywhere in sitcoms. The show is about this little white robber thief (Earl), who grabs a lottery card and scored a great time. At that moment Karma took him away. Overtime, he learns that the unusual incident was probably due to all the bad things he did, so he sets out on a mission to correct every mistake he ever made, and he has all his deeds on paper. <br /> <br /> This is a great prerequisite for a sitcom. Fortunately, he landed in his right hands. The show's performance brings very satisfactory results: you get an innovative comedy that is really fun and touches many times. You can't help but fall in love with Earl's sincerity and perseverance, Randy's simple mind, good heart, and the observation of life, Joy's wild personality, wonderful personality, and Darnell's mood, the chillin 'demeanor that easily endures him. > <br /> When you combine the show's innovation with original humor, good heart, interesting characters and well-written dialogue, you really have a breeder. With such demonstrations (and the incomparable "Office"), NBC is obviously something. Eventually they liberated the cubby or two to ensure quality? Hopefully. And hopefully, we will enjoy better shows like those that will be in the lineup; shows that both TV viewers and NBC leaders will stop crying after the long days of NBC's golden days (Frasier, Seinfeld, Friends)
