The Garbage Hunter, who could only do Full Moon studios, could have a group of college kids staying free in the old hospital without knowing that a demonic two-faced creature (barely visible throughout the film due to incomprehensible lighting) passes through the walls of killing everyone member who has a sheet of paper with old tags. Some of them (it won't be too hard to prove, but a slight twist is so uninspired to be revealed and limited to make you mock) is the master for which the beast kills and must be revealed before he kills everyone. /> <br /> Cheap, badly acted misfortune has "That's it?!" the kind of weak end that will irritate you why you have been wasting your time. Tanya Dempsey, who was unable to act her way through a wet paper bag, has the duties of a heroine as the newest member of the college student team named Clark. Oh, and the name refers to the sound the animal does before the attack, it's another victim.
