The Canterville Ghost (1996). Maybe it's a generation, but I really liked the version of Charles Laughton. There is a time and place for "emoting" and this production doesn't translate very well. Patrick Stewart, reciting Shakespeare, was very good, but still unsuitable. It is not recommended or observed. Close-up and padded text and partial lands have been lost to me. Adding strange materials and scenes takes a really great job. The scenario should find another profession in which it could abuse its talent, maybe it would be a better afternoon. Look for a really good version and pass this.
