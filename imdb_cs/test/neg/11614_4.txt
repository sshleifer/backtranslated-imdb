After an interesting start, this little drama quickly gets into the line of absolute mediocrity. Two women see the beginning of the film (Heather Graham and Natasha Gregson Wagner) meet while waiting for their friends to get home from vacation. Natasha Gregson Wagner is a beautiful actress and plays Louise; cute girl whose dear friend is a versatile entertainer; Music, movies you name, does it. While she tells the other girl, Carl (Heather Graham), about her amazing friend, it soon turns out that the similarities between the two friends are too much .... and it's obvious that both girls go to the same guy. Dear Sirs. Enter Robert Downey Jnr, a sleaze-bag who has two girlfriends while some poor ones have to go without one. Downey plays a guy like women, but men are unpleasantly uncomfortable; it's basically a mom's boy. Also the worst kind; on the phone ringing mother all the time, constantly showering her girlfriend with ambitious (though empty) promises etc. It's enough to make a normal guy sick. The film knowingly tears off the excellent three-way love triangle movies like Jules et Jim. However, this film does not work; mainly because it's a story so incredible. Seriously, if two women just found out they were dating the same guy, they shouldn't talk about it. Another reason it falls is that it's just a turgid. There is no end to the possibility of this film presenting a situation, especially with claustrophobia, how to build it all in a small apartment; but the whole film is lost in the masses of dialogue; poorly written and poorly conducted dialogue, that is. The film is also massively reworked; It just is not believable that people would behave as if they were in this movie after finding it in this situation. Robert Downey Jnr is one of the many things that are wasted in the movie. With Natural Born Killers, he proved that he could give a brilliantly entertaining performance, and that's something this movie could do. These two females are not unnecessary because nobody expected anything from them, but Downey could certainly be better used. Overall? Waste of time. Don't bother, see Jules et Jim or Natural Born Killers instead. That's my advice.
