C'était addition minable: à fuir absolument! This was an idiotic attempt to destroy the classic source material and succeeded! You do not see this film under any circumstances if you do not want your ten euros to be torn apart and push the nostrils of a bunch of vapid, cruelly onamusing characters. This type of film clearly illustrates the abyss, which unfortunately still divides directors and viewers. If an individual (heaven forbidding a collective who could imagine this slag) to do so was considerate enough to follow the version currently being played in French cinemas, it would endure what I was forced to endure, and graciously rewritten or simply scrapped completely. The genre of adult humor that has been mined here, in my opinion, goes back to Fritz's cat, but lacks the avant-garde status of this film or even its basic social commentary. With a lot of divisions and growing dependence on existing source material to tell story stories these days, one could hope that Snow White, and so do not worry about the concept of characters or the radically new story , would allow more time, no, I don't know, interesting animation, smarter jokes, maybe a coherent movie that has something to say and doesn't notice its emptiness from the opening frame? <br /> <br /> Significantly scary production.
