I have to talk about it by saying that I love watching bad movies that are fun. This film brings 100%. This is hands down the worst movie I've ever seen. It is full of miserable footage of random things in the city (people who travel, traffic, skyline, etc.) that do not relate to anything. Then there are too long "sex scenes". It is a lot of cuddling and frequent rubbing of socks on the body. These are by no means erotic and are closest to the horror movie found in this movie. This is especially true of the shower scene, where two of the so-called "barely legal" girls, who could not be more than 40 years old, are sprayed with blood, but there is also a crew member who sprays blood from the outside while one of them is in it's one of them. the girls are still smiling at him. No one has to remember any lines for this film, unless there are clearly reading cards, then they have a magazine they are looking at while they are fighting for a clumsy dialogue. Then there's Mr. Creepo. It throws Ed Wood's name the way he can compare it, but it is far from everything that is of that quality. He walks past a graveyard that shouts about the random things that didn't happen in the movie, which really helps to completely defeat the film that was already in motion. During this film, we couldn't stop laughing (except for the sex scenes where we were frightened and sometimes horrified). I gave this movie 1/10 for going beyond my expectations for a horrible movie.
