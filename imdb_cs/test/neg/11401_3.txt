This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Negotiations were just soooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a pretty good actor, but in this movie he sounded like reading his paper. Especially his voice was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was absolutely at the top of the frat boy Fraser, though this probably had more in common with the miserable dialogue. "Ik ook van jou" is an adaptation of the book and it seems that filmmakers have forgotten that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue. It all sounded a way to book. Some situations have been poorly visualized. Example: somewhere at the beginning of a movie there is a scene where a canoe travels at a fast pace. This piece is just too incredible to be true. You see a somewhat shallow river bank, with lots of rocks just below the surface (ie, fast). We hear some exciting music that warns us of danger. A canoe with girls goes in this somewhat shallow fast. Our hero then submerges a few meters below the surface to save one of the girls. The girl waved in her arms and said, "You saved me ..." Vomit! In fact, it was so bad that it became funny. This is sad because it wasn't really intended. During the break I heard someone say to me: "God, there's another part!" Exactly my feelings. What scares me is that the 'Ik ook van jou' final credits were in English. Does it mean he will be released abroad? Just as the Netherlands began to have a good reputation for movies like 'Antonia' (line Antonia) and 'Karakter' (Character) ...
