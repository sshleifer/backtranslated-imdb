If you're going to this movie to learn about depression, forget it: you won't learn anything except to write a script on the subject. I understand that the intention was to show how severe depression can turn an average person into a complete wreck, but the result is the most one-dimensional character I've ever seen in a Hollywood function ... no little performance. Christina Ricci, as Elizabeth spends all this movie, screams at the top of her lungs, cruelly insults someone, bursts into tears or some combination of these three (the only exceptions are some silent annoyances at the beginning and end). There is no sign of what could be like without depression ... not the weakest glimpse of any other aspect of her personality ... she just screams. At one point, her roommate says to her, "Lizzie, you're such a funny person that you're around when you're not depressed," and my reaction was, "Is she?" It seemed strange that writers would include this note without giving us some examples, but this scenario is a lesson of inability. It has no recognizable structure or flow; instead, it consists of a series of unpleasantly strung Lizzie scenes screaming, then ends. Character Development? No ... Scenes of her everyday existence, ie Go to classes that could be important details? No ... Shouting at maximum volume? CONTROL. I'm afraid it's not enough. 1/10.
