I know that many people have automatically given this movie a rating of 1 because it doesn't have a huge budget and special effects they're used to. But I knew what I got when I pulled it into the VCR. I don't think we have a much lower budget than a family meeting. Lighting is terrible, sound quality is sometimes incomprehensible and almost everyone involved is very bad. But this is still a fun movie and the storyline is quite interesting. It centers around a fellow named Tom Russo (Asbest Felted), who was down on his luck with his work. She is very protective of her wife and will not allow her to work, which puts pressure on herself. When he starts working more hours, we see him slowly turning into madness and obsession, and he becomes suspicious that his wife is cheating on him and is starting to brutally kill various men (mostly repairmen) for whom he is responsible. I must say that the gore effects are extremely cheap, but they fit into the overall tone of the movie. insane that he became. Film stimulation is also very good and rarely a boring moment. The end does not really follow the rest of the movie plot, as it seems to want to go from the psycho-slasher movie, to "Dawn of the Dead" wannabes, but it's fun however and I have to give Tim Ritter credit for wanting to use the unconventional ending. I can honestly say I enjoyed this movie, but it's by no means a good movie if it makes sense. It's budget is its main obstacle and the consequences are almost too overlooked. I do not recommend it to people who are totally spoiled by big-budget movies and who cannot have an open mind to ultra-low budget movies. You just won't like it. For others and gore fans - I say I'll do it. You will find at least something redeemed in it! <br /> <br /> My class: D
