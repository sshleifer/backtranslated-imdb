You know, I really have a problem with movie lists. Some time ago I read the Maxim magazine and had a list of the 50 biggest B-movies of all time and when they knew me, of course I have to go through and watch them all and write reviews of all of them. That's why on my list you can see reviews of movies like Gator Bait and Barb Wire and Coffy. So I noticed H.O.T.S. on the video store the next day and recognized it from Maxim's list of the 50 biggest B-movies, and I decided to rent and check it. My only consolation is that I rented it because I recognized it from the B-movie list so I knew it would suck. <br /> <br /> Given the type of film that is, I can't say that H.O.T.S. is a total failure because it is nothing more than the late 1970s T&A film, and it never pretends anything else. The only place where it extends widely from its goal is a torn subplot that includes several former consumers who have stolen a lot of stolen money in the house that H.O.T.S. Move to because this subplot has absolutely no place in the movie. Despite the fact that the rest of the film is also, this subplot is totally unnecessary and unnecessary. The story is based on a pair of opposing clubs on the beloved FU, which exists as one of those universities that contain a large sum of one union until the refusal is formed so that they can return. snobs in the other. This new association, Help Out The Seals (HOTS), is an association that is allegedly based on ancillary seals (the subplot seal is another that does not belong in the film and little attention is paid to the meaning of this name, which is out of the box all over the place) This is going to sound strange, but in fact, I really caught up with one scene in this movie, I'd say one SHOT I was impressed with, probably in the middle of the movie, one of the girls at Pi, a rival club, he pours alcohol into a punch and pours something for himself in the glass and drinks it, surprisingly what he does when he drinks alcohol reminds me of what Charlie Chaplin would do, which really made the movie brighter. Of course, this movie will not come close to anything Chaplin has ever done, but the shot itself raised my movie score from 2 to 4. But as a whole, the film is exactly what you would expect it to be, lots of people running looking for excuses, and they would take off their clothes (I liked how one of the clothes at the end of the game was removed at the end of the football game). one of GIRLS 'ideas. Riiiiiiiiight ??), and not much thought he is into many of anything else. There is, for example, a scene early in the movie when a couple of Pi girls pour hot sauce into snacks at H.O.T.S. The party, accidentally caught in the incriminating photo (the girl with the picture did not realize that she photographed them at the time), although the photo never comes for some reason later in the movie. I've seen movies like this, it's like Gator Bait, but without violence and rednecks and Coffy wasn't far away. Even Barb Wire is much the same, with only a larger budget and more silicon. Fortunately, Maxim's 50 B-movie list contains just a few other comedies because while these cheesy teen T&A movies are fun once in a while as bad movies with an occasional semi-nude scene, following H.O.T.S. I think I decided I like bad horror movies better than bad comedies. I'd rather watch a lot of terrible actors pretending to be afraid than being entertaining.
