Oh, Mr. Carell! How far you fell! After a shining moment in LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE, Steve Carell's selection of films begins to contrast sharply with what has come since then. Although the 40-year-old VIRGIN was entertaining, he was the dwarf of his "Sunshine" character. I was hoping to find something that would make me spout popcorn, so I decided to rent EVAN ALMIGHTY and find out what possible cases were waiting for me. Not much ... <br /> <br /> Due to the brisk and clich√© scenario, the whole film felt forced and unemployed. Evan Almighty is also trying to joke family tagging fun and the US government's current attitude to the environment. He is also trying to make a profound biblical moment imprint on humorous expressions but fail. Almost every person on Earth knows the Story of Noah and the Ark, God's wrath has been sent with 30 days and nights of rain that have flooded the entire planet while Noah, his family, and two of His creatures on The earth set off from the wet in relative comfort over a wooden gopher chest. It was a huge moment in human history (if you believe in biblical text). So why would God appear to one man and ask him to build an ark that could only bear animals in the world minutes after the dam's break? The simple answer is that he would never do it. Too much emphasis has been placed on US government policy and not on world affairs, which has made Evan Almighty a terribly short-sighted and American-centric film. Although it is designed as a comedy, it never really gets to the approaching laughter of the belly. Maybe a couple of grunts and a smile, but little else. John Goodman (CARS) pulls in another forced performance as the despicable Congressman Chuck Long, who is the only goal of creating opportunities for development on a protected national land economy. Even the strong presence of Morgan Freeman (10 LESS ITEMS), because God cannot help eradicate this wet wet film disaster. The only funny moments are between Carella and the animals, especially since Evan learns what animal magnetism is. The birds literally flocked to him. Flock of sheep around him. Lions are proud to be close to him (please forgive the puns). <br /> <br /> Special effects were fun to watch but were short (with good reason). The "flood" was interesting because the ark was clearly led by His hand and pushed in the right direction. But apart from being a little more than an insult to common sense and intellect.
