God, I hated the movie! I saw it in a tricky preview 13 years ago and I still have bad flashbacks. It was undoubtedly the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was badly written, badly directed, and (surprisingly, the cast) was wrong. I'd rather be thrown from the roof to sharp sharp razors, and then my skin was peeled off before I put it down again. Can you guess I didn't like it?
