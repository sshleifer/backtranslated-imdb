Well, people, this is another stereotypical display of Gay life, another disadvantage includes bad gameplay, terrible scenario, no budget, terrible sounds and let's not forget the impossible story. They are Christmas in New York City and our story is "focused" on two male individuals, apparently a lover for some time. One of them did not allow his parents (right wing, religious types of fanatics) to know that he was a homosexual (adding that this story is unusual, because this guy is like homosexuals these days) and his parents come to smell him. They stay in their apartment in New York, where he and his lover have just decorated for Christmas. The story is still evolving around the arrival of parents, who, like no one, will like it. and predictable ways - they come to learn that the son is gay. Tears shed as I was interested in this film. The cast of the charters looked like an intro of acting at the local community theater. Lovers in this film are disagreeing, and it does not seem to have any coherence with their union. The landlord is flat and her attempt to be humanistic in the situation is unfinished and certainly has not helped to move the plot further. An attracted friend who, in his "time of need" approaching one of the lovers, is stereotyped and gives a bad name to the unique art of dragging. Although some night boys find one of the lovers having a nice body (again stereotyped images) this does not help this story. Stay away from this movie, especially if you're considering buying. You shoot yourself if you do it!
