Being a huge fan of horror movies, one of the most difficult things to consider in the lack of rich films in the genre, and when I have seen hundreds of people in my life, I have to say that Dracula 3000 is by far the unrecognized, lame and poorly made piece of waste that I had to see misfortune. STAY FROM THIS FILM! It's so bad that it's not even ridiculous. Special Effects (I said "special"?) They were probably achieved by spending a few grandes, the acting was terrible and the screenplay was supposed to end up in the basket after first reading the studio, which decided to take on this miserable project. The whole movie was shot in the warehouse. Also, for you who like nudity in their movies, don't be fooled by the R rating. If you think you have a chance to see Eric Eleniak still half naked, you're wrong. She is fully dressed throughout the film. And the cover is completely misleading! There is no scene in any part of the film that even marginally reminds the amazing envelope art they put on the box to draw unsuspecting horror fans. Pity that the rating is only 1 to 10. This movie -10. Be warned. Don't waste your money or your time on this.
