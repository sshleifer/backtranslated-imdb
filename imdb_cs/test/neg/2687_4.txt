I'm a newcomer to Argento's work, and if this and Suspiria are some hint, then Argento is much more a filmmaker than a story. In their films, characters are placed in grueling and fascinating horror contexts that literally saturate the logic of the world around them. The camera literally flows gracefully through the sets as the characters run, stumble, and choke the way to a potentially frightening conclusion. It worked, really well, in Suspiria. For some reason, it didn't work here. The problem I see with this movie is that while the protagonist "gets help" by contacting the police and asking for help from his friends, he still feels as if she refuses to "get help" if the point is, he's trying to find a solution to his problem. Capturing in this movie is that it is trapped in a small game of a killer that could easily get out ... without being so easily built? Strangely, it seems that the character wants the torture that the killer gives her, which is a thing and it could work, except that all psychology is thrown mostly because of what Argento does. > <br /> As a loving homage to "The Phantom of the Opera", it's definitely an interesting and unique sight. Argento looks forward to the operative moves that fit well into action. It just doesn't make much sense, especially when it delves into a completely unnecessary end (yes, I know it's a reference to Harris's novel "The Red Dragon". No, it didn't work). Why should a character go from one scary experience of being captured to a willing one with the director behind me. It was almost an end in itself to the Argento section. Overall, the fun experience and between it and Suspiria I am more than willing to follow up on other Argento productions. But this is not a movie I want to go back to or remember. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
