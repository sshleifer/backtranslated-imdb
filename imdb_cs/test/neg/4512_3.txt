I saw and have the original 1959 black and white that stars Shelley Winters and Millie Perkins and no matter how many times I look at it, I can't help but cry. <br /> <br /> This version (of course) was a file, just like in 1959, but there were many layout errors. Spiral staircase? Items that did not exist at that time existed in the movie. Doris Roberts, sad that she can't play drama, he's a comedic actress and that won't change. James Coco was terrible Mr. Van Daan and Mr. Dussel resembled my professor rather than the dentist he was supposed to play. In the original movie, Anne went "gloves" to go to Peter's room, which seemed to take her more than a minute. It took her less than 10 seconds in this crappy remake. The first reviewer was right ... This remake is just a remake. What director he was thinking about how he took a comedy actor in such a dramatic role. I'm sorry, but James Coco can't play drama. Max .. Schell was better in Deep Impact then this movie. The harsh Mrs. Frank was just so insolent that I couldn't stand it. With reference to and comparison with the 1959 version, I like it better, doing a better job of being a stunning mother. Of the 10 stars I give this remake 3. Don't waste your time, get the 1959 version and the Kleenex box.
