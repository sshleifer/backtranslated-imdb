It seems that Dee Snyder will run out of ideas in the middle of the script. The second half of the movie is basically just rehash first, making the movie very boring. To sum up: Cop's daughter is sucked into a party through a chat room where she is sexually harassed / tortured by a psychopath (played by Snider). The cop saves her, the psychopath is put into therapy / prison. Psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played by AGAIN. Within all this, there are many inexplicable elements of the plot: Why was "Captain Howdy" psycho first? What is a one-off personality turning into a biblical thumper? How does he bear all the adults and manage to clamp their mouths without a fight? And perhaps the biggest unsolved secret of all ... how the 6'2 "man with pink hair hides in the 5'6" average builder? These are just some of the questions I have watched this movie. Snyder seems to have tried to comment on a) the "dangers" of online chatrooms, b) the hypocrisy of Christians sexual mores, and c) the impact our twisted Puritan society has on us as individuals. If it is, it failed. The movie is just too badly done to have fun, never mind mediating social news. Torture scenes are stupid and boring, bordering stupid (especially when Snyder goes to one of his "pain and death" monologues) and everything else is just stupid. The "call tracing" scene is really lame ... when the cops get the caller ID and * 69? The young principal cop character is particularly terrible ... basically, he shouldn't work as an actor. And the sound in the final showdown is really bad. I think you couldn't afford two boom mikes? The rest of the acting isn't terrible, but it's not good either. The cop is quite one note and his separate quality is not quite plausible. In fact, Dee Snyder is not too bad, but she growled too much and mocked. Robert Englund (who deserves a better way) gives a rather amusing performance to the hypocritical redneck. If you're a big Robert Englund fan, the movie is worth seeing. All the others are forgotten. Finally, we saw all these elements of conspiracy done earlier and better, in films like SILENCE OF LAMBS, HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. I suggest you rent one of those who would instead watch Turkey. 3/10. <br /> <br />
