The idea is great, beaten by great times by referees. Why make fun of people? If what the inventors say is true, and as most of them say they have spent their lives rescuing the invention, it is minimal to reject the idea without making people fun. <br /> <br /> shows when they want to accept an idea from the carrier they added to the referees. The only one I respected from the judges is the one who always sits to the right of the table, is a decent person, of course an English snob who claims to be a business man at does not mean that you are one friend <br /> <br /> not least a great guy who sits between English and crier. Wake up a man, there is no work and an inventor to call you himself. the inventor is not an attribute of work. I think they wanted to add someone like Simon from an American idol, they thought it worked there, it could work here. the context is different and the idea is completely different. It's a good idea and could make a good show if it just changes the judges and removes their actions and attitudes. /> <br /> stop kidding people.
