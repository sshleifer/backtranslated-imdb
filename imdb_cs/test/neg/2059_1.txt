This film is a disaster from start to finish. 75 percent of the film is made from scenes taken from HERCULES & THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES & THE CAPTIVE WOMEN edited along with original scenes that add nothing but a complete rip-off. I am a big fan of the two movies and I see the scenes I took from them, re-edited them and repeated them with nonsensical dialogue, which made my head spin. These cheap manufacturers' tactics, who make more money by cheating an unsuspecting audience, basically killed Sword & Sandal in the 1960s. with bad Hercules. The fight is cool and Giovanni Cianfriglia, who plays Antaia, is definitely exciting. He will make Herco an unforgettable nemesis. However, the rest is borderline embarrassing, which was probably shot in the day. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost!
