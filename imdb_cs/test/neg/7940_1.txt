Attack on Precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest movie I've ever seen from Charlie's Angels 2. Shame is that they have a good cast and a good prerequisite for the job. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ......................................... .................... I know he said that this movie is a remake of the Rio Bravo descendant, but the writers of this film actually watch Rio Bravo? Aside from the fact that Rio Bravo is a Western classic, the film's premise was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to hold the prisoner accused of murder in order to be liberated by his brother and his gang. No one wants to free anyone in Attack on Precinct 13. They want EVERY dead. So my first question would have to be, WHY SHOULD NOT PAY THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN FROM THE START? Why "assault" instead? I know that the conspiracy conspiracy conspiracy was supposed to be clever and shocking, but it didn't make sense and / or was properly presented. If a veteran was a cop on it, why is this whole movie needed? If a veteran policeman suddenly cut himself in the back door during the siege, how did he get a chance? Once he appeared at the door, he would be shot and they would have their entry point. It's just FUBAR. <br /> <br /> Which part of any city can take place in a police district (including helicopters and massive explosions) but no one will notice? However, once there is a fire, it must "leave the fire department showing" ?????? How did they plan to cover up the chaos that was going on outside? Are the police bullets in the walls, bullets of cartridges, fingerprints, the use of equipment, and the fact that there will be no organs of "episcopal men"? What about the police snipers? How often could they miss so often? I like the fact that when the two detainees tried to escape, the snipers were confused by two small hills of snow. As if it was not possible to shoot a high-performance riffle over a pile of snow. The setup was interesting, though ridiculous, but the movie just went out of the cliff when they decided to kill that particular figure with a bullet in the head for absolutely no reason at all. I know the filmmakers went to shock, but all they got was disgusted at the cruelty and anger of the audience. Do you not think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that the word of mouth is to tell everyone to friends and family to avoid this? That particular scene must be a big part of this oral word (that and the fact that every conspiracy is stupid, then dirt). The conclusion remains stupid when the villain embarks on diatribes similar to Austin Powers instead of killing the helpless people he finally captured. I know a few people mentioned the final scenes that take place in the forest of Detroit (> snicker <), but why did Ethan's figure first go into the woods? Doesn't he even find out if the SUV disappears with the secretary and his friend? They just cut it slowly in the forest, a gun in his hand. GACK. I could go on but not. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all costs.
