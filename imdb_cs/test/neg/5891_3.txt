I sincerely expected more from this film. Maybe it was a problem. By the time the camera was still - it was never. On close shots, the camera shakes, the subjects move and I have headaches. The pieces are so often and so fast that the viewer often finds herself over what just happened. (SEARCH, SPOILER ALERT) And at the end of the movie, when you expect to have a happy ending after you've gone through so much useless thoughts to understand what's going on, the loss will end. For me, it was basically a horrible movie, devastated by a cinematographer with ADHD and a lack of meaningful conspiracy.
