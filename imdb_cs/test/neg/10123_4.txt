I will never understand why a studio like Universal buys a musical, then transfers it to the canvas. My first thought, when I saw Ava Gardner and Robert Walker starring, would have seen something from MGM who made musicals at the time. The boy was bad and disappointed. One Touch Of Venus, played by Mary Martin, Kenny Baker and John Boles on Broadway, attended 567 appearances in the 1943-1945 season, and Gardner, Walker and Tom Conway play the roles that Martin, Baker and Boles did on stage. Kurt Weill-Ogden Nash Musical with Nash and S.J. Perelman was a comeback vehicle for Mary Martin who reestablished herself as Broadway Queen after a disappointing venture in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Check out the names that went to this show. Given who was responsible for the book, I expected to see some sparkling jokes in this production. Instead, I got rather a pedestrian script, as if the whole joke had been dropped. Doing your best to make it is Eva Arden plays her usual girl Friday role with Tom Conway, but it's too much for Eve. The story relates to the shop window of the dresser Robert Walker, who kisses a very valuable statue of Venus that stems from the life of Ava Gardner. Of course, when the statue disappears, Conway shouts at the law and is suspected of Walker, the last person to be with the statue. The rest of the movie is Walker dealing with Gardner and what happens to both. For reasons I don't understand, Eva Esonen Wilson and of course Walker sing a few lines. Singing by Dick Haymes and Olga San Juan playing Walker's friends and co-workers. Of course on Broadway there were songs by singer Mary Martin and Kenny Baker. Do you think Haymes will at least play the role of Walker. It was unpleasant to say the least. Only three songs survived the score, Don't Look Now, but My Heart Shows It Is On, And Unparalleled Speak Low. Haymes's silk baritone is shown as the best advantage in Speak Low, which sang as a duet of Martin and Baker on Broadway. For some reason the lyrics of one of the greatest men of the past century, Ogden Nash, were made by Ann Ronnell. I believe there was an infamous Code here. In Lee's biography of Ava Gardner, he mentioned Ava's brief duel with Robert Walker when he slapped his current man Howard Duff. . When Duff and Gardner met again, Walker took it wrong and did not speak Gardner off the camera. I am sure that even the fact that both of them were not in their best work did not help in matters either. Hopefully, some repertoire company will do One Touch Of Venus and see it Weill, Nash and Perelman.
