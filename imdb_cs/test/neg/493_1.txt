This is a film that is somewhat based on Rob Halford's output from the British metal god 'Judas Priest' and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to lead a priest tribute band. Originally called Metal God, this movie could be something big. Instead, someone in the office somewhere who knows little about metal music decided to water her. Since changing the name of Metal God to the "safe" middle of the "Rock Star" path to the lame soundtrack, this movie is playing badly. I spent most of my life in a professional metal band and I was looking forward to this. The soundtrack is not very metallic for one, and the end of the film is lame as well. The film has several bright spots in writing and playing, but as a whole, it eventually fails because ... 1) A metal band based film should have a metal soundtrack. 2) There is nothing about Mark Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are thinking of 'heavy metal', check out this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of ​​metal, check out this movie for a good laugh.
