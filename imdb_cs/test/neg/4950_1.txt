I don't know why it has some decent reviews because it could be the weakest horror comedy I've ever seen. Englund is just that he is for a portrait and his performance is just as unnecessary as most advanced jokes (and scares). The direction is terrible and the behavior is worse. It looks like every year the producers are trying to do another Evil Dead, but these weak non-original attempts just step on the memory of the true horror classic. Whether his filmmakers say, "This is not a remake but his 80th return (which is equally original in my opinion - Hatchet) or people trying to get involved with other horror classics is still misleading and used to supplement the scarcity, horror, comedy, or even decent movie <br /> <br /> Avoid all the cost !!!
