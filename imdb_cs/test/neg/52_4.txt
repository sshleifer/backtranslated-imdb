Conrad Radzoff (Ferdy Mayne), the iconic Hammy icon, dies of heart disease (not the destruction of an ungrateful assistant and television commercial director, both of whom disrespected him with insult showers). His body is removed from his mausoleum by some film students (they want to "invite him to dinner" .. they are quite big fans). What these children (including young Jeffrey Combs) do not expect is that Radzoff will be resurrected by a means that confuses those who have removed him from their resting place. The list of violent acts includes Radzoff pulling one guy's tongue out, setting a woman on fire, lifting a coffin that crushes a woman's face, decapping one guy, and cremating another guy alive in a coffin. A really weird soundtrack and annoying hazy wraps around Radzoff's ghoul activities. The film feels much longer than it is. The film is not so cruel and we hardly see much violence because the film is often too dark. Sometimes Radzoff is a sinister presence, but sometimes he looks really stupid.
