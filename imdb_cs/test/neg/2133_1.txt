This stupid, anti-environmental wannabe "Jaws" is sad, pathetic, boring, poorly dubbed and stupid. There is nothing redemption about it. The fence follows some shark / octopus creature-thing that appears off the coast of Florida and kills some people (including a boring, stupid couple with a lit wife and a silent husband who for some reason stabs a fork). Its ascent to the surface is always represented by an indefinite side of something bumpy. It doesn't make sense, it's so boring, and the plot conspiracy sucks. There are moments of the camp that cannot be ignored: the same shot of the ship a couple of introductory sequences THREE TIMES; the doctor twice struck the dying patient's chest with a diffuser without stopping even though he is clearly dead; porn-esque soundtrack; a shot of a couple loving on the beach, with three different ones ("that us ahead!") doing it; an ancient computer that sounds like Kermit Frog; "I know!" a la Dr. Smith; the list goes on and on. Oh, and everyone drinks at least thirty bears during the movie (he noticed a lot of Mike and 'Bots'). . . <br /> <br /> The MST3K version is their best episode, but it's definitely better than the movie itself. "That's how I love fishing, guys ... with a flashlight and a flamethrower ..." - Crow <br /> <br /> One star "Devil Fish"; seven for MST3K <br /> <br />
