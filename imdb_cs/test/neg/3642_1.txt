When I first watched Zoey101 with my sister, we thought it was a piece of waste. Nobody is so rich and lives on campus by the Pacific coast. In the show, Zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always goes to her for advice. Zoey is always the one who has a good idea and everyone agrees with her, let her idea be stupid. She is always perfect in everything, including her perfect character. And she is such a diet freak that talks about carbohydrates like she knows what they are. When she sees her friends eating chocolate, she confiscates her. And another thing that bothers me is that every time you look at her, she always chews a piece of mint. And everyone wants to do something with her, for example in one episode Logan offered $ 4,000 to cheer her and her friends about everything he does in his poor life. And her girlfriend Nicole is an overly energetic jester who screams a lot. And Lola dresses like a lady Hoochie Houdini. The 1980s called want there shaggy hair back.Might equally shave the hair. This show sends bad news to kids everywhere to think that if they don't have the latest I-pods and designer clothes, they will hate each other. This show is big thumb down. <br /> <br /> We Hate You Jamie Lynn, <br /> <br /> Happy Birthday Ryan and Kara L
