It seems that everything that made the original so much fun is missing. This is simply "running the mill demons on a loose crash" slasher, but without the passion that adorned the original. There's nothing new in the story, in fact, they seem to ignore the first. Here, the demons are released in a tall security apartment building and naturally kill most of the population. Make-up effects seem less convincing than the first time. Although the actors weren't exactly brilliant in demons, they're actually much worse in Demons 2. You don't care about these characters, ALL. The story is non-existent, the music of the poor (except one song by Simon Boswell) is not the least scary; It's just not that good. Easily the worst movie of Dario Argento was involved and Lamberto Bava is also (Bava's portrait in this movie, not a very funny one). Maybe 3 is too high a rating, but at least I might have noticed it and I didn't think I'd stop in the middle. My advice; Stick to the original.
