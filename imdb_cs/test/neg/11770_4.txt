I think my biggest mistake was to follow this remake of '95 "Piranha" back-to-back with Joe Dante '78 original. I did the same thing last week with "The Omen." Curiously, just follow the remake after the original '76, really appreciated the 2006 version quite a lot for various reasons. <br /> <br /> But this approach bounced off '95 Piranha '. This reinforced the fact that it is a really smaller picture. Basically, the '95 version is more or less the exact same film, as it tells the same story and follows it virtually scene-by-scene (only Barabara Steele's character and military intervention were written from it). But cinematography wasn't that good. Also, the negotiations were worse. Especially Alexandra Paul (playing character Heather Menzies) showed me again what a terrible actress she is. Bradford Dillman (from the '78 version) had his Charlton Heston playing method of going, which was amusing, while in the '95 version of William Katt does a good job of being William Katt. So I didn't mind him. But the whole cast is much worse and the only useful event was seeing James Karen ("The Return of the Living Dead", Parts 1 and 2) in a portrait. The effects of John Carl Buechler's make-up are not as elegant as Rob Bottin. The musical score had a circle, but Pino Donaggia's score was much more memorable. So all these shortcomings really shone because you just played the original as part of this double account. <br /> <br /> Since Scott P. Levy's remake follows Dante's original, I think it's fun to sit down. , though it lacks the joke Dante the original had. But what really disliked me is the fact that quite a lot of the footage from the first film was reused during the pirana's offensive scenes. I never like it when filmmakers do it (and I'm not talking about using shots for flashbacks or other reasons). I mean, if you don't have the budget (or imagination) to come up with the new material, don't make a remake for Pete. But Roger Corman has made this (cheaper) remake, so I think I shouldn't be surprised by the reuse of the record. <br /> <br /> If you decide to watch "Piranha" then make sure It's been a while since you saw the original. You can enjoy this remake a little more. And oh yes, the cool little stop-motion creature from the original is nowhere to be expected in this movie. But what's even worse is that there is no female nudity in this one too (the original had a lot of shots on it, and the blonde from the opening scene even accidentally pulled her underwear down while removing her jeans!). Numbers of how this '95 version was created for TV.
