As a Harrison Ford fan, I'm obviously kind. It was predictable, satisfied ... my husband made a lot of sounds as we watched him. What is an unsatisfactory film. Our local newspaper (San Jose Mercury News) actually gave 4 stars out of 4 stars !!! It's hard to believe the reviewer saw the same movie we did.
