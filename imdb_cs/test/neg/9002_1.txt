This is not "so bad that it is good" - It is "so bad that it violates the Geneva Convention's cruel and unusual punishment"! Only by reading Synopsis can you even find out the "conspiracy" of this disaster directly on the video. It's a hodge-podge grainy stock footage montage along with some of the worst acting ever you will ever have misfortune to see. Comparing this incompetent, turgical, humorous mess with "Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid" is like saying that "Gigli" is like "Citizen Kane". Talent casts are cheaper in costumes, J.C. Penney "Goin 'to Church" outfits, and there's not the slightest attempt at period hairstyles or makeup. If you really want to see how this kind of "homage" can work, look at "The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra" - It's clever, well written, and the best of all that real actors do not do. watch. For this reason, look for the work of Phoenix artist Paul Wilson, whose Sci-Fi short "The Attack 70 foot Courtesy Lady" leaves this film in the dust. People in the tropics look and look as if they have been pulled out of the street and given their scripts to read in one and only take. This is an insult to Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney and anyone else who is involved in films that cannibalize this schlock-fest! Money is not a problem - a lot can be achieved with very low costs. Good scenarios, decent actors and Z-Grade costumes and production design should be released before the so-called director created this smelly pile of film offal. Hopefully the "promise" of the sequel fails - it was by far the scariest thing that turned out in the whole movie !!
