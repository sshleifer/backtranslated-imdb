I knew five minutes after the monster appeared where he went. But when I saw the first credits, I said, "My God, Bruce Boxlightner, Walter Koenig (of Star Trek.) Gil Gerard (of Buck Rogers, and he is almost unrecognizable), then I saw John Callahan playing on my favorite soap, all my kids, get a few pounds, but it can still act, then there was Veronica Hamilla, too bad, when I didn't see her in the movie, I threw 20 minutes into the movie, never seen by William Katt (from Perry Mason and The Greates American Hero). <br /> <br /> All these stars and one crappy movie, I hope they get paid. Bad Bad Bad
