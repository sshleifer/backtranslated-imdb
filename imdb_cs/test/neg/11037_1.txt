I've read IMDb comments for some time. 8.3 average for this movie just plain gets on the nerves. I don't want to pull out one of those I just registered to write "pieces ..... but I did it." The only thing you leave this movie is that incest doesn't deserve to be ridiculed. Now I realize that many people who like this movie love this movie; however, it is stupid. The thing that really gets to me is the fact that the director expects you to be sympathetic to the film "villain". If you have sexual relations with your sister, you should probably be a pariah of society. I think only my personal feelings. Even so, I sat for over 2 hours of this * complete * expectation of some really deep thought behind the Dae-Soo imprisonment. <br /> <br /> I tend to have a lot of foreign movies, but this is my first meeting with Korean Flick and gave them the last in line in my book. Oh ... I feel better after a little ventilation.
