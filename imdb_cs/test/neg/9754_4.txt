I wasn't interested in seeing Step Up at all, but my friend was always eavesdropping and eavesdropping on me to see this movie, especially because she's so in love with Channing Tatum that I kept teasing her about the only reason she loved the movie . But somehow she convinced me that it was a movie worth seeing that if I loved movies like Dirty Dancing, Take the Leadership and Save the Last Dance, I should love Step Up, what the hell? I think every movie in some way has the right to display it. Well, you know the movies I just mentioned above? Dirty Dancing, Take the lead and save the last dance? Well, put them in a mixer with love gangsta and that's what you have. Not to mention if you saw the movies, frankly, you saw Step Up. Because Channing is a lower class with street smart people who just feel the music while the snobbish class has to follow step by step, how will they ever fall in love if they're so different? After all, it's their chance to "stand up" for passion, mystery and lust of dance! OK, that was a silly explanation, but as I said, if you saw those movies that I mentioned, or even if you just saw a plot, you get a movie. I don't understand how it actually has 5.5 ratings, I bet they're Channing lovers! LOL! I'm kidding you, but it's all good, I think I just didn't get what others did with passion, the secret that is dancing! Antonio Bandares, where are you when we need you?! <br/> <br/> 4/10
