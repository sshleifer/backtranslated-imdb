Return to sender, a.k.a. Condemned is almost imperfect. One good thing about this particular movie was that I was never bored. As already mentioned, the reviews that call this movie a low-budget success may not have followed the same movie I saw. <br /> <br /> Rather than write a review and say what's going on and what works and doesn't work I work, I just know that nothing works. There are plot holes in this movie that you can drive the semifinals. Playing in the movie is not very good, although it may be the result of such a badly written script that it could be a ghost written by George Lucas. Exceptional sets or costumes were not needed for this particular film, and it seemed appropriate. Did I mention there were some holes? By the end of the movie, you're wondering how blind a shotgun can be, why Kelly Preston believes Aidan Quinn why she would fall asleep the night before her client is supposed to be killed as Aidan Quinn can drive 400 kilometers in a short time is falling apart during the rest of the movie, why Aidan Quinn was not one-fifth instead of a bunch of nips, etc. <br /> <br /> With all that being said, it's definitely a B-movie and the horrible one. The unfortunate thing is that it's not bad enough to be good. If you value your time, please let this service serve as a public service message so you don't get away from it.
