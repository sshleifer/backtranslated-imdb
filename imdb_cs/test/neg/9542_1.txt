Wow - this movie was really bad! Are you talking about a formal, typical movie? Watching this movie was like hitting your head repeatedly against a brick wall. The transitions tried to be cool, but they failed. The plot at the end where we found out who the bad guy was was unexpected, but it doesn't make much sense until his monologue. Even ... The amount of gore in this movie won't help either. Are all these images necessary? My last complaint is about the credibility of the pieces of the film. Indeed, would a PD actually send a lone officer to an unlit warehouse, a subway tunnel, or anywhere she could find the body when the location of the perp is unknown? And why does romance end up somehow? It's like a writer trying to fit into every Hollywood cliche he could. Don't waste your time seeing this piece ... something.
