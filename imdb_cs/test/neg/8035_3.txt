On the way home from one day on the beach, four young people seek refuge from the torrential downpour in the Lord's House and Lady Alexander after their car runs out of gas. They don't know, but the house they stay in is supposed to be a place of satanic ritual. Jane (Camille Keaton), the only woman in the group, will be sacrificed. When her male companions rush to help her, one of them accidentally kills Lady Alexander. Things really get out of hand and all the others who visit black matter are also killed. Four are trying to escape, but they soon discover that there is no escape from what they have witnessed. One by one they meet their fates. Gong to the Tragic Ceremony, I was positive to enjoy it. Slowly burned Gothic horror is right in my alley. I'm also quite fond of some of the other Riccardo Fredy movies as The Horrible Dr. Hichcock, The Ghost, and I Vampiri. The tragic ceremony seems to be a thing. Unfortunately, things don't always work as they should. The biggest tragedy in relation to Tragic Ceremony is the time I spent watching this film confusion. With a few minor exceptions, nothing touched or worked for me on the film. The characters are unlikely, the plot is incoherent and schizophrenic, and stimulation is terrible. There is a subplot of some cursed pearls that goes nowhere and just serves to confuse things even more. Besides, nothing interesting happens to most of the movie. At a time when four leaders realized they were in danger, I was far behind the point of care. And I don't understand the reviews I read, praise Camille Keaton's acting. I suppose this is an amazing performance if you think it is an emotional daze. The three male conductors are in themselves an indefinable definition. They do nothing to stand out. The accompanying cast includes some popular genres like Luigi Pistilli, Luciana Paluzzi and Paul Muller, but none of them have anything to do. In fact, Muller's main contribution is a two-minute monologue at the end of the film trying to explain what happened in the previous 80 or so minutes. It is a weak attempt to create a very weak film.
