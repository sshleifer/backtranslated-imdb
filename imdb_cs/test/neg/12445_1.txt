This film was terrible not only that the plot was weak, but the acting was incredibly bad and sometimes pathetic. Very unrealistic dialogues of people in real life do not speak like that, and in nothing that is said in a very monotonous manner, with the exception of an almost indistinguishable whisper that constantly appears, there is no emotion or feeling. Even the cut is bad, the cuts are terrible. Working with the camera was sloppy and shaky on close-ups, even during conversations. There is nothing positive about this movie and George Katts has to work on heavy machines or any place where he doesn't have to talk to other people because he doesn't know how to do it. How this movie won / get nominated for awards oh my god!
