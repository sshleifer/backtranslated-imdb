What we know about Caravaggio is a troublemaker with a healthy sense of entitlement who lived among the whores and thieves and crooks and put them on the canvas. The topics of his works were mainly sex, death, redemption, especially finding the sacred inside the profan. He lived at a time when homosexuality was a death sentence, and political intrigue usually related to fatal injuries in society defined by the maximum of a "choking boy for the purity of his scream". Derek Jarman for his cinematography, or his requisition of Caravaggio's paintings, and you certainly cannot accuse a man of avoiding homosexuality. But frankly, Jarman never crosses the 80's cartoon. The Italian patronage is becoming the 1980s London art scene with nice waiters and calculators. Sean Bean is a sexy piece of northern harsh oiling on his bike. Tilda Swinton performs a transformation that is worthy of Mills and Boons ("Why, Miss Lena, you are beautiful ..."). Jarman gives Caravagga a particularly motivating motive for the murder that left him in exile. It could have been a visually stunning treatment for a man whose life was dangerous, exciting, violent, and decadent, but nevertheless elevated the lives of ordinary people to the status of Renaissance masterpieces looked upon by emperors and kings. Instead, you get Pierre and Gilles to Italy. The pretty bodies of young boys are shown perfection, but never the men who inhabit them. Jarman seems to satirize the London art scene, showing it shallowly and arrogantly. To use Caravaggio and Renaissance Italy to make the spot is to use a silk purse to make a pig's ear. Fairly, this film remains visually stunning, but ultimately as a two-dimensional image that it describes.
