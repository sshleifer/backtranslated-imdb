End of Days is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Mudling direction, a meandering script loaded with lame dialogs and gaping plot holes, rapid-fire MTV-style editing and bad behavior all the way. This does not mean that the end of days is not observable. I was interested in the film because I found that Ah-nuld's last action movie was ridiculously stupid for being so incompetent and stupid about logic. Without a sense of logic, the film dies faster, which is why the end of the days deserved a huge drop in cash desk reception in the second week after opening in the US <br /> <br /> I will not go into detail explaining why the End of Days violates film logic laws but here are some problems with this movie: <br /> <br /> (SPOILER) <br /> <br /> After the devil comes out, the restaurant explodes without any trace of how he did it. No snatching finger, no illegal gas to burn, nothing. How could it have happened? Arnold and his annoying sidekick Kevin Pollack somewhat magically comes up with the title "Christine York" after exploring the phrase "Christ in New York" carved on the victim's body, running a computer database, and, viola, Christine York, the only one a person with an exact name throughout New York! Except for my suspension of infidelity. How did the characters who came into contact with the character of Arnold turned against him later in the movie? I laughed loudly when I realized that the stepmother who had changed was the same actress who played a nanny in Romeo + Juliet William Shakespeare. Her ironic transition from this film to this one was absolutely cheerful if you could imagine. <br /> <br /> All the helpless huge explosions and firings. What did you expect in an Arnold Schwarzenegger car? The devil took the body of a man consisting of flesh and blood, yet bullets and explosions are invisible by healing through this body. Logically it is impossible. As the devil performs an illusion in an apartment, Arnold's character runs into a solid Christmas tree that is supposed to be an illusion and * physically falls on it. The Devil is able to knock out a person's brain and turn the victim's head 180 degrees, but he couldn't kill Arnold's character as he always wants. As the devil's goal of parents' desire died and why the evil New Yorkers run after Arnold and the object of desire was never explained at all. In order of rip-off Speed, Arnold and Devil's object of desire can escape the Metro Train Wreck by a short distance unharmed. This is beyond my understanding, because strength would be enough to make Arnold and the object of desire for a violent throw enough and die deadly injuries seconds after impact. Arnold suffers from a brutal beat from the crowd that the Devil has inflicted on the cross to hang against the wall, but the devil has forgotten to take the time and opportunity to kill him for comfort. <br /> <br /> At the beginning of the film, after the devil took over the male body, suddenly Arnold is his bodyguard ??? Is it coincidence or just an example of bad editing? Arnold's recital of dialogues in particularly ridiculous scenes such as "ARE CHOIRBOY COMPARED TO ME!" they are the perfect feed for MST3K, just like the Eraser with the classic "You're the luggage!" The whole theory of 666/1999 is totally ridiculous. Likewise, a pseudo-religious gossip about Christian theology involving the end of the world at midnight and fanatical killers who know the location of the devil's object of desire. It is very ironic that the End of Days uses scattered professions that abuse the deity while worrying about Christian theories. The level of violence in the film is excessive and horrible, and it is useless to serve a conspiracy. Here is the factor of director's leniency in excess. He certainly does not know how to create a coherent action film by Air Force One, who was only required to write the script for a large amount of money. Therefore, the end of the days is a worthless film without redeeming value except for camping - Arnold's worst from Hercules in New York. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
