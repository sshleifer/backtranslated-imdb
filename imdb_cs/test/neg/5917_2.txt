In the 1930s, Hal Roach Studios was on top of the comedy world with such stars as Laurel and Hardy, Charley Chase and Little Rascals. Most of these films are exceptional and have endured time. However, the less-known Roach product was pairing with Thelma Todd and Zasu Pitts (later, Todd was paired with equally unalented Patsy Kelly). I'm trying to, I just can't build these pictures - they just aren't funny. Moreover, unlike Laurel and Hardy, there was no ounce of chemistry between Todd and her two star stars. Before you think I am a handle, I understand that I have seen and examined hundreds of Roach's films, as well as many other early comedies, so I am well acquainted with the genre and within this genre this team is among the worst. The reason I think I'm right about the team is that as a lower-level team in Roach they got all the scripts nobody else wanted. If Stan or Ollie hated the drawing, he was often handed over to Todd and Pitts / Kelly - and he usually showed it. But in this movie, the team is at an absolute level. It's hard to imagine a comedy with less laughter and a conspiratorial plot. The film begins with Zasu in the jury and Thelma as an advocate. As for Zasa, he's a totally annoying jerk. NOT a kind of moron (like Stan Laurel or Lou Costello), but just a totally annoying and grating person who is ambitious and annoying. As for Thelma, as usual, she is rather a dull "straight man" and as such has little to do but reacts to the tough behavior of Zas. The plot is Thelma, which prevents the client who is accused of selling exploding weapons. slimming pills. Since pills are very dangerous when a lawyer asks Zas to try to swallow, it just looks stupid. And when they were called "pills," they were more like giant black balls that were bigger than golf balls. Swallowing them is only seemingly fanciful and makes no sense - even for a low eyebrow comedy. When she finds out she swallowed the pill and is really explosive, they all panic and run like idiots until the end of the movie. As I said, I am not a fan of this team. However, even for those who want a movie, there is not one legitimate laugh throughout the short! When I talked about this review with my wife (who also saw the movie with me), she thought my score 2 was too generous !!
