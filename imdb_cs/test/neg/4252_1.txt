A few words for people here in the locksmith's club: The worst crap ever seen on this honorable movie theater. Very bad script, very bad actors and very bad movie. Don't waste your time looking for this movie, check out the very good "mutantes verdes fritos anarquia radioactiva" or any movie was a good comment to me. Don't say anything anymore.
