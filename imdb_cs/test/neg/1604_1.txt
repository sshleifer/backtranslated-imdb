Very boring show. What's worse, his very racist. White boys are fools and the only romance is between a black man and a white woman. There is nothing interesting about this romance, it is not exciting, it is not fun, nor does it seem that they care for themselves, but rather as writers and directors they wanted an interracial thing to do. Why is it so popular in the media today? It is social programming and will lead to no good, there is always tension when too many people want the same thing. This exhibition is not worth $ 20 per season, for a waste of time and harmful to society. At the very least, when they use TV shows to sell products, they are more discreet, the sale of any program is quite obvious, and without clear thinking, some may feel bad to face it, but some of us know better.
