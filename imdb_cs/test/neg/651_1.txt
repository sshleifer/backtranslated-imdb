I knew a little bit that when I signed up for the "all pay channel" package with Direct TV, I'd like to face this movie. It was just after the next movie we watched ... and I was a teenager in 1981, so I'm not sure where I was at that time ... but I missed this movie. <br /> <br /> I can't believe we left it. It's kind of funny to take you back to the time machine in the early 1980s ... but I think even then it would be a painful movie. It was just ... well ... "too cute"! ET was "cute" in a way ... but not unpleasantly cute ... and stupid. <br /> <br /> When I see such a movie, I'm on IMDb to see what others are saying. I'm blown away that this thing has been nominated! Wow ... the film industry has come a long way since the 1980s! Well ... she showed it to some old actors ... btw, that's another thing I was surprised ... lineup ... not a bunch of no-names ... but some real actors / actresses. They had to be in their drug days! Anyway ... weird, interesting, bizarre, and they're happy to grow up!
