I wish I could use a time travel machine to jump back to the moment I thought about seeing this movie and instead doing other plans. I saw a free screening of A Sound of Thunder, so I can't complain about the prize, but I wish I got 103 minutes. The negotiations were mediocre and the special effects were pitiful. People should not make movies about dinosaurs unless they can afford to make prehistoric creatures look so good or better than in Jurassic Park. Spielberg spoiled us. Edward Burns as Travis Ryer was the only film of saving salvation. I noticed that women under the age of 18 rated the film as the highest, and the only explanation is that they all married Burns all the time. 103 minutes long. This movie should be over the last 80 minutes. He just moved on and on and on. Don't waste your time or money on this flick away.
