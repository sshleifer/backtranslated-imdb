Three words: What a heap ..... Two words: Don't bother! One word: Sucked! This movie is not visible. Even Seagal groupies should avoid this movie. Martial arts, typical Aikido, are terrible. Martial arts movements are fine, but cinematography is pathetic. The film actually goes into slow motion whenever Seagal gives his "kill motion" to his victims. Worse still, the same movement is shown three times in rapid succession from three slightly different angles. How stupid. Seagal's acting was simple stupid, but I still give this movie "6" because it was due to a supportive cast whose "rogue" roles were actually pretty fun. The story is just stupid. Seagal plays Federal Express with a license to kill. His character also has a dedicated work ethic that means that all of his packages will be delivered to the right people in time - and without any charges - and nothing in his way. Not murderers, political leaders, explosions or even death. I expect some violence in the martial arts movie, but in this film there are several scenes of random and terrible acts of violence that lend in no way to the progress of the film or its story. There is a reason why this movie went straight to the video and there are tons of reasons to avoid it. No one should bother with this trick. <br /> <br />
