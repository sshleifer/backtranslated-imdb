Another example of women's genre in prison. This is not exactly the genre known for quality movies, but this is a notch below the most. A bunch of women marries bordellos, where they work in a prison on a rocky island. Once there they are exposed to a lot of badly directed sex and cruel "dialogue". For a movie with a staggering amount of sex and nudity, nothing of it is erotic. Sex scenes are awkwardly behaved and some scenes, such as the shower scene, seem to drag on and on. This means that there are at least some minimum production values. On the W-i-P scale, I'd put it above Frauen Zellenblock Neun, but under Chained Heat.
