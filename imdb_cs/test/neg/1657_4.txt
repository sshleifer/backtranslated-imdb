Very slow, dim, mysterious movie. It could be the movie Jean-Luc Godard would have done had he been Italian. He certainly expresses how tedious, repetitive, helpless, and empty a person's life can be, but I usually don't go to the movies to find out! The storyline (as it is) doesn't convince. Why would a gorgeous hotel receptionist (exception to the film's dullness) be least interested in moody, chain-smoking, a quiet loner who speaks in "deep" aphorisms, I'm sorry. Very hard to feel sympathy with the main character. One feels like shaking his neck and telling him to get away from it! His brother is much more human. The end is inconclusive and mysterious. Everyone in the cinema (when I saw the movie) went mumble about how they almost fell asleep. Of course, it shouldn't be Hollywood shhot-em-up and crash-bang Hollywood style Bruce Willis, but some energy and action would make it a lot more exciting. One of the best Italian movies ever?! Pleease ... Art house, at best curiosity.
