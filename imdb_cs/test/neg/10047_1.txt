This unsuccessful satire or human condition commentary has earned a place as one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. I'm seriously thinking of buying a copy if I can find one dirt cheap, chasing an unwanted company. It's honestly so bad. I consider it some sort of anti-personnel weapon. If you're the kind of person who just needs to see the train wreck to witness the massacre, then this movie is a jewel. To be fair, the character of Kelsey Grammar has 1 line that almost works, but not entirely. Except that everything in this movie is trying to be insightful, it lacks a brand about the distance between the country and the closest pair of colliding galaxies. Usually I can appreciate a book or film where the protagonist suffers from some existential anxiety, but the anxiety presented here is so incredible and on top, and the film doesn't even solve the nonsense it presents in any valuable way. If you are familiar with the term "word vomit" then you can get a picture of cinematrocity. Oh, and the narrative structure is sick, pretentious and amateurish. It failed both in style and basically. If you really hate someone, invite them to the double role of this film and "Terror from a Tiny Town" from all of the 1930s. However, this is likely to violate some provisions of the Geneva Convention.
