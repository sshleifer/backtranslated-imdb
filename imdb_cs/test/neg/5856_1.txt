This film is a bit more than ersatz Verhoeven. Filming is supposed to be tele-realistic, but it's just outrageous. The parody disappears after about 15 minutes to replace it with a story that seems to be taken seriously. Brecht pauses for non-existent advertising brakes are tedious and even painful; no doubt there was no real intention to make this film Brechtian, it was just an accident that happened. If you want to see a reality TV parody, watch Celebrity DeathMatch - it's funnier and funnier and especially shorter. I rarely felt so much pain while watching the movie. Avoid like an angry rabbit.
