There is nothing to say except that I want the film to take me. I'm not a racist against Latinos. Damn, I'm half Brazilian. I loved Children. That doesn't make any sense. These kids just walk and do nothing. They're not even good at skating. All the while I was just waiting for something, something to happen! Oh no. Nothing happens the whole movie. I mentioned that they suck on skating. I could make a movie called beat up rockers, and the whole premise will be about kicking sh * t from poser moron punks like these kids. I don't even get into it, this movie is angry. Please do yourself a favor and burn this movie if you come in contact with it, so some other poor soul won't make the same mistake.
