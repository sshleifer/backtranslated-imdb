The original "Attack on Precinct 13" is bold, witty and - perhaps most important - short. This remake is mercilessly stuffed and talky. Worse yet, the African-American hero of the first film is replaced by the handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, who makes this "attack" less progressive than the 1970s. God, I miss John Carpenter and his unlikely conspiracies and his special sense of humor. I even miss his B-sheet actors who are better than Hawke and the company. I can't say I'm taking care of the new villains in this version - they're pulling as little credibility as the story ever had. Female characters are useless, criminals are generic hoods, and Gabriel Byrne gives another of his boring performances. Music is also bad - it is a bland action that actually tensions the tension. Just terrible.
