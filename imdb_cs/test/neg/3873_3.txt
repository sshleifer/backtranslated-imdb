The original name always considered me a somewhat overcrowded definition for a lot of riveting saddle tramps. Still; their presence on the screen was at least emphasized by a top group of actors in support of Yul Brynner. Most of them were movie stars on their own. <br /> <br /> However; this first sequel was pale imitation, with the band now composed of very B and C familiar players, who were more moderate than magnificent. It was a similar arrangement. Brynner's' Chris' had to recruit another team of weapons-toting saddle-tramps to solve the problems of Mexican peasants' again. Another tyrant gave them grief. <br /> <br /> With the original and freshness of the first film he has now spent, this remake has something to offer. The budget was probably very limited. This was reflected not only in the cast, but also in the underwater scenario, which he borrowed a lot from an earlier classic. It was also more than half an hour shorter than the original John Sturges. But we still had a repeat of being tortured and moralized, which sometimes even made the first one a little turgical. However, there was no decent action, action or work on the spot to deal with things. Filmiing was less expansive. We have not been able to express the wide scope of the landscape, which was a large part of the original. <br /> <br /> In general; lacking imagination. The first movie was a hit-hit, and this sequel pedestrian was apparently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible to cynically cash-in on former success. And it shows. It's about being a television. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
