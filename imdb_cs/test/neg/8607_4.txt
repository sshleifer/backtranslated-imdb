Sex Lives of Potato Men is about the sex life of several men involved in potato delivery. So there are no surprises. It's actually almost what you might expect from a title: that's, it's a weird comedy involving sex and potatoes. The movie sometimes works. It is a nervous, sometimes unpleasant comedy about the lives of some rather unimportant and rather average men who have problems with women. Where the film does not work well and why it failed at the box office is that unpredictable, uncomfortable parts may be just a shadow too unpredictable and uncomfortable. Instead of laughing during the scene of a man hanging on the basement ceiling, who masturbates over another man while he loves his wife, I think most of us just groan awkwardly and wonder what Andy Humphries thinks. Well, maybe we showed what he thought too clearly.
