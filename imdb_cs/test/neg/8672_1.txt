Please ... if someone gets a chance to read this BEFORE watching a movie, if it can be called so, refrain from it ... don't waste your time !!!! Even I watched this movie right after the book was finished and I was really disappointed ... the main character is basically new, made up of Fanny, because it shows that NEVER has a book similarity at all ... he's so alive and laughs all the time ... if there was one thing the author wanted to give it to, it was that she was a very shy, introvert character .... please !!!!! All the most important parts of the story to be passed to the ridge end are simply not taken into account ... and the rest are !!! I think it's better to use time to either read something from a real novel or just do nothing.
