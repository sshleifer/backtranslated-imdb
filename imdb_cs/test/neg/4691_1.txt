Not many people remember "The Carey Treatment" and I can't say I blame them. Blake Edwards did this during his lean years (ie among the "Pink Panther" movies.) And the story of a doctor who became a detective (Coburn) trying to solve his hospital murder is actually quite forgettable. Coburn is as reliable as ever and O'Neill is beautiful, as always something is missing in driving. The stories of twists and turns are not too entangled, and even the peak that is to be nerve-wracking is instead gut hail. Missed opportunity totally and unfortunate opportunity in it because it was based on Michael Crichton's book. Well, at least Crichton doesn't write a sequel to him. <br /> <br /> One star. "Carey," Coburn.
