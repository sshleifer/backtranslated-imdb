The film is powerful as a political statement on extraordinary rendition, torture and the policy of war on terror. Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the film. My review may contain spoilers, so if you haven't seen a movie, you may not want to read it outside this point. This movie contains several questions. First, was the protagonist guilty or not? There is no satisfactory explanation as to why the NSA decided to pick it up and take it first. Is there an innocent explanation of why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist? If there is, the movie doesn't seem to be one and this whole movie quite dissatisfied with me. It is good and good to make a statement as to whether torture is right or wrong, but first I prove that they tortured the wrong person, and then we take it to the next step. If the protagonist was guilty, then what was achieved by dismissing him? Perhaps we have been well trained to resist to some extent and then pretend to disintegrate and provide answers that can be proven wrong with little research, leading to torturers believing that they tortured an innocent person to confess. without guilt. But there is nothing in the film to prove that he is guilty. Various other free ends are as follows: 1. So the unexpected CIA agent released him and flew back home. What prevents the NSA from picking it up again? Little publicity in the Washington Post? Please give me the break ... If a senator doesn't want to put his neck on the line to hit his name, what does Corinne Whitman have to worry about? 2. If the NSA monitors what phone numbers are called by whom, why couldn't they listen to some of the calls to see if something is under control? 3. The story is just as stupid. Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would do his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line, not the one that could be traced back to him and his house. The whole film revolves around tugging on the audience strings by displaying graphic and gratuitous torture scenes. But when you think about it more deeply, there is nothing essential in this movie, just a lot of unanswered questions and the feeling of "what is it?" at the end of the movie.
