It's hard to say how bad this film is. Even in the fifties, when the intellectual search for the meaning of life was a fashion and beatnik rejection of physical comfort, clean clothes, hairstyles, etc., It was a common response to the middle-class smug morals in both the US and Western Europe. they were stinking. The storyline is mishmash several dei ex machina (if it is correct Latin grammar); acting consists of dead looks shattered by occasional hysterics (male leadership as well as females); a gratuitous look at breasts by Catherine Deneuve (or someone) is worthy of Budweiser commercial advertising; the repeated test of the cascade orchestra in an abandoned building is certainly difficult with the meaning of the director's mind, but for me there is just one other stupid symbol that is thrown into this nonsensical film - I brag, because my time has been wasted by watching this fraud apology for flic art. The scenery is beautiful and the sex scene is hot - but under his clothes this king has no essence.
