Henry (Don Ameche) appears at the entrance to hell and tells his life story of His Excellency (Laird Cregar). The story focuses on his life-long relationships with women, and especially his relationship with Martha (Gene Tierney). At the end of the film, we returned to Henry and His Excellency for a very predictable end. Unfortunately, there is nothing more about film because nothing is happening. His sentimental story about the life of one man and his very boring. I watched it with my girlfriend and my father and we all thought that despite Lubitsch's touch it was waste. I yawned more than 15 times. Hugo (Charles Coburn) is good when he is on the screen as a grandfather, and there were a few funny moments of dialogue. The color made him a great show, but it wasn't enough to save this helicopter from going to the thrown pile. In the same form as "His amazing world" and "You can't take it with you", and so, it's no wonder he was nominated for an Oscar. A story about ordinary people, none of which is interesting and has no story. Boring, sentimental and biggest wet hum of the end that I remember ...
