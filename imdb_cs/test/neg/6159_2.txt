This movie was weird mainly because the story was so incoherent. The title refers to a vicious wind that makes the Earth's surface almost uninhabitable when it blows, but it seemed to have nothing to do with what was happening. The film seems to be an extremely poor rip-off Bladerunner ie android rover to be chased by a bounty hunter (or a ruthless cop in this). Luke Skywalker turns in a surprisingly good performance as the aforementioned vagrant. Nothing is resolved at the end of the movie, we will never find out anything about Android or its intentions. There is one miserable scene where Bill Paxton (who hijacked the android) plays one particular song in his cardboard plane for no particular reason (the song is called "The Shape of Things", Yardbirds). This happens again in a later scene where the same song is played for no apparent reason. Does this song have any meaning for the movie? Don't think about it.
