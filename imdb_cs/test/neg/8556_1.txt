How can one of you call this propaganda a family movie. This is nothing but a computer, insensitive insult to small city believers. The film depicts a woman as a great white savior of a small midwestern city, and all the others in the city (mostly men) are merely damasks in need, unable to honor themselves, and rely on the main sign for redemption. This film is just some kind of love affair that a producer has with some undisciplined, arrogant, flashy little spray that expects viewers to admire. The person who made this film probably spent all his life in a church that was sensitive to seekers, and had the freedom to put garbage to small church members like madmen and not most. The same people who give money to the Salvation Army for Christmas collect gifts to help missionaries, the poor and the homeless, singing, fellow citizens and friends. What's wrong with this humble group that offends these self-righteous traitors? Most Christians in this world would go before the train and give their lives to all those in trouble, even if they disagree with them. Most Christians would not mind if a pastor or some church worker of any church took a coat (or outer shirt). She will not condemn her. This movie is ridiculous!
