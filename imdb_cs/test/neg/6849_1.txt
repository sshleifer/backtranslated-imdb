To really appreciate this movie, did you have to be there (acting?) Or are you a crew member. Yes, I am "Selena" and in a mature age of 42 I have serious doubts about what we did / did. It all started to be like "John Waters", friends who played badly in bad movies. Somewhere along the line, the fun broke, the people who were supposed to be friends were no longer talking, and BAD was getting worse. <br /> <br /> I regret the bad image I could project. Size One Golden Spandex Pants,) <br /> <br /> In addition, SUCKS movie so badly, I wouldn't even do mom watch it. <br /> <br /> To my director, cast and crew I say, <br /> <br /> "Why can't we all get it? <br /> <br /> It's been over twenty years, people !! !!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!
