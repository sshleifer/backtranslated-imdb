The recent Errol Flynn Adventure is a detailed look at the Ultimate Hollywood Hero. Bogart, Cagney, Wayne and the like were basically blue-collar screens, but Flynn was the aristocrat in his style and manner, the younger son carved his own belief for sword, thunder and romance that ironically found If he wasn't in a contract with Warner Bros. would be perfect in the role of Cary Grant in Suspicion: a good looking charmer whose 1000 watt smile blinds one to being a predator. And he could play with his best leading lady sister Joan Fontaine. That was Flynn's problem that was the Ultimate Screen Hero until his own habits and bad timing caught him. Grant and Flynn are in a way similar, but Flynn was the more macho of both, Grant can be seen as Captain Blood, but Flynn in the Philadelphia Story Mr. Blanding builds his Dream House, or Monkey Business, or Operation Petticoat would 'Turn these roles their collective ears, because he's too damn sure about his feet, and the sexual tension he would naturally bring would be horrible. But this inquisitive biography is just a plasticized look at Flynn and his era. There are times when I was half expecting laughter track or audience to go "Ahhh" at some point. It doesn't go deep in Flynn's life, just a view of the screen. It also does not delve into its fight to be considered more than a derring-doer. Just like the cleaned biographies of Lon Chaney (father, not Wolfman, or Lenny's "Mouse and Men) and Buster Keaton made in the 1950s, it's just a time to kill a piece of fluff
