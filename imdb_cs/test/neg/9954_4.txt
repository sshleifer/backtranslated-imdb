Pretty bad cheapc cheap, which I rarely bothered to watch again, and no wonder - it's slow and creaking and boring like a butter knife. Mad Doctor George Zucco is on it again, turning the shabby farm in Glenn Strange into a wolf man. Unfortunately, make-up is virtually non-existent, consisting only of beards and dimestore fangs for the most part. If it wasn't for the presence of Zucco and Strange, along with cute Anna Nagel, it would be totally unnoticeable. Strange who would continue to play Frankenstein's monster for Unuiversal in two years looks like Lenny from "Mouse and Men", it seems. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 (out of four)
