The cult begins twenty years ago on the 'Quinling Mountain Range, Southern China' because a man named Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) found that an ancient amulet says he has magical powers abbreviated to California, where Quinlin created a cult and members are about to sacrifice himself when one of them (Cazzy Golomb) angry with his evil scheme ... Jump forward to the present as five college students, Mindy (Rachel Miner), Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alex (Joel) Michaels & Morgan (Victoria Venegas) explores the events twenty years ago that became known as "Quinling Massacre" for a school project. Unfortunately, Morgan decided to kill himself, which launches the evil spirit of Owen Quinlin for reasons that are somewhat unclear, trying to finish what began all these years before claiming the soul to finally inherit the magical powers of the amulet for its own evil use ... <br /> <br /> Edited, co-produced and director Joe Knee is not a good movie and that is kind to him. Benjamin Oren's scenario, which seems to be taken very seriously, is a dreadful supernatural story about a cult leader returning from the dead to finish what he started a few years earlier, as you would expect the character to be related to that What happened all these years and it is as boring as it sounds. The character is incredible and forgotten, the dialogue as well as there is no horror or exploitation, it's a slow time sometimes, it's predictable, it's a clich√©, at the end it goes completely out of college and doesn't make much sense when you think about it. The story never catches your eye or interest, it's never exciting or particularly interesting. There is very little that I can recommend to Cult, don't bother with this. Director Knee is doing fine, but the movie has that anxious video shot made for television is a totally memorable and flat thing all the time. There is no fear, no atmosphere and no tension. There is no gore one, surely there is a fair amount of blood splatter, but no proper real gore makeup special effect. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 950,000, Cult looks cheap, though it's not as badly done as some low budget horror movies I've seen recently. Playing is not even worth mentioning. Cult is a bad movie that didn't do anything for me, I'd try to call that average. There are much better horror movies.
