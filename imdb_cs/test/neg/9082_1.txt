It's hard to believe that there are some people in the world who really think it's a worthy vehicle for Charles Bronson. Bronson is a good actor who can do more than pull a gun and knock down the bad guys. He was quietly moving in the television movie "Yes Virginia, There's Santa Claus" and showed a lot of class and style in Sean Penn-directed "The Indian Runner". In "The Evil That Men Do," however, Bronson again plays a character who sees injustice and sets it right with his fists, knives and, of course, weapons. five movies "Death of Wish". <br /> <br /> Wait, I'll take it back This must be the saddest and repellent violent movie Bronson ever had when he was on duty. or descriptions of torture, but in the fact that these scenes have been put into the movie just to sell tickets, and Jose Ferrer! What does he do here in blue flames ?! Okay, I'm sorry for the blast, let me say that "The Evil That Men Do" has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen and was based on a book. if it was written with bronson in mind? <br /> <br /> No stars. Watch "Wish Wish" instead.
