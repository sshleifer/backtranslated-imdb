Something special is happening in remote areas of the Arctic. The Air Force weather station is in ruins, its inhabitants are missing. Eskimo village is destroyed. The fishing vessel disappears. Curious spoons are in the snow. A four-meter piece of living organism is located near the destroyed aircraft. The piece looks like half the claws of a giant Alaskan crab. The Army (Craig Stevens as an Air Force Officer) and her experts are confused. A prominent scientist (William Hopper) and his handsome assistant (Alix Taltan) are called from New York. Hopper concludes from this poor evidence that they are dealing with a monstrous mantis. He's right. A nice assistant looks out of the office window and sees a nasty face with bulging eye eyes staring at her. She drops what she is wearing, clapping her hands on her cheeks and screaming in horror. overturn buses and eat people. Military weapons do not affect that much, but in the end, Stevens plunges into a combat fighter and mortally damages the beast that comes to the ground and occupies the "Manhattan Tunnel" connecting New York and New Jersey. Stevens, who has survived the collision, leads his team into the tunnel and kills a big mistake with "3RG mines" despite his wild looks, threatening behavior and terrible roar. Stevens and Taltan kiss in front of the body while Hopper laughs and takes their picture. gasping for air, falling around, searching for human beings as his prey, but nothing in the way of new or original thoughts. As it is, they overlooked one clich√©. Hopper should hastily devise a Super Duper DDT that could defeat the insects themselves. This is what 3RG mines should be filled with rather than ordinary explosives. Modeling is pretty good, considering what the budget was supposed to be. Not much money could be spent on anything else, because everything else is routine. Craig Stevens is bland, face and style made for the TV series. William Hopper looks right - tall and silver hair - but his tool only has one comment. A pretty assistant is rather simple, considering her role. Part calls Joan Weldon or Laurie Nelson. They could not act, but carried light but clear indications of harassment. Anything would help this messy movie. I wish the deadly mantis wasn't so loud and so often roared because you can't roar - you can't even whisper - if you don't have lungs. It didn't bother me when the monster encountered his demise in the tunnel. Praying Mantis is an elegant graceful insect and it's great to have them in the garden because they eat caterpillars and what not. But when you get it, they're not really attractive. The male mantis is smaller and weaker than the female, as in humans, and when a pair of copiers are in the female, the female bites the man's head, just like humans. But at least human men know when to stop. A male mantis holds for a few minutes, even though he is now without a head. We humans do not have a mindless male copulating with target women. Doing?
