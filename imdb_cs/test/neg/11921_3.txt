They started watching, but they didn't believe in any of the characters. Especially the relationship between the baker's assistant and the waitress didn't work for me at all. The scenes between the owner of the bakery and the assistant were nice, but the rest was very slow. It was a very superficial film that gave me the feeling that I was looking at the game rather than the film. The characters were very 'stagey' and the plot was much like a farce scene. Before the pyromaniak turned to the assistant, I was bored and didn't care what happened next, so I turned off. I'm glad I didn't pay it. He did not laugh or smile once. Americans seem to have a particular tendency to classify their films as "comedies" when they are funny, rather than funny. Finally, I learned to avoid what Americans call dark comedies that usually seem scary and rude. Now it looks like I'm going to have to be a little more challenging when they also say film romantic comedy. Maybe comedy means something different when it is applied to a movie, rather than a show in America. I don't understand why America can produce amazingly funny comedies, like two and a half men, Will and Grace, King of Queens, but can't create really fun movies without resorting to toilet humor. This film wasn't rough or anything. But it was nothing at all, just one big yawn ...
