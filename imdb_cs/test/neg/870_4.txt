Every great romantic comedy needs a contradiction between romantic guidance that could cause tension, expectation, and conspiracy. This story is quite flat in this area. There is no conflict - at least none that would prevent the eventual joining of the two leaders, and so the tension is tense, there is no expectation, and there is really no attraction at all. Chemistry between Richard Gere and Diane Lane represents friendship in the best case, and with the talent of these two actors I was quite surprised. During the movie I expected to play more ladies and talk about the weather than to see moving passion. Although I am a fan of both actors, I believe that casting this movie was turned off - or perhaps it was off the base and influenced their deliveries. Writing was very weak, which could have affected the performance; The scenario could certainly use some help from some Harlequin authors who have a real experience of putting warmth into romance. This movie may be worthy of watching on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but only after it's cheap shelves. <br /> <br /> (Sorry Diane Ladd and Richard Gere).
