"Shuttle" was / was more than a boring movie that had an interesting start, but after half an hour it ended in the worst imaginable way I could imagine. This film has lost its story if you can call it a story? ... after half an hour. All other scenes are totally inappropriate. The driver is some superman because he will survive every gun-knife attack, etc. He could put it in a box even after a stab in his leg. But what a coincidence that there was a box in the garage. I really felt sick and confused when the movie was over. If the story was much better, it might be so great. In my opinion, even a child would do a better story. And why send a girl with water and food. I stopped counting holes about the area about in the middle. And when the film reached its almost admirably ill above-average finale, I completely gave up (better to say "throwing"). The worst thing about Shuttle is actually that it can't get any worse. writer / director Anderson will learn from this lesson and next time he will give us a decent thriller, I think the better he moves to another genre, I keep my fingers crossed, but from now on I will read a commentary on his future films. first before we look.
