This movie was on HBO yesterday so I watched it. That was a mistake. I think I was sucked in and still watched, even though it was a lot like a train wreck, terrible, terrible, but somehow it just can't be broken. shaudenfraud I think! ; ). This is the story of model taking on an island in the Caribbean. One by one, everyone is murdered. One drink cleans the liquid, one is thrown on the waverunner, one goes over the cliff ... so it's not an accident, but for some intangible reason the police never say and nobody thinks they should "pack" the shoot and go home, not just with regard to the dead, but perhaps for fear of their own lives. No. They just keep shooting because it's the most important thing. Forget dead models, we have a production magazine! One of the subplots is the owner of Evil magazine, played by Lee Majors, Rex is his name. It's the most obvious suspect, and every time a model kills, twists a mustache and says "well, I can't say it's not going to be for sale", mooo hoo hoo hoo ha ha ha ha ". Another subplot is when it is discovered that Rex is one of the baby dady models, only when he learned about the child he tried to persuade the girl to break. Trying to give you false traces and pointing to someone named Raule, apparently because he is the only one with an accent and "looks scary". At the very end, but this movie came out years ago, so if you haven't seen it yet ... one of the women was found face down dead in the pool. That was the last straw !!!! the name comes to Rex with a gun, they fight, they fire a gun and now she's dead too !!! While she is lying on the floor, his business partner tells him that with all the bad pressures the magazine will be worthy of ss and it's all his fault. He gets him to sign a magazine for him. Once it will do voila! All dead models will return to life and you will find that the whole thing was complicated with ruse to return to Rex. <br /> <br /> Oy! What a ridiculous film. Someone else said; If you want to see something like this April Fools Day, it's much better!
