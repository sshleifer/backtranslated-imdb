I didn't like watching the DS9 compared to other Star Trek and Enterprise, but I didn't like Babylon 5 and now I know why. It's the same show. I just read the old news that Paramount stole the idea from Babylon 5's creator, but they decided not to sue because I didn't know or worry, but when I see Star Trek based on another, even non-Dire, show, To do this, I have to condemn anyone who mentions DS9 when talking about the series. Original, TNG and Voyager are my favorite in this order. Before I understood why everyone thinks DS9 is great and I don't, but I know I know. It is also because the captain has a real anger problem, and I hate people who act fine, but a madman, except not; and it seems in every episode.
