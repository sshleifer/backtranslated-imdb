That was painful! Recently distributed as a free DVD with a British newspaper, a British-Belgian coproduction of 1977 (it could fool me, it looks ten years older than it at least), it is deservingly obscure and if you do it for half -our mark, consider yourself for a slave. The combination of animation and live action is at best laic and, at worst, totally scary, wondering why it was decided to try this movie in this way, even if it wasn't really technology. Harris is nothing more than human support and animation is some of the most flat and lifeless I have seen, with mandatory "trippy" moments (especially where it is a Subtracto-like brain-brain character animation) that has made countless caricatures . features from the late 1960s onwards. Don Black provides a convincing argument for a usually resilient lyricist to stick to what he does best, and the pace is so slow that even the young are bored. As for adults, keep Jonathan Swift's original novel.
