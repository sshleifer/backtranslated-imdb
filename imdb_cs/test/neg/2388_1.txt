Four boys (Jacks) go to the restaurant with the fifth guy and lose all common sense. They make it worse than textile workers at the turn of the century without simply abandoning the situation. This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I just hope I can sell this item to someone who might like it. It is true that you will be interested if you do not get tired of the illogical development of the plot. It's very stupid all over the world, especially when someone enters a restaurant. Who is it? Guess. <br /> <br />
