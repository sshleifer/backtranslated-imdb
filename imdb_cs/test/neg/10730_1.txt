There is no "fun" that would be in a desperate situation of illegal immigrants! Or the desperate situation of shopkeeper heads, it matters! That richer-than-god Brian Glazer didn't see the irony that "heroes" do exactly what a villain does - make honest, hardworking people their life savings - not surprising me! How do you think he must be richer than God? In this supposed satire of greed, these mental dwarfs reveal their own hypocrisy: McMansiony, McToys, McChildren, McIllegals who are paid peanuts to take care of McMansions, McToys and McChildren! But the main problem (except rebellious fanaticism) is the assumption: as a former executive director of the now infamous company, Dick would be the Big Scalp for every corporate headhunter in the country! No soup for him! And raking in high six-digit numbers you think wouldn't be caught around the Gore / Lieberman poster!
