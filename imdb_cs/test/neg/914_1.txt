About Dear God I have suffered having to watch this movie forty times in my sister's house and it was a terrible story about sex and arms and very cheap inexplicable gambling if you're not on the challenge to watch it avoid Ja rule just proved it can't act Ving Rhames also gave the most terrible acting ever in any of his films there was no part of this movie made me laugh or make me jump or feel any emotions I'd be surprised by people actually liked it that seemed to some scary movies in but it would be in my five worst movies at all the music wasn't good in it and the story I think was made up of a couple of guys who ordered pizza and just sat down ten bullets and then totally horrible in the movie
