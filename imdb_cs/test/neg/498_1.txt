Critics love this movie. Personally, I found that it was senseless and tasteless. This is the millionth time I got into "critics who love it" traps and came out wishing someone threw boiling hot water on my testicles because it was less painful than watching a movie. There are many scenes that are totally useless. Warning for Animal Lovers: You do not see this movie if you do not want to see sheep killed and molested. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Asian movie, see Africa. If you want to see a movie about escaped convicts, see Gene Wilder / Richard Pryor classic Stir Crazy. Avoid 9 Soul as a Plague.
