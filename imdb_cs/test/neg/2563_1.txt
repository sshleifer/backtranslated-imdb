Steven Seagal has played in many action movies. Most of them were bad, but not bad as Patriot. This is a low budget Z-series movie. After Operation Delta Force, Act of War, Sub 2, Plato's Run, Base, Drive, Sabotage, etc. Patriot comes. Now Steven Seagal is certainly considered to be an evil actor like Mark Dacascos, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Treat Williams, Jack Scalia, Gary Busey, Chuck Norris, Michael Madsen and many others. The scenario was full of holes and the characters were not realistic (perhaps due to very bad actors) and the $ 4.25 you spend renting Patriot is called Lost Money !!! I'll give it 0 and a half (for laughter) of 5.
