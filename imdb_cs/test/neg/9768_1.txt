This movie is absolutely awful! I thought it had good actors like Gabrielle Union, Hill Harper and of course the infamous Billy D. Williams. The film is long, and stretches with a documentary style showing Gabrielle Union, who died in the film, talking about her family; which is, by the way, a confusing family because you never know who is who and who is related to whom. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, and I wish I took it back to where I got it. From time to time I fell asleep because of boredom. Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It could have been a more true life with more drama and less boredom.
