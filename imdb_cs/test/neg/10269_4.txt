Typically sophisticated production of HBO with first-class casting, rich atmosphere of a small town and nice narrative labels decorated with above-average production values. But it is a huge "but", a variety of subplots, populated by some sympathetic, mostly annoying cartoons, are paper thin and go in blunt sections for more than three long hours. Often a silly story moves between the melodrama without being funny. enough, and personal drama without being deep at all. <br /> <br /> Too bad because some scenes are really shining. Two or three, that's it. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10 grubby Paul Newmans
