My age: 13 <br /> <br /> James Cole, played by Steven Seagal, is sent to help Detective Jim Campbell, who plays Keenen Ivory Wayans, solve a series of murders in which victims are crucified. Since Cole arrived on the spot, he noticed that the murders had changed a bit and thought there was another murderer. This becomes personal when his ex-wife is murdered and Campbell finds fingerprints on his body. Campbell explores the mysterious Cole and learns of a very shady past. I'm not a Steven Seagal fan. I like action movies, but it's the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is not very fun to watch at all, incredibly stupid, and of course, Steven Seagal's acting performance is terrible. However, Keenen Ivory Wayans is not very bad. The only redeeming thing in this movie is the occasional good action scene, though most of them come because of madly stupid reasons. The plot in this film is absolutely crazy. I didn't care. The whole "flash" of Seagal's character was stupid, all the Mafia fights and restaurant fights were almost no reason. Give this movie to Miss. Australian Classification: MA 15+: High Level Violence <br /> <br /> Rating: 35 of 100 (generous)
