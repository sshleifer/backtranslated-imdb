I think the problem with some of the responses to this film is that - with a few exceptions - it does not focus on the main disconnection, that is, the main split in the audience. <br /> <br /> On the one hand, there are those who are impressed by the visual design, the nice costumes and the various elements that enter the film. Some child movie fans love color and animation, and all the un-scary 'magic' effects, shapeshifting animals, and so on. Some cult vultures as complicated references, layering different folklore elements, and the fact that they can follow the singing of Zhang Ziyi and quasi-miming, in two different languages, in fact, which was to be a children's comedy. On the other hand, there are people who say that a children's film should still have something that a mixture of folktals is not a story at all, and that it is easier to believe in magic when it has enough ideas and care for technical aspects to make it look real. In other words, ideas could be beautiful; but when you put them on stage, they have to add it. Here, they don't. Good folktale - from every country - has a clear story, point, and characters that communicate strongly with each other. They miss them all. Several revised gestures for opera, western and Japanese are not a substitute for a solid theme. As a fantasy fan, I have to say that I was sitting over some turkeys and loved a couple, but this is really trying to do too many things - cheap. Putting in Zhang Ziyi try to add a little glitter smack of exotic flower syndrome. Another problem is not that there is no conspiracy; half of the plot, which means that you are still getting in, then sinking again, because the next not too sharp dance number starts. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to know that they're starting to play in the movie. If you don't like other people's amateur video, it's not good. I'd like to test it on real kids; I think they would throw him in a heaven rebellion after about 20 minutes.
