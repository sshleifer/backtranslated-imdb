This film tries his darndest to capture that classic bad Canadian movie feeling: <br /> <br /> "weird" and annoying characters (several); "strange" city with "unpredictable" people; "Bizarre" cafe or restaurant (cafe); lots of Canadian stuff for postcards (oceanic stuff here); a lot of mention of "must get out of this city"; downright booooring. And that will succeed in all numbers. Something to note. I couldn't figure out whether this film was just trying to be a post-northern exposition of "unpredictable" comedy or something surrealistic, like drug or psychotic hallucinations. Editing this movie jumped absurdly from one unrelated matter to another with zero stimulation or motivation. Not to mention that we didn't even know where we were jumping for half the time. Take, for example, introductory images, screaming teens in the car. Who are they and what h - have anything to do with anything? And this sub-uh - fence (use the word plot freely) by children that seem to span a generation. I don't think they actually do it, but editing seems to be materializing out of the flashback, all the time. Huh? What am I missing? <br /> <br /> Avoid. Unless for laughter. Or, try and skip unavailable edits.
