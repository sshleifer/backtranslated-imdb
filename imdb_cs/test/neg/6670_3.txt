When I write it, Norman Wisdom is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours giggling and roaring old phrases at his ever more suicidal sister. Indeed, they are likely to join others and obituaries will record an almost 80 year old career of hysterical merriment-making of a cute funster with a crooked plaid cap. What most of these obituaries will not resemble is how Norman Wisdom committed some form of suicide with this tremendously poor but strangely impressive skill for his film career in the late 1960s. <br /> <br /> The signs are ominous from off ??? "Tony Tenser Presents" Go Titles. Did he scratch his head? "Where did I see the name before?" Well, take your choices on the titles of many of the cheapest, most beautiful British 70's movies. Then it says ?? "Menahem Golan Production". Oh, dear. From what I have done is the combination of Confessions from the Holiday Camp and Last Tango in Paris. Sponsored by Southport Tourist Board. Norman Wisdom is very versatile in that Norman Wisdom (or variations of that) here. Even in such a garbage he never touches and in some way follows you by watching torn fingers. Tony Tenser and Menahem Golan were among them responsible for some real movie horrors, but the bedroom scene in the film rebirth atrocity. By the way, Sally plays the role of a lobotomized sex toy, by the way. I wonder if any of the crazy young cats that set up the parties of this movie might think in a quiet moment of "Umm?" "Old Norman + sex + hippies. I think it was a paycheck for them. I'm sorry for The Pretty Things. They probably thought, "Yeah! This will do what Blow Up did for Yardbirds" <br /> <br /> And so old Norman's leading career is over. Freezing Small Balls in Southport. Once I went there. It was a depressing place.
