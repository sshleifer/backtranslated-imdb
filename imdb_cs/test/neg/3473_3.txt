"Nero" as the film's title in Germany is another attempt to show one of the most interesting Roman emperors, Lucius Domitius of Ahenobarbus, better known as Nero. Although this attempt at least tried to show the historically more accurate Nero than the fun, but completely fictional Nero Peter Ustinov played in "Quo Vadis!" it is still a major failure. And to those IMDb commentators who still believe that Sueton and Tacitus propaganda are true, please read the Nero book that was published less than 20 years ago. Nero didn't burn Rome, that's proven! He didn't kill Britannicus. He did not torture, kill and maim for pleasure, he was the first emperor who BANNED gladiator fights. The film still shows a lot of mistakes, mistakes, and by the way it's really cheap, especially the files were cheap and unconvincing, the palace looked like a villa, the city itself looked like a cheap set. The play was between good and subpar, the music almost negligible and the film soon deteriorated after Nero became the emperor of a rushed, poorly modified mess without a clear narrative structure. There is still potential for the epic biography of Nero, which shows the true Nero, who was one of the best emperors who ruled Rome, despite the lie of Sueton et al.
