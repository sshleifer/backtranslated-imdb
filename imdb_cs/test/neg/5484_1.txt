Remember when Rick Mercer was funny? 22 minutes was a great show when Rick Mercer was on it and Made In Canada was one big show. Talking to Americans was so fun. But like my friend, he said, "Rick Mercer woke up one day and wasn't fun anymore" I think that day was when Rick Mercer Report went in the air. What is the purpose of this show? Rick Mercer reads crazy, fake subtitles, displays pictures of bad shelters where people send mail, and then spends about 20 minutes of a 30-minute show they go somewhere, and just talks to people hoping to say something funny or clever to get on TV and maybe even somebody laughed somewhere. We should be interested in seeing Rick Mercer to visit the gymnastics team and then try to do some of their moves, then suck it deliberately while desperately trying to be "funny". Rick Mercer grew old or just lost interest, or just not funny. Even his classic rant bits lost all his bite and humor. Can you say that about CBC comedy in general though, because how many years to keep Air Farce on TV deliver the same kinds of useless jokes?
