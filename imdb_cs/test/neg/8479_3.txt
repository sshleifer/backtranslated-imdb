This movie is not worth going to the theaters to watch, I did and didn't like, the effects on the movie are really well done, and you get a laugh here and there, but the story is really bad, it seemed they would run out of ideas and what is it with elbow and odin, how do they get? that it totally destroys the burrowing mythology, and I think they have forgotten that Loki's forces only worked at night! If you really have to see this movie rent out when it comes out, don't go to the movies for it! They could do a lot more with it than they did, it was as if he just wanted to make a movie to show cool animation and effects
