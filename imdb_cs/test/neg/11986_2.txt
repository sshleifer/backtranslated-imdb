I really liked Far Cry, nice graphics, good level of design, interesting and clever enemies, above average length and even some decent plot. I'm not by default against spin-off games. I thought "DOOM The Movie" was fun. But what Uwe Boll did is take a game and modify each of her good aspects and turn them into something terrible (not in length, the movie runs only mercifully 90 minutes) Characters are even more stereotypical than in the movie game, which is quite a success. The whole plot is told without any twists or mysteries. Several ruthlessly ridiculous scenes tell you every story. And come "Genetically Modified Soldiers"? they could come up with some better name. However, this movie should get some award for the most idiotic love scene. I've never seen anything like it before. I couldn't believe he was trying to be serious, "we gotta get out of the wet clothes" "I think I can get a cold" (even if everyone wears t-shirts) "We have to pamper each other for body heat" "Is that your gun?" But ... but ... weren't there people who knowingly did that? There must be a screenwriter, director, actors, gaffer, electrician, some food! Why didn't anyone jump to the scene to stop this evil? Was this film made by devastating, inhuman, genetically modified movie people? I'm not going to start bragging about how many logical errors, inconsistencies, and shortcomings in script writing there were, but even a tough action fan can't be anything but insults. In fact, he asked for a rating of 2 out of 10, so I'll do it for it. But that allows me to explain where the second star comes from. Special effects? No. Acting? Not really. Game links? You wish. Wait! used the game font for the title and credits. That was elegant. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a movie for a bad movie night, go to "2012 - Supernova", this is just sad.
