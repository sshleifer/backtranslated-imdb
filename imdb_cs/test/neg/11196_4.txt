The summary was promising, but watching the movie was a huge disappointment. Nothing happens in this movie. Land is linear and without surprise. Normal characters remain normal until the end of the movie, strange characters remain strange until the end of the movie. There is no one attempt to prevent the viewer from thinking that someone other than the most obvious candidate is bad. The positive thing is that the actors play quite well and there is a bit of atmosphere in the movie, but too little to be significant. <br /> <br /> People who vote for this film 10 see or are members of the film production team! 4 is well paid.
