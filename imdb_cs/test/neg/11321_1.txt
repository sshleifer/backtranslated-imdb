I like good news. No, I'll take it back. I like good news. In contrast, GGROBAR totally despises and from the first note I've ever heard. When I found out that someone had made a cartoon on it, my head almost exploded. Now that I've seen it because the kids begged me, I wish my head would explode. That would save me from the unbearable misery that was cr @ pfest. First of all, making an hourly show based on a three-minute novelty song is a ridiculous idea. It is even more ridiculous to stretch such a song that had to fall like a fool just as long as an hour. It was badly written, cheaply animated, misbehaved ... the list goes on and on. Dear God, it's still bad.
