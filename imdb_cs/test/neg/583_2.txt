OUR GANG HAS GIVEN A CHANCE FOR A FULL FILM IN HIS 22 YEARS, AND IT WAS THE BEST WHAT YOU CAN DO? It is boring, forced and meaningless and I have to respectfully disagree with another poster on this film; LITTLE RASCALS remake of 1994 was better than this. Almost everything is. Children are subject to civil war management; he does not feel like a film OUR GANG at all, but as a humorous second-rate clone of Shirley Temple.
