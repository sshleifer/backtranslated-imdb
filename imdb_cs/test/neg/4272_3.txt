I always try to be cruel and criticize something I don't like, but after watching this mini-series I was so disappointed that I couldn't help my irritation. On the one hand, it is true that the series remained faithful to the novel and of course I found it very nice, but on the other hand terrible casting, bad behavior, especially key figures? Like Funny Price, the impression of a play, I mean the theatrical way of acting you irritating from start to finish. I'm sure with this budget, even if it was low, something much better and more useful could be done. It is up to you to look at this series, but I personally do not recommend you to spend time on this unsatisfactory ecosystem.
