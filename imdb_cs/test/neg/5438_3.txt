"Congo" is based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel, which I thought was lacking Crichton's usual charm, clever characters and strike. Well, I'm sorry, but the same goes for the movie. Here is a conspiracy: <br /> <br /> Greed is bad, this simple moral story warns. Megalomaniacal C.E.O. (Joe Don Baker) sends his son to a dangerous African Congo to search for a source of diamonds that are large enough and clean enough to function as a powerful laser transmitter (or are they laser weapons?). Laura Linney, a former CIA operative agency and computer magician, is sent to them when they lose contact with their son and team. On her way, she is accompanied by gee-whiz aids and several eccentric figures (including a mercenary (Ernie Hudson), a researcher with a talking gorilla (Dylan Walsh), and aa nutty-type Indiana-Jones seeking Tim Curry after several narrow leaks from surface rockets and air and some African wildlife, they all find that often the most we want is the source of our fall. <br /> <br /> The actors in this film were not talented, Dylan Walsh acts like a poor crybaby , especially at the end, Ernie Hudson is unconvincing (no wonder he was going to play in TV movies?) and Laura Linney is nothing special, saying safely that the only talented actors in this movie had very small roles: Joe Don Baker and Tim Curry always an entertaining actor (though sometimes he got married by constantly reminding him of "Rocky Horror Picture" days). <br /> <Br /> This movie also had some more there are problems, including the horrible direction of style, cheese dialogue and a just-boring plot that has been completely hashed compared to Crichton's novel. Even Stan Winston's creature effects could save this film from catastrophe. I am deeply disappointed with this film; She couldn't even bathe. It was just horrible, raw, boring and ridiculous, and it turned out to be one of Crichton's worst film books. <br /> <br /> 2/5 stars - John Ulmer
