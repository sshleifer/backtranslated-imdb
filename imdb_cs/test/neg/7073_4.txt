Tamara Teenager (Jenna Dewan) has it rude. She is mocking all the popular "kids" for being shy, book, tasteless and because of her interest in witchcraft. All the footballers and cheerleaders are particularly angry with her for writing an article on steroid abuse for a school newspaper. In addition, her father is a drunk, her mother is not around and she is secretly in love with her English support teacher (Matthew Marsden). Popular children based a cruel joke to humiliate her, accidentally kill her during the fight, bury the body in the forest and make a pact to keep quiet. To their shock the next day, Tamara goes back to the classroom and looks seductive and, uh, dressed for killing. Yeah, back from the dead and ready for supernatural revenge against everyone involved. She also takes the time to take her sexual abuse pop eating a beer bottle and trying to seduce her English teacher from her wife (Claudette Mink), a school counselor. Negotiations and writing are strictly average. You can also tell people who are responsible for seeing such movies as CARRIE (1976), HELLO MARY LOU: PROM NIGHT II (1987) and THE CRAFT (1996) as they borrow wholesale from all three outstanding films. There's a blow (a guy who cut off his ear and tongue and then stabs the eyeball, which is probably the best), an ugly scene of vomiting and a couple campy / funny monochrome. It is not a scary movie in any way, but it has not been too original.
