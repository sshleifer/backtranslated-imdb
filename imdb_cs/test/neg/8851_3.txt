I saw this movie because every review I read says it was one of the scariest films of the new millennium. I don't really understand what the hype is about. First, the dialogue in this film was ridiculously bad ("What if something special happens?" ... what?). Nor did acting socks throw me away. It could have been because the script barely gave the actors anything to do with .... the characters are purely 2-dimensional to me, and I didn't even tell them about them. Another thing is that the movie is very boring. Very. Sure, here and there are a few "shakes," but for the 112-minute length of the movie, it certainly didn't take time to be wise. Most of the film contains characters talking about things that had nothing to do with the plot. What was the meaning of that? <br /> <br /> To begin with, the film doesn't make sense. Yes, I believe I have understood the intentions of the ghosts, but as it fits into the events that actually occur in the film, it is beyond me. Also, much of the film is played in small medallions, which makes the story difficult to watch occasionally. And don't even start with me. What exactly happened there? <br /> <br /> I can give Kurosawa credit for placing some scary images throughout the movie. There are very scary shots of ghosts and other disturbing images. If they were more involved in these paintings and processed on them, the film would be much stronger. But they didn't, and instead worked out more about social commentary that was interesting, but again, portrayed in an extremely dull way. Yes, it's a movie news. All right, fun. I'll get a report on my rating right here in an open space: find a better way to spend your free time than watching it.
