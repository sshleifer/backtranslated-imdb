What can we say about such a pathetic film? Very bad behavior! The main actress seems to know only one facial expression: fear mixed with weakness. Like a pathetic loser ... The other actress (the one who plays evil) looks like a Ozzy Osboure pair with a terrible red wig. The other actors are so sorrowful that they are not even worth being described. <br /> <br /> - There is no graph at all. The story begins with possibilities, but goes nowhere: we know nothing about the meaning of "11:11", nor who Rayden really is, except the simple "she's evil" or "she's the Apocalypse child" ... which is not an explanation . We do not know why parents were killed, what the dangers were and why Sara was chosen. As the film goes on, we just watch pseudo-scary scenes with bad music. Moreover, the end does not say anything: we see only two options, as if one of them was a bonus scene or a director's cutout ... There is no plot, so no possible interpretation. <br /> <br /> - "11:11" is full of clich√©s! It's so obvious I couldn't laugh. For example: an abandoned library or toilet scenes, ghosts with wind, ... there is a fashionable "scary little girl" like "Dark Water" or "The Ring". The main character is, of course, bullied at school and looks like a stereotypical gothic girl (dark hair, red lips, skinny, black clothes). Is it an obligation to make it trustworthy? I do not think so. Sara's psychology is so underdeveloped and so typical that it does not make her trustworthy or pleasant. Terrible directions: as I said, nothing original, everything has been seen thousands of times and is used here without any real purpose. - There are some funny incoherence. For example, I do not know whether "spirit science", "paranormal course" or what is taught in American universities ... It is not really in Europe: teachers talk about negative energies or use "immaterial" sensors of creatures. .. ridiculous. Also: how can you watch a movie shot in the 1960s with a Super-8 camera on your computer screen without spending time clock digitizing (in a movie they watch instantly on your computer screen) And how can you zoom in on this old movie, isolate small detail and see a perfectly identifiable face? I wonder if the director ever tried to digitize an old analogous movie ... <br /> <br /> Finally, "11:11" is worth watching if you want to laugh at silly movies, or maybe if you want fall asleep on the couch ... But it's an expensive way to sleep!
