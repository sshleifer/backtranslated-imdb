Great. Another foreign film that thinks it's Fellini. In addition, we need to have more propaganda about murdering people with disabilities. I see no reason why we should be flooded with ads with a thin, hidden euthanasia. <br /> <br /> He did not object to this film. What can be a redemption of a man without courage, despite some adversity. He does not dare to commit suicide. This is a coward's action. Sharing this "desire" with his wife simply causes her the same illness she has. If it was a movie about the man's courage to go on, despite his problems, like Jill Kinmont's story, it would be a great movie. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in seeing the real courage, check out the Jill Kinmont movies, a former skier who was banned after a bad ski accident.
