Back in the dark days of 1990, he hoped-for the heir of the Spielberg throne (after the failure of the supposed moth-baby Phil Joanou) was mistakenly believed to be the flashy Spielberg wannabe David Mickey Evans. Evans managed to break through the studio for more than a million dollars, breastfeeding baby boomer managers believed that his screenplay - a combination of nostalgia, links from the sixties and a distracting drama about child abuse - somehow matched good storytelling and decent film. As Rod Stewart once sang, "See how bad you can be." But the novice artsy-fartsy, "ET" - inspired scenario convinced enough people to be the next Chosen one - the new Spielberg - and so an agreement was agreed not only to buy the script for more than 99 percent of the world's population, they will ever see in their entire lives, but also directing the film for Evans - though he never did anything in his life. Hey, how hard can it be to be the next genius doing the movie? Two weeks before filming, Columbia found out. His diaries were called "totally unusable" by the studio - or at least those who were on the same level not to fall under E.N.C. (Emperor's New Clothes) Magic. All his shots were discarded and recycled into guitar photographs. So what is the studio to do after sinking $ 10 or $ 20 million into what they believed to be the resurrection of Steven Spielberg? Hire Spielberg yourself to save your day? Apparently Columbia was trying. He entered the old for Richard Donner. Hey, it doesn't have to be a movie genius, but it gets a job. After all, "Superman" wasn't too bad - and the first "deadly weapon" was pretty good. So Donner enters and grabs the overhead reins. Fortunately, he manages to convince Columbia that the worst of the staging sequences - which would have happened as a ten-year-old sour trip - must go. Unfortunately, he leaves Crying Buffalo (ooh, as poetic) and ridiculous, pseudo-Spielberg fantasy ending, complete with clueless mom perfectly content for the rest of her life to get a postcard from her missing son as he circles the globe in his red wagon. Good. But Donner managed to get a good performance from Elijah Wood. Even Lorraine Bracco as Idiot Mom was not bad. Perhaps Donner should be reevaluated. Maybe it's not such a fake Hollywood hack as everyone has always believed. The only reason I give this overblown misfire 2 rating is that someone was smart enough to throw big John Heard (but in the wrong part of course). Children are doing well ... though Tom Hanks' horrifying, over-explanatory story almost destroys every scene he encounters. You might think that after David Mickey Evanses and Phil Joanous and Troy Duffys' studios, they could finally be wise. One might hope that these hype-driven film-debates could prevent the Emperor's new garment syndrome from ever rearing his ugly head again. <br /> <br /> Doubtful!
