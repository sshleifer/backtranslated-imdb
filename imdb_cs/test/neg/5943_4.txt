"Midnight Clear" is a great prerequisite. A group of overly educated, too bright GIs are sent by incompetent leaders on a vague mission to patrol around an isolated farm on the eve of the Bulge Battle. GI meets a group of German regular fighters and it is clear that they no longer want to fight. That's the problem. It's really simple. If the Germans want to give up, they do it and that's the end of the film. If the Germans want to fight, they do it and that's the end of the movie. So instead of GI and the Germans playing games with each other, they even throw snowballs in one place. Interesting for one or two scenes, but soon it will be very annoying. After all, they're Germans. Enemy. Nothing in this film makes me think they should not be captured or shot. The film does not mean that it makes them more human. In fact, most of what the German characters did to ME wants to shoot them, including one scene where a German officer refuses to deal with a Jew or surrender to a petty officer! Why should I care for such characters? Just shoot them and let's go to the Bulge Battle. Anyway, it's much more interesting. One Good Scene: The GIs are returning from a German survey, where the Germans were in their sights but did not fire. Walking through the clearing, they realize that a group of Germans have their Mausers on them. The Germans are about 100 meters away. GI then do something I have never seen any GI do in any Sillywood movie. They drop their rifles and throw their hands down! Unusual as it may be in movies, it's a perfectly sensible reaction to having a rifle aimed at you from that distance. Even though it seems far away, in fact, these rifles are just a point. I'll put the course that someone working on this movie was a cruiser!
