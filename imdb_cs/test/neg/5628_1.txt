Famous as a British film so bad it had to be dealt free with newspapers, the quality of this sub-children's film foundation "thriller" can be quarreled out of an abnormal number of 10/10 votes and a large number of rave reviews from posters without broadcast history and no other reviews on their name. Regularly knowing what it means, gullible could be summoned. If they immerse themselves in the water of this, they will not last long before it is below them. Technically incapacitated with a mike boom getting into a shot or reflecting the crew visible, it just goes on forever in the forgetful sub-DAVINCI code at $ 5 a day. The end is just offensive, but don't worry. It's not as if you got so far!
