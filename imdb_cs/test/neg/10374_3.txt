This film should be retitled: Sex in the 70s In the New York section called Greenwich Village and Chelsea. This film has little talk about sex in the 70s except for a focus on the hypersexual environment of the public and private sex spaces in New York. I doubt that the Manhole bar was a symbol of real sex in the 1970s, and this kind of sex is much more prevalent in the film. Don't get me wrong, the time period looks like an explosion. And it's very important to document the scene the movie refers to. But when it comes to calling this movie in the 70s, the title is a bit misleading. Technically, this is not an Oscar Nominee, but what is appropriate for this subject is rude to him. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's "eh."
