Oh. Good. Grief. I saw this movie title on TV and I thought, "I have to watch this movie, tear off Snakes On A Plane, it'll be horrible, but hopefully even laugh. Sounds fantastic bad" . Well, I was half right. This film is ominously bad and unfortunately unintentionally cheerful. It's just bad. Worse still, it takes almost an hour to get to something similar. In the first half of the film we have to endure some mumbled foreign language (Mexican or Spanish, apologies for my ignorance) and horrible behavior when a woman throws up live snakes for reasons we find out later. Then we must endure even more terrible deeds and find that those who murmur in a foreign language can speak English the same way, because snakes finally relax on the train and things pass from sedentary to ridiculous. A low budget doesn't always mean "bad", but in this case it does. What we have here is a film that has not been thought, a terrible scenario, a poor cast, and very little to gain from it. I give two marks for a few decent special effects and a broken end, but it's still too generous. Avoid if you can. <br /> <br /> If you like: Stagknight, The Wicker Man remake, horrible CGI.
