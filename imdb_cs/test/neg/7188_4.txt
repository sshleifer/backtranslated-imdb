Let me start with a terrible story and a terrible control system. good animation but not very good graphics. That's why I give this game 4 out of 10. This game really needs improvement if you marry me !!! I would like to remake it and make this control system better so that the jaws are not so damn hard to control. If I did it to make it better, these graphics would look better than in the movie. It will drive someone crazy when you are killed so crazy easy. I played it and was killed by a diver when he had one of those fast knives in 2 hits. dolphins will kill you so much that the shark will beg to go to the bottom of hell. This game sucks some fat ass. sorry for all cussing i think i did now. It just that this game sucks so badly that it should be removed from the store shelf. I dare to play garbage and you will probably be so mad that you die so easily, so DO NOT PLAY !!!!!!!!!!!!
