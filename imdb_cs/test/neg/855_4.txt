Spike Milligan was one of the funniest men I've ever seen and a huge impact on my life. This film is lame and terrible and its memory has no credit. The script is crowded and keeps too many lines from the book intact (foot jokes are incomprehensible here). The performances of the actors are uniformly ineffective, the big cast is unnecessary, and the leadership, Sean Hughes, brings Milligan's aggressive fighting action in a pitiful whimper that completely makes no sense. Slight stimulation is a killer well. Farce should speed up at the end. Goon exhibitions often did, the novel "Puckoon" definitely did, but this film, if anything, slows down only when you want different elements to break in the finale of the climax. Milligan narrated a shortened soundtrack "Puckoon" in 1980, with TP McKenna, Dermot Kelly, Norma Ronald and Jack Hobbs. That's funny. Ten minutes is more fun than this whole movie. I believe the LP was transferred to the CD, but I don't know if it's still in print. There is a movie "Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Fall" with Jim Dale and Arthur Lowe. It's also a crazy mess, but it's more fun than this thing. <br /> <br /> It is possible that the spirit of Milligan is too unreal for the screen. Other reviewers devote themselves to decency and wishful thinking. This film breaks down virtually every opportunity and never misses a chance to disappoint.
