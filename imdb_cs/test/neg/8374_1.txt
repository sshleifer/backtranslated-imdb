That must be the worst movie I've ever seen. It just wasn't fun. My wife fell asleep. I think if you are the man who goes to all the doggy eyes when looking at the dog, he can do something for you. If you expect a comedy movie to have some humor, then you will be disappointed if you do not find an English radio announcer who says the word f is very happy. The strippers in the club kept their underwear, so even a little nudity did not get rid of boredom. What happened at the strip club didn't make any sense. The leading character met with a great mumble, with which I had no sympathy at all. Mena Suvari was hardly in the movie, probably just there to make people think it was a serious film making attempt. The poor were unconvincing and carried as much threat as dead sheep.
