I was looking forward to this movie. Being an old fan of Robert E Howard, mainly from Conan's attitude. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a lot of things and I thought they couldn't beat up too much ... Oh dear - how bad I was ... it was pretty boring. You need zip along with nice help of supernatural goings-on, fighting swords and the like. <br /> <br /> You have some gore, but everything else was pretty lifeless. The middle part seemed to include 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow horse-drawn horses and even slower dialogue and character development! On the plus side = costumes and effects were fine, but not enough to keep your interest. I think it would be better if they called gore, pace and go to the 12A rating. As a ten-year-old boy, I probably liked this movie. About the age when I first read Conan stories, pretty funny. Maybe it says a lot about my movie expectations? Or ....... Go really "Art-House" with tone, direction, etc. But this is a fairly high risk when it comes to as a box office. Well, well ... Maybe the next movie Conan will make up for it?
