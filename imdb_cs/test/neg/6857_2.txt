I don't know why, but I was watching it with quite expectations. Unfortunately it was wrongly placed. At first it is not a horror, it does not frighten and (if it was not worse than I gave him credit for - what is possible) is not trying. It's a dirty comedy and the fact that I once smiled means I gave it 2 no 1. This movie tears Gremlins in a really strange way, I can't say I've ever seen a movie that is more dedicated. Very, very bad - avoid.
