It seems to me that I am concerned that people are not so critical of work that deserves criticism. Many similarities, both structurally and literally, with the "Amadeus" party "Copying Beethoven" deliberately chooses an easy way by putting the audience in front of the art. And so they deny the world a challenging, intelligent and creative job. Now consider the following: Isn't it possible that the true story of creating the ninth symphony can be a truly engaging and powerful story in itself, as well as in a dramatic narrative? Beethoven was absolutely deaf by writing a symphony? Isn't it more interesting? How did the symphony go? Wouldn't it be great to know? So ask yourself what kind of motivation could a filmmaker have to introduce a woman as a copier? If there was a copier, it would be a man. What was his story? (Please try to be a bit more critical even if you like the inventor's invention). Fantasy should be much more than a distortion of reality to serve writers. For those who compare and justify Anna Holtz's invention with the invention of Salieri's assertion that they murdered Mozart in "Amadeus," consider that he confessed to a priest in a mad asylum procedure (Schaffer uses this device to greatly influence the film). "Copying Beethoven" might have worked if Anna had been the product of Ludwig's feverish imagination. But we should believe that it is "maybe" ... Yes and that the extraterrestrials helped Strauss. Most of the positive reviews I have read here are often DESIRE for film is good; almost intentional amnesia. Remembering the film for what you want it to be rather than what it is. For those who believe that imagination justifies the means, then consider that you are not just accepting a lower interpretation of real events, but also sacrificing Truth for the sake of triviality. Finally, a short note about acting that can surprise some of you. Ed Harris is not good as Ludwig Van Beethoven. Is that shocking you? She looks embarrassed throughout the film as well as the actor dressed but out of the set and stands at the dining table. Most of his lines are stated as cues rather than answers to Anne Holtz's lines (ie He does not listen to the actor). It is quite clearly an actor who is masking himself more like a character than living a character. Indeed, how many times does Beethoven have to plunge into her grave before we get right? Ask yourself if Ludwig would agree?
