The film starts well, but after half an hour it becomes boring and stupid when there is a whole plot about Karenina (that was the name of the girl?) Pregnancy. The End of the Movie It's really frantic and the characters really stupid. I don't know who's stupid, if the girl, because she came back with her old boyfriend or boy as she was used for her. In any case, it's my conclusion: it's definitely not the best 1980s comedy, just another movie like many others who have nothing special, they could do it better, but destroy it if only a conspiracy It had a different way, but they keep that pregnancy thing and they certainly are destroyed, so the final conclusion: I don't like it.
