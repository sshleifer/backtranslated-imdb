Being a totally shattered film enthusiast with a house that is equipped is a great IKEA fan. My whole home, practically, is packed to the brim with cheap chipboard stuff. And you know how all the stylish items at IKEA have the funny names - a shelf called "Holika" and a bathroom mirror called "Grundtal" - that's just a supplement to the whole Euro-spell. As well as the interestingly named (but terribly translated) shelves at IKEA, I'd like to provide you with some translation of some of the reviews I read about the Swedish "Kraftver 3714". Original comment: "It's a pretty cool thing for a low budget movie. It would be great to see what these guys could do on the Hollywood budget!" Translation: Film composition is miserable, lighting is pedestrian, cinematography is uninteresting, audio recording is hollow. Original comment: "David Lynchesque sci-fi drama set in a strange forest town with equally strange characters!" Translation: These "actors" act for free, the story is circular and tiring, thoughts that cheat are desperately trying to be existential, but they are simply mundane and set (especially interiors). they are boring and filled with ugly wallpaper. Original remark: "Adjustments are well done and conservative use of computer graphics shows that compelling CGI effects do not have to come from Hollywood studios.!" <br /> <br /> Translation: When you start with sketchy cinematography , hide imperfections by digitizing your entire computer on Mac and mixing it thoroughly for three minutes. Thoughtful! I have a chance on this DVD because I'm crazy for independent movies, especially those trying to solve the often expensive and marvelous science fiction genre. I think some of the best sci-fi movies of all time have been made with little or no budget, spfx and weird actors. Take, for example, Peter Fonda's environmental warning to help you with "time-travel" "Idaho Transfer"! Classics. But "Kraftverk 3714" doesn't fit into the category of "carefully crafted, low-key, idea-dependent sci-fi." It relentlessly focuses on characters who do not do much and do not say interesting things. It's round and round. It's too long (it comes from Tarkov's main fan). Worse, the concept of "extraterrestrials" is the Twilight Zone 40 years ago. It's not just a good movie - and I really wanted it to be, damn it! However, when I am an IKEA fan, I made one broken observation. First, everyone who has been shopping at IKEA knows how their complex shopping carts work - all four wheels are multidirectional. The trolleys can rotate to the perfect 360 degrees and be treated like professionals because every passionate IKEA customer knows. Well, I'll be damned, but one of the leading actresses in "Kraftver 3714" goes to some idle grocery store in the middle of nowhere, and what's going on around her? Multidirectional Shopping Cart! So this is not the IKEA invention, but it's another amazing invention (let's call it "Tacklebee" for hell) from hei-doo!
