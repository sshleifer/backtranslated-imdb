The worthless movie. A complete waste of time and nothing I expected to be. Obviously the cover is like the American Pie (not) genre. somewhat it is a ridiculous linking coincidence that makes the film look more like writing exercises (let's try to figure out how many mixes we can write to what should be bad SNL skit to the full length of the presentation). Remarkably, the director (based on their commentary on DVD) is taken seriously. I was a big fan of films that National Lampoon lends to its name, including Van Wilder. With this I felt completely cheated. In fact, I feel DUPED. I expected Van Wilder, as a farce, to spend my days at school, but instead served an hour and a half of waste. What led to my unsatisfied expectations? Well, for starters, the fact that the cast all look naked (with a huge sausage covering what needs to be covered) on COVER DVD. Add to this the images on the back of the case, as well as the description, and you introduce people into thinking that it's a movie that's not. To make it even worse, the movie begins as one might expect too much with half naked drunk college students weakly trying to photograph stunts, but in the end it has nothing to do with film. In fact, I didn't even realize that the people in this introductory sequence where the characters were to be in the film until the commentators told me to. Don't get me wrong, I love twists and surprises movies, but I hate the fact that this film is trying to stop it as something that isn't. In the end, it makes a huge disservation (artistically, though most likely not financially) because it sends its audience to confusion and disappointment simply because it neglects to do what it advertises. <br /> <br /> In short, do not rent this movie based on what you see on the cover. It's not your usual national film, Lampoon. The only thing that is funny about this is the fact that many actors have appeared in other films and TV shows that will be entertained here.
