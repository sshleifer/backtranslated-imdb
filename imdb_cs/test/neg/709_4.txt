I recently watched Atoll K-Laurel and Hardy's latest movie and known in states like Utopia-on Internet Archive, which expects to see some more shots because the IA version had a running time of 2 hours and 21 minutes. It turned out to be basically the same version I had previously watched in a good VHS tape basement from Goodtimes Home Video, which took an hour and 23 minutes (except for product placement on the Welch's Grape Juice label that was inserted when the bottle was displayed) with the rest of the time run dedicated to dark empty space. While Stan seems to be able to die at any time, he still plays a soft physical comedy with Ollie during most of the first 45 minutes. Then a conspiracy to take a yacht with a passenger and a man without a deck on board - despite the charming female French singer who also comes to inhabit an unexplored island, ends up taking over with possible complications that largely fit into the swamps. down and never really recover despite the well-known end of Ollie, who last told Stanovi: "Here's another nice mess you got me in!" before Stan crying uncontrollably before he disappeared. In other words, if you are a laurel and hardy fan, this movie is recommended for you at least once. Anyone who wants to get to know this classic comedy team should look for their earlier work done for Hal Roach, from the 1920s until 1940, when they finished their latest film, Roach, Saps at Sea. Think about it, even some of the L&H Fox flicks (still see two they did for MGM) from '40s to be better than this ... Update-8/29/09: Just watched some missing scenes that appeared in Italian version on YouTube. Cherie sings in one and has an interview with the captain. In the second, the captain's wife pulls a gun on Cherie. Once again Giovanni explains why he left his country with a flashback scene. The tent is nicknamed the high pitch!
