Jerry Lewis was barely funny when he didn't write his own material and had a good director like Frank Tashlin. When he began writing and directing his own films, he had little talent he had overshadowed by his egomania. Whenever his films on the American market would fail (and deservedly), Lewis always blamed everyone and everything but himself; for example, he blamed the failure of this film on the fact that it was, according to Lewis, released on a double account with the porn feature "Deep Throat". If someone complains about this situation, he should be the "Deep Throat" manufacturer. It is a totally stupid "comedy" about the world's richest man (Lewis), who is refused during World War II for military service and decides to equip a special "squad" to go to Germany and capture Hitler. In addition to many bugs this movie has (script is mind-insensitive ununny, Lewis's "direction" is non-existent, the film has the appearance of a cheap home movie), Lewis apparently thought to surround himself with no talent, over-the-Borscht Borscht Belt comics like Jan Murray and Sidney Miller was a good idea; he had to imagine that they were so bad that it would look good. He was half right; they are embarrassingly bad, but they get worse than they do. For "comedy", Lewis's character is annoying, angry and ambitious; The way the abuse is being accumulated on its subordinates is why you would sometimes be bullyed on a dangerous mission, like trying to capture Hitler. The fact that this movie has won money at all is overwhelming. It's by far the worst Jerry Lewis movie I've ever seen - I've heard that "Slapstick" is even more pathetic, but I can't force myself to see if it's true or not - and all the possible costs should be avoided.
