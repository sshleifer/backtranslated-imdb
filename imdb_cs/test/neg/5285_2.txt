Probably one of the best, worst movies ever, how bad and random it is, it's a little jolly, and I don't know how I feel about it. karate and yelling 'pancakes' it is interesting. Since many people have already outlined the storyline and all I do is summarize the quality of the movie with one quote: "I'm a park ranger who's going to f * ck you up". Yeah, enough? If you are looking for a quality or really scary movie, I do not recommend it. but if you like these kinds of movies then i think you would like it .. i dont know how, but i think some people would.
