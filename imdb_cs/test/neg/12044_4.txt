It is unlikely that anyone other than those who love silent movies will appreciate one of the lyrical camera and busy (but scratched) scores that accompanies this 1933 edition. Although the sound came to general use in 1928, there are no more than fifty words spoken telling the story of a woman, unhappily married, who releases her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods. The most vividly photographed scene is to give a jealous husband a lift to a young man to drive into the city, to progress normally until he realizes that a man is his wife's lover. In the fury of jealousy, he rides at the highest speed toward the railroad, but at the last moment he changes his mind, loses his nerves. It's probably the most tense scene in an otherwise definitely slow moving and apparently fictional story. HEDY LAMARR gets her detailed treatment that her discoverer found on Marlene Dietrich, but her beauty hasn't been refined by cosmetics, like when they were transported to Hollywood. Her performance is mainly due to her sad and sad looking, while she mourns the loss of her marriage with a short flash of a smile as she finds her true love (ARIBERT MOG), a handsome young stallion who gets a dress after naked swimming. The swimming scene is very short, inconspicuously photographed and not worth all the heat it has created. Love-scene, later, is also artistically photographed with a kind of lyrical photograph evident in most of the film - artistically so. More is left to imagination with the use of symbolism - and this is something that others have to claim a film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece. It's not like that. It is disappointing, primitively raw in his sound part (including laborious symphonic music in the background), and certainly Miss Lamarr is lucky that Louis B. Mayer has seen the film and made it a career in Hollywood. He had to see something in his work that I didn't. Obviously, it was conceived as a silent movie with a camera that does all the work. The negative "worker" scene lasts too long at the end and is a disturbing intervention where nothing is needed. He can't finish the movie on the right note.
