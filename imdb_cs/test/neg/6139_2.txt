************* SPOILERS BY ************* "" Night, Mother "is the story of Jesse (Sissy Spacek), a divorced epileptic woman who calmly announces her The harsh mother (Anne Bancroft) is committing suicide, a fascinating premise that is exhausted by all vitality and excitement, the brilliant hook proves to be a scam - the story that follows is devoid of substance, gravity and apparent value. How Mother and Daughter Have, What Can Be the Last Conversation of Their Life Where are the secrets, confessions and fantasies and regrets revealed? Norman at the expense of everything else is not a film, but an exhausting endurance test. <br /> <br /> Let me avoid my comments by saying that Sissy Spacek is one of the greatest actresses in film history, women so magically It is so natural that it surprises me and impresses me after twenty years of fame, bringing a touch of class and magic to everything it does, and seeing more than one film from a recycling bin with her angelic face and vulnerable eyes, soft voice and sweet smile. Because of the great Spacek, who was watching this film in the first place, and for one of her films to be horrible, she must fail significantly. This film fails in two. First of all, the film is so faithful to the Pulitzer game that it is claustrophobic and repetitive. The whole film is a dialogue between two women between Jesse and her mother. What worked on stage - a mother and a middle-aged daughter argue for two hours in small movie houses. The game, no matter how big, must be * customized * for the screen? it is self-confident and arrogant to believe that dialogue is so perfect that we cannot change it in one word. The screenplay for this movie could be cut thirty to forty pages, and an experienced screenwriter would give the brilliant Spook and competent Bancroft * physical * sequences, some face reactions, something that would break the wall from wall to wall like a fest. and a prison disposable set. Not surprisingly, the script was modified by the original playwright Marsha Norman, who can know the theater scene, but reveals that he is helpless in the film. I can't emphasize the effect of the script scenario on the film. Watching Jesse and her mother argue that Jesse's impending suicide is unnecessary and boring. Women go to the den from the living room to the kitchen and return to the living room where they start again. The Little Midwestern House is not the ideal place for a single set movie, and the director never does anything smart or original, never trying to split the monotony with an external shot or cutout or flashback or * anything *. There is no music, no other characters, no other stories ... just two women covering the couch on the couch and arguing their views. Respect for the game is disgusting? Even Shakespeare's most famous classic rocked the screen. The commitment to the original game seems almost insidious? It is as if the film was made solely to document the dramatic treasure that was a play with the viewer. Another reason the movie fails is Anne Bancroft. Maybe she's a good actress, but on movies where 80% of the performances are present - it doesn't seem to fit her. He certainly doesn't fit in here, he plays the Midwestern grandmother, but looks more like Mrs. Robinson before the morning coffee. She pursues Jesse around the house, looks more appealing than overwhelmed, and seems to be extremely unsympathetic, even if her lines express a loving woman if it is faulty. Sissy Spacek is great as she is always honest and honest. open and so good that you really understand and agree with the choice of her character. Sissy allows us to see that Jesse is a flat tire, a bad turn of a woman who had every bad break and made too many bad decisions. She never had control of her life and her suicide would be her way of finally saying, "Not anymore - this is where I got off." So does it, and when Spacek speaks? you listen. In all his films, he proves that a good actress does not have to behave like a man, it does not have to be all bluffing and bravery and testosterone lending. In this and in films like "Coal Miner's Daughter", he quietly demonstrates the subtle power and quiet depth that is as impressive as the hypnotic? you can't help but fall in love. That's why it was so hard for me to watch "Night, Mother". Starling is wasted in a stetted piece of film that never serves to distract or even distract. I would not recommend this movie to anyone except Sissy hard fans like me, and even then you will be disappointed. The film gives the whole letter bonus for the end, which is bold enough to let the lead character do what's right for her * and not the pander into the hackney-end. GRADE: C
