This is a horror movie that plays as Richard Crenna and Joanna Pettet as a psychologist duo who buys and olds and invites a small crew of friends and patients to help clear the place. Apart from them, the mansion hides a cellar door - a gate to hell. If you're in the mood for a horror movie clich√©, then look no further, but if you want something ingenious then you won't like this little movie. VIOLENCE: $$$ (rather subdued, though the scene where a man cuts his hand with a saw - he thinks somewhat terribly that fans of inventive death scenes don't seem to be any character in any way electric shock.: $ (What I can't talk about. Mary Louise Weller gives a good look, but her character was underdeveloped). <br /> <br /> STORY: $$ (Cliched but still worth it. casting Victor Buono - which is just as dreadful as Santa's department store - seems to have attracted several viewers). <br /> ACTING: $$ (The best performances are Crenna and Pettet with other actors simply "phoning" into their roles The script cannot develop any characters outside of Pettet's character and seemed to have forgotten about Mary Louise Weller (Animal House), who disappears for about twenty minutes and just boring modes to return to electricity like everyone else.
