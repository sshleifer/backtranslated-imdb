I really wanted to like this movie, but after a fun opening a few minutes I barely cracked a smile. I agree that there was no chemistry between the two leaders, and the other characters were clich√©s. The script totally missed the talents of Bud Tingwell and Kim Gyngell. However, it should be said that there was a lot of laughter around me, and finally applause. Maybe I couldn't get enough of it. I'm just glad I went to cheap tickets.
