Asia Argento has never made a film (as far as I know, even those directed by her own father, Dario), where at some point she can't show all her anatomy. Certainly, in the most boring opening introductory scene, poor Madsen came to her office and right there, reminding us that while her hair is up, she can still keep her crotch fingers in that second moment (which she does, but in such a coincidental "what ? I really see that? "kind of way). The DVD box, the cover, makes it look like a femme fatale movie, so you'll wait to see how it turns into an elegant and minimalist killer .. no such luck. She is detailed, hung up on some aging was and even worse, she has no credible skills in physical agility other than (surprise!) To take off all the dress when a scene allows it. Her accented English would be fine if she didn't try to make it sound so strong and try to talk like 12 years. How about a plot? A weak-minded but at the same time nymphomanic woman is suddenly driven to kill when she has another business on the road and runs a cheap drug deal ... what? what? does anyone have the motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster? It seems that the script is oriented by letting everyone talk many times about the same things over and over again (I expected to see that the worst part is looking at it as a producer who threw money out of it to have some time on screen) - there is nothing to follow the sub obvious shortcomings in Asian character that at any moment in the film brings what the DVD promises. She's weak ... but she knows how to kill. she flails LOT. She is naked, half dresses, even throws herself into the clothes of a dead woman. It is very discreet and unmotivated. In fact "Floppy" would be a great name for this movie .. and the shot of Asia died looking angry on the cover would be a better representation ... there are actually shots of her eating a meal plane !!! What is it? The End Makes 0 Senses - Everyone is just uncomfortably wisely stupid in their intentions and fulfilling them all goals. Lester's wife does not bring any real revenge (while someone who has a bad karoeke IS life threatening but is not really valid). Completely misleading key art ... yeah, we know that Asia has lost the baby's fat of its first born, but indeed, the whole movie trying to pretend it's so interesting that it couldn't control a movie about a passively aggressive chick isn't worth for your time. Instead, see No Return.
