More of Frisbee as a turtle with fangs that go up like a pig wart. More battles with people in suits that look like people in suits. Ping pong ball spaceship. Two naughty boys who know how to do everything, including getting aboard a spaceship. More tedious music. More "Gamera is a friend of children" stuff. I remember Godzill and Rodan coming out. The movies were a lot of fun because monsters were actually a threat to people. Now it's just a show of stupid costumes with very little behind them. Adults are all ridiculous and moronic. As in American sitcoms, kids are bosses (when they really couldn't think of a way out of a paper bag). These monster movies must be Japanese means partonizing these little snots. Above all, however, after seeing three of these films (with the same plot over and over, check the footage), the final conclusion is that they are boring. If you haven't seen it, don't bother.
