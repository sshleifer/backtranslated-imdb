This is an above-average film in itself, but why was it in the name of Bog? It is impossible to treat him as a thing, because it is almost a shot of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960s classic. <br /> <br /> What does "credit" mean? How can we appreciate Van Sandt and his co-workers with something other than deciding to use different actors, slightly different sets and colors? Anne Heche is attractive but lacks Janet Leigh's firm commitment to becoming a decent middle class woman. And Heche is younger than Leigh, who brought her a fruitless attempt to marry and settle down, the despair of a woman facing forty. And Heche is not anxious as Leigh did. A scene with a CHP officer looking into the car window illustrates the weakness of the role. In the original, the officer asks, "Is something wrong?" Leigh: "Of course not. I act like something's happened?" The officer hesitates to answer, "Well, honestly, yes." This exchange is omitted from the remake for the simple reason that Heche is not nervous enough. The worst change, no doubt, is the replacement of Vince Vaughn for Anthony Perkins. It can't be Vaughn's fault. Who could deal with Perkins? Perkins is a jerking, bird-like, long-neck, veiled in an externally charming exterior that masks the inner vacuum. Its every move (eating corn sugar, swinging with apples) and every talk, faint laughter, dry laughter is in place. He just can't be improved. Vaughn brings in the presence of a short-haired guy who was just released as Lance Corporal of the US Army. To design his psychosis all he can do is to overlap the manic giggling at the top of what seems to be an otherwise perfectly normal Norman in speech and manner. (Unlike the original Norman, Vaughn doesn't even hit the word "mistake" because he resembles a "phallus".) He could just hang around the motel and wait for his UCLA scholarship to apply. > <br /> The direction deserves some remarks. I don't see what she adds to the story when we see Norman masturbating while looking into Anne Heche. I don't have OBJECT on it. I wonder why it's there as well as I wonder why the rest of the movie is there. And I think that in order to impress us on how many colors he adds to the visual experience, Van Sant seems to have missed a bit of Hitchcock's finer stuff. Heche receives underwear from all different colors - green, pink, orange and - mango? Is it color? If so, what the hell color? Does not matter. The thing is, in the original, when the camera first looks through the Phoenix Hotel window, Janet Leigh captures a white, half-slip and white bra in her bed. Later, after she stole the money, we see her again in her underwear - this time both her slip and her bra are black. It's a small thing, but Hitch's own. <br /> <br /> In that case, the idea of ​​filming in color might not be bad, except that black and white shooting of the original was excellent. The color and strange lighting effects in this version turn into a plain, boring and subliminally sinister motel for something that looks like it belongs to the more dazzling part of Las Vegas. The 1960 movie was more shocking than one. I remember seeing it in the drive in San Diego and staring at the screen when it was clear that the central character was actually DEAD - in the middle of the movie! Nothing like that has ever happened before. This shower shower, in both movies, was a great improvement over Robert Bloch's original novel, by the way the author writes something like "The killer then stepped into the bathroom and cut her head off with a knife. I don't do that. Even here, Van Sant's film gives us a surplus, there is more blood and more bare flesh, and where Hitchcock first closed on the blood that was circling the tub and stretched out into the open Marian eye, he slowly pulled out the camera, to reveal her face, the camera turned from a slight inclination to the correct vertical position, giving the viewer a sense of not only the murder's incredulity but a dizzying distrust.Van Sant does not rotate the camera 10 or 20 degrees as Hitchcock. It won't make Hitchcock's bow because it's not, it's a money pillage of Hitchcock's material (which has already been torn off in "Psycho" I, II, III, IV and "Psycho: Initial Years" and "Come to My Salon: Mrs. Bates" Revenge, "and" Hand Me That Knife, You?: The True Story of Norman Bates. ") Rehashing and grinding on truly original things, a crumenal act, if not a criminal. And not to mention the many honors in other films, especially in French, such as the notorious "ocean of boring" scenes between Marcel Brule and Jeanne Gateau in the "admired" La Mere de la Nuit. "(Perhaps I would add that the last sentence is a terrible attempt to parody academic critics. And when the chicken gut grinds corn, it's a" crumenal "act. As they are, they're more fun than a movie.) <br /> <br / "Who was it? I would have to guess. Kids who are too young to know about the original and who don't like movies in black and white? Children who hope to see another plain slasher movie? Chimpanzees?"
