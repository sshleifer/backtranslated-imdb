Well, I got it. I saw the box on the video store and I imagined it wrong for "Girlfight", which I heard was great. In my own defense, the titles are similar, and they re-made the cover art for boxing so it looked almost identical. Anyway, to sum up, they probably reiterated the entire package / promo cover to use the "Girlfight" buzz / success. I threw it and got a bad feeling when they started showing low budget trailers directly to the video, and even worse when the music video from the main song for the movie, which sounded like elevator music and featured canyon slomo clips from the film preceded the main feature. When I saw the first few minutes and Maria Conchita Alonso appeared, I knew I had fallen for it. (Don't get me wrong, he's a talented actress, but I knew he wasn't in "Girlfight", a movie I was under false impression I rented). So, unlike me, feeling like being cheated and angry with myself for not being closer, the movie was OK. The storyline includes Belle, a young Latino woman who is the daughter of a former boxer champion. One of her close friends is a female boxer who - and I have seen all these sleds coming in time that it was really a drag - gets seriously injured during a match with the middle champion "The Terminator", which resembles a female version of the larger , more pumped up by Ike Turner. Of course, Belle decides that the only thing you need to do is to become a boxer and avenge her girlfriend. He lives with his caring, supportive, and at the same time protective dad (her mother died of cancer when she was younger), who is just a cop. Her love interest, also caring and supportive, but also protective, is also a cop who works with her father. Hmmm, they both have a job that threatens their lives in accordance with the duty ... wonder what happens? She starts training and meets a slippery manager who pretends to take care of her, but she just wants to use it. The actor they hired looks very low-rented to Cary Eweles and is so young he can barely have a mustache. His actions were also really bad. I'm not going to conspiracy anymore, because anyone who has seen Rocky or almost anyone knows exactly where this movie goes and how it ends. It wasn't a terrible movie. Most games were fine and the main actress was very good. There were good, strong women Latino designs. The last battle scene caught me a bit, even though I knew everything that would be going on long before it did. The actress who played "The Terminator" did a great job of being unlikely to really want Belle to kick $ $ and take root in Belle again, though there was no surprise. My favorite moment (maybe the only moment I wasn't upset about having a movie accidentally rented) was when Belle wrapped up her slim manager after showing her real colors, screaming at him and then turning away, just to suddenly fake Punch and watch him bend over in fear, showing that he is really the one in charge. The dialogue was really, really bad, my main complaint. One of their attempts to be humorous was someone discussing boxing saying "size does not matter" and the woman answer wryly, "now where did I hear it before?" T The next lines that are to have a dramatic impact are: "Doctors told me that I will never walk again! " "Come on, you know you can trust me!" and "Your mother would be so proud of you". I could go on and on. Nothing you haven't heard a million times before in bad serials or movies - the week. Maybe I'm too medium - the filmmakers tried, and I volunteered the whole thing ... but just because when I was working there was nothing but watching. It could be worse (especially if you're looking for a movie with strong female characters), but you can also do a lot, much better.
