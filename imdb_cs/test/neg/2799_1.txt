I think that's why this movie never came close to the thrashing theaters. Perhaps it was my street neighbors who filmed this movie with their mother's camera. Acting is very amateur. This movie is definitely not something you would like to watch if you weren't very bored. The actors even seem to double as directors and crew members, without "professionalism." If the director (s) and / or the actors decided to continue their filmmaking efforts, I would definitely advise them to try their skills and maybe take a few (ok, many) classes about filmmaking and acting.
