... Once. "Manos, hands of destiny." That was worse than this, somewhat worse: but one thing was: they were beautiful, negligent women who wrestled each other - about 20 minutes. It has a fat 45 year old with 3 breasts and a tail, in the Kantin scene cloned directly from "Star Wars". Not to mention the obese, blue seducer Uhura, her thick legs and ass hanging from some mad bird costume in this method. Has she always wanted to perform before a "captured audience"? She had to think of poor lords who robbed 8 bucks and hoped to see more "anger Khan", or at least "Voyage Home". I wonder how many people in theaters were trying to cut their wrists when they shouted, "Mother, stop it." <br /> <br /> No question, "Ultimate Limit" is not just an unreal disaster, it's cruel and an unusual punishment, it's Star Trek from hell, this is Shatner on the Mushroom - or maybe peyote, that's where no man went and wished he'd never come first. Review "Heaven's Gate:" It's like Gene Roddenberry sold his soul to the devil for the success of the TV series, and the devil is just about to gather. And not even letting me start on drunk Kirk and grimacing McCoy's singing "Row, Row, Row Your Boat" together as if they were lovers in some demented dream. Then we have a hidden dynamic Sulu duo and Chekov, together we walk through the woods ... probably on the way to Barry Manilow's concert, then there's Laurence Luckinbill as Spock's brother ???? Yeah, right! And when we need a new plot line, and remember that Spock is rocketing over Kirk when he falls off a cliff in Yosemite, so he catches Kirk and puts ONE FOOT away from him.
