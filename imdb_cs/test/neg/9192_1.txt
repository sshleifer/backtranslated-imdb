One of the worst movies ever made. Let's start with the superficial: Joaquin Phoenix is ​​primarily too fat to be a novice firefighter. NYFD does not accept a boy from Pillsbury. John Travolta has a bad dye work and a strange flash in his eyes made me think throughout the film that he was on some expanded focus of Scientology. The story hits all the tropics and clichés, the average Joe believes as a firefighter: they all get drunk, get into battle, hard to express their emotions, their wives stay crying, they all have problems with their father, everyone has an accent in Boston and more. An executable piece of schwarmerei who plays on our ongoing cultural hero worship of firefighters after 9-11 - which, by the way, was a valid worship of a cultural hero. Unfortunately, this film is not a revered hero.
