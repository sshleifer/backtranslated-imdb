"Clubbed" is another "will-to-do?" joining the British fistuff genre and it's sure to keep divers who don't wait too mildly for ninety minutes after several beers. However, for anyone looking for smart, quality entertainment, it's really best to avoid it. There are so many bugs in the scary scenario that Colin Salmon's actor is also a left-looking daft. The event takes place in the 1980s, but it is never clear why, especially when they did not get any convincing feeling in this decade - the soundtrack lasts more than a few decades, an occasional zoo suit and a handful of thirty-year cars. Then we see the central characters studying the lyrics like Sun Tzu's "The Art Of War" and talk about how violence should be the last resort, while the same characters seem too willing to start blowing strikes with all the testosterone-powered, unthinking abandoned ones. A bunch of chavas fighting for a sack of chips. The development of the character in "Clubbed" does not exist. Neither irony, gentleness or pathos. This is a movie that trades on memories of Guy Richie's early gangster films, which, despite their shortcomings, certainly had much more joke, better editing, easier dialogue, and more emotional strike than this weak saga. They are now decades - is it not time to try to imitate them?
