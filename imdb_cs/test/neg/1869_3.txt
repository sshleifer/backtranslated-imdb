Busty Beauty Stacie Randall plays PVC dressed, bad-ass bitch Alexandra, faithful acolyte Faust, an evil entity trapped in hell. Determined to free his master, the evil minx falls into a warehouse to steal a magical jewel that is vital to its success; but while performing a Satanic ritual to evoke Faust, a silly mare accidentally enters a pentagram that she has drawn on the floor, resulting in the loss of the gem and the release of two tiny, troll-like creatures called Lite and Dark. Now he has to find a replacement jewel that won't be easy: the only other stone that will do the trick is to be worn around the neck of a former lover, Detective Jonathan Graves (Peter Liapis), who is investigating a robbery in the warehouse. he knows too well what the bad Alexandra is capable of. Meanwhile, the wisely cracking interdimensional Lite and Dark halfparts come into all sorts of problems trying to find their way back home. <br /> <br /> In the crooked world of Jim Wynorski, all women are big boobs girls with a fashionable sense of cheap hookers. Ghoulies IV is no exception: every woman in this movie - be it a police captain, an antique curator, or a mental patient in asylum - is hot, hot, hot and wears a lot, and that's a fact that makes it an otherwise completely unnoticeable piece of STV crap just bearable. But be warned, although the presence of a half-naked, high-quality pancake makes the trip a little easier, there is still plenty to say about this film to be described as suffering: it is wooden and dialogue is painful; black humor (as it describes a DVD disc) is about as fun as a knackers knee, with comedy joke Lite and Dark being particularly cringe-worthy; and special effects are a beneficial basement, consisting of gummy creatures and visual effects that would look ten years earlier. <br /> <br /> 3/10 only for high bimbo quotient.
