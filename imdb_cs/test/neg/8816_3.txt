The main 'Saw' problems are associated with huge scenario errors that only a non-critical viewer will avoid. The main question is, what is the goal of the killer in his lying in the floor? The film tries to show that the goal of the killer is to cause evil and destruction in his victims, he loves to play with the lives of other people and feel control of their fears and debts. So why is he just pretending to be dead between the two main characters? Huge improbability: can one pretend to be dead for more than one or two hours without moving a single muscle or even without breathing to find two men in the same room? It makes no sense, except for the final (d) film effect. It seems the killer always has control over the conspiracy and if it is like a dead body, it can't be possible. It doesn't work in the end. The right place for the killer was to be a darker and untouchable shadow behind a false shadow (nurse) but not a white room floor. The director was not supposed to show the face of the killer and perhaps the place where he was hidden. Then the movie would be a pretty good thriller. But "Saw" is just a fiasco. Hitchcock, please come back.
