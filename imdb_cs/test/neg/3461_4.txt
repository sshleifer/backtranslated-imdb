This is defiantly DVD movie rental. I'm a big fan of cast members, but the storyline never really grabbed me. Don't wait "Oh brother, where are you" in any form or form. The funniest part in my opinion is when a war hero explains what's going on in argon. It looks like they're trying to copy some of Clooney's funny facial expressions from "Oh brother, where are you", but you could say he's trying to. John Krasinski was a clear point and was tough. Renee Zellweger plays the role of a zealous reporter who is willing to do something for the story. Overall, it's a movie that's worth watching at home.
