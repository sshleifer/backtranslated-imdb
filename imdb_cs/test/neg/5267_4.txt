I was really looking forward to this movie. He had all the ingredients of a big tongue in his face, but it just didn't happen at all. Kevin Spacey's accent was tolerable except that he sometimes forgot to use it and would rather not listen to Linda Fiorentino's pale attempt. She and Helena Baxendale were totally absent from the charm and personality, fortunately their kids had a lot of stuff on the screen, so you could find at least some of the members of his 2 families who were delighted. You could have copied spaghetti and I'm sure the script was written by a teenage boy in high school English competition. This means that when I didn't get a sneer, I grinned, so it wasn't entirely unnecessary for 90 minutes. I found Kevin's overlay on the picture very clever and quite funny. Maybe I'm a little bit rough, but I've been waiting for some quality tracking and it just never came.
