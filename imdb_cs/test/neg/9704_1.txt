Perhaps if you have never read any English literature, or have ever watched a Hollywood version of any book, you may find merit in this horrible movie. It has Shoreditch overhead and scripting capabilities. The BBC 1995's adaptation is very nice and close to the book and captures the atmosphere between Elisabeth and Darcy very well. Bingley also acts crazy and it is incomprehensible that he is my friend of Darcy. I can't imagine how Judi Dench could accept this role, maybe she thought it was a surreal comedy version. Quotes from the book are out of context. Big bits are missing, an important episode with Wickham is overlooked. However, Mr. Collins is very good and stands above the other cast members. The only good thing is we didn't pay it. Wait for the DVD and use it to keep the table from moving.
