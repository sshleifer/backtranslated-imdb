I am disgusted and appalled by the positive assessment of this film. Not only is it hockey, manipulative and melodramatic. It is also shamefully offensive. Radio Character `Gooding Jr. 'is marched like a cute animal animal like a puppy that is so cute you want to take him home. 'This mentality is shameless; Radio is never considered a human being, but a manipulation device that draws sympathy from the audience. Even more ugly are the many moments of the movie in which Radio hits the head / trips / falls over / etc. These moments of slapstick comedy had the audience howling with laughter purely because it's funny because the radio is retarded. This is shameless, now I don't feel that the word "retarded" is a good word for describing mentally handicapped, but it seems to be the attitude the film does, "Radio is retarded, but that's fine because it's cute and we have like him. " Gooding's portrayal seems to be more appropriate for John Water's film than the inspiring family drama. Adding insult to the film's injuries is incompetent at all levels, Debra Winger is uninspired in the role as "stereotypical housewives" that the very reminder of her ugly monologues perceives laughter in all who see the film. John Horner's score is pure sap always overlapping his tear score over tired cinema. Ed Harris is decent in the role he could sleep over, but he manages to keep a lot of audience attention throughout the movie. In conclusion, if you consider yourself a decent human being, ignore this film trouble, read the book, but otherwise skip this horrible movie of interesting character from American history.
