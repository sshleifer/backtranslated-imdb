I don't see how anyone can say it was a really good funny movie. With some well-known actors I found it hard to believe it was just in 2005. It's crap! Acting equals amateur drama, bad amateur drama. If you don't want to laugh loudly in the amazing 100 minutes of pure corn, don't bother to download or rent it, the worst I've seen in years. It's from ancient game days when cowboys shoot 8 rounds of six shooters. The more familiar the actor, the worse the Drury is. Was I extremely disappointed with Lee Majors, actually collapsed to such a waste? It was bad enough to play $ 6 million.
