When I saw this movie, I was on British Airways flight from London to New York. I wish I had to sleep. The story was very thin and the editorial team did everything it could to keep it as long as they did. Gary, played by Andy Garcia, was that I couldn't stand up. supporting him. Andy's acting ability is good, but he's not good enough to balance poor writing in this movie. Andie MacDowell has done a great job with her portrayal of Linda, the romantic interest of Gary. I can't say anything bad about Andie, I always like her playing. The problem is that the romance between Andy and Andie is so attractive and incredible. Both of them don't make a good pair on the big screen. The end of the movie was almost the same as the movie itself. He nodded from the Pope and everything is forgiven, come on. An event that allows this film to have something that has a happy ending and that writers expect us to accept it is pathetic. Gary will not change and only the death of a dear friend will improve his situation. <br /> <br /> There are tons of great movies that should be seen before this. Don't waste your time. <br /> <br />
