This was just a TV show here in the US. Others have commented on the fidelity (or lack of the same) of the novel; The 1983 BBC version is far better in this and all other counts. Due to the extent of the novel, it should not be condensed for 85 minutes. Key sections must be rushed or omitted; barely enough time to get into the chronology of events, so character development must be sacrificed: we can't get the power of the senses for who the people are, robbing us of what makes Austen so big. One of the main negatives for me was cinematography, which I thought was just awful and literally scary. The camera constantly makes ultra-detailed images and swirls around and around in circles. Maybe it's fine on a small TV box, but on our 40 "hi-def screen it was so dizzy that both my wife and I had to break away from the set repeatedly (my Dramamine offer was exhausted). distracting from a somewhat more obscure play in the script I'm just-read-what's in the script (isolated scenes are pretty done, but not enough to store things). <br /> <br /> Adding a score in Complete JA Sweepstakes: Much appreciated "Northanger Abbey" success, thanks to excellent direction and production values ​​(and the story fits better for short treatment), "Persuasion" OK (though not the same as for other versions), with condensation again I blame you for better in the two remaining novels in this television reader, Jane Austen, as well as others, I am grateful to have left P & P alone!
