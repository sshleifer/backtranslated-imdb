It's great to hear 3 or so comments that point to what women 'footballers' mean to women. The title itself removes all alleged women who have equality in the media industry or society and reduces them to two-dimensional cartoons as men think women should behave. It's a postmodern Moroccan farce. It could also be called 'Wifey footballers who stay home and know their place'. On the one hand, it could actually be some kind of parody of the British, grooved baskets of the press representation of personalities and the role they have in maintaining a patriarchal society. Women can thus undermine stereotypes by behaving like stereotypes and their own image created by the desire of men. That would be ironic and clever. I also feel that I should praise it. Zoe Lucker is just too much of a camp to be taken seriously over the top. Like the cheaper Cruella De Ville. She just needs some manic, condescending but self-evaluating laughter to show off her true range. Oh? Right. Anyway, it's just about who it focuses on. Be a clever smart journal that thinks it is a booming mission of Vaudeville proportions, or people who think it is "real." "Finest Actors"? PRO BOHA !! Stop following this birth of mime and get your life. Her absolutely sexist and of such low quality that perhaps those who enjoy it think they are a "joke". Does it matter to the actors or do they understand what they communicate? It's so humiliating for women and men. These are not self-confident, selfish, football-loving materialists who think women are nothing more than a public trophy. It's so humiliating. I'm sure Mrs. Lucker could easily stand in her "real" life and turn her finger as easily as they do in "Footballers Wives." Of course, it doesn't really matter. After all, I mean his only VV program. So please let him stay in line. It is terrible and will only look back at the same mistrust that the 'prison cell block H' was so kindly remembered. <br /> <br /> How did this happen? Certainly it is neither subtle nor complex. It could only come from the same set read by FHM, and think that his "okay" is to look at soft pornography and "do" so many women who worship their "will" and sing patriotic and racist , whenever "your" loss of a football team.
