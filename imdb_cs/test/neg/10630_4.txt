I am a huge fan of Amy Adams and for many years. I am also a big fan of musicals. He said it wasn't a good movie at any level. It's pretty boring and the actor is very bad. Amy Adams is uncomfortable watching an act with Scott G. Anderson for being in a different league in acting. All performances will be very amateur. The musical performances are pleasant, but nothing special. Scott G. Anderson is just a bad actor! I assumed he was in this movie because he had a great voice, but it wasn't. He has an average voice and sings to the key, but that's about it. I think I can see why Amy Adams made this movie with the singing I wished. I could brag about the other bad elements of this movie, but I'll leave it to it.
