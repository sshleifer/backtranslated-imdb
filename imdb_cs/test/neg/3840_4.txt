Like most of the people watching this movie, I did it for Michael Madsen and Dennis Hopper. Both of them are extremely underestimated, and unfortunately because of this, the headline must be bullshit. In this movie, Hopper plays a guy who accidentally kills blackmail and is offered help from a mysterious Madsen. In fact, the film is not as bad as it could be. I have seen both in much worse, both independently and collaborate (LAPD, horrible film). The direction was quite poor and the script needed several transcripts, but both provided the best possible performance with the material offered. Also, the end is strong enough so you can tell the story has the potential. But when the glowing review of the film is: "It could have been much worse", it doesn't say much for the movie itself. <br /> <br /> All in all, one thing that can be easily skipped If none of these actors picks you up. But if you're a fan of one or both, give him a watch. Both have strong performances that overcome the obvious shortcomings of the film. Believe me, there are much worse options out there.
