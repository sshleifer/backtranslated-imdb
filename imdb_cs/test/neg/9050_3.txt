A very memorable story in which mercenary Kerman and employer Agren travel to the jungle in search of Agren's missing sister. Despite his connection with the cannibal film family, this film is more of an extreme version of Rene Cardon. Lenzi clearly wants to exploit (at the time) the current Jonestown massacre, by depicting a rogue, a self just zealot with a penchant for bigamy, and only a hint of megalomania (played with ruthless intensity by Ivan Rassimov) leading his colorful crews with a finger in the finger, Kerman & Agren try to stop rot, but after a few unsuccessful coups he ends up escaping to "Green Hell" just to run away from the locals and their famous tastes. <br /> <br / > One in the chain of excessive gore fests, which appeared in the late 1970s / early 1980s, when each new addition seemed to be involved in a contest for one of its predecessors with its predecessor by trying to figure out the bloodiest and graphical display it ever brought This lower installment uses all the motives and tricks of others, but with much less success He was a so-called "native of the Amazon" who seemed to be a Bollywood refusal (this film was made in Sri Lanka), or an inept "scenic" scene that seriously reduced authenticity which was evident in the "cannibal holocaust"? You can decide. Without spoiling the conclusion, Lenzi seemed to put more emphasis on his shock and peak climax than on the basic demand for a cohesive end where all the loose ends are resolved. Most unsatisfactory. As with others, where the scale of graphic depiction of violence against people is limited (fortunately), filmmakers have not spared extremes in causing the worst possible cruelty to unfortunate animals in their pursuit of the more sadistic upheavals. The only thing that is shocking about this film is that it is a mention among others of the film, which is more convincing. If there are any removable features at all, Kerman is favorable if he is a one-dimensional leader, and his heat of scattered clothes (Agren, Lai and Senatore) provides a certain visual rest from inexorable murders.
