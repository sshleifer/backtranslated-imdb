The only reason I gave this episode of "Masters of Horror" and 2 instead of 1 is that the two main actors are good, and it wasn't shot on VHS. The story, dialogue and action are ridiculous. Speaking / Driving Zombies Returning to Vote and Swinging the Political Tide Against the War! Give me a break! What's next, zombies who return to jump? Maybe the zombies who return to the QVC host show? I have never supported the war in Iraq, but I support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces; and "Homecoming" was disrespectful in that it ridicules TRUE's horror of war. <br /> <br /> With zombies that are mass-produced in today's marketplace ... this is SPAM zombie related entertainment. How to "Homecoming" to do it on "Masters of Horror" is over.
