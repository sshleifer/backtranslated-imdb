I am shocked by all the good reviews on the cover of this movie and on IMDb. It belongs to the $ 2 basket in the local video store. To say it's a B movie, it's very generous. In addition to the lack of a fanciful character, just a little better than the average acting performance, and the ugly quality of the 80's-style picture, the film's script is boring. without life. This film is not only boring - it is pathetic. (It is true that there is sometimes a slightly interesting chemistry between the two main characters.) Even the last conspiracy conspiracy - rather the only conspiracy plot - doesn't save the film. <br /> <br /> Renting "Diamond Men" If you have to, but don't hesitate to turn it off once you find yourself worthless.
