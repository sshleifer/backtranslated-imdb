That was just a horrible movie. I once watched it when I was about 12 years old, I'm 19 now and I don't think I'll ever forget this movie. Every time I think about it, I'm still sick. Everything horrible that would fit into one movie. I really don't understand what kind of person could enjoy this sheer waste. It's not enough to turn your mind off to enjoy this movie, I can enjoy the dumbest movies made for Disney, as well as another person, but this is something completely different. Usually I do not like to judge a movie until I have seen it, but believe me to do you a favor. Don't watch this movie.
