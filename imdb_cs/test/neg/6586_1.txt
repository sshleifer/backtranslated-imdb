"Polar Express" was a horrible film. What makes this film the worst is hypocrisy to introduce itself as an innocent, sweet and harmless story for children about the "true" meaning of Christmas. I have never read Chris Van Allsburg's book in what was inspired, but it was most disappointing that it was directed by Robert Zemeckis, as well as the one who made a great movie "Who Framed Rabbit Roger", an excellent film where he proved that animation could To be rewarded for children and adults alike, while in this film it seems to have been a victim of its own ambitions and gives too much importance to create an impressive level of detail than an interesting story. "Polar Express" has as many artistic levels as an advertising campaign of video games or toys. Everything in this movie seems so lifeless: the characters might look like people, but they have nothing to wear and have a sinister touch in their eyes. But the worst ... is the "message" in this movie. You could have seen it on some parts of the movie and believe me it was ugly. For example, one scene where one boy refuses to enter the Polar Express. Note that a character who looks like Tom Hanks makes a gesture like saying "you're stupid not to accept my offer". Second, when a girl says the toys are so "warm" and similar things. All the damn movies that kids still talk about, how big the gifts Santa would give them. There is even a song about gifts! Vagabond is irrelevant and weak. And in the last scene, the character seems to "discover" the true meaning of Christmas: and what would it be? What do you think ? gifts! Many Christmas movies are close to what he says, but "The Polar Express" is an ode to materialism and greed. Seriously, I refuse to call it a "children's film," because if that's what children would learn, I don't want to think about how our future will be.
