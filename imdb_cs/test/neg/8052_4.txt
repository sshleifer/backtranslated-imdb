I watched Kindred for the first time in 1987, along with another film called absorbing waves. I remember then I hated them both and I never bothered to look at them again. However, recently I began to crusade to collect as many as 80 horror titles in their original boxed form that have been erased for some time. I have a pretty proud collection with many other titles on my list! Kindred, even though I don't have a copy yet, has a high priority, because I didn't like all the old movies back then, I'm now the owner and now I was looking again and I think they're brilliant and bits that I remember from Kindred, now forcing me to keep a copy of ASAP <br /> <br /> Hooray for the 1980s and a long live horror!
