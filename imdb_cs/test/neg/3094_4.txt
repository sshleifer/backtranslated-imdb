Directed by Alberta Pyun in his inimitably terrible but strangely hypnotic style, "Crazy Six" is another crown jewel for this ten upscale hugo haas (jess franco?). "Stylish" redirects, incoherent rendering, time-outs in action sequences for eurodisco torch-performances, all this seems to be a sign for our human Pyun. The most interesting thing is how he always gets a top b-cast compared to Wynorski or some of the other video directors. Ice-T, Rob Lowe, Mario Van Peebles, and the very strange Burt Reynolds aren't a bad cast, though they often look a little confused. Check out "Postmortem", "Mean Guns" and "Omega Doom" for more top-notch Pyun mayhem!
