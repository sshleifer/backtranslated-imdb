The series finally hits the rock-bottom with this miserable fourth installment that was (thank God) last. None of these three sequels made justice to the highly amusing original, but this particular film is nothing more than a shameless attempt to use the name "Magnificent Seven" and Bernstein's exciting musical theme. The production values ​​are similar to those made for a TV movie, and the characters are forgotten and indistinguishable: in the "II" and "III" sections you do not remember their names, nor do you remember their faces. Lee Van Cleef was an inappropriate choice for Chris's role, but no one could replace Yul Brynner in our minds anyway. Don't waste your time.
