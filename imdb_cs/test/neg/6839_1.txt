Ridiculously terrible. One might think that all the great actors involved in this film would have believed him at least, but no - this is stinky. <br /> <br /> Characters either sprint around without having a good reason to know where they are going, or stand around making faces jams when they should run for their lives. <br /> <br /> Check your higher brain function at the door if you intend to try to watch this movie. Or get a lot of your wisest friends together and give this treatment "Mystery Science Theater 3000" treatment. That's what I did over the other half of Turkey. And PLEASE don't confuse it with the superb movie "Jackal Day," a far better thriller 30 years ago.
