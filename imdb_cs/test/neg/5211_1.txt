How on earth were these guys put money to this movie? The lack of a script is one thing, but cinematography makes you cry. The handheld camera can be very valuable for the look and feel of a movie, but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. I am well aware that actors are amateurs, but it is not a defense, because the director could be the least talented man ever to run in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if (or anyone in the team accepted it) got the money to make the film again. This film simply gives fuel to the argument that too many films are made every year in Sweden.
