I don't know if this exceptionally boring movie was intended as an unofficial sequel to 'The French Connection', but it has many of the same drawbacks: the script is so confusing that the viewer remains unmanaged and feels missing from the image and the direction is so cold, so little energy that even a large sequence of persecution cannot revive things. (* 1/2)
