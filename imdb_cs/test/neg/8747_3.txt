Jessica is a young, virgin and very innocent girl who lives with her aunt on a remote ranch. Jessica is also a powerful psyche, capable of dowing, retro-cognition, precognition and esp. When young and handsome Gordon Hawthorne comes to visit, he is immediately skeptical of Jessica's powers ... until her skills reveal a lost watch and reveal an ancient treasury. However, the treasury holds separate heads of century dead satanist named Gideon Drew, whose powers are far stronger than Jessica's. Despite his evil warnings in their midst, Drew manages to mentally enslave every unhappy person to eye contact with him. But Drew wants Jessica the most. He needs his skills to reveal his body so that he can rise from the dead and control the human race. Will Jessica be a mighty fleur de lis, combined with Gordon's love, to turn away the ancient evil before it is destroyed by everyone? This is not a very interesting movie. Certainly it could be - the basic story is interesting and imaginative, but acting is lead and the whole thing is moving too slowly to attract. Jessica is also too innocent - almost uncomfortable, and Gordon, her love interest, is wooden, tough and totally emotionless. None of the characters is very likable and the low budget is painfully obvious. The rushing end will also not help matters. Avoid if it is not a MST3K version.
