can someone please help me when i missed the last moments and i don't want to pay money to see the whole movie again. I just got where they were on the train and she says, "What about the drink now?" and smiles. what happens next? is there a dialogue or action? surely it won't end? I was a little bored in the movie and I was hoping it would be better. I Love Kristen Scott Thomas remembers a British TV series in some nuns? I want to know the name. Sean Penn was a brilliant Madonna eating your heart out! each other in fact the movie a bit predictable, it was a 'star star cast'. The end took me by surprise, I really thought she had burned her ships ..... if you are a fan of some of the stars worth watching.
