The first few minutes, which showed the cold and crisp character of Willis, were very pleasant, especially with Jean Smart. This is just a hackney big man and a little irritating baby stuff from the way back without innovation at all. I know this casting apparently chose this baby to show that Willis was just as irritating in his younger self, but I found that this boy was very irritating and whinney.
