The first Bones season is played in Finland and I can't believe that the amount of bullshit this show puts - the characters are shallow, poorly directed and clumsy. He's a bad guy. Or actually a CSI without a continuous plot. Although Bones has the potential, he will not succeed by missing a director who could not rip the essence of the show from the actors. It's actually sad to see a show that threw it all away when it could be a descent show with just a little bit. From the beginning you will feel how uncomfortable acting is. Long story short - don't waste your time on Bones.
