Throughout his career, Hitchcock has made great movies; it wasn't one of them. Man knows too much, his daughter is kidnapped to secure silence, and in denouement everything is solved by escorting shooting and roof drama. Anyone who has seen Fritz Lang's films in the 1930s - "M" comes to mind, will know how far this urban crime and conscience story does not reach what was at that time in this genre. There is totally amateur air about much of the staging and playing that subverts some sense of threat, darkness and corruption that Hitchcock might have tried to instill. What's worth watching for, however, is the succession associated with shooting at the Albert Hall. Once it starts, it is as if the film had a blood transfusion. The camera is vivid, the cuts are interesting, and the way it combines everything with the top is masterful. Here you can see the future master: Hitchcock effortlessly organize all the resources for an impressive and unforgettable effect: when screaming comes you really feel as well as hear.
