A dull walk through the banality of Mormon prosthesis. Absolutely un-funny. It bears witness to the broad theory that in order to wake the bathroom it must necessarily be vulgar; it also encourages the claim that a close relationship with Jesus does not mean you witty. More propaganda than film, don't worry about any touch social issues that appear at the dinner table. The saving grace of this film is its exact depiction of young Mormon women as particularly attractive. Well, its $ 7.50.
