Toxic Avenger, an ugly deformed creature of super-human size and power, is back in this sequel that gets mostly everything wrong. Toxie goes to Japan to find her father at the suggestion of her psychiatrist, who is in conspiracy with an evil corporation who wants the Avenger to go to Tromaville in his absence. With the new actors for Toxie and his girlfriend, who has a different name in this matter, a much less grim, much more comical tone and conspiracy that can't hold the original candle. Even with a totally uncut version that can only be obtained when you buy a DVD Tox Box, it's the only thing that's happening for this model. And if you happen to be on ANY other version, forget that you're looking forward to it. While the first is a low-budget classic, it just isn't. <br /> <br /> My class: D + <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Erika Schickel has a very fast slide; Phoebe Legere goes upstairs; one villianess gets completely naked; and a few accessories in the bath scene show a variety of skins <br /> <br /> Tox Box unrated director of DVD Extras: Intro and commentary by director Lloyd Kaufman; Lloyd Kaufman's second commentary, editors of Tromo Gabriel Friedman and Brian McNulty; Toxie on Japenese TV; Interview with editor-in-chief Fangoria Michael Gingold; Interview with Videohound's Mike Mayo; the same damnation that is on EVERY THREE DVDs; Clip by Lisa Gaye; "Toxie 15 Years Later" mockumentary; 2 PSA; Troma Intelligence Test; Troma Studio Building Tour; Ad for Lloyd Kaufman's autobiography; Galerie statk≈Ø; Theater trailer; and trailers for: "Toxic Avenger", "Toxic Avenger 3", "Def by Temptation", "Class Nuke" Em High "," Sgt.
