Blake Edwards's legendary fiasco begins to seem unnecessary after just 10 minutes. The combination of Eagle landed, Star !, Oh! What is Lovely War!, And Edwards' Pink Panther movies, Darling Lili never deals with the viewer; Air sequences, music numbers, romance, comedy and espionage are all drone. At what point does the viewer have to give the heck? This catastrophe waving in tone, never deciding what it wants to be, and apparently thinks it's a spoof, but it's a pathetic and brilliant square. The audience was, in the worst sense, outdated and, of course, the audience was still in horror. That's horrible. James Garner would be a huge improvement over Hudson, which is just a carton, and he doesn't join Andrews and vice versa. And both Andrews and Hudson don't seem to be let go of the joke and act with a counted seriousness. Blake Edwards' SOB is no more than OK, but it's the only good thing that ever came out of Darling Lili. The expensive and professional look of many of Darling Lili, just what it is all that is even harder to carry. To quote Chief Paramount Robert Evans, "$ 24 million for film and no picture".
