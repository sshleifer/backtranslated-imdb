Uuuuaaa! Barf! Yuk! Yuk! Disgusting! Puke City! The worst piece of junk ever made. Sick. Strange. Grapes. He said enough. Hold your nose. Don't eat. After you see this sick, demented, film trash can, you won't be able to eat food for one week. But maybe it's good. A new diet was invented. Check out this vomiting movie. Getting into the stomach. And you will be so shut down by the whole mess that you can't eat at least a week, and you drop about 15 pounds. Me Me Lay! With such a name, it's really amazing that he doesn't have a "cult" fan. Heading as the worst actress ever. Her films make Ed Woods look like Gone With The Wind. This film rated minus 10.
