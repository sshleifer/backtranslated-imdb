You will be forgiven for such a title that you think this film is about the great Goya painter. After half an hour you decide that it is more of a Roman Catholic Inquisition. With even greater width, maybe it's just a snapshot of the season. With lurid characterization, too many axes to browse, and mistaken respect for fact, Milos Forman prepares himself for a varied but shambal, raging mish-mash that fails on all three accounts. Milos Forman Jewish father of Nazi concentration camps) is a great director who painted the artist Mozart as a fountain and got rid of him. In fact, he won awards for it. His life in Czechoslovakia gave him the taste of various, repulsive regimes, especially communism. He also made as over-the-top but somewhat formidable, One flew over the cuckoo's nest. So how did he offer me this mess at age 74? In Goya's spirits, Goya is one step removed from Buffalo. The main character is Brother Lorenzo, Javier Bardem has been passionately featured. Natalie Portman is as alive as Goya's Ines model (and later in the film, her own daughter). The slight connection with Goya is that it happens that they both paint them. Lorenzo tortures (and then rapes) Ines who suspects he's a Jew. Her father tortured Lorenzo. Napoleon beats up to free Spain (briefly). Ines leaves the prison where the church left her and looks for her baby. Goya is still painting them, but she is deaf. His main concern seems to be to help Ines. And so on. Historically, Goya was also a historian. As Forman, unfortunately, renounced the idea of ​​a biography of Goya painter, could this be used to pull the film together? a great deal of history as Goya sees it. But the painter is too tangential to gain any weight. Similarly, should a document on the horrors of the Inquisition be conducted? Compared to other oppressive commands over time, the Holy See was barely forgiven. Although one may ask if Forman is competent enough to be faithful to the factual description of anything. "I thought it might be the heart of a wonderful story," he says in production notes. "There were many parallels between the communist society we lived in and the Spanish Inquisition." But the story is too fragile to keep our attention. Against our expectations and against the background of something great (the life of a great painter, the horror of the Inquisition and even the French Revolution), we are instead asked to feel involved in the fictional (if kind) amusement of Goya. As a result, we feel cheated. <br /> <br /> The background detail is heavily processed. Goya went deaf in 1792 (when the movie begins), not 15 years later. Napoleon is as trustworthy as a cut out of a bale of cereals. We see that the Church is ruling death (when the normal procedure was for the Church to insist that the secular arm was doing this dirty work). Battles look too choreographed and theatrical. A beam of gratuitous naked barefoot will hardly come up with it. <br /> <br /> Positive is that production values ​​are mostly good. Colors are vivid, great stimulation (at least until we give up finding a useful story.) Bardem is excellent and Portman is delighted until he gets into a quick excitement like a mad woman. Although he doesn't say much about Goya what he says, he's nice, though superficial and quite irrelevant. Once I had a late night drunk conversation where I and my friends were asking, If you could choose a director to describe your life, who would it be? On his record, Forman would unfortunately have to be at the end of my list.
