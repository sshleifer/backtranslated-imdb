I got this movie as a birthday present because all my friends know I'm a big fan of horror fast moves. Kaufman Studios have always made the cheesy move. I loved to watch their movies at home on a rainy night with my family ... until I saw Bugged ... What happened? This movie started with a pretty good concept of mutation error and even added some smooth comedy, but overall writing is wrong and it was number one. Ronald K. Armstrong should first learn to be a better writer before becoming a filmmaker. After reading Credits, we find that he has played the most important role in the film! Two Words Mr. Director "Acting Lessons" OK? Armstrong joins the ranks of other writers / directors who plunge into their own films, and that's number two. The only thing I believed to have saved this movie was an art camera and a musical score (let's hear it for the crew!) The cast of other actors who looked a bit cold at the beginning of this production half and the end of this production. Everyone pulled back and helped shut the movie off. Ronald Armstrong may lack talent to become a decent director or actor, but I'll tell him - he seems to know how to organize people to unite them all and release his productions. <br /> <This film, I must say, can be an inspiration for any young filmmaker who dreams of making his own film, because if someone else can do it, Armstrong can do it. If you have a chance to see this movie, watch it for you to be inspired to "Better" in the future. Hollywood needs a bigger and better Horror Flicks to get this genre back from its grave.
