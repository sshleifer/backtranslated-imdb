I went to see this movie with a friend. I looked quickly and read a brief overview and thought it was interesting. We came out of movies that don't feel very good if we don't like it. The acting was good enough and the connection to the characters was fine. The main character I thought was like someone like Van Helsing. Yes, it was pretty fun. But the story I felt was used from other movies. The script was a bit weak, I'm not sure why every time something bad happens, the main character always says "Oh my God". Special effects worked fine, but (sorry for the spoiler) the main monster at the top was reminding me of a lot of Lord Balrok of the Rings. Overall, the movie was fine, but I felt it was done. Go and take a look at buying all the resources, but don't expect too much.
