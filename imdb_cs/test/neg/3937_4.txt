Daniel Auteuil's Bruno in Petites Couperes is a middle-aged model of Pierre's La Separation Christian Vincent 10 years ago. In both films, youthful belief in left-wing ideology and love (mutual metaphors) breaks down into paranoia - manifested as traps in Pierre's aggression and desperately comical femaleization in the newer Bruno. Unfortunately for the fans of Auteuil, the actor became addicted to the unified world-fatigue (not dissimilar to compatriot Johnny Hallyday in Leconte's recent l'Homme du train). It is not, and it becomes somewhat frustrating how the film progresses. Pascal Bonitzer does not help as a writer / project director. His sequencing of episodes overlaid with linking symbolism fails to mask the lack of film rhythm. In particular, I was angry that the incredibly dramatic / romantic scenery of Grenoble was virtually superfluous for the cameraman, who was apparently shivering in the winter. Krisitn Scott Thomas almost saved the show with his female counterpart Bruno, Beatrice. It dramatizes dizzying contradictions intended as Bruno in the nature of increasing complexity until it becomes unreal. But Bonitzer can't keep it and the flowing land requires Beatrice to go to another bourgeois mannequin. Bonitzer shows that he is denying Scott Thomas the Oscar Cabinet. All immersion of the characters into the bourgeoisie can be a viable and truly tragic result, but in this case it is a cadence hill (unlike the brutal, painful denouement of La Separation). Serious disappointment, 4/10.
