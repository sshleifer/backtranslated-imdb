Jack Frost 2 was a terrible, horrible, unfortunately pathetic excuse for continuing a great movie. The original, low budget comedy horror movie about the murdered who was turned into a snowman after an accident with some poisonous waste. And the snowman went past the murdering people and avoided the dryers like the plague. However, this was far from the quality of the original. It looks like this has even had a lower budget because for some reason I haven't seen a snowman after the hour of this movie. Some revenge he will get if he is always in the form of ice cubes with a shabby voice and a small radiator shake, which is to give the character an animation. Disappointed to no faith, even for a bad cinema fan.
