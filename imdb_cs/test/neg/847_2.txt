Actually, I was looking forward to this movie. After reading a few reviews before the release, it sounded like a really nice movie that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting movie (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt.) But it's so boring that I resist almost anyone who sits throughout this range and keeps attention. Also, Cage's attempt to speak with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad. He's such a good actor that I've always been in this movie every time. "Disappointed" seems to be the most commonly used word of reviewers to describe this film, and I totally agree. I think it didn't take long. The word get out about how bad this movie was because, like Cage's accent, it didn't do well.
