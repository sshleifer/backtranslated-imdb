A moderately interesting start, a nice scene in Japan from the 16th century and a promising idea. But execution? A comparison coming out of mind after about fifteen minutes is "Cannibal Women in Avocado Jungle of Death". Really. A specialist in "oriental history" who does not speak any Japanese, walks on the tatami without removing the shoes, and is generally stupid as a celery? Please. It looks like a student movie: the files are risible, acting (except, perhaps, for the title character) close to the wooden, plot absolutely arbitrary. At least "Cannibal Women" was funny! This is best watched with someone who knows something about Japan just to watch their bride crawl repeatedly on her face.
