Now I saw two films by director Chen Kaige, very good (Farewell my concubine), and the bad one, The Assassin. Both films depict key events in Chinese history, the 20th century FMC and TA's first unification of the entire Chinese nation in the 3rd century BC. FMC succeeded with unforgettable characters, beautiful cinematography, convincing sets, good acting and an interesting story. Assassin fails at almost every level (fine, kits are great, cinematography is good and a few battle scenes are quite exciting). But ... pathos. Call me a cynic, but too much is too much. If you have felt that Saving Private Ryan is too pathetic, remember that you will be sick. Dialogue is lifeless, many lines appear to be political statements, subtle or entertaining, it's not pic. The film is overwhelmed by its own pomposity. I am really surprised that Assassin here has such high voices on imdb. 4/10
