If you're a fan of slap-stick who has horrible writing, horrible play and clichÃ© clichÃ©s, this is for you. There's too much on the list of reasons why this movie sucks. In brief, people with a combined iq 100 trips to New Mexico to race for $ 200 million. And yes, they're all probably super heroes because they can do many things, such as jumping on trains that travel 80+ mph, surviving numerous car accidents and endless cases of direct cartoonish roadrunner and coyote antics. If you're a teen, or you don't want to think about a movie, this is for you. Not one actor outside Lovitz is believable. Lovitz saves the movie from 1 with Hitler's bit. > <br /> 2/10 (save 2 hours of pain and $ 4)
