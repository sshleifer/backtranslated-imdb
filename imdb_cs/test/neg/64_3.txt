It only gets bash because it's David Hasselhoff. Well, then let me. Compared to the garbage they call today, this film is not too bad. She has a beautiful Leslie Cumming. He's super hot, but he can't speak very well. She's a great scene with her being supernaturally raped. He shows off his nice body. Linda Blair does nothing here, just like Hasselhoff. 3/10
