ONE ONLY, I'd like to see Koontz's work dedicated to a decent screenwriter, director and producer! ONLY ONE! This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon, and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant, but everything else is pure clean waste. The screenplay should be filmed for leaving Koontz's work that way and director ... please. The story is a well-written story, but the script is quite boring, incredible and terribly executed. The only elements that work are LeClerc, Sarandon and Tennant. <br /> <br /> On a personal note I really wanted it to work. I love Koontz's novels, but they have never given them the attention, support, and talent they deserve. If they had put the same money in Koontz's work that would have shoveled the King's barrels, Koontz would have risen quickly. But unfortunately! Without the powerful people who believe in his work, I'm afraid he'll never get a chance. As an adaptation to the novel, this film was absolutely fun. It was not as bad as a separate film, though in many places with large conspiracy holes and terrible, tough, unprofessional dialogues that should never get into the final cut. This film has failed miserably to fulfill its potential. If they followed the original work of Koontz, a little more detail, and they would invest a decent amount of production money, it could be much easier. However, everything in this, how good it could have been, and wasn't. <br /> <br /> Rated 4.3 / 10 of ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
