And now for another look: I didn't like it. In fact, I didn't finish it. I know "Unforgiven" is rated by some as one of the biggest westerns he has ever done. I know stars and director Clint Eastwood, one of the icons of American film. I know he won a lot of Oscars. Still, I didn't like it. I don't like Westerns, and that is definitely a matter of taste, but I also don't admire Eastwood's actions. He's not and never been a leading man. Not Burt Lancaster, no Paul Newman, no John Wayne. In this film himself is the dwarf Richard Harris and Gene Hackman; both are actors. No, Eastwood is a tall guy with a voice that usually plays hard guys. Here he plays a tough retired guy. When I see him on the screen, I see a man working on his acting. Then there's the anti-west west. It is too obviously intended to bring present values ​​- respect for the role of women, blacks, Native Americans and single parents; disrespect for violence and drinking; The health service that comes with marriage, including interracial marriage, and little cute babies - into a century in which these values ​​were not necessarily accepted, at least in these ways. By promoting these values, the film meets as well-educated, if not preacher. Then there are horrible movie stereotypes - prostitutes with gold hearts, a guy who can't shoot straight, the city is new to the wild west, sage glitters on a summer afternoon with music in the main chords. Finally, there is a way down Eastwood's direction. I gave up after an hour. Eastwood was still in the north, chatting with Morgan Freeman and the guy who couldn't shoot straight, sixty minutes after the prostitute's plot started. It was too slow. Someone had to find these elements uncomplicated. I'm afraid it was me.
