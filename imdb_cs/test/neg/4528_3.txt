In another unfortunate attempt to make a fast Hollywood cash-in of one of the biggest TV works, Peter Segal created a monster. If a person were out of context, if you didn't know Brooks' work before watching, it would be a movie that would be a big lame budget that is not sure if it wants to be a fat joke and a silly comedy, or just an ordinary action movie with nothing further. However, as the young generation of Y'er, who just recently spent two months obsessing over the five seasons of the Get Smart TV show, the 60s, I've seen Steve Carell crushing since I entered. Stories, Agent 99 get a plastic surgery and 86 as an analyst who was previously morbidly obese, defamates the complexity of the original duo and carries their boring re-evaluation. The screenwriters, unable to be truly witty both in dialogue and in the situation, seem to have fallen back on lame sets for the famous Don Adams line, fat camp flashbacks, links to Carell's office role in camera-style interviews they have, and female chauvinism that fits on the face. <br /> <br /> For those who saw the original, the writers of this film thought they would include some memories. They mentioned Herbie, Fang (now a worthless petty little dog that Carell is covering up), a shoe phone, a cone of silence, and his classic red car and door and phone that showed off the show. Classical music is back, but now everything is updated, generally worse. The cone of silence is now some strange blue telekinetic force field, the headquarters headquarters right below the museum that protects the past of Control. The film lacks any creative random technique and replaces it with crossbows in Swiss knives. Lots of "humor" in the movie's Carrel hurts itself, or another character is hurt, whether it's Karel spending two minutes shooting himself by accident with a crossbow, or getting punched security guards, or throwing up in airplanes. In the original, Smart would offend a great enemy, attack him without success, and try to mate with him before getting pulverized. In this, he attacks without success and gets pumped. It seems that the screenwriters have not understood that humor has arisen with dialogue and not unnecessary violence. It is as if they took the names from the show and cut everything that was good in the first place. The poster hides Carell's face beyond Hathaway's. The film also avoids everything that could be good. They reveal classical music with excessive dramatic action and romantic music in large films. While the original radiated the feel of the camp, this replaced the quality with massive doses of cgi blasts and sound effects. I was really looking forward to this, because I finished my original series two months ago and joined my five best shows of all time. But that was a huge disappointment. Loans say they worked with Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, but in all the things I read on the Internet, they were largely omitted from the writing process. Finally, if you want to waste money on small value cash and whatever your name tag, go for it. But be prepared that the ride is not what you remembered. PS: I almost forgot about George Bush's humor. They mentioned "Nuculor", falling asleep at the fine arts, the president's job for their vice president, and valuing problems to solve real problems. If you have heard the same jokes that you have heard 3 - 4 years ago in a large budget movie form, chuck your money here.
