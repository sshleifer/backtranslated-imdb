Adenoid Hynkel, a weak soldier in the First World War, rises in the coming years to become a reckless dictator of Toumania. Creates an aggressive, anti-Semitic war machine and cultivates a little mustache on a toothbrush. Sounds like anyone you know? From the safety of Hollywood, Chaplin uses this soap box to challenge Europe to take up arms and resist Hitler and Mussolini. Given that the United States had more than a year of neutrality in 1940 and no strong desire to get involved in European civil disputes (remember that it was Hitler who declared the US war, not the other way around) it is surprising that Chaplin it was allowed to spread this absurd controversy. The story includes, on the one hand, the vulgar and repulsive Hynkel and the reign of terror over which he unjustly presides, and life in the Jewish ghetto, where every person is friendly, humane, brave, etc., Chaplin is Hynkel, and also plays a Jewish barber, a little ghetto hero (Tramp in Everything but Name). Needless to say, Chaplin writes, directs, stars, composes music and does food. In 1940, the complete truth about the Third Reich was not yet known, and Chaplin could be forgiven for something less. than a perfect historical foresight, but also according to the standards of the day when Hitler is wrong. Chaplin, a comedian and sentimentist, tries to ridicule Hitler by making Hynek silly and unhappy. All this is his humanization. When Hynkel's fools of soldiers who are not very warlike, with a large gun and aircraft upside down, become more adorable than scornful. As a dictator, he controls the technical innovations of his subordinates that do not work (parachute, bulletproof uniform, etc.), and these passages aim to think that the Nazis in real life are incompetent and can be swept aside. In fact, Hynkel's regime is adorable and sympathetic to his tormenting body. In truth, Chaplin's day has passed when he did it wrongly regarded as a controversy. There was still a silent screen in the heart of the dinosaur (look at the humor, the gags that roam up and down the street semi-natural, or the pantomime coins in the pudding). The hero of Schultz is to present a scale of European grace against which Hynkel can be judged, but Schultz looks more like a character from an operetta than a Nazi. Is it somehow plausible that Schultz's character (if any) would tell FÃ¼hrer's face, "your cause is doomed to failure because it is based on a stupid, reckless persecution of innocent people"? And how does Schultz get into the cellars of the Jewish ghetto? If he's subject to an exhaustive search, why is he staying in a Ruritan uniform? Chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of Auschwitz-Birkenau or Treblinka, but the Nazi concentration camp he offered us was hopelessly a kilto with a gloomy spirit. As usual, Chaplin thinks they are "quiet" comedies that are loosely hanging on narrative clothes. There is a knock out scrapping with stormtroopers, shaving a man to escort Brahms, and a ballet globe (watch the segment filmed in the opposite direction). Paulette Goddard is constantly perfect Hannah. Just as the ghetto people are incredibly nice and the Jewish refuge in Osterlich is ridiculously idyllic, Hannah is literally too good to be true. Brave, defiant, resourceful, hardworking and (of course) beautiful, she is a canary of Judaism in a ghetto cage. "Gee, am I not cute?" she asks, after Barber gives her makeup. Too cute is the answer. She wouldn't approach her because Chaplin made her a cartoon. "Wouldn't that be wonderful?" the speech Chaplin puts in his mouth is typical of the author - too disturbing, too emotionally cloning. Jack Oakie is great as Napaloni, a fascist dictator of bacteria. It brings a whiff of much needed comics brio to the controls, but the basic weakness of the film remains. If Napaloni is stupid and ineffective, how can we fear him? And yet, the stuttering stop-start back-projected train is a subtle Chaplinesque example of a gag that persists with far beyond its comic values. And where did the Jewish Barber get that spotless Hynkel uniform?
