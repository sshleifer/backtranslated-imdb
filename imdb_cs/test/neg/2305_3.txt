Jacqueline Susann has written several novels related to sex and melodrama, and a few of them were actually made in films, including this effort, and they all have the difference that they are one of the worst films ever made. The story is about Robin Stone (John Phillip Law) and his rise to the top of the television by being ruthless and counting for everyone around him. It is the worst kind of playboy that uses and then discards any woman he has, including the wife of the president's IBC network. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Greg Austin (Robert Ryan) is in charge of the television network IBC and when his younger wife, Judith looks at Robin, do not lose time with him. Greg gets sick and has to take a break, and that's where Robin enters and tries to run the net, but all the time this Amanda (Jodi Wexler), who is in love with him, kills him. As Greg returns to his work, he tries to get Robin out of his moral clause in his treaty, where rumors start to fly about his relationship with Jerry Nelson (David Hemmings), a homosexual photographer. directed by Jack Haley Jr., who continued to be a very successful producer on both television and film, but that was his second film as a director and material that seemed to be over head! The screenplay comes from Susanna's novel and would probably be the reason why it resembles a cross between "Alpha" and "Valley of the Dolls" and I think the reason why her books have never been able to translate well into a movie is that the filmmakers did A terrible mistake to take her stories seriously instead of tongue to face. With that, the laughter that comes from this is unintentional, especially during this totally ridiculous fight at the end of the movie, which begins when Cannon refuses to give a slave bracelet to homosexuals! Hemmings was a very good actor, but his role here is upstairs and wears one of the worst beards in history and uses the term "chic" in every other sentence. The law was not the original choice for leadership, but another actor who was cast had a serious accident and the law entered and delivers one of the more wooden performances of this party to Miles O'Keeffe. The film's scenario suffers in two different areas in that it's totally stupid and terribly boring and will test the audience's patience if they decide to follow it. One has to wonder what the result would be if the director decided to make one of Susanna's novels and didn't take it seriously because the experiment is cumbersome and ridiculous.
