I admit that I was taken into the provocative photo of Charlotte Lewis from this film, as well as a commentary on the IMDb message board dedicated to it, called this picture "great underrated film". So I got my own copy of "Dialing Help" with great difficulty. <br /> <br /> What a waste. Nothing but cheaply produced blood and gore film with a ridiculous assumption that I won't repeat, with several telegraph sequences (for example, when we see Lewis lovingly feeding fish, we know what happens to them later). Even Lewis, with his beautiful raven hair, big and light brown eyes, full and handcuffed lips and a stunning figure, can't save this film. Lewis fans would be better off with "Bare Essentials", "Sketch Artist", or even "Golden Child".
