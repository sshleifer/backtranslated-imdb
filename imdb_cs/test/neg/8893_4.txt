This movie came very close to being a good movie. The direction must be a little smoother to move from one piece to another to make it more plausible. In particular: The main character needs to escape is not explicit enough. Trying to kill? Is he trying to escape? His life doesn't seem so bad, so it's harder to swallow that he wants to leave his life so much. Also, it is not entirely clear how much "in love" fell with Jennifer Jason L. If the film was reworked with more attention to these details, it would be great. On the other hand, for inattentive movement it's pretty good! Maybe if you have a few drinks to dull the logical thinking, it would be more fun ... <br /> <br />
