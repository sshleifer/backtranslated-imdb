Mao Zedong and Karl Marx didn't appear in hell, but Ronald Reagan is in the same room with Hitler? We may have to wait for these Californian rotary physicians to show carver Paradis that they have all their political ideological figures. Fox News, even the SUV. All the radically left-wing spots were too completely covered - even though they clearly missed the "other side of the aisle" wrongdoing - not to be conscious. The unique exception I noticed in an hour and a half is that JFK must have sex with Marilyn Monroe for eternity.
