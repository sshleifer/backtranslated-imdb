In one sense, I like this movie because it is a "thoughtless", positive atmosphere that it represents. I had a problem with the conspiracy aspect, but later on. First, the characters were a little goofy and one-dimensional. "Good people" had similar physical and character traits and "bad people" had similar physical and character traits ... hmmm. The basic story was OK (quite simple and standard) - nothing too exciting or unpleasant. The main attraction was of course the miniature dinosaurs - a kind of nice fantasy element. However, they had a very minimal presence in the film. Besides, the movie kept a brisk pace and didn't get too set down in one place. I liked the movie. The problem I had with the chart had to do with the idea of ​​"theft." I think this film may not have been well thought out - something bad, especially if it's a children's movie. I will keep the next sentence of the abstract so that it is not a spoiler (skip if you are afraid). 'Good guys' are doing some theft and don't have the same information that the audience has - so it's just stealing and that's something wrong with the children's movie. Overall, if you have children, because of the controversial aspect of the conspiracy I would consider going through. However, this whole movie is pretty low key as well, so it may not be important. Pass this if you have other interesting options.
