This film gives a new meaning to the term "uneven", which gives us some interesting characterizations that are compensated by an unpleasantly conspired plot that rests on several well-placed fingers that bring most of the excitement. The conspiracy involves a group of men who have a mystery within them that has caused a curse on them in the form of a ghostly female revelation that causes death. She can also seduce her sons. It's pretty spectacular that all the notable veterans together in one movie, but unfortunately are not very convincing, especially the scene where Melvyn Douglas goes off the deep end begging the others to listen to him. It's not a shock then that actors who play the same characters in these youths are terrible, especially giggling Ricky. They add the worst gee-aren't-we-all-drunk scene I've ever watched. The film has several austerity charms, namely Dick Smith's great make-ups (but they have a bad location) in this movie), and the fascinating performance of Alice Krige as Alma / Eve. I have never read the novel from which this movie was taken, but after reading some other reviews on this page I intend to. However, you do not need to read the book to realize that it is only a shadow of the original story. There is a good story, but it seems to be lost somewhere, in the middle of an exposure that shows that men have nightmares over and over again and make indecent references to the secrets they all share. <br /> <br /> It seems that about half an hour of recording has been removed from this print, especially near the top. After all ... how is it that Fred Astaire can dig a pond so fast? What are Gregory Bate and the boy with Eva? And when we're at it ... what the hell was that? Why let her out of the car to make the revelation disappear? If it was a revelation, how could it have sex with two men and let them know? These and other questions will never be answered, at least not by this movie. If there are no restored shots somewhere, curiosity with some craving makeup, bizarre sexual scenes and nudity and some interesting performances will probably remain forever.
