Gang is back for more! Ron Howard and Cindy Williams are now married! Her brother demonstrates against the proposal and Charles Martin Smith does everything he can in Vietnam to send home. Problems of the 1960s appear here, but it's everywhere, from New Year's Eve 1963, then three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1964, then three minutes later, it's New Year's Eve 1965, then three minutes later, it's back to 1963 again. Martin Smith talks about his friend dying in drag dragons a year ago, and a few scenes later, this friend wins his next heat in the drag and drag event all over, the drug scene and the flower kids enter the picture (or in some cases up to three different camera shots are displayed on the screen at once). <br /> <br /> If you want to watch this movie, you have to watch this movie, but I would advise you to stick to the original and leave it there. Wolfman Jack is heard at the beginning of the movie before almost every song in the background, but where did he go? Maybe he couldn't keep up with this movie and didn't stop! 2 out of 10 Stars!
