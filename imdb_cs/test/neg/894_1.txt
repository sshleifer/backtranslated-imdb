(Spoilers ahead!) The same accurate chart from this movie was made earlier. This was done on Ferris Bueller's Day! Marques "Bat Man" Houston plays ill. His gullible parents believe him. His sister knows he's pretending, but he still has to go to school! She's crazy. He has a party with his friends while his parents are gone. When his parents return home, he is sick again and his parents have never found out about this side. I love Immature better when they were at House Party 3 and not yet mature!
