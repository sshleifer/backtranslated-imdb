Well, I didn't know what to expect from the 555. I never heard of it until a few months ago. But when I am a collector of almost all types of horror movies, I thought I would continue to catch this obscure 80-year-old slasher. in a row. What does the third 5 in the name mean ... no one knows. Anyway, killing begins when the killer is looking for young teenagers who are fooling around in dark places. Men decapitate and brutally knock the woman to death. After this, he continues to rape a dead corpse. Police think they have a leading role in killing, but they really have no idea what's going on. How do they find the killer? Does anyone care? <br /> <br /> This movie is full of some of the worst actors I've ever seen. No wonder none of these actors did anything else, literally. The three main actors consist of two detectives and a "sexy" reporter. I'm sarcastic when I say sexy, she's about as un-sexy as she gets. Two detectives are like watching twins and twins. One of them is undergoing his part and the other can go to Satner's school of acting. Acting is so bad it almost compels you to lose your interest in the film, so you almost sleep. For a movie about this budget, the creators need to put all the money in special effects that aren't that great yet. <br /> <br /> If you're not like me and you don't have to own every single horror movie, I'd suggest that this movie be removed. 4/10
