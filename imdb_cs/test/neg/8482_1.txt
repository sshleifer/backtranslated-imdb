OK, about 11 years ago, the amazing, funny movie "Mask" came out and everyone loved it and now, 11 years later, the mask is brought back to this amazing movie? POORLY!!!!!!!!!! This movie was the dumbest movie I've ever seen !! I mean, when I rented it I thought I would laugh so hard that I would almost pee my pants like the first one. but after seeing this "sequential" and barley, he even laughed. I don't mean the director or the cast of this movie, but what is a waste of time and money. So, the plot of the whole story was about this little baby who has a mask in it, and this bad one is for him some thing, because that's all I really got, at least I would add other things to it. so it would be higher than 2 out of 10 stars.
