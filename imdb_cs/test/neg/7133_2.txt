People can say I'm cruel, but I can't help it. The film is so bad that I was absolutely overwhelmed. The first movie was bad enough to ask me. It was very exaggerated and stupid, but this, despite the scary scenes, has a serious butt-stupid story. They actually went deep into the investigation of Kayako's past and found that she had a mother (who miraculously speaks English) who was an exorcist and "nurtured" the evil spirits to her daughter. Stupid? Yeap. OK, it started with Kayak, who was an ordinary housekeeper who had an affair with a block and got dead. This section is still fine. Because of this moment of anger she became a vengeful spirit that kills anyone who enters her house. Can be used. Her murders began to stretch, where she could travel around Tokyo to complete her victims. (Her victims traveled, didn't I?) That hit me hard. If the spirit could actually do something like traveling around the country without paying public transport fares, I wouldn't mind being. Ask someone to kill me, then * snorts *. And the crown all up, the ghost that was once portrayed as very vengeful (In Ju-on: Grudge, which was better than this waste) is now portrayed as a scarecrow that really enjoys and felt it was her mission to finish people. Things got worse (for me, the viewer) when the spirit came into the form of large strands of hair. I think, ??? If the spirit had such power, I would have thought it was one. I never liked movies showing ghosts like MONSTERS because they're not. Overall results are just bad. Like The Grudge 2. With a better scene and less exaggeration, this show would be better
