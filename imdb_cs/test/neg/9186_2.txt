"Smell to the East" was a great disappointment for me. But the saddest thing about this movie is that it has turned out to be John Candy's last film role (he died just before the film was finished). There is just a few laughs throughout this western spoof, and for a comedy that's not cut it. If you want to see the scary spoof of western movies, the answer is obvious. See Mel Brooks' classic "Blazing Saddles". Or if you want to see Candy in much better material, see "Summer Hiring", "Spaceballs", or "Uncle Buck" (just to name a few). These three films (as well as others) show us what a great comic actor he was. Unfortunately, "Wagons to the East" is not. Damage! <br /> <br /> * (of 4)
