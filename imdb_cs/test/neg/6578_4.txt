I like dogs. 12 years after I first saw Star Trek V and thought it was bizarre bad, I gave him a second watch, I hope I can find some redeeming quality that I missed for the first time. <br /> <br /> Not at all. Writing is half-baked, and although the quality of acting is stable enough at first glance to keep the film on its feet (though shaky), the more we get into the Sillier plot gets it. The last quarter of the movie is just ridiculous. Worse still, the original POV movie is that it was the first ST movie to be released after the next Generation franchise franchise, and the average Next Generation episode would shame it * - including special effects! What embarrassment. The Final Frontier is not thoroughly pathetic - I gave it 4 out of 10 - but it's so far below the standard of its predecessors (yes, including the first), the reason I think to watch it is, that you will appreciate more movies more. <br /> <br /> * If it's not an episode with Troi's mother in it.
