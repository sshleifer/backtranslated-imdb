Last night I saw 12:45 hours and I'd go out for 20 minutes. inside, but there was nowhere to go! Apparent product placement, teenage script, so many talents that they fell off, homosexuals ... what didn't they do? The film is also insanely long (we have 3). As a man who rarely pays full price in movies, imagine I chose $ 22 for this benevolent, pernicious nightmare (plus two parking spaces). I woke up today and felt depressed, and I couldn't shake it all day. I love Vince Vaughn, and he seemed to have lost himself on this, just like I did. When the Cedric Entertainer is a sign of high water (a man so extraordinarily entertaining that he has to be called "entertainer" so you understand what he thinks he is doing), you have a serious problem. Also Robert Pastorelli's performance is fine because he died almost a year ago (March 10). This should give you an idea of ​​how long it rubs. This film is for the bitter end. We stayed just to make sure they didn't give Robert "In Remembrance", which he didn't. Zachran se! Save your money! Save Your Soul!
