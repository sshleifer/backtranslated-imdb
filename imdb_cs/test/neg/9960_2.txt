OK, this movie seems pretty well covered with earlier comments, but there's a few things I want to add. A mad scientist produces a serum from the animal's blood in a cage to make him a werewolf. If we suspend our mistrust so that we can buy it, all right. But the animal in the cage is a coyote. That would mean it would be becoyote. Did the audience know the difference between the wolf and the coyote in 1942? They are easily recognizable. That's weak. Second, this movie was included in the third episode of MST3k (on Comedy Channel). It took Joel and the shoes a few episodes to get to the full riffing steam, and they weren't there yet. DID added enough to this snoozer to keep you awake, but it wasn't one of their better episodes. They never even mentioned how the wolf actually disappeared, and the joke just hung in the air and waited for it to break.
