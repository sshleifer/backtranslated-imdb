1993 was a time of change in WWE but for this Wrestlemania they decided to return the clock as Hulk Hogan returned, along with his good friend Brutus Beefcake, who was off the match from the paragliding accident in 1990. <br /> <br /> this big event. Only two games had a real construction, and the whole thing seemed hurrying. The ring action wasn't great and the end twist that I was going to discuss later wasn't really where WWE hoped it would be. This forgotten night began with Shawn Micheal defending his intercontinental championship against the undefeated Tatanka. Tatanka defeated several times Michaels leading to the fight. Michaels had a new manager, Luna Vachon, while Tatanka was accompanied by former manager Michaels and future WWE Hall of Famer Sherri Martel. Tatanka won DQ. Michaels kept his title and went straight back to his dispute with Marty Janetty, who was only detained for Wrestlemania. Why, I have no idea. Another saw Steiner Brothers (Scott and Rick) beat Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) with Scott scoring a pin after hitting Sam with the Frankensteiner. Good match. Doink the Clown needed help from another clown to win the match against Crush. The second Doink distracting Crush when he had complete control and allowed Doink to get the pin and victory. Doink was a fun character who cares fast and fast. Razor Ramon easily defeated Bob Backlund in the following match. This brings us to the first in our dual main event. As a Mega Maniacs team, Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake, with the newly transformed guy Jimmy Hart in their corner, took Hart's former friends Money Inc (Ted DiBias and Irwin R Shyster). It was quite a superficial surface. Beefcake, as mentioned, was in a paragliding accident that required full facial surgery, and struggled with a face mask. Shyster snatched the mask from him and beat Beefcake on the flesh. The referee went down, Hogan grabbed his face mask and knocked out DiBias and Shyster, and then Hart, wearing the referees shirt, counted three. Another ref came and reversed the decision to announce the winners of Money Inc by DQ. Another Lex Lexer or Narcissist as was also known at the time defeated Mr. Perfect. This match took place because Lugera was led by Bobby Heenan, Perfecta's old manager. Perfect had legs on ropes when he was clipped but ref missed it. The Undertaker raised a faint DQ victory in a fairly bad match against Giant Gonzales. In 1992, the Undertaker earned the crime of Gonzales' manager Harvey Wippleman and Taker defeated his great monster Kamal at the Survivor Series. Wippleman promised revenge and took him to the Royal Rumble when Gonzales attacked Takera, which cost him a match. Gonzales dominated the Undertaker in this match, but DQ'd was for choking Taker out with chloroform. Strange ending for a bad match. This bought us at our main event when WWE champion Bret Hart won for the first time, seriously attacked as a champion, giving his title to the fight against Mr. Fuji Yokozun's unstoppable monster. Yokozuna drove early departure, but Hart resisted and then took control. He had Yokozuna in sharpshooter, surely he would put in and Hart would be founded as a heroic hero after taking a great monster. But Fuji had other ideas, throwing salt in Hart's face, making the Canadian helpless as Yokozuna got the pin. <br /> <br /> What downer ends. But wait here Hulk Hogan. He checks Hart to make sure he's okay. Suddenly, Fuji calls Hogan to the WWE title right there and there. Hogan accepts it. Fuji throws salt to Hogan, but hits Yokozuna instead. Hogan hits his leg and wins the match and title. What was I watching? And so what most fans thought would be the night when we either saw Hart, who had established himself as a giant murderer, or Yokozuna had established itself as an unstoppable monster, instead we saw Hulk Hogan who won the insignificant title. A title that wouldn't protect in three months. In fact, it was the only match Hogan wrestled for WWE before King Ring PPV in June 1993.
