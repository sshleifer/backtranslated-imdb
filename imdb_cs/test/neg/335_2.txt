I have made great efforts to read this film after reading the comments on this site. I really don't have time to write reviews, but I felt it was my duty as a science fiction horror buff. This is just the second review I wrote. The second was for Dracula 3000. Now to the point. This film was sucked. Simple and simple. I was still wondering if I was watching the same movie as those who wrote all the "beautiful" comments. I saw movies with bad effects, bad behavior, bad sound, you name it and I saw it. But this is really soaked. I don't care how much it costs or not, so movies like this and Dracula 3000 should be banned and the entire cast and crew arrested and imprisoned for time murder. By the way, I mentioned that he licked this film. I mean really sucked. The plot was non-existent and the negotiations were weak. It looks like the writer saw Pitch Black and angry because he didn't think such a story was the first, so he decided to make his own torn version. But instead he took over and dropped him. DO NOT PLACE THIS. You will have more fun if you pull down your pants and sit on the burning charcoal.
