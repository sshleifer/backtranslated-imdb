I think there are two ways to make a movie with children as an intended audience. You can either say: a) "Let's make a movie that kids will love today!" or b) "Let's make a movie that I love when I was a child!" The second approach explains why Steven Spielberg often makes films that appeal to a younger audience. The main examples are E.T., Goonies or Indiana Jones. That Darn Cat is an example of the first approach. You see these flat, incredible characters who say things to be funny, but not. The plot itself is sufficient for ten minutes, but instead goes on and on. And even if I'm not a child, I don't understand what the children's fun should be in this movie? The clumsy cops chased the dog, the old lady with tweety bird or the sarcastic clerk Christina Ricci? One actor showed a spark of talent with his very acrobatic humor: Doug E. Doug plays an FBI agent.
