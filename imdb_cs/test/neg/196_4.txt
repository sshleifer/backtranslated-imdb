I loved Miloš Forman's movies since I saw "One Fly Over the Cuckoo's Nest" and "Amadeus" (two big works), but when I saw "Hair", I wondered if it's the same Miloš Forman. This film is at least boring and uninteresting. OK, the music is pretty good, but the screen seems to be a lot of dazed people dancing around (wait a minute ... that's what it really is!). The only interesting part and the only part where Milos's talent appears is the last 15 minutes or so (SPOILER !!) because Berger takes Claude's place as a soldier who joined the Vietnam War. That's 15 minutes that are moving and well-directed, but it's a pity that we have to endure so much terrible material before that. Well, maybe it's one of those movies that you have to be "on the subject" to enjoy (the subject being marijuana, acid and other drugs celebrating the movie).
