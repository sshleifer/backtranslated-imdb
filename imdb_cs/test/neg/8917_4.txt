Today, Die was the 4th Seagal movie in the mini marathon I just held. Wow, I don't know where to start. His line seems to be increasingly muttering as time goes by, and the scenes between Seagal and Treach where they seem to improvise are embarrassing. And what about his girlfriend's dreams about anything else on the property? I can't recommend it to anyone other than the most appropriate Seagal fan, and even then you do better with his earlier work. Of the 4 films in my marathon (Submerged, Sun, Alien, and Today You Die) Today was the worst. The previous reviewer mentioned it, but the use of footage was quite obvious.
