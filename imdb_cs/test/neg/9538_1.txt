OK - say some college in Southern California has a movie making class. And some dudes were only written on film girls and gave them a camera. And then they were drunk / stoned or simply idiotic to actually use the camera, and they did it for their degree. A FAILED. This is my only explanation, this. Good God, they left a time and time counter during that time. The picture began before the new sound with a new scene and forgot the plot. Well apparently there was one and they had to tell everything about it once the 3 hours initial sequence was completed. But I'm glad they did it because I never did it by watching it.
