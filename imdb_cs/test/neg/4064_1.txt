Perhaps this film was actually intended as a satire like "Airplane," but it failed as unfortunately when it failed to be a "thriller". I don't understand why they couldn't pay the real pilot a few hundred dollars for a little technical advice. Damn, I would do it for free! This magical plane managed to morph from 757 to 767 to 747 per hour and the power levers worked backwards. And the dialogue looks like it came out on the back of the "phone" children's game where everyone spoke different languages. Actually, I twisted TIVO and for the second time I watched it if it was as bad as I thought. It was.
