There are interesting pieces and what he likes and does not mind Bruce Weber. Maybe if the professional editor put it together for Biography, I would be happier. Instead, I spent $ 8 at the film festival. There is hardly anything revealed about Bruce Weber for an autobiography, besides looking at photos, shooting interesting people, especially beautiful teenage boys and listening to jazz. Director "Crumb" would make a much more interesting and cohesive film.
