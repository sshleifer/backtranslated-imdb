Sometimes I avoided this movie ... because I saw it as an unnecessary installment of a series that was supposed to have only 2 parts. But after reading some rather favorable reviews ... of some IMDB observers ... I spent $ 1.50 and rented it in my local video store. I need to go on ... when I say ... this was 50 bucks. This movie is one of the 10 worst movies I've ever seen. First ... I realize that no one in this movie wanted to see a 33-year-old Macchi ... But why couldn't Miyagi read a letter or something from Daniel-san ... maybe explain what happened to Daniel ... damn it, they could to at least quickly mention fallow deer or something. But no ... and to deal with such a bad scenario ... they added the stupid monks ... I thought the monks promised silence ... guess these monks do not take their promises seriously ... hehehe. The training the girl went through in the movie was a hasty and stupid ... and a paramilitary group of young men .... was at least a confusing conceptâ€¦ it was far from being a martial arts film. .. with a girl who only briefly fights in the final scene ... and then she never came close to intervening again ... the man who fought her ... give me a break ... she would At least once he got hit ... I think writers and directors thought it would be shocking to see a girl get a punched man in this. I could go on and on ... but basically ... I'm quitting that the movie was so bad ... even the girl they chose wasn't pretty when they looked at it (it was sort of) butch " looking) .... I can only think of a few movies that I sat down ... that is compared to how bad the swing was ..... DO NOT USE THIS TIME ON THIS ONE ...... ..
