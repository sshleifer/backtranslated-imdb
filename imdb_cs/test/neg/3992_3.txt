Like Lamberto Bava, his father's non-standard facsimile, Mario (who was still a director), Michele Soavi is an inferior standard director at Dario Argento. "The Church" has at least one thing to recommend - an incredibly detailed artistic direction - but nothing else. The film is long-lasting, filled with one-dimensional characters and almost sleeps me several times. There is a fine line between "art" and "pretentious crap", and while "church" is not entirely worthless, you should watch something different. <br /> <br /> 3/10
