The amount of humbug and the tremendous success that this film has met is proof of how desperate our people are toward a good independent Saudi film. In fact, the huge success of "Tash ma Tash" is also proof. I'm not going to start with how important film creation is, as it is obvious to those who have half the brain of how movies have changed the world. And I won't say how much our company needs a lot of movies to clear up a lot of the problems we have in our country. Religion, politics, women's rights, education, general health, terrorism, law and many others. Together, there have been news about a fist Saudi film that should be the remedy for some of the problems we have. , especially towards young people. Instead, we had a bald film for the thing. Ignorance and naivety on the scene was obvious. It was as though he was 13 years old. Now I heard that the budget for this movie is huge. I'd like to know where the money went, huh? The effects were really ugly, the cut was bad. The script was "kharabeet". You really do not know what the story is and what the director is watching. A note about an actor who played a religious brother, his performance was good, but in the wrong direction. Another thing the role of religious friends he has is not how religious boys work in Saudi Arabia! They are not "evil" as this film intends. In fact, they are some of the most beautiful people you ever encounter with some really unusual ways of life, and that's what should appear in the movie. Youth here follows religion because for some reason, and that is, young people are the most passionate and sentimental. And with the well-formed principles in which religious lives, the young men follow them. Again, this should appear. We need another "First Movie" with a Saudi writer, actor, director, composer, even cameraman. Make everyone passionate about experimenting, not just for money! And we should do what Shakespeare did hundreds of years ago, we should include phrases from the Koran in the film script. Since people in our society still see art as a form of sin, the challenge faced by the Saudi filmmaker is changing the mentality at this angle.
