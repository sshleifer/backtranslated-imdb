I always think it would be nice if you somehow have some insight into some of the old movies that are re-released on DVD before you buy them. This way you could save time, money and a certain degree of aggro when you feel so utterly let go. <br /> <br /> "Holly Friends Story" is such a movie. I don't want to go into the characterization, the plot, or the embarrassment of the historical facts that this film contains, because I had to deal with them twenty years ago when I first started watching it. <br /> <br /> I recorded it on an old (Monaural) Beta machine in the early 1980s and was so happy to be a regular favorite. The best thing is, in my opinion, the performance of Gary Busey as a young Buddy and his almost perfect vocals and guitar playing. I was looking forward to the day when I could have him ... STEREO ... and that's where disappointment comes. <br /> <br /> This DVD version is (apparently) re-mastered in audio and video, according to shell information, but I'm afraid he left me sadly released and looked at my watch that wished it to it ended. The sound is dark, bordering with incomprehensible, and so unprofessional mixed that it bothered me for the crystal clear singing of my old Beta tape! Despite what you think of pictures, or of plot, or of characters, MUSIC is a real card for drawing here ...... and if you don't hear vocals because they're drowned in cymbals, or in harmony or in other environments, then there is not much left, is it? <br /> <br /> I will be converting my old beta to (Mono) DVD for subsequent views and putting it where it belongs, with trash! "Extinction is a rule, survival is an exception ..."
