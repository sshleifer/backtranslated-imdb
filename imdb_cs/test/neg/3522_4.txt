This movie is so mild! I tried not to expect anything bigger from this movie, but it was a big disappointment. The basic idea of ​​the story is interesting and potential. That could have been much better. Characters are really simple, no depth at all. It is a pity that the previously talented artists Tiina Lymi and Petteri Summanen did not make such bad characters. The director simply does not get the observer emotionally in contact with this piece of cr * p. This is disgusting !!! Why did it have to be so stupid and old for this situation? OH NO!
