There is no way into words as bad as both formless, mindless and helpless these "Vice Academy" movies really are. You must experience one for yourself. Director Rick Sloane shows no ounce of writing or talent management for the third time in a row. There is nothing that a person over 5 years of age believes or laughs at, but (very brief) nudity and other "conspiracy" elements make films unsuitable for children. Which leads me to believe that they are really focused on adults with 5-year-olds. Elizabeth Kaitan is more than a welcome substitute for Linne Quigley - she is victoriously lively and cute, and her gorgeous smile is about the only thing she can smile to the viewer. But watching her and the other girls in this movie is like watching a bouquet in the desert covered with horse manure. (*)
