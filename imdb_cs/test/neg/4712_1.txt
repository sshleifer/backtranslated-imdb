An annoying and talented American documentary filmmaker will learn about the legendary South African monster, Half-Caste. Tradition says it is a half-human, half-leopard creature with the closest parallel to a werewolf of European tradition. Rather than focusing on creation, the film follows the film crew's meanderings. There is little action or tension until late film. This problem is aggravated by the numerous irritating characters that create a constant amount of even more exciting speech. The basic assumption is unnecessary because it is displaced by an inexplicable focus on the documentary crew. Maybe the director was influenced by the approach of Blair Witch Project (1999) or The Last Broadcast (1998). Regardless, the movie fails at most levels. Avoid at any cost.
