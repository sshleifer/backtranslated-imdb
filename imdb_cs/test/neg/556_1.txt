Hillary Swank is an unattractive work in this unattractive work of the film. Pat Morita, a desperate job, any kind of job, has agreed to take on the role of "Karate Teacher" and bring her Karate brand back to the silver screen, this time except for being a "Hankry" Swank student. Br /> <br /> I just see that Hollywood writers are excited about the idea of ​​taking the role of a "troubled, corrupt female" who takes on the role of Ralph. The film doesn't work at any level and it's boring at all levels. There is nothing interesting and no lessons for anyone to stick to. The film was made without any thought of making money because it's so bad. I'd like to spit on all the actors in this movie for getting involved and having writers black for their movies. torture and offensive efforts.
