Alexandra Ripley wrote a terrible sequel to Margaret Mitchell's book, published in the 1930s. Margaret Mitchell's heirs sold out their rights and, for big money, allowed Alexander Ripley to write a junk book worse than Barbara Cortland's romance novels. I was a huge fan of Margaret Mitchells and Alexandra Ripley's false sequel was written just to be cash. Although I have always admired Joanne Kilmer and Timothy Dalton's acting talent, this is a really horrible movie. The script is horrible and full of clich√©s. Ann Margarets portrait as Belle Watling is so terrible I wanted her to slap. The only useful thing in the movie is Sean Bean, who gives a masterful brilliant performance as a sexy, wild villain - Lord Fenton. Sean Bean's performance is consistent with "The Man You Love to Hate" and depicts a dangerous sex symbol. But Sean Bean is only in the first half of the movie, so you have to be tortured with watching an incredibly long 6 hour movie with an unbearably boring scenario. Don't waste money on this movie if you're not a fan of the hard core Sean Bean and just watch it for its amazing performance.
