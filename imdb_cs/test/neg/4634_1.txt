I saw this movie and bored from my mind! I am a peanut fan, but I do not understand why Charles Schultz had this catastrophe done! Spoilers forward. I can't believe Snoopy let his friends sleep on the ground outside in a dangerous situation and go out to the bar and swim a few colds without looking! The story was utter nonsense, even for comic book characters. It takes them too long to get to France, and once they got to France, I felt that the writer (I still can't believe it was Schultz) didn't know what to do when they got there. Peanuts are best prepared in 30-minute episodes, not 80-minute movies. Go home Charlie Brown, you're in the best place. <br /> <br />
