When I first saw The Comebacks trailer, it seemed absolutely horrible and I wasn't interested in seeing it, but when it came out today on DVD, I figured I wasn't interested in anything that interested me, I rented it and he gave it a shot. I watched it drown and it really wasn't that bad. I think it was sometimes immature and stupid, but I had a few funny moments that made me laugh. I don't really see a lot of sports movies, so I'm surprised that if I saw more, maybe this movie would make more sense to me, but it's all right, I still didn't mind so much watching The Comebacks. I admit that these "stupid spoof" movies are lame, but what is the pity in a silly joke once in a while? Comebacks isn't so bad if you give him a fair chance. Fields training fails in life, in family and in career, but when he is offered the opportunity to return his career back to life if he can bring a free football team to the championship. But the team is really terrible, just like the horrible. But with a bit of work and teamwork, he tries to give them everything, even if it turns into something more sad. Comebacks over all is not the worst movie I've ever seen, I think it's good for a couple of laughs and giggles. I know it was stupid, but I couldn't help when the coach got to the center of the locker room and he beats the nerd on the locker, only he and the nerd were so amusing. . If you have an open mind and do not take this film too seriously, I think you will have fun watching it when you watch it worthy of Oscar, this is not a movie for you. /> 4/10
