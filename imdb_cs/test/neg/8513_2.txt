In my opinion, this film is not good. I would hardly say anything good about it, but I'd like to explain before I came to the conclusion that it's just another bad movie. I decided to watch him because Costas Mandylor was playing, and that was the main reason I watched it to the end. I like action movies and I understand that such movies are based on events rather than on the story. I know he doesn't go into details about the credibility of the story and events, but it doesn't even explain why some scenes, just because they lack a sense of reality, look ridiculous. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, the movie looks promising: a tough, good-looking specialist and his not so strong but clever and witty partner has to do a job that turns out to be a little different than they expected. The story takes place on a cruise ship. There will be a disaster, the ship will turn and only a few of them will stay alive. During the struggle for survival, they must escape from sharks, professional killer and rising water. Moreover, the film is very violent. The main weapon (besides the catastrophe that has already taken most of the passengers) is a weapon that is in many cases successfully used. I personally missed a good man to a man (or a woman to a woman if you prefer). Family Fun? I do not think so. All in all, I think this film was shot in a hurry, without a real vision of what it was trying to say. Made from the usual action movie tricks, with a little something called love, and no real meaning, it results in a bad movie.
