Words fail because of this terrible waste of two hours of life. The story is created to the point of total incredibility. Acting is leaded and so many of them are ridiculously horrible. Vinnie Jones - so beautiful in Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is unbearably horrible and incredible as journalist Mike Sullivan. It's just worth looking at the terrifying continuity. After a huge beating is given to Jones, it appears on it without scratching. His girlfriend is drinking over him and he's chasing her. It's pretty horrible, the worse talented actors are doing it.
