I saw it in the cinema during its initial release and I can just ask, "Is this a world crazy?" A seemingly overwhelming positive response is the overwhelming mind for this poorly written, embarrassingly predictable damping trap. Stephan Elliot is no brilliant filmmaker, as evidenced by the consistent bombs he has made since then (see Woop) Woop ',' Eye of the Beholder ') I can only assume that a film that deals with gay / transexual culture has people, provided that a film that doesn't like is an insult to this sector of the population. Aren't we smarter than this? What an interesting scenario and good performance? Okay, so 3 leads right with what they have to work for, but this movie contains the worst performance of a child actor I've ever seen, not helping the scary dialogue and the really lame resolution you can see for miles. Br /> <br /> This is an unsatisfactory film and one that does not deserve the exaggeration it has gained.
