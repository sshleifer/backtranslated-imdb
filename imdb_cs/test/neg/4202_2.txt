This is a very boring and uninteresting action movie, and without Chuck Norris it would be unbearable!, Plus a low budget showing great time!. Some of these fights were good, but the story is ridiculous and no terrible bad guys at all. The dialogue was ridiculous, I had trouble completing this movie, but Chuck Norris did it a bit. I really don't have anything to say because I was just paying attention, because it was so unbelievably boring that it got a little bit better. The direction is terrible. Don Hulette, doing the horrible job, with a lousy photo, a terrible pace, and overall the movie looked boring! There's no wound. Acting was terrible. Chuck Norris is very good here, kicking that ass and making the film almost bearable (Chuck Rules!). George Murdock is terrible as the main villain and is very unconvincing. Terry O'Connor, he's decent here, and he has good chemistry with Chuck. Michael Augenstein is decent as Chuck's brother. Overall, it's pretty simple! * Out of 5 (Chuck saves it from BOMB).
