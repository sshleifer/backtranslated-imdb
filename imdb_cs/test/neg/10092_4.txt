Wow, I was really disappointed. Actually, I didn't plan to see this movie in the theater, and I wish I could stick to the plan. It should be a really made video. I was so excited to see it because I am a big fan of Fairuza Balk, but this movie didn't do her justice. Infact I'm a little disappointed with acting all around. What a terrible covering of Fairuza Balka's tattoos every time I saw her shoulder. There was no flow into the movie, it was hard to get into it. One scene we got angry about, praised, wanted blood, expectations are rising, then the director takes us to another scene to show love between Annie and Bobby. It would be more pleasant to watch if it was divided into three sectional Sunday paper comics. <br /> <br /> There was little logic behind the characters selected to play some parts. The gangster leaders were crafty guys, not very believable. Matt Dillon Head of Gangsters? Come on, give me a break. There was no intimidation. <br /> <br /> Soundtrack .. wow. I think it's one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard. What a terrible guitar solo, my God. The sound of grinding my teeth was more pleasant for my friends, I'm sure. Anyway, there is one positive comment I would like to make about the film. The setup was done nicely. I liked the colors, the good work that expressed that time.
