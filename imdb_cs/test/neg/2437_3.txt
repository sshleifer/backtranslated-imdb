It's hard to tell who this film is focused on; characterization and smacks style of the "child's ITV" series crossed with Aussie soap, but the subject, nudity, and language target the older audience. The first half hour has a heroine Justine philosophizing about losing her virginity, and is excruciatingly embarrassed by anyone over 18 years old. Complete rip-off "Ferris Bueller", from talking-at-the-camera bit down to screen graphics. Her stupid friend Chas brings her to a computer fair where her explosion during the use of virtual reality machines turns her into man. Or it actually creates a male alter-ego called Jake. Don't look at me like that; I'm just relating it as it was shown. <br /> <br /> After this movie it is slightly fun for a while; among all the drama school fairy tales, only Rupert Penry-Jones brings a real comical touch to his wife-imprisoned Jake. There are some funny scenes with Jake dealing with his new body and new feelings; nothing you haven't seen before, but then in this movie you'll associate with anything that is fun. Unfortunately Justine and Jake meet, and the hilarious antics follow (wish), involving the owners of a virtuality machine that wants to kidnap Jake to have sex with him, or to explore or something. By the way, it's just an excuse to fill another half-hour with some kind of explosion and chase of cars; For such a cheap film, explosions come often and loud, indicating that the money has been spent at all the wrong places. Finally, the heroine realizes she can't fall in love with herself, deletes her alter ego, and ends up in one-night stands with the nerd losing her virginity (this probably is what's meant for a happy ending in 90 years). But only after taking off his glasses and putting on some hair gel and a leather jacket; God has forbidden her to actually have sex with someone who looks like a nerd. Of course it's a bit subversive - these days PC movies that tell you that you love and be yourself, and that everyone is in a special way in a way, it's a refreshing response to a movie that screams "CONFORM!" with you and treats virgins and nerds with the contempt they deserve. Characterization is a simple threat; nerd is very stupid (room full of computers, thick glasses, social retardism, virginity, no leather jacket), there is a bitch, it is very slutty (blonde, tight dress, orange tan, vampy backing music), there is an athlete, he is very ... well, the picture is. With this kind of characterization you can get in a broad comedy, but "Virtual Sexuality" is not much fun. It's just slightly fun in parts and unbearable in others. It takes a lot for a woman as cute as Justine (played by Laura Fraser) to bother me, but she does. <br /> <br /> Don't be fooled by the title; There's nothing erotic about the film, and it's not about how new communication technologies change the way we display and get relationships (if you think your PlayStation chance can blow up and change your sex.). <br /> <br />
