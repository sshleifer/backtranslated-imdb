... a good script or director couldn't fix it. <br /> <br /> The original 'Poseidon Adventure' was a story of human courage that triumphed against amazing chances and personal tragedy. Survivors were guided by a charismatic figure of great spiritual power that would take anything that God had thrown at him. Subsequent steps are trying to recreate the mixture, but will not succeed in the formal scenario and pedestrian direction. Irwin Allen may have been a great producer of rapid disaster movements and has done a great job of directing action scenes in Towering Inferno, but he simply can't bring any human depth to his characters. If the characters are not trusted any danger they face also falls straight. <br /> <br /> The script is also trying to copy the original too. So we have Peter Boyl who makes Ernest Borgnine a thing by being tough and uncomfortable (but having a tender heart); Karl Malden's Red Buttons moderating influence (and is terminally ill for good measure); Slim Pickens makes comical relief for Shelley Winters, and so on. <br /> <br /> To make the story more modern, we have a dishonest arms trader ready to throw plutonium into the firearm class at the highest bid. A really ugly piece of work that ruthlessly leaves a wounded man (the actors playing his followers were probably paid as supplements because they seem to have no lines) and has a tucked woman in the back - what is incense! Thank goodness, the French emergency services made the hole in the Poseidon fuselage twice as big as in 1972 (and on the other side of the propeller shaft) to get its goods out. And when we are on the topic of getting crates * to * oh, forget it. Actually, I paid good money to see it when it was released. Given the current reputation of the film, it may seem strange, but in fact it was quite mixed reviews at that time. Some said it was junk, some said it was as exciting as the original. It doesn't matter, no one can still be fine.
