This must be the biggest practical joke ever. I am amazed that all the other actors kept a straight face. I could be wrong, but the impression I got from this movie was that they cheated Frank Stallon and Joe Estevez to play a budget of less than $ 40 in this movie, depending on how many bats and spray squeezed devices worth creating. the most diverse movie ever made and sit back and laugh at the fact that Joe Estevez and Frank Stallone were not joking. If he didn't happen to be joking and trying to make a real movie, then I'm sorry for everyone involved in the creation. I had quite a love affair with kitschy movies, but this movie is so bad I can't watch it. They repeat the unnecessary "special effects" so many times that it is obvious that they are just trying to hide the fact that they shot only 30 minutes of recording. If I was forced to watch this film in repetition, I should be over unconscious after about one and a half times. No offense to the great Frank Stallone, but I'd rather watch Sylvester teach a class of fingers for 10 hours before watching the movie at all.
