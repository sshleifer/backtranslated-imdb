Critics began to reasonably call it Oscar Winner. What happened after Halle Berry won him for Monsters Ball then went straight to the devilish Catwoman. Hilary Swank triumphs in Boys Don't Cry, followed by Core. Jamie Foxx takes nosedive as a pilot in Matt Stealth after getting a gong for Ray. Now it seems Hollywood Starlet Charlize Theron throughout her "Monster" Oscar with this one of the worst sci-fi glasses she ever made. The thing really worth staying is the fact that, despite the film being a waste, Charlize Theron is still an exceptional actress who clearly makes the best of the raw and ridiculous assumption. Not only is Flux shallow, but it is also very boring for action. This will only really appeal to fans of comics and Horney teenagers who like the idea of ​​Theroc running around half naked for 90 minutes. Flux only succeeded in failing. Against the 2011 virus that kills 99% of the world's population, and in the last city on Earth, Bregna, who survived, about four hundred years later, 2415, they continue to live in the Goodchild dynasty, the name of the scientist who developed his medicine. Citizens of a never-ending jungle, but what an unspoken, unwritten taboo that holds and binds these unwritten taboos that hold and bind these unfortunates together that lie within these walls of paranoia, consensus and undisputed obedience. Ironically, this film is filmed in Berlin and around, it is a story built against a totalitarian state, a walled city where its peoples are no longer able to reproduce, and its sinister and most secret conspiracy on how to maintain life. luxon Flux is a killer who has been eternally assigned by underground insurgents to change the direction of humanity forever. This is the story of her struggle for justice, freedom and revenge. Flux combined miserable stories, valuable stimulation and truly desperate effects. It looks more like an unrealistic video game than a movie. The only thing that is lucky to fail is that there are no sequels in the works, Flux could only be the beginning and end of what could be one of the worst concessions in history, thank God for the miserable cash register. <br /> <br /> My last verdict on this really miserable feature? There's really no story here, just Charlize Theron, jumping in a black suit like a grass hopper. Acting is very wooden and moral without emotions compared to other cinemas that are today. It's too much to be an adaptation, and it doesn't really take much from the cartoon, which is what I expected. Avoid at any cost.
