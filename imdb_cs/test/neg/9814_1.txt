I saw this movie about 8 years ago when it first came out, and the only memories I have about it are: 1. That was horrible. 2. That in one scene Linnea Quigley applies sunscreen to her hands and feet repeatedly for about 15 minutes straight (seemed so long). 3. One scene where the character gets hammered into the head. In this scene, when the hammer joins, the head breaks like glass. It's pretty bad.
