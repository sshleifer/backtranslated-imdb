Extremely formula with cosmic logic holes and pretending in comedy. Aw, poor NYC lawyer! He is just scratching, and when he gets a discount on wages, he doesn't go out to find another job, though he is one of the most respected lawyers in the field. We see him arguing in court for others to come and congratulate him on his fiery, victorious birth, but he can't face anyone in his business. At home, problems are ignored until people storm out of the house. The only character you want to take root is the last maid who seems to be a real human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world. As laughter that maid should bring a lawyer and his wife chicken and wine on New Year's Eve because they are sorry! (Bit not playing for laughter.) <br /> <br /> Sorry, just too incredible and with ** SPOILER ** pat, all-turns-180 degrees ends. How did the top stars get to it? If I was in the studio, I'd send it back to complete rewrite.
