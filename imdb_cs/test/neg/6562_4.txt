This is the only word I would like to describe. They are not lost as a waste of time (the time spent with these characters is never wasted), but waste as a waste of opportunity. When I see this film, I think of all the Star Trek novels that were written and which would create a much better film than the Shatner story. The setting was like an average TV episode, while the target felt like a climax (if you can call it) of the first movie. Nimoy, directed by II-IV, focused on the character of Spock - how he faced Kobayashi Maru outside the classroom and how he now dealt with his emotional life when he had the chance to start again. Shatner could do the same with Kirk, but he didn't. We don't know much about Kirk what we didn't know about before. One of the novels would be better again - try "My enemy, my ally" for a very interesting study of the character of our friend James T. The smaller characters are mostly used for cute pieces, and the Scotty-Uhura subplot appears as a way out of the left field, especially because that the subtext in the original series was Sulu-Uhura. <br /> <br /> Even hardcore fans can't find much to enjoy here. I'm sorry, but it's true.
