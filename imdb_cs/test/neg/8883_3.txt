Maybe I missed something, but I found GOYA'S GHOSTS as a borodrama boring costume. As for the story he was trying to say, I found it confusing mish-porridge that went in all directions. And perhaps a Spanish director with the appropriate subtitle languages ​​should do this instead of in unconvincingly accentuated English. I cannot judge the historical truth of the story, but it seemed to move along with a similar "tragic fate" of the artist's model as GIRL S PEARL EARRING. Was the film a commentary on the religious injustices of the Inquisition, false piety, torture then and now, or what? I never seemed to do it. Various characters of Natalia Portmanova also seemed ridiculously stereotypical. And finally, the film was crowned with the final melodram of Bardem's head and body, hanging at the edge of the cart, heading for the sunset? Ines and Goya followed each other ?????? than that?
