If you're going to watch 'Partner' and have an IMDb reading about it, you've spent too much time on this stupid, idiotic, horrible movie. It's a horrible, horrible, horrible copy of 'Hitch'. I decided to ignore all the other warnings and bad reviews I heard about this movie, and I wasted a precious 20 minutes - I thought after all who did it, David Dhawan, who was doing it, and Govinda - How bad can it be? But after 20 minutes of watching this nonsense I couldn't take it anymore and shut down my computer. Overloading everyone in the movie, stupid dialogues, total waste time - I gave it a 1-star rating because it's the lowest you can do. If I could go down, I'd give him a -100 rating.
