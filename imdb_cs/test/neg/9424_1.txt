This film is a burden of crap. It's quite disturbing to see that everyone can say it's one of the best films of the year. What can I say? Poor play, bad action scenes that eventually become really comical. Sorry, if it was a comedy, then I didn't understand. If it were, I'd regret laughing from the tent scenes! Do yourself a favor - go to bed instead of watching it! Good night!
