He watched the director cut herself last night ... glad that it was free hire, even a dollar would be too much for me to pay to watch this attempt on "film noir". Anachronisms (modern phones) were uncomfortable for me, not clever, they seemed more like budget constraints than anything else. I also found "unconventional" casting disturbing. If I have to stop watching the story and think, "What the hell does a black cat / drag queen do?" then the narrator failed me. Again, not clever in my opinion, but annoying and irritating, and very film school's latest project-ish. And when it comes to pete, if you shoot in black and white, use at least some of the techniques used in old movies that take full advantage of the lack of color. There was no use of nuance in the lighting, no shades of gray, no depth, no texture ... just black and just white ... boring!
