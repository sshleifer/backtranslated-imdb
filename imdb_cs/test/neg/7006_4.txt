Midnight Hour AKA: Tell Me No Lie (as found in some video stores) can be judged in two different ways. One is Merritt as a film, complete with a fence (no holes), a good story and a believable conclusion, and the other is a skin film that tries to be. This is definitely nothing more than the B-Movie movie, whose only purpose is to show every girl in the movie at too long a sex scene at least once. regular movie, then it's the bottom of the line. Huge plot hole destroys what's going on for it. For example, if a coworker were killed, would you call the police or go home and hit the whirlpool? Judging by this film it's skin content, it's traceable ... barely. Girls are pretty beautiful but obviously improved. All the sex scenes were long and exaggerated, making it just a redemption of quality a little boring. Amber Smith could be a decent actress if she wanted to. She wasn't as bad as you could imagine, or maybe next to the rest of the cast, she looked much better than she did. Zoe Anderson, who played Arraya's thriller, shouldn't even watch a movie, much less in one. She looked good, but we know why she was there. <br /> <br /> Overall, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Even if you're looking for a good skin look, it's much better. I rate 4 out of 10
