This is the worst movie I've ever seen. At first I thought it would be good because I was interested in the Bermuda Triangle, but it was horrible instead. All he did was offer a lot of lame justifications that didn't make sense (if time moves differently, as a woman didn't age, and her son quickly grew older), and he had a terrible clever end. Next time, the guys who did it went to Bermuda to take all the copies of this film with them. Please vote for this movie to get to the worst list of movies.
