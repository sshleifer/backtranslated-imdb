"The Son of the Mask" is a terrible excuse for the film. I went to see it with my friend and still wish we saw "Because Winn-Dixie" instead. I must say that this is partly my fault when I agreed to go with him. Being a fan of the first "Mask" movie (Jim Carrey was merry) I was hoping it wasn't as bad as all the critics said it was. Ten minutes to the movie I knew headed for disaster. Disgusting and pointless joke attempts were small and seven-year-old screaming with laughter, but the rest of us stared at the screen in disbelief. Finding a movie as repulsive and rude as I was Surprised by the way I loved "Scary Movie" and "Anchorman", two movies that many people have found found crude and offensive. But the thing is, "Son of Mask" is not funny unless you are under ten years old. The movie contains a lot of CGI in it, but it can't save this piece of waste. Whoever allowed this film to get on the big screen was probably thinking of having the potential, given the success of its original. Unfortunately, he has no laughter, fun or excitement from the first, which makes a mockery of the original film. I recommend renting an original "Mask" to anyone who thinks he could see it. 1 star of 10 is generous to this terrible mess.
