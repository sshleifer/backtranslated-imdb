I don't mind some adult humor, but this function was just downright dirty. The first 10 minutes were that Pryor swore on a guy who photographed, followed my even more profanity. I don't know what happened between the time of the last 5 minutes because I came out. After seeing it, I've never looked at Richard Pryor before. And thinking that he actually went on to host a children's show. <br /> <br /> If profanity and tasteless, nonsensical dirty jokes make laughter, then you'll probably enjoy. But if you're an "old fashioned" type then don't bother.
