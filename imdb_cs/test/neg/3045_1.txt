What should be a routine babysitting concert in a remote pool house becomes a night of horror, as high school student Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle) receives threatening phone calls from a sadistic stalker trying to stay one step ahead of him. Br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes of the original movie was pretty good, but from there it was all downhill. The remake lasts for the first 20 minutes and stretches them into an 80-minute feature film. This is a good idea because its eliminating everything that made the original bad. However, if they wanted this film to work more efficiently, they should hire a better leading actress, a better director, writer, etc. There is no tension, everything can be invented long before it happens and it's a very boring movie because much is not happening. At least there is not much to sit on because its less than 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> If this assumption works, the leading actress must give a realistic performance. Camilla Belle gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen, and during the whole movie she seemed to read her lines. You get the lead role in a Hollywood movie that millions of people will be able to see. Why did they hire the girl? Sure, she's pretty, but she can't act at all. I suppose it doesn't matter to the target audience who will most likely eat this movie. The rest of the cast is bland and forgettable, especially the woman who plays the maid, Rosa. Even the stranger was lame and his phone lines were not effective at all. This film reminds me last year of the disappointing horror Boogeyman. The movie was a lot of cheap ghosts and false alarms, and when foreigners' calls are almost the same. Jill enters the room because he hears the noise, but it's just a false alarm like a cat or a maid. This type of scene is constantly repeated until a stranger appears after about 50 minutes. He must be one of the funniest murderers. He carried no weapons and did not seem to pose a great threat. The end is bad, but it matches the rest of the film, so it doesn't matter. The film was directed by Simon West and he is really bad at building tension. He used every clich√© he thought and the results were not very good. The house was amazing and I will give you a film credit. It was an isolated house, so it was pretty scary, but that's probably the only good thing this movie has to offer. Ultimately, if you're not a teenage girl, then you should skip the movie. Rating 2/10
