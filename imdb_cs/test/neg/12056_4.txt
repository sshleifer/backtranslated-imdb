Yes, it's Friday the 13th rip off, but I have no problem with it. It's a good endeavor, killing is not such a cruelty, but the acting of one girl carries a movie that is the screaming Queen Jennifer Ritchkoff. For a low budget movie, the effects are nicely done, well, sometimes you can guess how it is done. Some people have problems using the camera, I don't see what's wrong with it. It's so strange that so many people don't like this movie, I really enjoyed it. Of course, the script is not original, but give me one that is, I think, so many slashers are made in the woods. Maybe it's all predictable, but it's worth seeing, I've seen a lot worse, I can tell you
