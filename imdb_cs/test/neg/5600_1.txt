I didn't expect "Citizen Kane", but I was hoping it would be a pleasure! The scenario is bad, but the school's outer frames were apparently made with the same 5 accessories on the same day, and the outer track shots were easily filmed during the hurricane. I was hoping the wardrobe had some good, strong pantie soap. I know the budget is time, but do you think they could buy several different styles of underwear? What overexposed vampire hot chick would wear boy-foot panties under latex pants? I was relieved to see one tango look in the penultimate scene. Good Points: The actors were all very attractive and the girls had natural breasts. Too bad they never picked a bra. Special effects weren't even effective and could only be described as special if they went on a short bus to edit bay. The particular final scene is terribly, ridiculously bad. <br /> <br /> -Lizzzzzzzz
