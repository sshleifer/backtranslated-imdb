. . . and only if you like the look of a beautiful woman with nice, jumping jugs running around the so-called African jungle. So no problems there for most men out there. I watched it as one of those packages together. Forget the plot that is basically just a fragile story to keep our heroine flashing her pitchers on the screen at every possible opportunity. To make sense to you, our heroine throws herself from the vine to the vine and climbs to the tallest animals in every chance, without any good reason, just to let you see her jugs at all angles. Again, no complaints. <br /> <br /> "Battle Scenes" are ridiculous and borderline on pornography. Our heroine found herself in the film at least five times. On occasions when he has to fight, "fighting" involves rolling in the dirt, insurmountably grunting, and basically fighting like kittens. I'm surprised it's not hair pulling. It's so bad that the main baddie had to remind "fighters" that "I said the one who draws the first blood will win!" to avoid watching silly fighting. Witch Kuku was a bloody explosion. From the initial big, teddy bear he became manic depressed when he was captured, and then, absolutely psycho. The whole movie muttered without any insignificance. Besides Liana (our heroine), who jumped topless, you can also look at a lot of other Amazons, as well as one woman who decided to jump naked into Lake to swim without good reasons. Yeah, it's such a movie. Look at the beautiful Liane in her jumping glory. Despite the fact that the film is more than 20 years old, the spell of watching blond women flashing on their pretty jugs on the screen never gets old.
