A group of young adults is opening a plan to escape for the spirit of Elizabeth Bathory when they recite her poem from a video game that allegedly represents a session. The only one who dies in the game is Miller (Adam Goldberg) who also is found dead in the same way he perished in said video game. While the characters of the others did not die in the video game, their recitation of the poem instead released the video game into reality with the walking CGI characters walking and killing each one, one at a time. They must follow certain methods using the mirror and nails to beat Bathory and save their skin. <br /> <br /> If this assumption sounds stupid, it's because it is. Characters are ho-hum refusing from bad TV shows WB, this time allowed to climb vulgarity. This film follows the rules of slasher, but does not show much violence or gore. Keeps PG-13 safe and most deaths are off-screen. There's a scene where the real hero and the heroine are running away from the characters of the video games watching them. Yes, it's so bad. I recommend nothing. A good-looking cast including Sofia Bush as the appropriately named October.
