The hero's message is quite clear: the idea of ​​greater China is more important than the death and suffering of millions. At a time when China is holding its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to support this piece of overproduced, government-sponsored, dogmatic waste. Especially surprising is the support for this liberal media film. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon and many others all over the world supported Hero. In this way, they implicitly legitimized their reactionary political message. The only critic (I know) he saw through the shiny facade of the film was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote about "sacred traditionalism" of the film and its "celebration of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national authors". "I, for one, sign your name under Hoberman's latest statement: Hero is nothing but" fascinating fascism ".
