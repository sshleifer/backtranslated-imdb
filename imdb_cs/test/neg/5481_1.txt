These are the hands that are the most enjoyable and frustrating game I've ever encountered. Every time you turn, the game takes control of your character or creates invisible walls that you can't pass. Scene editing lets you control the movements of your character, but only slightly. You also have to play the game for about 2 hours to get through the intro / tutorials. It's scary! I'm afraid if I play this game, I'll end up with something. This game is upset. The graphics are good, but nothing special, but the game is terrible. To say that I hate this game would be a huge understatement. I got it for sale, but I want $ 20 back. What a shame!
