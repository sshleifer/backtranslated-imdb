"Comedy of Biblical Proportions!" These masters of exaggeration, the writers of film marks, do it again; The sequel to 2003 is Bruce Almighty, barely laughing. The only thing that raises my interest in this film over overall indifference is its doctrinal Christian undertones. Sorry, let's do these undertones. Steve Carrel, ignoring the good sense of Jim Carrey refusing to retaliate, plays Evan Baxter, a complacent journalist anchor from Bruce Almighty, who has just been elected to Congress. With a new life in Virginia and the stress of moving into a house of the Acropolis, the pressure on all these changes turns into his family. His wife (Lauren Graham), evidently flown from Stepford, and three sons (Jimmy Bennett, Graham Phillips and Johnny Simmons), who are doing the job of looking at the piano accompaniment, pray that the family will come close to guilt, just like Evan. In what must be the greatest shock of all time, God (Morgan Freeman) actually appears, but the whole annoying "work in a mysterious way" around the world. Instead of telling Evan to build a Noah-esquire Ark in preparation for a great flood instead of giving him a pool table or X-box or something. And in a real poor godlike style, he forces Evan to grow beards, long hair, and wear worn and shabby clothes. Now, on that day, I'm sure shavers are hard to accept, so beard is inevitably inevitable for Noah, but I'm pretty sure it has nothing to do with spirituality. Just like a dress; massive construction work is undoubtedly more difficult. Couldn't God conjure up a pair of steel shoes and caps for a poor man? Seems not. To paraphrase Bill Hicks, I found that God was a little disturbed by us, as was Evan, who fights with him at every turn. And who wouldn't? God basically lets him fire, takes away his loved ones, makes him laugh, and at one point really threatens him. Of course, God turns out to be right, and a rational, hard-working family man who is all right to himself is forced to eat a large piece of bitter cake. It's almost as if Evan was alone to leave him alone and humorous. What's the message? Evan Almighty has a very laudable ecological tendency, and the basic issue is that the federal government is blind to the damage caused to the world around us. It is also the first film ever to balance its carbon emissions, and this should be certainly considered a landmark achievement by the Hollywood studio. If it wasn't for the banal, condescending inscription of American Christianity flying high above him, Evan Almighty might be a harmless family movie, with a commendable environmental record. But with its confused religious dogma and the relentless message of "blind faith," it is one of the most vile films of all time.
