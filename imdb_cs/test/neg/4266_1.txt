The worst thing I've ever watched. The film is pure waste. Everything's bad on the movie. Direction, script, art, cinematography, cast or anything else. <br /> <br /> Can I say more? The main character is a boy. He must be about 20 years old, but the actor who plays the role looks like 30 years old, plus he is a very bad actor. Adjustments are trying to save, but with that very bad material in the hands can not do wonders. As I said, casting is bad, the text is bad, it doesn't help the actors. I learned "no" to make a movie.
