Hey, if people thought wood was a bad director, they didn't see this movie at all. I mean, there were gaping holes and under cast. Shoddy special effects. I think I can't believe this movie came out of Hollywood studio. College drama club could probably come out with a better product. I think they had Erik Eleniak, who is a beautiful Casper van dien and under the rated actor. Their agents should be shot to ask them to sign up for this dribble and not read the scripts. I still can't believe that little lister was a survivor in a movie that banged my head all the time, why he, and not van helsing, was the last man. I am a fan of vampire films, and this is by far the worst thing to play in a way that never sees the light of day.
