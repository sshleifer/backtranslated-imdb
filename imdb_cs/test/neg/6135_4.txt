Army private Gene Kelly, who is also a talented trapezoidal aerialista, comes under fire for doing bold bits without a net and alienating his high-cohort wire; Meanwhile, there is a sophisticated "camp show" that will be deployed on military troops and personnel, and the entire M-G-M studio has turned out to be entertained. Mickey Rooney plays M.C. (unusually), featuring acts like Kay Kyser and his orchestra, Bob Crosby, Benny Carter, and M-G-M dancing girls (who seem to be dressed as a vegetable). Red Skelton does a cute piece with Donna Reed and Margaret O'Brien, but other comic bits suffer from a seeming vacuum between the performers and the supposedly live audience (they're terribly quiet until the editor edits them for overreaction). Judy Garland sings an inappropriate song about a jump night in Carnegie Hall (unlikely to be accompanied by the classical pianist Jos√© Iturbi, whom Judy calls "hep"). Production is shiny, but mani energy is false, made. ** of ****
