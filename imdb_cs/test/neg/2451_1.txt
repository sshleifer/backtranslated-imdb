I think I'd rather let my piles be cut with a pair of rusty scissors than carry another five minutes of this movie. In fact, I can't even bother to go into detail! I don't know how they managed to get the needles into the wooden actors to cure them! Better for everyone involved if the island were just bothered to learn about the virus, it would take as long as there was a commercial break and we could go on with our lives. And one more thing was the trash that the divine channel had entered? As if everyone seemed to praise the bleeding master most of the time. Avoid the plague! In fact, I'd rather do it!
