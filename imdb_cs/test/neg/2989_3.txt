I have seen the comments of Turkish people (which I am not) that this film is fantastic and accurately describes Turkish life. All I have to say is ... Turkey has to be one of the most boring and depressing places in the world, because in my opinion it is exactly what this movie was for me. If I were Turkish, I think it would have a greater impact. But if you are not from Turkey, I would recommend that you not waste two hours of your life on it. "Distant" seems to be lagging behind forever. Many scenes are long lasting with little or no purpose. I don't understand the director's goals in many scenes. It is pointed out that the director used his own car, flat and friends to shoot the movie ... Well guess what? Shows. Looks like a low budget. Behavior is bad. If it's a cultural thing, it is. I just don't understand the purpose of the film. It's incredibly boring.
