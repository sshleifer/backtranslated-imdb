It's a pity that such a lame plot should be hung at such picturesque places where the reportage report is pushed to the next length. A shorter film can hold the tension a little more, and a more charismatic lead may not mangled his line so much. Also, female leadership was not allowed to do enough, resulting in a nice but boring business. It builds to the end, but the redemption of the leading actor is too late and should have been revealed earlier in the film. It's not terrible, just a pity. Unexciting, but nice enough to match the TV schedules of the morning.
