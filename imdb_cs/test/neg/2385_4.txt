What we've gotten in this trendy movie is a "frat-pack" of college friends approaching 30 years (which, of course, we all know that their generation thinks it's "new 20"). They consist of four guys and a gal that we have cast the following types on us: seemingly "unemployed" and frequent drug users, along with one individual who is successful and trying to be. They are all drifting in a way, trying to find both future and emotional happiness. With one, maybe two exceptions, these are the people that this reviewer would never have ever taken to model himself. There is disappointment after the disappointment after disappointment in almost all their lives. Except for a single individual (who appears on the road to finding him), no one feels at the forefront of his life for emotional satisfaction. So, the only sincere moment in this movie is when knocking on a door brings a person who answers unexpected and honest "I love you" to her. Only with these exceptions, these people are what they deserve or deserve a few hundred thousand dollars that are thrown away in presenting their stories. PS - The writer / director, Johnson, seems to have a problem with displaying gay sex scenes - --- with such problems in presenting longer-term and revealing heterosexuals. Why could it be? <br /> <br /> ****
