Minnesota's feeling is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, it's also one of the most disgusting movies ever made. This is related to a woman who is forced to marry a vile crowd. At the wedding he meets his brother Jjaks. They have sex in the house after eating the cake before they decide to run away together. Of course, the second brother comes after firing his weapons and killing his wife. Jjaks wakes up to find a corpse in the tub and bury her. They seem to be friends with Yaks and try to get the money together because somebody blackmails them because the body saw them. These loops around and several characters will die or return to life, but will never encounter anything that can be called a good conspiracy. The performances are terrible, almost everyone. Cameron Diaz, Keanu Reeves and Dan Akroyed. Direction, dialogue and visual effects are just terrible. Disgusting and horrible film.
