I have to admit I'm at a disadvantage here; when I learned more about film from other reviewers than watching it myself, then it's a problem. Although the story of "a man who knew too much", seems generally straightforward, the film allows too many mysterious elements to get in the way of what could be a satisfying secret. By the time we get to the scene where a charming woman decides to conceal the "first level of the sevenfold beam", I didn't know whether to laugh or rewind to see if I missed something. In a retrospective, a mysterious remark made by Mr. Lawrence (Leslie Banks) from the shaving brush handle was a crafted message, leading to a dentist named Barbor, and finally to Albert Hall, a place, not a person as he is indicated in "A. Hall ‚Äù. But for all the intrigues, it has never been clear why the assassination target was excluded. Well, Louis Bernard was killed because he knew about the plot to murder a diplomat named Oil, but why was Oil a target? Think about why the note was written and secured in a shaving brush? Bernard had to call it off occasionally to remind himself what was going to happen? With his discontinuous scenes, it is difficult to watch "The Man Who Knows Too Much" and a little disorienting, but I give Alfred Hitchcock a credit for lending it soon. From a perspective, I will have to follow some of his other works of the same era, although this movie cannot definitely hold a candle to his later works like "Psycho" or "North by Northwest".
