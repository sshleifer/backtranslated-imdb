The plot includes a new, barber barber shop that moves across the street from Calvin's barber shop. So he feels as if he has to change and improve his business by acquiring new things and the like. Sounds really exciting. As for the rest of the film, many of them include the same material from the first film. People who work around Calvin's stand speak loudly and mouth to each other and to their customers. Again, the Cedric Entertainer was slightly witty, but it's more like he was doing a stand-up routine than doing a movie. And Calvin faces another moral problem that involves a great deal of money. He has already shown that he will do the right thing in the end. <br /> <br /> FINAL VERDICT: Nothing new. I do not recommend if you thought the first barbershop is the best from sliced ​​bread.
