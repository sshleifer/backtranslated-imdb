It's about jealousy, about racism, about manipulation, but love is the basic message. Geoffrey Sax tried to break Shakespeare's Othello by bringing it to a modern context. However, the actors were not convincing enough to get it out. There have been other bodies to help put everything in perspective, however, John Othello, played by Eamonn Walker, despite reacted much in this film, causing the fall of Keeley Hawes, Dessie Brabant, eventually ending Dessie's death. Ben Jago, played by Christopher Eccleston, was seen as the main character in the film. He didn't give enough evidence for Dessie to cheat Othello, with Michael Cass, played by Richard Coyle. Instead, he just played a friend to everyone and gave one reason to "cheat". In the game, it took Iaga much more convincing for Othello to suspect anything. This change made the film more about rage for bad reasons than what the book was based off. However, the film had some good points. It turned the army scenes into a more racist group towards the blacks, where Othello is the chief chief of the police force. These scenes are angry mobs of believable and flaming fire. You are able to perceive the amount of racism in the film, more than in the book. This book plays on a modern day scene by making it much easier to understand than the Shakespeare times when it was written. In the game, Iago (Jago) is tortured at the end, but in the film gets his satisfaction and gets Othello's position. She'll never get what she deserves, and she'll never catch him when she tells Othello a lie until it's too late. I saw it as a fall in the film, because I think the villain has his treasure from the promotion of lying, and Rodrigo finds out in the book. Overall, the film could do a better game-based job than what it did. I think the director of the movie missed some of the most important parts of the game that were mentioned, or there to create a game, or make it more tragedy. I'd say you should read the book first to understand all the events that happened in the movie, otherwise you may become lost and confused.
