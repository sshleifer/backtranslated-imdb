Consequently, the touted update goes and shoots itself over the head. Somewhat apt, given the regret of this film, the continuation of the film, which apparently did not need it. <br /> <br /> What Robocop 2 really is irritating is that, of course, the creators didn't understand why the original was so good in the first place. Robocop (7) was a humorous, lively satire of bad action movies. Robocop 2 is just a bad action movie. The thin dialogue, especially towards the tiring final shootout, attracts little interest and has no energy or the spirit of the original. Spoof ads, now a bit tasteless ("Warning: continued use will cause skin cancer") seems only there as an additional idea. And calling the new drug designer "Nuke" is nowhere near as subtle or funny as the original family board game, "Nuke"! <br /> <br /> Stop-motion animation ??? the weakest element of the original? is used more extensively, as this humorless sequel fails to include sequence credits that makes it look even cheaper and rushed. Oh, no humor? You can say. But what about a funny mayor, or the way Robo is reprogrammed for a runoff phrase? Yes, these are slight relief attempts, just as Robo has tightened with a screwdriver ("we are just humans") for film madness, but none of them are likely to provoke laughter. Like the rest of the movie, they are old and moronical attempts at fun. The third and final movie in the series (imaginatively called Robocop 3; 5) saw that Peter Weller was leaving. Robert John Burke, who is doing a modest role. With a softened language and violence, it was an obvious petition on the child market. With an overly exaggerated social conscience and the terrible attachments of Robocop's newly found shoulder and jetpack, the ultimate film was never supposed to be a masterpiece. Still, the flow of Fred Dekker and the steady pace make this fun player a joyful observation. Robocop is a movie. Robocop 3 is a sequel that you could watch if there was nothing better on it. Which lets the second movie hang in the middle, inimitable dirge image. A franchise car that has nothing to say except for the street signs that have risen. Irvin Kershner is not Paul Verhoven, like Frank Miller and Walon Green are not writers such as Edward Neumeier and Michael Miner. A tragic waste of a good, albeit limited, concept. 4/10.
