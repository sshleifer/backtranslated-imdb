I'm sure it impressed me - I can't believe anyone has made another Australian movie that is even more boring than Somersault. The story is unlikely, characters except Friels and Mailman's characters are unlikely and wooden, Tom Long has a VAST line of facial expressions: happy and not happy, and "sex scenes" that could be very confrontational and disturbingly erotic, would be at home in low-level pornographic film. This is the first movie I've seen in a 30-year-old movie theater that had my place on the edge .... ready to get up and leave. The best thing about this movie is a promotional poster.
