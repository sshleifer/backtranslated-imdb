That's scary. No, this is, bar, nothing worst ... worst ... I hesitate to call it @ & $% in '_movie_. It's a ninety-minute visual root channel. The story is virtually non-existent: a mad scientist who looks like a "The Cars" frontman impregnates a woman in his secret lab, a lawn chair in what I think can be a garage, using Palmolive. Within hours, a full adult monster is born, which then continues to rampage. That's the whole movie. Deadly Scenes: These are poorly set up, take on themselves, and act ... how can you get rid of _screaming_ ?? The victims stand there while the growling, wheezing, overloaded madman progresses to them and continues to cut them down for three days. The kits are raw, the lighting for most of the movie consists of one maglite (yes, a big honkin flashlight), the sound quality is low, there are only about 40 words of dialogue for the whole movie and the acting is generously described. as wooden. The shots are brazenly recycled to expel the film. And special effects would make any BBC science fiction production shake their heads and say, "They didn't even try". 'Monster' is some nameless in a $ 3 halloween rubber mask with a few bandages slapped on. In a meeting with a lone filmmaker, a policeman burns mindless, smokeless, invisible missiles that seem to travel so slowly that a monster can avoid them in five steps. You don't see this movie. No, it's not courage. You don't see this movie. The director should be shot. The writer should be strapped to a giant rock, where his liver will always be eaten by Ed Wood. Enough loans and it could be a sequel, don't let it happen!
