I rented this movie and hoped it would provide some good fun and some great poker knowledge or stories. What I got was a documentary look at the average life of the guys that was really good on the cards. I want to see romance with his wife? NO I want to see everything that happened in this guy's life except poker? NO. Well that's what you get with this movie. The effect is good for such a low budget piece of crap. The film never tries to break through the mold or do anything original. Just sleep goes through the script. The end is disappointed and never looks deep into Ungar's mind. Instead, it focuses on what has already been obvious. He was a dazed player with an average lifetime, unlike other average joe in vegas. The film focuses on aspects of his life that were extraordinary rather than extraordinary. Poker scenes in the entire movie add up to 4 minutes of recording. Ungar's achievements in winning the WSOP three times seem to be a life of thought. A 10 year old could do a better job directing this movie .. or maybe it was a script being a piece of crap from the beginning that denounced this movie joke. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a movie about gambling watches Rounders. At least she has a style.
