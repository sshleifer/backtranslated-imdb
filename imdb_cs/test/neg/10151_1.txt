I like cheesy horror movies, I think dead alive and bad tastes are great and I think sleep party massacre II (even in connection with this movie) is fun. But this movie is absolutely motionless, I wasn't allowed to, nor did I use it .. you can see all kinds of bugs that aren't even camping. The best scene where a woman leans against a window is where she slams her head on the windowsill? Give me a break. Do not let this thinking be rented, it is in connection with the party massacre series. It's terrible and I have no idea how it has any distribution. Rent it with a fake name and burn it, everyone else will be kind to you.
