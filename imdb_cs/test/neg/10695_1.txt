This is the worst movie I've ever seen, so bad it's amazing. I'm glad I never saw that black sidekick in some other movie: OK, it wasn't his fault someone gave it to him, but he could refuse the role and try to act instead. How did anyone get the money to put this movie together. Is there a corporation in Hollywood that deals with garbage for male college students without a brain? "Oh yeah, they will love this: he has no believable plot, some kungfu movements, Chuck Norris, a black sidekick with bad slanting lines, a sweet little Israeli (or is he an Arab or cared for?) Boy pickpocket and devil and many thanks to all who are worried about enriching the human race.
