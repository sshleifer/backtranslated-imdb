An excellent example of a catastrophe that occurs when you combine a challenging scenario with two actors selected for physical attraction. It is rare for me to consciously be aware of acting during the first viewing of the film because I try to go with the story and save the analysis for the second track. In the case of "Full Drive", acting was so weak that the film was impossible to appreciate as a story; I was too busy (during the first and only viewing) between laughter and nausea. Fortunately for most individual cast members, almost everyone in the ensemble is weak, individual talent limitations do not contradict any real action. Riley Smith and Meredith Monroe are at least physically balanced because they are trying to find a common ground that looks too old for their characters' credible age. Unfortunately, the script requires particularly intense and compelling performances that display their characters, just exposing Smith and Monroe's overwhelming lack of talent. The positive is that they know enough not to look directly at the camera and bite. It is better to use a less attractive pair that could physically go through the right age. The basic story is not particularly original, just another variation on "officer and gentleman", but it would provide a nice show for a talented couple of "teenage" actors. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
