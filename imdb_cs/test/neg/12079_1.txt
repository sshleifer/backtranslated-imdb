It's only when the band travels and has only one original member. It's not the same as a classic lineup. All new actors play the lead roles of Rag, Scotty, etc., With Ashby as the practically only returning face from the first movie. And he had only a small comment on the first film that served as the only redeemable group of three guys Scotty tried to help in meeting women. The film is poorly written, featuring the dumbest dialogue on this side of Armageddon. Even for a T&A movie, this is a turkey. Even a low-budget movie with a budget of 80 years will not want to sit in this movie, which has no storyline, and a lot of bad games. This movie would be better if he was never released. Just bad.
