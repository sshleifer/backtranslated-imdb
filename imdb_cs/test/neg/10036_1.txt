Are you kidding me? This is perhaps the worst, amateur movie I've ever seen. Casting was terrible, the acting was worse than terrible, and I'm sorry the guy at the picnic speed loaded a plate full of food was somewhere nonsensical and the demonic ugly and chamber chases of Drew around were nothing more than comic. When I was guessing about the Bell Witch, I wanted to believe. I read some literature about it and thought it sounded like a possible story. But this movie destroyed it. Ric White (Director, Writer, Leading Actor, etc.) Takes too seriously and thinks he gives himself a little more credit than he deserves.
