How to do bad stories. That's not a question. It's a statement. <br /> <br /> Here are my movie problems. 1) Much of the story's development was predictable and boring. My emotions ran almost flat. The movie couldn't be reached by the viewer. 2) The characters were definitely non-charismatic. One was loon, the other was confusing and the third was pretty damn boring. There was absolutely no reason for them to pull them. Even though I knew it wouldn't happen, I was hoping to get into someone else, someone more interesting. <br /> <br /> 3) The physical environment was annoying for me. Trailer ??? In the desert ??? The desert is a place that most people would rather not visit. How come these three people end up in the desert ??? <br /> <br /> 4) And in the same desert. Did the writer really expect me to believe that the last three people on Earth could find themselves within a few weeks in this desert? 5) Was it really necessary for Mrs. Ryan to be in two scenes that require a swimsuit? Hey, it looks great, but it was pretty unreasonable. Well, so when I thought it was so bad, why did I give him 3? I'm trying to be as objective as possible. Even though I found Alan uncomfortable, I must say that David Arnott did a very credible job of portraying a neurotic nerd (the character reminded me of some Albert Brooks more annoying role). Jeri Ryan tried to do something with Sarah, but it just wasn't written very well. Okay, so she was supposed to be a confused, broken woman. But why? What did she add to the story? Her mood swings left me feeling as if I was one step choppy (hard!) And then another and then another. Often I don't want to go to movies, but this has been thinking me several times. Tough, predictable, boring. Continue at your own risk. <br /> <br /> My 2 cents.
