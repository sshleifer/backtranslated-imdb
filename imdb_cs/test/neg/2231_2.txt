I rented this movie because I knew it would be bad (I saw just one good sequel to Disney and it was the Toy 2 story) but it went much lower than my expectations. I'm a fan of hard disney and I just don't believe in continuing with Disney movies. For someone who hasn't grown up with classics (either watching them come out or rented them from birth) it's a cute story. I feel the plot has been pulled out a little and it was predictable. One thing that pissed me the most was the girls' girls and the tramp. They were too high. Although most reviews say it's not that bad, I think if you're a real fan of Disney, you shouldn't waste time with this. Hopefully Disney won't do any more sequels of any other classics anytime soon.
