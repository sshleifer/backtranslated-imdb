I found the movie a bit predictable and boring, but I am 14. <br /> <br /> I was really upset with my little cousin as she was very hyper that day so I saw a movie on a Disney channel and put it on and said her to watch. she is 6 and she loved the movie, some pieces that didn't get the end, but i didn't get that either y was eddie the star of the video shot i thought it was jordan's video?! but she enjoyed it. I noticed errors like Jordan did not really play guitar at the end, but never. it's definitely a movie if you're seriously bored or 10 or less. <br /> <br /> Called my cousin well. Although all then it was singing for the rest of the day.
