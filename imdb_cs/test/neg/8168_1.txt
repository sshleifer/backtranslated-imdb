this is a movie that reminds me of an avatar - play rajesh khanna from the 80s. the issue of distributing parents and children is interesting, but it has been rather non-original. the characters were not fully developed and the children seemed to go from outside love making (in the first 15 meters of film) to totally uninteresting parents, this transformation was not credible to say it was the least. amitabh and jaya were mistaken as this helpless old couple .. firstly amit was not very convincing in this role because he just didn't seem to be helpless, i mean why not just go back to work where to want them instead of being w / children who didn't want to .. hema wasn't convincing as a 60 year old either ... she wasn't looking for a day over 50 .. then the whole isssue book baghban won the booker prize begging .. all in all, a movie that deals with an important issue but cld they were done better, I give it 5/10
