Where the hell did VH1 find the scriptwriter for this movie ??? High School? This film tries to sympathize with Michael Jackson, but instead turns him into a horrible, cheap cartoon. All the lines are full of clich√©s, but surprisingly it wasn't bad. As usual, it's a bad movie with pretty good actors. The actor who plays Michael Jackson, jeez, I'm sorry for him! I think he did the best he could with the weak scenario. I didn't mind that Flex didn't look like Michael Jackson, I thought he did the best he could, but later, when he had all those white make-ups, man, he looked yucky! Other actors who played Debbie Rowe, Priscilla Presley and Elizabeth Taylor were pretty good. Besides, the actress who plays Liz Taylor looked too young and healthy to play Liz. The actress, who plays Diana Ross, didn't look at her at all, and I couldn't figure out who the woman was until later in the movie. This movie does service for anyone on Michael Jackson's side or against Michael Jackson. It means nothing to change someone's opinion. As a matter of fact, the only opinion someone will have after watching this movie is, oh god, this movie really, really sucks! And where is the hellish music and songs of Michael Jackson? There are none in this movie. I like the soundtrack to this movie anyway and I'll probably buy it if I could. <br /> <br /> On the lighter side, however, this is a very funny, campy movie! It's a great time to watch something that won't have a brain problem. I will probably watch it again because it's just so bad fun!
