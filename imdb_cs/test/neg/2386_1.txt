"The New Twenty" is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Yes, some may argue that small budget filmography films that seek less may seem worse, but I would argue that the pseudo-intellectual anti-formal "indie" film that pretends to be more is worse. "The New Twenty" was written and directed by Chris Mason Johnson, and I will never return to the 91 minutes of my life I have wasted on his film. SCREENPLAY & CHARACTERS <br /> <br /> The scenario from start to finish could not provide a hero or hero with a moral core that viewers would like to see succeed or fail. In the storytelling, three dramatic conflicts are man versus man, man against world, and man vs. man. The scenario focuses on a group of college friends in New York, and is impressed with human dynamics vs. herself, where each of the film characters is so absorbed in the rigidity of depression and self-destructive behavior that the film atrophies very much with the viewers. <br /> <br /> Each of the main characters is dedicated to the inexplicable bad behavior (heroin addiction without history, why is the character a junkie, a fiance who has sex with a betrothed boss / investor, even if the character is too smart to have sex with such a slim character, a man who starts out as a decent man, but is attracted to investors who behave in the mouth and convert for some unknown reason into a similar merchant who is in the mouth who is closed, chubby chubby gay cyber geek, who will do nothing but find data online, and gay Asian, who dates an HIV-positive older man, but has no scenes to indicate why the relationship works and why love is evolving. <br /> <br /> Essential Scenes determining the cause of dependence on the character, suffering and self-confidence of the fiancé, who could explain why she would sleep with a slimy bag; ý would explain why a decent man would be attracted to a "Gordon Gecko" character and become a jacket; story for chubby cyber geek; and other scenes of interaction between an Asian man and an HIV positive friend are missing. <br /> <br /> Without proper details, all the actions of the character seem to be forced and fictional. DIRECTION, CINEMATOGRAPHY & SCORE <br /> <br /> I found that Mr. Johnson's direction is clear, so the actors are not emotionally divided. <br /> <br /> The camera can be described as mundane at best. Mr. Johnson chose the small spaces to shoot and could not capture the grandeur of New York. This failure created a claustrophobic film that looked like a theater play, not a movie. <br /> <br /> Scores were uncomfortably absent from most of the movie. I suppose Mr. Johnson is to blame because he could ask for a full score to improve understanding in every frame. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> The New Twenty is an unpleasant and unreal failure in filmmaking.
