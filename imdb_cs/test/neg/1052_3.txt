Physical evidence is one of those movies you want to have, but it really should be much better than it really is. Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Glenn Close and Robert Loggia, this gives the impression that everyone involved did it only when they were waiting for something better. The assumption is perfectly serviceable, it is mostly technically effective if it is awfully unspinspired, even with the surprisingly pleasant score of Henry Mancini, but you can't help feeling that it would be better if one of the leaders became a killer (like the case). As shown by the opening scene of his little-seen, personally catastrophic Heat (1986), Reynolds has all the prerequisites of a great screen villain. How is it, there is little surprise and a feeling of half-numbering by number, because it builds the head of the intertie because it is uninterestingly approaching less than the great will? final. Reynolds is fine, cruising on charisma in what is a bright star vehicle. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about Tereza Russell. The impressive and fearless actress in Nice Roega's film, which allows her to immerse herself in the darker side of human nature, is trapped in a part that requires the quality of stars rather than depth, and does not have it in spades. She does not fluff her lines or stumble upon other actors, but that is probably all she can say in favor of her amazingly stilted and often amateurish performance that makes the movie wrong. In addition to prosecutor Ned Beatty, the support cast will only add a little surrealistic presence in Boston, where everyone seems to have a badly masked Canadian accent and the streets bear a surprising resemblance to Toronto and Montreal. Likewise, director Michael Crichton, who showed Westworld, Coma, and Robbery's First Great Train that he knew how to tilt the audience to the edge of their seats, seems to be purely perfunctory mode - really , in one short pursuit of don shots, they don't match, and they seem to be bound almost arbitrarily. The climax itself makes no sense and is completely free from threat or danger, and many scenes are played much less than it is worth. It's no big surprise that, in addition to the unrecognized reshoots on the 13th Warrior, Crichton has no directing because. Its traceable enough in the 80s TV movie somehow, though it never lives up to the promise of its opening. Whatever the reasons for this to be seen, it's individual.
