Every time I go through this show on TV, I absolutely and truthfully want to claw my eyes, and rip my ears off.It's so incredibly awful. Jokes are not funny, acting is absolutely terrible, and the whole show is one of the major disappointments. I hate Charlotte Arnold's courage, and I want to punch her in the face or stab her knife every time I hear her conversation. It is no talent, low IQ, a big loss to society, and I think it would make the world a favor if it simply closed the f * ck and left for a long time. Please, I say it with all my heart, DO NOT VOTE ONE EPISOD THIS EXHIBITION !!!!!! It's not even 30 minutes of your life and there are thousands of better things, including killing, than watching this show for half an hour.
