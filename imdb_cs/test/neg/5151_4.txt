No, it's just a cheap 1940s serial with Cap. If you are a comic fan, you will be very disappointed. They radically changed character. No shield, no Bucky, no fight with the Nazis, no wings on the side of his mask, and most importantly: Captain America is now a district lawyer and no longer GI. Dick Purcell as Captain America? Don't look too close when it turns into a costume. It is obvious that he was not in the best physical condition when he did this series (can you say faded?). It is also very obvious that the stuntman performs most of the action. Almost every chapter has a binding fist that is shot and executed in exactly the same way. The villain is somewhat bland and although he uses the alias (Scarab), he does not wear a disguise of any sort. The story repeats and is very simple. The effects are ridiculous and the action is average. On the plus side, we have sexy Lorna Gray as assistant D.A. All right, but nothing special.
