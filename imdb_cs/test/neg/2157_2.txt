I'm not sure what the meaning of this movie is. It looked as if a historical company had done that in your local Pistol Pete museum. Initially, it seems to be the beginning of a Mad TV or SNL sketch. But the joke is up to you when it's not punchline and you realize somebody is taking it seriously. The story was not bad, but the inclusion of SASS members seemed to be a trick (that worked) to see me film. I swear, the trailer recorded all the characters in the film until "dead cowboy # 5". The reason why Westerns are so entertaining is the atmosphere and characters it brings. I just felt like I was watching civil war actors dressed like cowboys. Nor is it worth the digital video on which it was recorded.
