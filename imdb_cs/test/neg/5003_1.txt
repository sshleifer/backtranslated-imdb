This movie was terrible. It was so terrible. <br /> <br /> The most unpleasant was the way the process was performed. A lawyer is entitled to tread on and interrogate a witness without raising an objection. They attack the children brought by the testimony with cruel fury and repeatedly scream at them for lying. These are not just the things they subordinate to children who have been sexually abused. The process is stupid and destroys the whole movie ... (Law and Order spoiled me with the accuracy of the courtroom).
