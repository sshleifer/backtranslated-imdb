Alain Resnais manages three parallel stories about fantasy and imagination in the adult world. One of them is an operative bordello story, where a rejected architect tries to manipulate a group of people into the throat of happiness - only his attempt is missing, it is just a real goal, a woman who is borne by him. In the same unfinished mansion he built, a group of teachers are looking for love in a more modern story, because one woman believes she is undoubtedly in the romance, and a cynical anthropologist tries to teach her a lesson by building it with the greatest twitch. group. Meanwhile, a bunch of fantasy kids George Melies-like adventures of a prince who saves a girl in need of a swamp creature and then kills the evil king, bringing to the kingdom of love. Two basic themes? Life is a fairy tale and life is not a fairy tale. <br /> <br /> Which is better than the movie anyway. Resnais is a type of director where the concept is often good or bad, but the exhibition matters; here's the concept of great, but the film is totally painful to watch. Horribly tuned songs, lively characters without an ounce of dimension, backdrop of hideous pastels - instead of giving your inner baby an ice cream cone, Resnais drowns in a bucket of cake topping. Add some French philosophy and you get a strange witch to cook, one that doesn't bubble bubble toil and problems, but just sit wrong in your stomach until you want to repeat it. Resnais is a risk-taking director, and even at his worst, you can see that he is trying to do something that might not work with the full clarity of the action. In the film I Want to Go Home, he manages to pull past annoying characters and ditzy sets by showing some real change and moments of silence to catch his breath. Here she immerses directly in a fantasy that does not really reflect the imagination, only her children's wallpaper. The biggest problem is that he somehow managed to make a movie that captivated pop videos and more kitsch than the 1980s Golden Era. The fantasies are out of childish and naive, but the film (with nudity and profanity) is definitely meant for adults, a goal that it definitely missed. However, he is sticking to his theme and never singing. If anything, this film is impressive simply because of its unapologetic. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
