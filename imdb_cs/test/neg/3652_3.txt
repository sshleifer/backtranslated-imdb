MGM tried to pair and come with young men with Divine One to give them exposure and test them as leading men. Gable and Garbo had chemistry in SUSAN LENOX, but it was a lousy movie. Here at INSPIRATION there is no chemistry between Garbo and Robert Montgomery, and the script is also bad. What did they think? Modern, fast-talking, wise popping Montgomery and long suffering Garbo? It's a story like CAMILLE. A young student falls on a woman's world and is repelled by learning about her past, rejecting her, taking her back, rejecting her ... you get a picture. Garbo is absolutely believable as a model of the best Parisian artist and at home, even when bored, with life on top of society amidst her artistic friends and their free morals. Suddenly this innocent fascinates her. Finally, he gives up his life and sinks into poverty, only to save him and to establish himself in his own house. Ironically, he wants to marry and keep her on the side - so much for his pure moral ethics sooner. <br /> <br /> The scenes are incredibly boring and boring and nothing is happening. Only Marjorie Rambeau as Lulu is able to inject life into driving with lines such as "Unfortunately, weak women have strong tastes" and "Odette, where is your sting?" <br /> <br /> Garbo fans only.
