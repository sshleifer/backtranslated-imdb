Horrible writing, highly inventive, from "adventurer" who currently knows nothing about racial relationships in L.A. or the US. Blasting positive reviews is a mystery to me - but they could only be provided by people who think someone's "good" intentions should be applauded, no matter how shallow, simplified, and totally unrealistic results. If you want to see a movie that realistically deals with modern L.A. - The movie you need to see (and probably already seen) is Pulp Fiction. There's more honesty and realism in terms of race in any two minutes of this film than there are in 4 hours (oh, sorry, it was only 4 hours) of this smelly. If someone needs proof that the road to hell is paved with good intentions - then this is a movie for you.
