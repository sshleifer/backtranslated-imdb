BOOOOOOOORRRRRINNGGGGGGGG and STOOOOOOOPIDDDDD. He fell asleep. If you want to see Miles O'Keefe swinging in a furry Speedo, rent this movie by all means. If not, don't bother ... Experience anachronisms. Was it supposed to be determined in the Ice Age, Iron Age, Steel Age, or Reason? What was the reason for a black nylon wig for a guy dressed as Genghis Khan? Should it really be Genghis Khan? If Ator had access to such advanced technology and science, why did we wait for Leonard for another 1,000 years? It is never clear where Ator comes from, or if there is to be a superior kind of being. I wonder if it was all explained in the first movie, but after seeing this, I know you'll never bother.
