I haven't seen this show in months, but for a while I was forced to watch it every day because I had a roommate. So maybe it has gone through some tremendous improvement all the time, though the IMDb 4.2 ads and ratings are not a good sign. It was just a quick replacement for the Chappelle's Show. That's what Mencia says. And even though I wasn't such a big fan of the Chappelle's Show, his jokes were at least original and clever (and far greater than Mencia ever). Menci jokes are totally unoriginal and outdated. If you don't see it, I think there's no hope for you. But to be fair, here are a few examples: - Mantanne jerks from the Lil Jon skit chapel. She just takes it. "South Park" is an episode about Scientology. A week later, Mencia has a joke on his show as how to attack them to scientologists. Keep in mind that the joke isn't about Scientologists, but about how much they offended at his show. Until now, he had never done a single scientific joke, ever. After Hurricane Katrina, two photos of AP go online and show a black man looting food and a white woman finding it. WEEKS later, after millions of people have seen it, Mencia presents him on his show as if he discovered it and shows it for the first time (The Daily Show would be something like that in a day). Pathetic. Even more annoying than joke-stealing is the way Carlos has promoted himself and his show, claiming to break down some kind of PC barrier (anything) and that if you don't laugh, you must be a weak hero, who can't handle any race jokes. Yes, Carlos, it's not because you're not funny, it's because we're all too offended to laugh (if that was true, then why was Chappelle's Show so popular?). They constantly face their audience for "not getting it" if they don't get enough laughs, and they often repeat themselves and their jokes repeat, a technique that most comics stop using at the age of 14. The worst part is that Mencia doesn't seem very intelligent. It's somewhat tragic that there are dozens of fun, more insightful comedians trying to do it when the guy is in the money. His show is said to be the third highest rated on Comedy Central, which is miserable (again, has 4.2 ratings on this site). Where the hell do they get these numbers? Central Comedy tries to charge itself as a "nervous" station, but if it tries to appeal to the dumbest audience possible, it will never be so.
