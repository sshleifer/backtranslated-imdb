The forbidden movie of Nico Mastorakis was quite disappointing in my opinion. The film is about a couple who go to the Greek island to kill all perverted people (apparently). You know you have something sick enough when one of the first scenes contains a guy who has sex with a goat and then kills him. But since then things are getting worse because all the scenes look similar. . They meet some people so they either kill them or have sex (preferably both). The end is fine when a couple turns out to be a brother and sister and she just lets him rot somewhere but more could be expected overall. I'm afraid there's no substance here. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
