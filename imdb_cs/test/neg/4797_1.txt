I went to see this movie through Matchstick Men, actually buying tickets to Matchstick Men and going to the second because it looked like a fun movie with action, romance, excitement, jungles and exotic places. They had everything, but so many movies with a story. <br /> <br /> All I can say is, WHY WHY WHY WHY it didn't mean it was just a narrative story instead of an unfortunate story. Here are all the movies of what I saw that the film was derived from: Of course, Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone, but also True Lies, Proof of Life, Tom's old 80's movie Sellecka, Bananas (Woody Allen), and Hero (from the use of digital accessories). PS the only scene in a movie that was cool is when a central character discovers her room is fired.
