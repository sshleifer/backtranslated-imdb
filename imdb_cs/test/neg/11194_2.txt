(This review will have some very obvious spoilers, so be careful.) <br /> <br /> A friend brought it up and we managed 45 minutes of film before we decided that Fast Forward 8x Speed ​​is the only way that this film should be watched. There were points where we watched the movie at normal speed, where I left, preparing part of the lunch and coming back to see that nothing had happened. Two lines of meaningless dialogue were exchanged. Nothing happened on the background, there were no important gestures on the face, useless, just to the numbing unpleasant silence. tropics. If I told you that Disney made a film about 4 children who start the band, and the singer was a French student, what would you expect to be "conflicts" that arise? The main singer has to overcome the fear of the stage? Someone has an unspoken crush? The band is late for their performance and the side character has to buy them time? <br /> <br /> * SPOILER ALERT * <br /> <br /> All these things happen in this movie. /> <br /> At no point in this movie, you have the slightest fraction of the fear that these girls will not be able to meet their goal. <br /> <br /> * THIS MEETS THE SPOILERS SECTION * <br /> <br /> I like Japanese movies. I spent a lot of time in Japan. I work for a Japanese company. Damn, I even know that all the bands referred to in the collection of records and the MD they go through, and I sang with friends on karaoke on the title track. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in Japan. Don't be fooled. Although the characters will have points in the film where they do typical Japanese high school, it's not a "typical day in the life" of the movie. This is "a day in the life of 4 extremely random, strongly conflicting, unpleasant Japanese students." <br /> <br /> There are also problems with the DVD. See he decided that a great extra would be a producer who would read the Wikipedia entry on Blue Hearts aloud. What value! In addition, the titles are so low that the band's name in the subtitles is "Paran Maum" other than the menu for selecting "Paran Marum". In the final stage of the auditorium, there is a very visible reflection / phantom effect on everything, but it seems to be the fault of the original film. <br /> <br /> 2/10, DO NOT DISPLAY IF YOU DON'T Absolutely Love Unpleasant Silence.
