Looking for something shocking? Okay ... the pictures are. That's about it. This film attempts to establish a deep connection with the audience through various symbols and eventually ends in annoyance. I'm not quite sure whether the director's goal was to really portray any deep message to his audience, or whether he was just trying to shock them with gore, sex and violence. I think it was probably the first ... but in an unsuccessful attempt ... he just ended up being a piece of artsy waste with lots of blood, some unpleasant characters and an exaggerated reliance on religious symbolism. If you're looking for an independent movie that would be criticized for its attempt to use the metaphor ... so on. If you are looking for a gore movie that will make you uncomfortable and uncomfortable ... here you go ... If you are looking for a movie that will irritate you to the end because you realize the message was stupid ... the movie was stupid ... You'll never get the minutes of your life again, that's a movie for you!
