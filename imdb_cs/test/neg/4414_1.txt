Huge, cut, grimacing tree trunk threats fake "aborigines" to "Pacific Atoll" (looking suspiciously like Southern CA ...), reaction havok and revenge. Unlike the stupid stubs in "Navy VS The Night Monsters", Tabonga is actually an adult tree. Well, grown in 2 days: moost has gotten away from those Miracle Grow spikes ... Anycow, he's from hell, but from the grave a fake native, Kimo (Greg Palmer, "Zombie Mora Tau"), murdered by native elders for that they meet those terrible American scientists. Scientists include Dr. William Arnold (Tod Andrews, "Hang Em High", "Under the Ape Planet") and Professor Clark (John McNamara, "War of the Colossal Beast"). The rounding of the cast is Linda Watkins ("The Parent Trap") as annoying Mrs. Kilgore, an obvious comic relief that stands out from a distinct false "cockney" accent. Star cast really !! Anycow, because of his doughy, the empty wife, Korey, played amateur Suzanne Ridgeway ("Love Is-Poppin"), helps set him up, Kimo claims his revenge on her and all the elders. Then American scientists who did, exploited the tree, brought him back to life "in the name of science" and allowed him to wake up about the island to kill anyone who made him a mistake. Of course, we all know that evil monsters carry away fair virgins, so Tabonga catches a rough female scientist, Dr. Terry Mason (Tina Carver, "Hell on Frisco Bay") and leaves with her. A guilty ally, a good shot with Remmington hits a knife in Tabong and falls into the dead sand. This absurdly foolish tie is one of the ubiquitous cooks. Tabonga is probably the slowest monster in moovie history, right there with articles, an over-built robot from "Robot Monster vs Aztec Mom" ​​and a perverse slow carpet monster from "Creeping Terror". Try not to laugh when you watch Tabong throw fake natives down the hills and into the sand, avoiding spears and slowly bored of the island. Shady writing, woodworking, and handy direction all point out that this fibrous fertilizer has far more mooore than bark. This lukewarm pile of wood chips was the last hurray from a longtime editor, director and director Dan Milner, who quickly disappeared into well-deserved darkness after the film. You download it through the vines of MooCow first: "It came from hell" is a classic compost! : ??
