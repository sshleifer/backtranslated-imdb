By far this is the worst Halloween movie ever made. Negotiations are wrong, except for Paul Rudd and Donald Pleasence. The girl who played Kara (forgot her name) was fine, but overall the film was basically a big delay. Nothing moved the story forward, lacking the essence, and scared that Halloween and H20 were so good. All and all, skip this movie, it's not worth the rental price.
