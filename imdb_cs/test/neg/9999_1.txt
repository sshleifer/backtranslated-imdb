When all we have is largely the reality of TV shows with people who do themselves crazy for whatever reason, it's too fat, or can't sing or cook for damnation before I know that Hollywood has original ideas. I can't remember the time when something original or intelligent came out on TV in the last 15 years. What is our obsession with watching burns? I would think these types of programs would have a whole circle, but they come up with something new every year that is stranger than the previous one. OK, so people in this one have to lose weight ... most Americans have to lose weight. I just think we all look forward to watching humiliated people to some extent. Maybe we feel better when we see someone else looking like a blockbuster. I don't know, but I just want something intelligent that doesn't harm your intelligence.
