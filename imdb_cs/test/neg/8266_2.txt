Document Definition: Works, such as a film or television program, presenting a political, social or historical theme in a factual and informative way and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration. The keyword here is informative. I love being giants and hardly knowing about them. I don't care what Sarah Vowell thinks of anyone, and Syd Straw was absolutely irritating. And listening to people reciting TMBG lyrics as if they were funny / interesting? It wasn't so. I think it was a problem: the film spends time discussing the love of TMBG for coffee. So what?? Millions of people love coffee. Was the material presentation fun? No! There were indications that both men were married but never talked about them. And what about the solo material they did? What motivated them to do so? These types of questions are not solved or answered. <br /> <br /> I could go on and on with the negatives. Very interesting I found the segment on Dial-a-Song. To learn more about The Might Be Giants, just buy a few CDs and listen. Seriously. This film is a huge disappointment. I can't believe many people gave it 10. Incredible.
