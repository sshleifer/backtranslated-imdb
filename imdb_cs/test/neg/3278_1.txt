1 Yeung has been in the movie for ten minutes, including when he serves the beverage's beverage. 2 Lots of street criminals who look like junkyard holders will immediately seize an Asian superhero who speaks as an illegal stranger who is on the back of a truck. 3 (thief) let me do it - shirts off, gay model like muscles- heee-haaw! hee-heeew! hap hap! - He is dead on the floor with his neck, elbow, chin or balls broken - 4 cheap semi-sex scenes where the white wide comes out of nowhere digs up the Asian superhero. 5 Norton (former star of action movies) does nothing but act as an eccentric fashionable gun smuggler who trades white slutty girls in a nightclub, where they readily follow an idiot as a millionaire who bursts on them (reaping what you sow) 6 yes, the local police captain is involved and yes, the first loser cop is a former superhero team mate (yaawn!). 7 Action Scenes Are False Like A) hee-haw! Chinese are trying some spinning kick B) skinny leg of chinese throat negro thug C) completing death move to his head too like walker texas ranger fake action 8 final titles finally <br /> <br /> sheer waste. These people are only good enough to stand in productions or careers in other C films and have been credited with MOST together as a "stunt crew provided by County Prison".
