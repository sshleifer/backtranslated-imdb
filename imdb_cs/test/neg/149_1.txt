I've just watched this "movie" and actually wanted to write my first comment on IMDb.com, even though I've been a user for over 9 years. The reason I watched it is that I like film spraying and sometimes I like to try my limits and see what's really shocking me. At first I wasn't struck by this film, nor was the idea that someone came up with it and made it a movie - what really shocked me is that there seems to be a market for this kind of crap. . do not get me wrong - I am against censorship, but this film seems to me to have been created for some kind of fetish crowd that looks like this type of sh * t same kind of disgust and guilt that one felt after watching movies like "August Underground ". The movie is horrible to watch, but at the very least you feel the filmmakers want to show you how vile the violence is. In the case of "Nika Daruma", it seems that it was done strictly to wake people up. I prefer films that shock because they are well done and thoughtful, as well as Gaspar Noe's movies, or Takashi Miike's, or Funny Games or Man Bites Dog - those movies will hold on to you for a while. this movie, which I will forget tomorrow, and the only thing that will hold on to me is the idea that somewhere there are people who are excited about watching this sh. if you read it, please check out another hospital or shoot yourself - this is of course not true for gore hounds who love splashing. Are you OK! peace
