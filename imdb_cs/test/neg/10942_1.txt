Shakalaka Boom Boom is a rip off from Amadeus movie. I personally rate Amadeus as one of my favorites, not only because it is the music that is my favorite theme, but also because it tells us the true story of a musical genius who not only remembers the vast works of beautiful music he has produced. During his lifetime, but for his own self-destructive nature and his tragic death at the age of 35, which during his life was virtually unrecognized because of the politics played by some people, especially Saliere, the Italian composer who was jealous of him. Personally, I was shocked to see Shakalak ... because the director was always carving most of the scenes from Amadeus. I see the worst kind of plagiarism in this movie and I am skeptical about the kind of movies Bollywood is constantly developing day by day. The film is a disaster, the two musicians in the film give you no feeling of being realistic, the film is tasteless, insignificant, and complete failure in any number. The only one who has an impact is Bobby Deol, who at least knows how to act. Otherwise, the whole cast looks like a bunch of amateurs. Ironically, while watching the film, the first screen in the movie says that all the characters in this movie are fictitious and that any resemblance to anyone is purely random, which is a glaring lie because all the similarities are very clear and very determined. I wish I could have Darshan et al. Take the court not only for copyright infringement, but also for crippling a beautiful work of art.
