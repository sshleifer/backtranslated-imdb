I consider myself a decent sense of humor, but this "movie" left me stunned in a chair. It's so bad that it couldn't get any worse. Not once did I laugh sadly at trying to make jokes in this movie. I watched and enjoyed some big movie parodies, but unfortunately it will always be the one I remember best - in my nightmares. <br /> <br /> The only reason anyone should want to look at it is if they want to enter a short coma. This is the worst movie ever.
