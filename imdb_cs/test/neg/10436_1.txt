A recent DVD release of Good Humor Man marks the film as a comedy. It is hardly a comedy, rather a boring independent film about a group of losers. Probably in the 1970s, little attention is paid to period details, with excessive color correction. The monotonous soundtrack serves only to emphasize the repeatability of the film (perhaps that is the point, but it does not contribute to the enjoyment of the viewing experience). It looks like the film's comedy cover is supposed to deceive people to rent or buy this movie, which is a complete waste of time.
