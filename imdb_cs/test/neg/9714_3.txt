The only reason I watched this little known Irish movie was the question that Mike Myers played a normal, dramatic character. Well, he could and his acting was pretty good, but unfortunately it was probably the only good thing I could say about this movie. At the beginning, the film follows the life of a 12-year-old orphan, Mickey, who lives with his brother and sister with their rather eccentric grandmother. Despite a strong language, it looks like a family movie, but after a while it becomes clear that Pete's Meteor is barely suitable for a young theater drama. And worst of all, it's a drama with so many ridiculous and even unlikely conspiracies. One nonsensical storyline turns into another, and there is no point at all on screen events. I suppose that when a life drama needs a meteor or something that looks like even more ridiculous spiritual content, it's a really bad sign. Characters are not much better than the story. Despite all his troubles, young Mickey is by no means a sympathetic figure, but it was clear that we should take care of him and even feel a strong compassion with him. It does not work. Same with other characters. They are mostly as ridiculous as the story itself with the title character (though he was not the main character) as the only bright place. At the end of the film, I still had great hopes that there was something behind that omnipresence and absurdity. Unfortunately, even though the story writer had such intentions (and I'm sure he had) in the movie, they are hidden and virtually imperceptible under such a strange scenario. Stage: 3 out of 10. Those of you who are interested in seeing Mike Myers as a dramatic actor can watch Pete's meteor for that reason, but the rest of the viewers will most likely be bitterly disappointed.
