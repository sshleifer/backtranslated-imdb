Bad, ambient sound. Lots of mixing. Loooong senseless scene. For example: a guy sees an interesting woman in the hall. He can stay there and watch her under the guise of waiting for the head of the building to get the package. She says nothing. He looks creepily. More mixing and other irritating ambient noise. Wait. Wait. Wait. Guy says nothing. The woman looks scared or at least a little disturbed and right. The administrator returns with the package. Guy goes to the apartment with the package. Another example: this guy and his guest sit around watching bad TV. More ambient noise and shuffling. Wait waiting. Guy travels to bed. If you can still see this movie, you can watch TV later. .
