This "cosmic passage" was kind of stupid. I think it was supposed to be an unexpected end, but IMHO was just a huge downturn. Joseph Campanella and the rest of the terrestrial actors are doing a great job in this; however, their performances are not fair with such a stupid end. How this end could ever get through any sort of review by the producers is beyond me. Another comment is not correct here, the language in the vignette came only during the second season, this thing should have been taken seriously! Producers and writers could be a little more creative with the end making the rest of the episode of justice.
