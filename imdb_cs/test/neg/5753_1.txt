This game is a good looking first person shooter. ----------- Hang on ...... <br /> <br /> But of course this genre must contain a story, so it's a totally innovative conspiracy about the soldiers who are now powered by drugs. To save the world and kill the terrorist, Nectar is a drug of choice that will create a super soldier. Great, now just give us some fun, challenging missions, throw some new weapons and free off-road vehicles that can be driven in our free time and I'm pretty happy. <br /> <br /> NO !!!! The creator of this game decides to create a propaganda military game that seeks to understand our fears of terrorism and to embrace democracy. The game has twisted ideals that just re-enforce the morale that we learned when we were in elementary school, nothing new is said to us, but "Drugs are bad ... mmmkay". Then he pushed into ... Yvan eht Nnnioooojjjjj! (to join the navy) how to stand up to the common good, to normality and abnormality, right and wrong .... GOOOOOOOOOOD WE GET IT! WE ARE SOMETHING !!!! <br /> <br /> NO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br /> You can't, you're forced to endure extremely long gaps in completing BULLSH! T Goals like "Run to Helicopter" ....... "Go to a Troop Group" .. ... After it's finished ......... CINEMATIC takes over ..... .... You sit there for at least half of the game and watch the scenario that takes place in characters, man I can't skip but sit and wait, sometimes when people don't talk, we sit and wait for a helicopter landing! Wrong game from a laughing programmer group! Don't bother doing more because I would rather see the movie!
