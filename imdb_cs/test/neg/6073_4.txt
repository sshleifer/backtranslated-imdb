Yes, I realize that half a dozen other reviewers have called this film "Copying Amadeus," but that's not enough. The scenes seemed to be raised directly from Milo≈° Forman's script with superficial changes. You can expect to see: <br /> <br /> - the arrogant maestra scene ("I am the voice of God. Everything else is meaningless!") - Maestro makes fun of the average composer's work (supplemented with raspberries) and simulated flatulence, just like in Amadeus) <br /> <br /> - Average Composer Dialogue with God ("Why do you instill music, but denying me the ability to compose?") <br /> <br /> the deathbed scene ("Shared Time. Start with the Violin ... Cough Coughing") <br /> - and the list goes on ... <Br /> <br /> The problem is even worse. Not only were these scenes copied blatantly, but they didn't do well either. Jeepers, if you are going to rip an original, you should at least try to improve it in your own creative way. No wait, there is something even worse. It's the fact that the director tried to beat Mozart's story into Beethoven's story. Guys, Beethoven wasn't crass, vulgar freedom, as this film portrays him. In addition, Beethoven was not a crazy idiot who takes pointers from his copyist, 23 year old music student. Unfortunately, movies like this are responsible for cutting history. And another thing, Beethoven (in real life) never called it "Moonlight Sonata" as it does in the movie. The name got confused by the critic for several years AFTER DID, and unfortunately it stuck. But Beethoven's original name was "Quasi una Fantasia". And other things when Beethoven (in the movie) shouts "B-flat! B-flat! B-flat!" And hit the note on the piano, he hitting the white key! <br /> <br /> A THINGGG !!! Beethoven (in real life) has been completely deaf for several years before composing his 9th Symphony. This film shows him that he barely has a minor disability (he says "what?" Every other line, just so annoying). <br /> <br /> AAAND !! ANNNOTHER !!! THINGGGG ... !! American accents ...! Does not matter. Just ... don't mind. I've wasted enough time on it. Go again "Amadeus". Then, if you want to see an interesting biography about Beethoven's life, see "The Immortal Beloved" who takes poetic freedom, but at least they're interesting ideas. Finally, if you want to see something on the lighter, check out "Impromptu", a movie about Chopin. But besides the three, I've never seen a good tribute to a classical composer.
