Why did they have to make such a terrible adaptation? The entire "Complete Jane Austin" series as part of Masterpiece Classics looks like a huge disappointment. The characters are completely wrong and there is no chemistry on the screen. The whole thing seems rushed. A 1999 edition based on the same novel appears to be a masterpiece compared to this. I really want to forget it. I am really glad that "Pride and Prejudice" will not be re-made as part of this project and will see the iconic and spectacular Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle as protagonists. If you missed this "Mansfield Park" production consider yourself lucky!
