"Tenchi Muyo In Love 2" is Tenchi's third movie. His creators seemed to have taken the elements of the first two. With the risk of giving away spoilers, Tenchi is kidnapped and the team must get him back. Nothing new. Yosho's past love is bad. This was done in the second movie. The battle between Aka and Ryoko and getting bored. The film has almost no action scenes and very little comedy. I personally do not know what they thought AIC, they are the creators. I gave this movie to 4 votes.
