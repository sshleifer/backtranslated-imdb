Andy Milligan, an independent filmmaker from New York, directs this little delicacy as his version of Sweeney Todd. Sweeney cut the customers' throats in his hairdresser, and his cohort Mrs. Lovett made them meat pies. Fortunately, I was well informed about the plot before I saw this movie. Milligan, for my money, has to really run at the head of the worst directors of all time. Ed Wood looks like Orson Welles. This movie is so bad in many ways. Let's take Milligan's instructions to get started. The quality of the film is grainy. The sound quality is grainy. Many scenes look like Milligan used a video camera to film. Credits Say "Photographed and directed by Andy Milligan." Want to take credit for ceilings that appear after death? How about the appalling music score chosen for the movie? The film cuts with one bad transition after another. A small logic is used to create a graph. The story has little to do with the true legend of Todd. The murderous scenes are abundant, but they are by no means scary. Hands, feet and other pendants are cut out of the skills in which the editing was done: choppily! And we'll take the breasts into the pie scene. Yes, it's there. The cake maker didn't know that the whole breast with the nipple would fill the whole pie crust? Later on, we hear from our characters that "they were careful not to get caught" for the 200 murders they did. Obviously, this is a couple of boobs who are unable to keep up with what's going on (I'm sorry it was too tempting). The actors aren't too bad to be honest. Some even have glimpses of talent and all seem to be original English articles. Many non-erotic nude scenes are forced around the world. Apparently Milligan has some questions about sex. Fence springs are left untied. The end is almost unsatisfactory due to poor camera work. I could go on and on. Did I like something about the movie? It's not very true. I have a high degree of acceptance of this ilk's films in terms of low budgets and marginal talent, but this film lacks any purpose other than being rude and ill.
