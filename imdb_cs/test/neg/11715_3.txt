A few friends and I went to a video shop a few years ago and we were in one of those moods we rented with some harsh looks. My friend grabbed the head of the family and we were greeted by a head sitting in a wheelchair. Well, it made us laugh and we decided to bet who would be the one who had to go to the table and pay for the film. Well, you guessed it, it was me !!!!!!!! I've never been so embarrassed for my whole life. We got home and dressed for the floor and laughed for about 45 minutes because it was the funniest movie in the world. I can't remember much about it, but one thing I remember was a blond girl getting it with some guy in the back of the store every 5 minutes. That head made me laugh, and when I look at the comments of other nations, this movie makes me laugh. The head of the family is so good and the head is funny and still laughs ha ha ha ha ha ha
