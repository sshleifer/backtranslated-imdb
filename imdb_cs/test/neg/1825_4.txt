Basically, I watched it for the sole reason that it should have references to the Third Reich. It turned out to be a totally helpless and predictable film of slasher that seems to be attractive to feminists or something. <br /> <br /> Let me tell you something when you wait for the whole movie to see attractive female breasts, the last thing you want is a "tasteful" finished sex scene with annoying camera angles that don't show anything. Her busty friend didn't even get her out, but we saw a lot of men's butts and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off. And finally, my heroine magically avoids scalpel and thief swings (which turns out to be a piece, merrily) and fights easily (uh huh), while her male interest in love is tied up and waiting to be saved. The funniest part was when she picked up the chair and "rocked" it with the guy and he breaks over him. Now it would be as much as she could lift a chair, let alone break it against a man with enough strength to break it! It looks ridiculous, basically cleansing it against itself and falling apart. If you are going to do this kind of "role reverse" garbage (which has already been done to death), then you must at least make it partially plausible. But he was one good piece. The bad boy got to a better slimy friend and taught her a lesson for being such a hiker and sleeping. This is not something feminists want. <br /> <br /> Pretty stupid. Not that American slasher flicks were generally much better, but you have to wonder why they bother. There was nothing new to the genre. <br/> 5/10
