The director makes this film a false depth by repeating the trick throughout the film. EVERY single frame in this movie is 3 times longer than needed. You can easily cut out 1.5 hours of this agonist 2.5 hour movie without eliminating: one dialogue word, one picture, one event, or a bit of movement. It was one of the rarest waste film I have ever seen. Other reviewers have called it pretentious, which is an understatement. L'Humanite is a pseudo-intellectual waste designed to be anti-Hollywood so that judges at Cannes can assert their independence from the Oscars. IMDb Reviewer says: "Unlike Hollywood movies, which usually force the audience to overclock - it makes viewers slow down and look at some of the smallest and rarest features of life. You will have to be catatonic to look at some of these images for so long and move so slowly with these characters. This is not real life unless you are heavily medicated. Finally, I felt that Schott's portrayal was the sad rebound of master "Chauncy Gardner" Peter Sellers. Uses the same facial expressions and posture. Even the gardens! In many ways, there are parallels between the two films. The main difference is that "being there" moves and does not rely on shock and tricks to create a meaningful experience and question the various things we take for granted in life.
