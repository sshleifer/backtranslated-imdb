I can't believe the horrible movie was created by the same people who made Lepa Sela Lepo Gore. Watch and skip this. The plot is confused and the characters are mostly two-dimensional stereotypes. I think the editor went on vacation in the middle of the film because of the fast, choppy cuts that more confuse things than clarify them. Neither does the end make sense. It is mainly a propaganda film made so that the Serbs apologize for themselves and defame America for NATO bombing in 1999. They do this by keeping lies about the Serbs being our allies during the second World War II, claiming that the whole world is unfairly against them, and totally ignoring everything that Slobodan Milosevic has said and done, such as waging war in three neighboring countries. They seem to intend to make a political film, but on the TV screen for just a few seconds. Apparently, the Nationalist Agenda has replaced any art thinking that was not the case of Lepa Sely. Unfortunately, I recommended this film to a teacher when he played at the Seattle International Film Festival last week. He also cited poor editing and confusing plot and I had to apologize for bad advice. You were warned.
