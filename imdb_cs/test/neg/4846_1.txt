I've never heard of Dead Man's Bounty when I saw him on a DVD store a few weeks ago, and I thought I came across an unrecognized gem because Val Kilmer really had a unique role in it. Sadly, it wasn't more than ten or fifteen minutes into a movie that I realized was a catastrophe of epic proportions. The first clue to see how truly this movie really is is coming to the beginning when you have a lot of dirtbags in an old salon that laughs like a bunch of hyenas on a scene that takes about five times too long. It's incredible how bad it is. And unfortunately it is no better. Val Kilmer is prominently placed on the film box, perhaps making you think he has a role in the film, but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of concentrating on a lot of half-humorous cheats and the most conceptualization of the unique city sheriff I've ever seen in the movie. It is played by Boguslaw Linda who is unable or not interested in covering her Polish accent, which makes it impossible for the film to take place in the American Old West. Does Poland have this type of border past? I don't know. My knowledge of Polish history is not my strength, but I can tell you, the sheriff, as I know in the film, is the worst representation of law enforcement I ever remember when I see it in the movie. He is presented in a truly absurd scene where he is wearing a scarf and a peaceful man alternating and punching him in the face. Before he starts to beat him, he explains that everyone can hit him once, and after the first round, everyone will hit him again, and if he can find out who is throwing strikes, they will lose. What the hell? I'm totally embarrassed to explain why such a scene would ever be embedded in a movie. Throughout the film, the sheriff still appears more and more defeated and bruised and drunk and beaten until he does anything but occasionally, stumbles on the screen and mutters "no?" "You see, there's plenty of talk and preparation for hanging, the details of which are as nonsensical as the rest of the movie. By the way, this is a city that consists of just two dilapidated wooden buildings across a flattened piece of dirt that is rather I understand that it is a part of Poland that should look acceptable as the American Southwest, where none of the characters, except perhaps the dead, could come. <br /> <br /> I have heard that Val Kilmer this role he accepted because of his unique role and the minimal use of Uklanski's dialogue in favor of relying on the cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual photomontages. <br /> <br /> Yeah, whatever. <br /> <br /> Seems I think that Kilimer couldn't overcome what had to be a really satisfying feeling he had to get when he was offered a role. he reached a certain level of success when someone approached me and offered me a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lie on the ground for a while. I think I didn't even read the script for this mess, because if I had a total loss to understand why he accepted the role. In any case, the film will open with a man bringing the corpse of a man played by Kilmer looking for a reward. He soon becomes entangled in a ridiculous love story that includes an urban prostitute, an alcoholic sheriff, and a lot of chaos that includes a number of stupid, stupid characters. There is also an extensive and senseless lack of understanding of American rituals. In one scene, a person cuts half a cherry tomato and shoves half into Kilmer's eyes (for what reason I can't imagine it), and then the man briefly talks about Kilmer's body explaining that he was "one of the best men we've ever been they had, and then trying to cut off the shovel. What the hell? Not yet convinced? Here are some other reasons not to look at it. In one scene the sheriff appears to be covered with ash, with the exception of perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only be described as bright red lipstick. A man gets a blow to the head that crushes his head and body in his blood. He stunned him with gunpowder. Smart. In the end, the sheriff seems to have a broken arm. As he sat at the bar, he laid a rope around his neck and connected it to his wounded arm, pulling a rope with his good arm, lifting his trembling beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth instead of using his good hand to drink. Also smart. Why doesn't he just use his good hand? I have no idea. This, like everything else in the film, has no meaning at all, like a name. Summer Love? Are you kidding me? Avoid this mess at all costs. Meanwhile, there is something for IMDb Goofs ?? Bugs Caused by Characters (Maybe Intentional Errors by Filmmakers): This film was created. HA!
