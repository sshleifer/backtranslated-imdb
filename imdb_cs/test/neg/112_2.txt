Now I love Italian horror movies. The waiters are the better. However, it is not a cheese Italian. This is a weekly spaghetti sauce with rotting burgers. It's an amateur class at every level. There is no tension, horror, only a few drops of blood will disperse to remind you that you are actually watching a horror movie. "Special effects" consist of lights that turn red whenever it is around (or what it should be) and the string pulls the sheets up and down. Oooh, can you feel chills? DVD quality is the quality of VHS transmission (which actually helps the movie more than it hurts). Dubbing is below the lowest standards of "bad Italian film" and I gave him one star just because the dialogue is so cheerful! And what do we find out when he finally looks into the attic (in the scene that is one minute and the next night) ... well, I'm not gonna spoil anyone who really wants to see, but let's say it's not a "novel"!
