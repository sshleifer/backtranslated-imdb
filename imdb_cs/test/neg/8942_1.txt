The bunch of 3rd graders seemed to have stolen the video camera, borrowed some old editing software since 1995 and played a joke.

It was a group of friends who enjoyed each other and recorded each other. The plot was very hard to follow. The camera's experimental angles were reflected in the story and made a dizzying experience on their own. Although the comic comic was very amateur. I think the concept is fine. Maybe next time, manufacturers should raise capital and hire real experts and try again. I have to say I'm sick and tired of so much thinking that making a good movie is easy. It's not easy ... This fact seems to be lost or ignored by many who believe that without any training / experience and talent they can be a good product. I think they will eventually learn how difficult it is for me to be so disgusted that I don't have a comment Chrisite wrote on August 5, 2006 (billing no. 762):
