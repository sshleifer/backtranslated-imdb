The Feeling of Minnesota, directed by Steven Baigelmann and starring Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofri: The Tense Relationship Between Two Brothers, Sam (D'Onofri) and Yaks (Reeves), is moved to a breaking point when Jjak arrives Alone. The wedding and makes with the bride, Freddie (Diaz), a former stripper, takes Sam to pay off the gambling debt owed to the nightclub owner Red (Lindo). Baigelman's debut and direction is a frustrating mess, full of hateful characters and lacking in coherence. Launching Keanu and Diaz in the same movie should at least bring some eye candy, but Baigelman even gets the score, and his actors are angry with a small positive effect. Very bad.
