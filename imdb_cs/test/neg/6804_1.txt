I haven't heard much about this movie, so I saw it. I realized that this film only appealed to someone who didn't live in the real world. And even those people would think this movie is moving too slowly. When the film opens, you'll see Nicole Kidman, who goes to a nudist camp. Hey. Shock. The scene, dialouge, was great. And then the movie went downhill. Although I respect the vision that a filmmaker must have, this film is sucked. It was too slow, too predictable and not moving enough. Robert Downey Jr. is great, as usual, but this movie is not good enough to sit. He tries to be shocking and abnormal, but he misuses the talent of all actors. Don't waste your money, nor have sex scenes boring.
