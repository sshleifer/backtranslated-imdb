OK, so it's not great either, but just because of how great Laurel and Hardy were in the past. If this movie gets an overall fix with improved picture quality, add a new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and add a nice inconspicuous background music, then this movie really would start to form. How it is, he's in trouble. People were stinging how old boys looked. Quel surprise! they were in the '60s and led a' life '. However, for me, they still come across as with bucketfulls of spells, and when it doesn't come close to tickling the feet of their classics (I put it 4), it's worth a watch just because it's them. Thinking differently would be fraudulent!
