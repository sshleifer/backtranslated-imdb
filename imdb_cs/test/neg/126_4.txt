It is worth the fun of renting, especially if you like action movies. It contains the usual car chases, fighting big Van Damme kick style, shooting battles with 40 rounds of ammunition and even terror bombs. All this is fun and competent, but there's nothing that really blows you off if you saw your share earlier. The story is interesting because it has a rabbit that is clever but barely deep. Many characters are strongly stereotyped - angry veterans, frightened illegal aliens, crooked cops, indifferent confreres, bitter predatory boss, cruel politician, fat federal who seems to have been sent as a Mexican. Hollywood movie from the 1940s. Everything acted passively, but nothing special. I thought the main villains were pretty well done and behaving well. By the end of the movie, you certainly knew who the good guys were and weren't. There was an emotional lift because the really bad ones got their desert desert. Very simplistic, but then you didn't expect Hamlet, did you? The only thing I found really uncomfortable was the constant cuts of VD's daughter during the last battle scene. It's not bad. Bad. Transitional 4.
