AFFAIR is a very bad TV movie from the 1970s, in which Robert Wagner's and Natalie Wood's marriage team, who hesitated, played at that time. She has polio and leads a recurrent existence as a pop song writer. She is an ambitious lawyer who is very severely beaten with her. Their affair, like the one, is doomed from the beginning, and she knows it, but it still does. Two things to look at when you're trapped when you're watching this: Jane Fonda's hairstyle, who never cares, no matter what you do, and the melody she sings early in this horrible movie. It sings four or five or six minutes, so you know it's a classic stuffing between ads. It is also one of the worst songs ever written, and the woman who makes Wood's singing should be shot and put out of her suffering. Also pay attention to all the peasants and dresses. By comparison, Wagner looks relatively timeless, with narrow-cut hair and a sporty range of classic suits.
