One look at the evaluation should tell you that this film was voted on shills, in an effort to artificially strengthen the rating of this film. <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't bring anything new to the zombie genre. In fact, it is ridiculously bad (in acting and cinematography) and a derivative in its conspiracy. Makeup looks horrible and the zombies look even worse when shooting. The lines are firmly delivered and poorly timed except for a female bounty hunter who is the only good actor in this movie mess. The worst offenders are the Italian guy (Hans), the protagonist of Ryn and the leading evil guy. I saw a better pizza delivery with a flat tire. It's a self-styled "zombie western," but the only thing that makes it a "zombie western" is the fact that people wear cowboy hats and the real name of the actor is Clint. The protagonist is not cold and mysterious as a traditional Eastwood hero, and as an anti-hero he has no wise attitude to get rid of him. Don't be fooled by false shining reviews. This is just another B-level zombie movie that is competently made for the budget that it has (it has some decent lighting) but it smells of low-budget, first-time overhead and bad gameplay. There are plenty of stupid scenes that make this look really amateurish.
