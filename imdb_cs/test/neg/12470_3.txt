The beginning of the film was confusing and the rest was predictable. It was just one of those movies I met in my instant netflix queue, and I thought it would be interesting to see Brad Renfra and Bijou Phillips join together from Bully again. Unfortunately, "interesting" has never happened in this movie. Swain plays an invisible girl in a private school whose best friend is rich and does whatever she wants (Phillips). But Swain likes one of the boys (Renfro) from "in the crowd" and finally starts hanging with them. And of course, like all the other movies, they are good (or so you suppose, because the movie never suggests that things are good) and then things don't get so good by hanging with rich kids. The problem with the movie is that there are absolutely no peaks and valleys. It's just a dead, lifeless movie that, after watching it, makes you feel like you can do something better. Some scenes (those with Renfro's parents) make no sense even in the film, because the director and writer didn't even watch it at all. All the interesting things It could be played, it was just completely ignored, and it's almost like watching it before the stellar episodes (Mischa Barton and Rachel Bison of the OC). The only shining light in this movie and the reason I didn't get one rating is Phillips. They needed more scenes with her. Renfro looked as though he had brought a little of his character from Bully. And for pete's title, BS, change the name.
