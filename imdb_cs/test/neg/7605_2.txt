This sequel is pretty awful to be honest. I'm a fan of kung fu movies and that's by far the worst I've seen. The bride with white hair 1 was actually pretty good and it is a huge disappointment. BWWH 1 was brilliant in some ways with a unique odd bad guy. The couple from the first movie in this movie played a small part. Instead, the film revolves around a lot of uninteresting characters trying to revenge on their fallen clans. But there is no antagonist in this film, so revenge is muted. The worst part of this movie is kung fu or lack of it. They literally struggled with a street-style knife. The character at the end refused to fight because the choreography was missing.
