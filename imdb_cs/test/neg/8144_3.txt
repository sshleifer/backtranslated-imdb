For an indy movie it is about a bit better than 3 out of 10, but in general it only gets 3. The effects are not terrible and at least they have some adult roles rather than all children as a lot of low budget horror movies. Acting is very wooden, but at least had a better "display" than some films in the cord category. It's a lot shot inside the building than in a friend's basement. The plot as a whole is not the worst. It's a Resident Evil rip off by a bad corporation invading a small town and outbreak doing people into zombies. I'd like to see some kind of creatures rather than a big thief just another "super" zombie. I'm trying to write spoilers, but this review has one so be warned! WARNING: SPOILER !!! Not only do some of the cast just seem to shrug around the zombies (the same are recycled over and over, but at least they have more than 5 people playing). But one of the plots doesn't really come with me. The representative who goes in turns out to be on wicked corporations wages. He kills one of the other employees in the cold blood and then meets the head of a bad guy in the office who talks about cleaning up the mess. The deputy has just shown us that he is a really bad person and speaks as if he could clean him up (which means killing all the surviving witnesses) no problem. But two seconds later he helps them. There was no real "change of heart" emotion or something to feel that this evil man had gone from killing an innocent guy just a few minutes ago, and then talked about each of them having no problem being his savior. There was no incident or anything to make me buy it. It is worth watching if you are a fan of low budget flicks, otherwise you will not like it.
