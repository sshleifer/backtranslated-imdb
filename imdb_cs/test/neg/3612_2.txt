A group of tourists stuck on Snake Island after an unfortunate accident with their ship. They are forced to spend the night and as you probably suspected, this is not called Snake Island because it's just soooooo a lot of fun to say - it has a history of people disappearing one by one because of the big snake population, which is just what happens to these poor souls. It is a very boring and typical film with a number of off-screen attacks and poor performances of NOBODY. The only rather entertaining scene was a totally useless and forced scene, which is nothing that could not be seen in a movie rated PG13, the people. If you're in snake movies than look at SSSSSSS, but don't torture yourself with this crap.
