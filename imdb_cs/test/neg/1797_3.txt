Joseph Conrad's novel, The Heart of Darkness, is a dark, deep and enduring novel that portrays vanity and irony in Africa. If you're looking for a great book you can read on the weekend, it's not a book for you. Conrad does nothing to describe the 19th century imperialism, but the novel is meaningless without giving him the reflections and reflections he deserves. If I read this novel looking for a great adventure story, I would say I have wasted my time, but when looking at the perspective of explaining the futility of the 19th century civilization, I would say it is one of the most important novels I have ever read. Since I read this novel in my English class and analyzed every page, I think I appreciated the book more than someone who just read it for fun. I will not lie, this book was difficult and invited the reader to go deep into this novel in order to find true meaning. The film on the other hand I found tedious and boring. "The Heart of Darkness" does not come where the book of justice would be. The film has missed many key parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story. If you're having trouble understanding and visualizing a novel, the movie might be a good intervention, but I wouldn't recommend the movie to be seen as an alternative to a novel or even a different perspective.
