The 1998 "Psycho" version had to be established in the 1960s and not now. These operators would do a good job of setting up. There were two scenes that stood out like a painful thumb. The first was at the beginning of the movie, when Marian Crane (Anne Heche) sat at the table. Her boss took his client to his office because "it was air conditioning." I imagine most businesses in Arizona have air conditioning. Another was the meeting of Lily Crane (Julianne Moore) and Sam Loomis (Viggo Mortensen). The Lila Sports Walkman seemed to over-update the movie. The film haunted the audience in the theater.
