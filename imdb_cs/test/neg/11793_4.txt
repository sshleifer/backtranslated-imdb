I realize why people hate this movie. And I hated Blair's project of witches, so go to the number? It is about as staged as it gets & yes that insults your intelligence by trying to make it look real.I really liked the story of madame lalauria though it's more than likely to form. But the main reason I like this movie is false or not when ghosts start attacking them and kidnap them. but hey more than half of the drive, which is horrible in today's cinemas and DVDs, doesn't give me goosebumpy, so it's a creepy pleasure. 13 ratings are not gore. And the females are very annoying, you want the spirits to take them and experiment on them before they say it and do it. ** outside *****.
