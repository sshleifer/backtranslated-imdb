Words can't describe how awful this movie is. Well, maybe they can. I'll make a stab at it: 1 - Poor. Hollywood makes more talking animals in graphics. It seems that the script and storyline are no longer needed. <br /> <br /> 2 - Violent. Kids movie, but one of the characters is sinisterly attacked and killed. 3 - Crazy stupid. In fact, the film depicts farm animals that have human capabilities. In Nemo, the fish could talk, but for the most part, they are still fish. We only hear English as a translation. In Barnyard, animals are actually speaking English that other people can understand. 4 - Unintelligent - No clever story, no clever humor. (Ok, 13 year old dog on crutches was funny). 5 - A culturally insensitive - "black" cow is actually played by a black actress. Pink cow playing white actress. The black cow played a stereotypical black woman. 6 - Unknowing - No thing like a cow I know. I believe we call them bulls? If we are going to expose our children to a gift, it could also have the simplest facts right. My 4 year old left us after 45 minutes. He practically fell asleep. I'm sure this movie will make millions, which is unfortunate because Hollywood producers just prove that the American public is just filled with suckers waiting for $ 8 just to get a little and calm from children for an hour or two. Unfortunate circumstance. Why should manufacturers spend real money when revenues are the same.
