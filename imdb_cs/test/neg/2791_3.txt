The film begins as we see the shots of a huge drought in America in the 1930s. Then there is a short story about the haunted farmer Elij, who made a deal with Satan to get a good harvest. Elija hired young men to work in her garden, killed them and used them as scarecrows. He also fed the earth. Some time after two cops visit him. One of them is shot by Elija, another one kills the farmer himself ... After that, the present day is shown, and some guy named Sean says he has an old farm as an inheritance. He decides to go there with his friends to see what's going on. Little Sean knew the next night was "Payback Night" ..... <br /> <br /> As for me, this movie had a good story for a horror movie, but a low budget and bad special effects were destroyed. "Dark Harvest" is a perfect example of lazy film making. For example, we see a scarecrow (the usual guy wearing a funny, cheap mask) chasing a girl. When he raises his hand, we see normal human skin beneath his glove, instead of some rotting meat. Gore is also not very impressive. There are some nasty killing by our "beautiful" scarecrows, but everything is very cheap and unrealistic. Surprisingly, acting in this film is a bit okay, or I rather call it credibility. Some nude scenes are also presented to fans (even a lesbian scene), but these scenes don't store it. Verdict: Good music, good story, solid playing. But terrible effects, cheap holes, and hole plot slow down this movie. It's not really recommended.
