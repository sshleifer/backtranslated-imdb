It's really easy toast, toast, flay, and otherwise burn this movie for all its rich flaws. It was made by high school students and faculty and entire communities; shows! Sure, I could explore a scenario that's just ridiculous. A monster created from the rubbish of a growing California city begins to eat garbage around the city and take away garbage. Soon, this huge beast with wings will begin to destroy buildings and even play "beauty and beast" with a young high school woman. Fortunately for her there is a gang of guys, her former friend nicknamed "Penguin" and the city drunk to help her. The direction is terrible, the production values ​​are terrible, the acting does not exist and the pace is slow. The movie is hard to sit - period. However, it has been said, it is also a miracle of the film when you think this thing has been created by the entire community. You can see all the collective efforts of the actors, the real mayor and the real firefighters and the police, to the local shots. I was also impressed by all the local businesses that were credited at the end of the film to help finance or contribute to the film in some way. If you look at the movie from this perspective, it's really quite a success. I didn't know anything about it before I sat down and watched. Now that I've found out about it, I'm impressed. But don't make a mistake - I don't ... NO ... desire to sit again.
