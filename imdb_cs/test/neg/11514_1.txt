This movie is about 3 stories combined spins around 3 separate individuals. One of the worst movies that is available and even better if not available. The Good: 2 pretty lesbian actress 1 The True and Moving Story of Theresa Chan film format and in a more appropriate documentary form. No connection between the three story lines. Minimal DIALOG in movie, replaced by SMS and CHAT programs on PC. No cultural insight into the film, and that will forget you before you get out of the cinema.
