Power began to look promising, but soon became boring and boring to watch. The story is about an ancient Aztec doll that empowers those who own it. The idea is decent enough and this movie would be pretty fun if it was better. However, after the first ten minutes, he will soon get bored; we don't get any good scenes of death and we have to listen to a lot of talking. In the end, one of the obsessed men meets his death by melting in front of two girls, but it is not very interesting and certainly not gory. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend The Power any horror or slasher fan, because of that there is little.
