and it's just January, I'm still sure of it! By far it is one of the worst Swedish movies I've ever seen and being a sincere Swedish film is not good at all. It has been claimed to be "original" and perhaps it can be seen as that for people who have never seen an English-speaking film, for us who were in the cinema of the last 10 years it cannot help, but feel like Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein they sat one weekend and went through the most successful films of the past and tried to push them into one Swedish package. What can I say is that the result can be ... poor. First of all, it's just a weak start, even worse when it's not just a bad story, it's a desire to connect with very poor stories - first it wasn't possible to try a Swedish action á la Matrix and then combine it with a really bad story. moral story. And if you thought it couldn't be worse, you'll notice all the "cool things" that were thrown there absolutely no reason to show that Sweden could also do Hollywood movies - which we can't even try. For example, the main plot is trying to do deeper by allowing young people to play a computer game called Storm, which has nothing to do with the story, or about how there is a "Storm" website, while suddenly it's just the main character. Consciousness - I really don't think that either Stein or Mårlind sees a point with three-quarters of the film, more than just trying to show bad extra effects. For the actors, I must admit that Eric Ericson has a pretty good job, besides doing the same work with the whole movie, even the hard Storm is trying to be a film about the personal development of DD that doesn't change in his battle. manner of action. To be honest, Jonas Karlsson thought I was quite a respected actor, but according to Storm ... he really must be ashamed of this film, its character and scar. Finally, Eva Röse is simply out of criticism, both her character and her actions. The only reason Storm succeeds in not getting 1/10 is Eric Ericson and what I can say is at least trying.
