What a shame. That could be good. The main problems are the script and the star. The film cannot decide whether it is a grotesque comedy (a very uninspired and routine kind), or whether it is a keen satire in old East Germany and its mores. Her attempts at the other, however, fell apart. The film does not hold together and the end is very artificial and incredible. Unfortunately, any stereotypes that would give rise to German comedy are strengthened. The characters are one and all the stereotypes and the leading character played by Kim Frank are colorless. He just can't carry the movie and seems to have been chosen mainly for his baby's face. It doesn't have to be the whole actor's mistake (he's a pop singer) because the script doesn't give him much work. One plus - East German "style" recreation and season is good. The worst part is that the film feels somehow dishonest and humiliating. It seems that the film was frightened by people who didn't necessarily do it, and wanted to do a quick beating out of a few cheap laughs. (If they gave them the best, it is a really sad case!) I watched it in a cinema with an East German audience and I was sorry. The GDR regime was terrible in almost all respects, but those who lived through it deserve better than this.
