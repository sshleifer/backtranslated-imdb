I can't believe how this atrocity managed to capture the heart and mind of the "bright young things" of his time, but I'm sure I wish it. In my opinion, it is an inaccurate, poorly kept, faintly written, flashy piece of gumpf. Short ascents to the idea of ​​realistic bludgeon every humor to death. The situations are inscrutable exaggerations that make even fragile figures more incredible and repulsive. Romance is boring, the end is unsatisfactory and destroys a single sensible drug message in the film and a simple chart ('Withnail and I,' 'Fear and Disgust') is tested to extremes with an uninteresting motion of the film. In short, this film is an obvious visual attack with no hint of skill or initiative. I condemn him to a heap of history and pray to stay there.
