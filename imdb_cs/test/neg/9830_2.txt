If you've ever wanted to learn more about cab drivers, then this is a great movie for watching, for informational purposes only. I hear it now, "Wait, wait a minute! Why don't we follow a taxi driver all day! Guys are funny, so are the people they meet and talk only a few minutes, so other actors should be cheap! Harry, take care of the production, Joan, you have the materials, Brian, go to some actors and we'll all meet tomorrow to start filming! "<br /> <br /> The first 90% of the film couldn't be worse if it happened. there is always a surprise element without any plans, some of Jim Carrey's movies have things added together, and they always behave well at the box office, the problem being that the first 90% is pretty well off, and it's almost upset. Paul Dillon plays a taxi driver in Chicago, who works all day, we see what he sees, people get in and out of the car and go around the city talking to those people for a few seconds and then getting more people. <br /> <br /> I admit that t A religious family is trying to talk to a taxi driver with them, take a pregnant wife and her husband to the hospital, divide a wealthy merchant from her girlfriend, a poor friend from her boyfriend, and marry a rape victim home. I think the film's morale is that the cab driver is more than a cab driver and has a bigger sphere of influence over his passengers' lives than you originally think. For some people, it's just a way to get out of here, but for others, his very ordinary words help to change their direction of life. The last passenger of the day is used to try to do the rest of the movie and to some extent succeeds. It was a bit of a repentance, as it felt where the vast majority of the film was upstairs and at the end trying to make everything better in one or two changes. I wasn't too overwhelmed by the film as a whole, but there were a few bits and pieces worth watching again. As for the actors, Paul Dillon is. John Cusack, Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore are all in this, about 30 seconds, but don't look at this or you'll be disappointed. I will give other people who have received some recognition that it is not your ordinary movie they made here, but neither of them was good. There just wasn't enough material to keep you for an hour and a half. It was a decent effort, but it did nothing.
