A really bad movie allegedly about a dealer who wants to be a writer and incidents that make up a casino's life. It moves at a pace. Dull, boring, boring! Practically everything about this film is amateurish and unconvincing - with one very remarkable exception: the performance of Clive Owen, who is like a Rolls Royce penetrating a slum. The casino sequence advice was allegedly provided by the professional, but the director was completely ignored by the way they were processed. While casino employees may be a very different breed for the rest of the world, they are not nearly as helpless and booooring as the characters presented in this script. Courses and endings are thrown into the script to give him a convincing background, but they seemed to be entered in the cocktail wipes list. For anyone who lives in a casino business (as this writer has in the last forty years!), It's a poor depiction of their world that NEVER this was in the farthest and most revealing areas of England! A frightening, insulting film clutter that looms and spawns and spawns at the idiotic and unconvincing end. American critics loved it.
