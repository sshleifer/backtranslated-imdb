Usually, every film with Steve Railsback leads a good movie. However, this film is not in line with this view. Lifeforce is a below average movie that is extremely confusing at the beginning (it reminds me of Star Trek: TMP), but is able to choose things at the end when London becomes Zombie City. A horror / sci-fi mess that is very hard to sit with, although naked spacegirl / vampire is very easy to look at. This film deserves a rating of 4 out of 10.
