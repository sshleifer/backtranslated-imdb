Oh no. Where do I start this slime? This is one of the few real high budget movies on my list that I actually saw appropriate to give 1 ratings, and it's not for production values ​​that are pretty high. This film has absolutely no respect for the account in the Bible, and treats the whole story as a laughing fantasy. I couldn't recommend it to anyone, except how low the company we were in ... <br /> <br /> For the first thing, Noah wasn't absolutely friends with Lot. Anyone who really read Genesis could tell you that Abram was the one they thought. The writers were just trying to release the story with the entire Sodom / Gommorah subplot, and it seems to be in place because it is. Noah is considered a steep goofball ("You've Kissed! You Kissed!"), But at least it's a step away from the hilarious overclocking of Voight in Anaconda. These crimes, however, pale in this film compared to God's heretical treatment. God is portrayed as a tiny, incomprehensible being who changes his mind at the slightest whim. ("I am one eternal perfect, but I can be wrong") What? Where do they get it? This kind of God ... no one should ever pay attention, less worship, praise or love. What the director says in this I don't claim to know. All I know is that responsible handling of the Noah's Ark should not be so easy. Shame on these people.
