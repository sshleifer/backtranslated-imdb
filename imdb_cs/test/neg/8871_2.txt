Here pa there is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But on the other hand, it is better than most films from Slovenia who are filled with depressed characters and a story without clear ideas. Here pa is bright, optimistic and free of artistic moments. Director Mitja Okorn has tried to tell us in many interviews that his film is very good because it doesn't cost a lot of money. But I think it's bad. Here pa there is a very bad movie for me. Dialogs are really badly written (90% of the script consisted of a curse), the characters are stereotypical morons, the story and its twists are very predictable, and the action sequences (this movie is to be an action comedy) are filmed very bad and without any style. Okorn just thinks he's even bigger than Quentin Tarantino, so his style copies all 90 minutes. The humor in the movie is very cheap and primitive (Okorn probably thinks that the constant curse is funny). In my opinion, Tu pa has a very cheap (not just budget) movie with a silly story and a very bad deal.
