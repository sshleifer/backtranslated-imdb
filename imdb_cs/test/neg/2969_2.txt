It looks like some of the previous reviewers have seen a different film than what I saw tonight ... Actually, this movie is the reason I signed up for IMDb. Certainly Bobbie Phillips can "fight" and for being this movie 2, but the rest of this movie is just pure crap ... Acting is wrong, the plot is wrong, camera angles are bad, and the effects are bad. Sure, the actors are in good physical condition, but they can't act! Sometimes I like watching bad movies for laughter, but this movie didn't have charm and after seeing this movie I was full of pity to see it. Sure, if you'd like to see average fighting without anything, then this movie is for you. If not, stay away from this movie! PS: Sorry for all the spelling mistakes ... I'm just tired of the cause of this movie!
