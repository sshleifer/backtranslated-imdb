This looks like one of these Australian films made by "talented" students and funded by the government. It is full of clever shots of colors and shapes and verbal excursions to Freudian psychology, which will be appreciated by students and art teachers, but in general, silly ridicule of good cinema, good narration and generally good taste is perceived. What happens, I think, when art students become so obsessed. "Pink Flamingoes" is a mile before one same subject. Some 70s porn movies are much more attentive and inspiring. The book of Revelation is not entirely without merit, but as an overall experience it is well below the class B average.
