Emperor's new Groove was a big step for Disney. It wasn't a musical! She had clean, fresh jokes and no political twists. It was just a damn funny movie. On the other hand, Kronk New Groove is tired and weak. My 3-year-old still loves Emperor New Groove, but fell asleep during Kronk's. There really is no real conflict (which leads to all the crazy adventures in the first movie). Due to lack of conflict, it almost seems that the animators blew up the writer and just made the story up as they went together. . . and I am still.
