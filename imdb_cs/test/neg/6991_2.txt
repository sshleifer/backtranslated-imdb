I liked this movie. Sure, the acting was flat, there was no conspiracy, and the villain was the most beautiful I saw. Michael Bernardo as Dante is worth laughing in his own right, with an incredibly funny catchphrase and evil laugh. But it's worth seeing, just for the WORST explosion you'll ever see outside the Power Rangers TV series. You'll know when you see it. Frankly, this movie must have a budget of low grade porn. I almost stopped following the lesson, but I suggest watching the whole thing; at least there's a lot of eye candy for everyone. Recommended for viewers with high tolerance for bad movies.
