I loved the Muppets. Muppet, The Great Muppet Caper and The Muppets Take Manhattan were good family movies, cleverly written and fun to watch. I never thought I'd see the day they would be jumping on a Hollywood wheelchair, but here it is: Scooter as a kneeling dancer, Pepe doing lewd and suggestive notes every five minutes - this isn't your father's Muppets. It's no longer Jim Henson's Muppets. <br /> <br /> "It's a wonderful life" has its moments, but it's not enough to save it. In doing so, I watched with my children. I still hope for their next movie, but this was definitely disappointing.
