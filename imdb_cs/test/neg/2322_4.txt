I'm not much of an Abbott & Costello fan (although I like "Who's First") and to be honest, there wasn't much to inspire me to watch their work. It was not bad. She had some mildly entertaining scenes and actually a very convincing giant playing Buddy Baer, ​​but in some way, given the duo's glory and respect in which they are generally held, I have to say I waited more. As the story goes, the couple run into babysitting work and during reading Jack and Beanstalk as a bedtime story (with a baby reading Costello), Jack Costello falls asleep and dreams of the story. There is a "wizard Of Oz" in the story, in that the characters in the dream are all the equivalents of Jack's true acquaintances and the film opens in black and white and turns into color during the dream. The battle scenes between Jack and the giant and the dance scene between Jack and Polly (Dorothy Ford) are among the fun parts of the movie. Of course, Polly also leads to one of the film's questions - what happened to her? Jack and the gang apparently left her in a huge castle! I know - it was just a dream, so who cares. Still - I was thinking. There was also a couple of cute songs and dance routines. My 4-year-old giggled a bit, so she could appreciate some of the humor. I found it to be an acceptable time, but definitely nothing to convince you of Abbott and Costello as comedic geniuses. 4/10
