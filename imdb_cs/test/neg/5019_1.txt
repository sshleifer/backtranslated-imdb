This movie is absolutely incredible. The only way the girl would do it is if she had serious mental problems or had a long history of sexual abuse or was under duress. Yet we are asked to believe that otherwise "normal" healthy woman was a little bored and "made a little mistake" and oops had a sexual encounter with a dog. What's more, she never had any adverse effects when someone told her. this activity completed with the dog's own choice. She wasn't on drugs or on anything that "seemed" to her. The rest of the film is trying to put this action in the light of "hey, it could happen to anyone who is just honest." But indeed, to believe that we must believe that she is a woman who is capable of doing ANYTHING completely if she "feels like her". Think about it - could she consider the rights and injustices of this action before she did it? If she did, she would stop in her footsteps. Human beings have instinctive boundaries for reasons. Now if we are to start considering the bestiality as a "cute" little aberration, what's next? Child Abuse? Yet the "heroine" is portrayed as a hard-done, kind girl who had a moment of aberration. If she were forced to exploit this act by a violent man - that story could make more sense and I could accept that story. However, there is no way for anyone to perform the desired long-term activity and refer to it once again - if there is no deep disorder that requires great psychiatric help. This is no way of doing it in an otherwise perfect life. I know it's just a movie, but through normalization behaviors like this, through the media, society becomes numb and an increasingly horrible reality is possible. I could imagine that a bully who would show a child to convince them that it wasn't such a big deal, and then shifted to their agenda. This could also be used by abusers to emphasize that the child does not talk about abuse - because you see how people will respond to you if you do. It's not the truth. The director wants people to think it's true. It's about degradation and how easy it is for people (the public) to be manipulated to receive the most horrible concepts when they are packed the right way. The watched public is manipulated, degraded and laughed. It is a film in which actors and viewers are humiliated and fools in a very sophisticated way with a clever but very disturbed film. writer. This movie seems to me to be used as a means for filmmakers to get off the thrill of playing with your mind in an abusive way. I don't know if it's their conscious - but it's the most classic example of Mind F *** I have ever met. <br /> <br /> I hope it offends too much. But if you watched this movie - I don't think there's a room that could be offended by anything.
