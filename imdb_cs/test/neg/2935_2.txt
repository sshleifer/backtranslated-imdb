Where to start describing this debacel? You already know that a big fat NADA is going through a plot, so let's point out that it's so PC is offensive. It's hard to believe that Frank Oz, the same guy who gave us laughs like Little Shop of Horrors and Bowfinger, made this unjust mess. So this guy doesn't know he's gay to this actor. it. OK Sure. If someone says I'm gay, I'll know the truth, even though I currently like girls more than George Luca likes the dollar. And how to know the true nature of my sexuality? If I like classical litterature, dance and Barbra Streisand, I'm gay. If I run around like a blind man in a hurry (with half his shirt hanging out), I'm straight. Oh, sure. And here's a big cliché cliché: no matter how you look, she's always a very attractive Hollywood actor who loves every bit of grease under your skin, or a top model that will love your zero IQ , your butt-ugly face and showing-out ears. If all these common places were not enough to make me angry, it was. In the real world, matter looks like people, and I know for sure. <br /> <br /> I see it coming: now you say "Relax! It's a comedy! Don't take it so seriously!" If the comedy is something "carte blanche" to loud aloud, I think the world has a serious problem. Wouldn't it be much better (and more fun) to make a movie that would reveal the old tiring clichés instead of constantly growing them? So one of the worst movies I've ever seen seen. 1 out of 10. If this assessment has something to do with my sexual tendency, please let me know. I am interested in.
