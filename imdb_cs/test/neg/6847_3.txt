I agree that Mary Woronov (Murdoch's secretary) is one of the best things about this movie. She's my favorite actress, every role she plays is always so good. Her character is cunning, sarcastic, clever, light-hearted, funny and cunning. She really pulls this role from well and you have a good sense of what her character is all about. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is pretty bad. Music is the funniest thing. One of the characters has a really strange circular radio that she brings with her while wearing her tight zebra striped tank top. One thing that was a little interesting about the story was the idea that someone hires these three children aged aged spruce at an old abandoned theater. He gives them the keys and says - go for it. That would be really fun and I wish someone gave me a chance! Imagine going to an old abandoned theater with two other people and deciding how to decorate and fix it. You have complete control over the entire building. That would be so fun! Unfortunately, the characters do not consider it an exciting adventure, which they think is a big chore. They walk with long faces and fight with each other all the time. It's such a mess. But it's fun to think about the possibilities that these people aren't even excited about. The film does a pretty good job of feeling helpless or a little frightened by the theater itself. However, acting (except Woronov .. and perhaps Murdoch, boss - just because he does really good money hungry fake smiley business man who never has luck) is really terrible and you just end up feeling discontented. Moreover, a random slapstick is a bit sticky and it's a wreck that the film is trying to create. Look at it if you dig Mary Woronov, the funky 80's Casio electronic rhythm and if you think you have a giant scary abandoned theater for yourself, it's interesting.
