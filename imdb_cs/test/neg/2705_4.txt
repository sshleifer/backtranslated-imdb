I like Errol Flynn; I like biographies and I like action movies. This represented all three of these .... but I didn't like this movie. It just went too long, even though the last 20 minutes were great, especially in a photo with some big low angle shots. But it seemed to me that it took six hours to get to this point, and I really can't tell why I feel like this. The action is interesting, Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland are all right. In fact it was refreshing to see de Havilland actually promoting Flynn instead of her normal role as an antagonist to him. But there is something missing in this film. The film was critically criticized for its historical inaccuracy, but I don't hear the same criticism for many other films that did the same. In fact, his RARE when the film is historically accurate. For some reason, this revisionist history has offended most critics. If the film made General Custer much worse than he was, he probably would have liked it. Well, too bad. They criticize critics critically against hero heroes. <br /> <br /> I really wish I enjoyed it more, but I'll take a lot of other Flynn adventures.
