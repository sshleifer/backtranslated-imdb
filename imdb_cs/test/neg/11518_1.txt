I'm in a film club at my school and I was forced to sit and watch this absolutely desperate movie. The story of the film is not desperate, but the film itself is extremely desperate. The meeting was utterly awful. The children were too indignant. The metal rod could do a better job. I desperately wanted to sleep, but because the television was so loud, I was kept out of peace. Monkeys are neither cute nor fun. The drama is laughing-worthy. I can't remember when I saw a more horrible movie. The story is weak, thin, predictable and totally false. Adults are trying to be good actors, but they just can't break through stereotypes. The girl even seems to want to leave the movie during the downhill to leave. Micheal Anderson should publicly apologize for this film. Not just for me, but for everyone else who was forced to sit in this horrible movie. In fact, I'm sorry. Even if I have nothing to do with this project, I apologize for this film because it means at least someone. This film even overcomes the dissatisfaction of Rob Schneider's films and the Cheetah Girls. I would even go so far as to make it worse than the Hilary Duff movie collection, but it pushes it. Just please do not see this movie, otherwise you will have to write a review similar to this, about how awful this movie is. I'm sorry.
