Telly Savalas is like a Mexican revolutionary (though he is associated with Chuck Connors as a military martinet) in this joke, but a rather boring pastiche about the life and time of a famous historical figure. Earlier Attempt, VILLA RIDES! (1968) with Yul Brynner in the role and teammate of Robert Mitchcum dealt with these events more soberly and at a higher level. As such, PANCHO VILLA is a typical European venture, which, despite its credentials, is without distinction. the end result is rather stupid than funny - though a few moments, especially action sets and scenes involving a brawl in the church, offer mild pleasure. Oh, and Savalas even gets to sing over the final titles!
