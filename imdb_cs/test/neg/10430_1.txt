After I saw the DVD release of the Blues Brothers, and their mention of "Wired" on Belushi Bio, my friend and I were hungry for more information about John Belushi. I heard about "Wired" but I didn't know much about it and found it at the back of a local rental company. I understand that Dan Akroyd was really over this movie and I thought it was because he didn't draw it in good light. But that had nothing to do with it. The film starts fine until he gets tired of John's body in the morgue. When he wakes up at the autopsy table and decides to run for her, then he begins to absolutely taste the film. John is watching his life and all the confusion he has created with "Angel", the driver of the Puerto Rican cabin, with a nasty sense of humor - criticizing him and trying to get him to cross him. The two actors who portray John and Dan do not look remotely or close to real actors (let alone anyone involved, Lorne Michaels), so it's hard to really focus on them and how they do they were in real life ... but that's the tip of the iceberg. I believe it was supposed to be a "artsy" movie - John is constantly worried about drugs (ie, soap in the bathroom is cocaine,) in a way that is also difficult to track. Memories of the shots are jerky, which also makes it difficult to understand. Probably the most delicious scene was when John (literally) is forced to undergo his autopsy and is in pain when removing his heart to weigh her, saying it was abnormally large due to drug use, obesity, yeah , we get a point without a grotesque representation. There are very few other actors we know in the movie, (where is Carrie Fisher). They were incredibly close and Jim Belushi would be a great person to show it, it looks very cheap (we felt that the graphics looked from the early '80s or late' 70s) as if it were being filmed in about a week and didn't even show the side to John at all. I felt I knew a little more about him when I watched Saturday Night Live episodes. On one final note, Bob Woodward met a narcissist by appearing in the film and arguing with John about writing his life. story. For someone who was supposed to be very highbrow about the Nixon bust, his person's caliber could match any writer in the National Enquirer, and therefore lose my interest in any of his work from that point forward. SKIP THIS FILM. If you want to see more about John, have a look at his movies, watch Dan Akroyd's videos that talk about him, or hope someone else wants to make another movie about John, which is based on the "Man on the Moon" line, which is eventually what we expected. I think it was a "moral" kind of movie - you know, don't do drugs, but I think the creators of this movie didn't understand that his death caused many people (like Carrie Fisher) to stop doing that.
