Imagine every stereotypical, overworked clich√© from every movie and TV show that takes place in the streets of Brooklyn from 1930 to 1980. Instead of real characters, fill it with a stack of exchange cartoons. Throw in the "period" of music and wailing electric guitar during the "rumble" scene. Then pass the time trying to come (or care) which of Deuces will be killed in the (anti) climate finale rumble. I'll give this movie points for not being just another romantic comedy, teen slasher, explosive action movie, teen sexual comedy, children's musical or vehicle Oscar nomination. But bringing something new or interesting to the genre of street gang tragedy could be nice.
