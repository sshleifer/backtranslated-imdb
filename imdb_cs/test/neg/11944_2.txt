I was reluctant to see this movie because I really enjoyed the original "Mostly Martha". What a disappointment. Catherine Zeta Jones is a good actress, but this wasn't her movie. The original had charming moments, perfectly interrupted by an incredible soundtrack. No reservations felt like they were never connected. Food, characters - nothing felt passionate. In most Martha, the food came alive - each scene was shot in such a way that you could taste it with your eyes - smells, textures. The food in 'No Reservations' was in the background - we rarely got a close-up of preparation; the characters were not real enough to carry the film without him. It was hard to finish the movie - many scenes felt embarrassed. Look at the original - it's a really nice movie; soundtrack incredible.
