First, let me say that I'm not someone who usually cries over having to think that when I saw movies I like Tarkowsky movies, for example Berghman is also a favorite ..... but this? Positive points can be easily summarized: the photo is beautiful and the music is perfectâ€¦ does it make a good movie? I used to think that, but this is a perfect example of not doing it (for me) .... maybe it's because I'm too stupid? maybe, but I don't think so ... Tarkwosky, for example, also used very long shots, but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of exactly the same picture of two people (and just their heads because this movie has a lot of shots) but sometimes it's effective), the general result is completely boring, even with intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that is intelligent, but very pedantic). You also always feel that the director does some of the long shots not for aesthetic or symbolic effect, but just to save on the budget .... <br /> <br /> I'm very disappointed in this movie, because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so but it just went on and on without keeping on the same level as in the first scenes .... <br /> <br /> While reading the very commendable comments on this page , I also feel that some people try to see a lot more in the movie than it is there ... when the movie is slow and arty, it doesn't need it means it is very deep .... yes it is an allegory of musical a theory placed in the context of a small town that itself is quite interesting but does not make a deep film .... except people who absolutely want some kind of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it is not what you find in the movie but what you find in yourself .... exercises that by my His opinion can be much more effective in watching "Stalker" or "Solyaris" than Werckmeister Harmonies, which owes a lot to Tarkowsky, but the cabin never equals the level.
