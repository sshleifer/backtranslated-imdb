After reading both _River_God_ and _The_Seventh_Scroll_, I can't begin to say how disappointed I was with this movie. While I agree that some poetic license may be permissible, this film is in constant contradiction with books, making incredible injustice to the exciting, credible, and wonderful stories Wilbur Smith wrote. I can only believe that writers, directors and film producers have never heard of Mr. Smith, let alone his work. Smith's live characterizations are converted to wooden sticks, all historicity is ignored or discounted, the book's realism has been changed to include phantom monsters more appropriate to the cartoon. And why does an Egyptian follower speak Spanish? Geesh, no wonder the movie was made on miniseries television! Did Wilbur Smith have any input to making this movie? I can't believe he did it. Terrible, horrible movie. If you have read one or both books, do not waste your time or money watching this money. You will be very disappointed, I assure you. Only the moment of supreme generosity persuaded me to give this film a "2" ranking, thanks to a beautiful, sometimes spectacular photo.
