On cast in picturesque Italy, the beautiful lips-synching Lana Turner (as Fredda Barlo) meets the older singer and Prince Ezio Pinza (as Mr. Imperium). They both fall in love and enjoy the beautiful Italian landscapes. Mr. Pinza is unhappily called to his royal father's mortal bed and leaves Lana in the church. Twelve years later, Mrs. Turner is an actress in Los Angeles who is about to make a film about falling in love with a king. Turner's romanced co-star Barry Sullivan, who wants to marry her - then, King Pinza re-enters her life? "Mr. Imperium" provides a tired story for the sex symbol Turner and the debuting bass singer Pinza, who has appeared for decades in the New York Metropolitan Opera. Pinza deserved his career in the MGM feature film after appearing in the very successful South Pacific theater production (1949). The album's cast, and Pinza's Golden "Any Enchanted Evening" single, sold millions. Support wheels Marjorie Main, Cedric Hardwicke and Debbie Reynolds make the film even more wasted on resource waste. Don Hartman ~ Lana Turner, Barry Sullivan, Ezio Pinza ***
