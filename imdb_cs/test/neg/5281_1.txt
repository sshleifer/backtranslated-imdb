This film is sucked on so many levels! Have you ever seen a dentist? This movie made the Dentist look like a masterpiece. I do not recommend this movie to anyone unless of course you really really get bored, then maybe. It was so sharp. The killer reminds you of the grandfather of the monsters, except he is wearing glasses. When Jessica said, "I want you to meet someone, my inner whore, I thought she would kick her ass, but all she did is throw a trash can on him. I was very disappointed. The crying scene about him woman, I SO felt the pain behind his tears ......... NOT !!!!! So before watching this movie, grab a blanket and pillow, get comfortable because it is very relaxing.
