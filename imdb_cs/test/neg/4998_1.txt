Did you see Romero movies, okay? And you've seen Jacob's ladder, right? And later Hellraiser movies? Okay, now let's make a movie of all three, let's just put it all together and make it a big mess, it sounds like a good idea? This movie is terrible. Absolutely divine fear. Yeah, it's an indie movie, who's bullshit? Is it a passage to make film excrements? The film attempts to establish credibility by focusing on character interaction, which is evident. Unfortunately for writers, they are not good at character interaction. This is not the Night of the Living Dead; the characters are nonentities screaming their inane lines at each other in a futile attempt to be caught by the microphones on the set. Dialogue is never interesting. For a movie that focuses on character interaction, you'd think characters would have something more than "WHAT WE DO" "I don't know" "GOOD WE DO SOMETHING" "What do we do?" "We should leave." "WE ARE RECEIVING OUR FATE." "No, we have to leave." "WELL LETES LEEN THEN." "No, maybe we should stay." It's not exaggerated, there are exchanges in this movie that reach this level of redundancy and inanity. Worst thing about this movie? Half of them are dreams and have a really zero purpose. Nothing in the dream has any meaning for anything in the rest of the film. Writers couldn't decide whether to make a zombie movie or a monster, so they both did. It's absolutely ridiculous, the cheapest trick in the book, and that's insanely offensive, especially since I'm sure they broke off the idea of ​​Jacob's ladder, which the concept of the hell was far more competent than the jokes could ever hope for. And then there's the adjustment. Watching MTV and playing horrific video games must inspire the creator, but it's definitely a sad thing they didn't realize, what made choppy cuts and confusions in the media first. In this movie you will often be confused, not in good, David Lynch way, but in the wrong "Wait, I thought it was just killed, right? Then, who the hell was that? Wait, who's this guy? Where to get here they got? "way. It's constant and consistently bad. <br /> <br /> This movie is a ridiculous piece of waste and should only be searched if you want to have a few friends and laugh. And as a final note: how people talk about "comedy" in other reviews, it's all unintentional. There is no single piece of comedy in this movie. It's supposed to be a big, serious character study, because filmmakers want to be credible in their horror concept. Unfortunately, their assumptions do not match their abilities.
