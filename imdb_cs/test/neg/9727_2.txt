I feel very generous that this movie is 2 out of 10. Okay, I noticed that special effects are "okay" and Renny Harlin did one of my favorite movies from genetically altered shark-attack-research stations you might know as Deep Blue Sea. Also, the opening credits are doing pretty well with the remix of "more human" by WhiteZombie, and it goes pretty well with what's in the context of this "movie." not so much. Not since Uwe Boll Alone in the Dark has ever felt that the special effects in the film are totally useless, our story starts with four boys who are descendants of four different families. never fully explained power from a never fully explained family background that never led to a complete explanation of the art of witchcraft, and for some reason these descendants of all 17, all go to the same school, all are a swimming team and all, for some reason or another reason , sitting in bed with shirts, sweating and talking to each other on the phone, I have nothing against gays, gothic or thirteen, but that's what this movie is meant for in ... 13 years old goth, who questions their sexuality who sits on their bed in their panties or whatever, but how come they don't take shirts? Hi its the only fair. Anyway, the characters in this movie say that when they turn 18, they will ascend and get new deep, almost divine powers. But before I go on, I forgot to mention that when they use their powers they age slowly and grow more dependent on them. This explains why people are 20 years old to play for 17 years. And if he needs to explain something, don't worry, someone will explain it all in one big dialogue. God, the movie is angry ... where was I? oh yeah, part of the ascension. Well, apparently there was a super-secret alpha-one family that others have forgotten, or something like that, I don't know, I'm at that point fading away. But they were written by some as and a new boy at school who is a group friendship is 'secretly' one of these descendants of the fifth family. And I say 'secretly' because anyone who has seen any of the previews of this film knows that this new person is a bad man. He has more power than others because I think he is older. Anyway, Bob Loblaw (say it loud) things happen and we get to the final of the movie fight. To be honest, I was the whole game for a witch battle. You know as Saurmon vs. Gandalf or anything that is in harmony with the battle, because you know it's about witches and stuff. Now that these two witches are thrown away, it's more ... how can I give it ... a very, very miserable version of the Dragonball Z battle. I say "throw things", I just say that I have no idea what F #% to throw at each other. It looks like big goblets of slimy water. God sucks this film, anyway, when our main witch "rises", he doesn't have much power at all. It just throws bigger mushrooms of slimy water. Things happen and they end up being a spectator who knows they will end. A good witch wins a bad witch who loses. You know how stupid a movie is, when a bad person says something as incredibly stupid as: "I make you my Wiotch" That's where I wanted to hit myself in the face to sit all over this thing ... <br /> <br /> Yes, I admit that the idea of ​​witches that struggles uses power in the modern day, it sounds a little cool, but when the execution is done wrong, I really wanted it they did not do this. Maybe if it was R-rated, they had these and threw more deaths with a hyphen gore, it might work ... it could work. <br /> <br /> buy or even rent. Wait for it to come on TV or borrow it from your friend who bought it. Just don't waste your time with this movie hack. If you spend some money on it, there's a good chance you'll be pursuing the sequel to Uwe Boll called The Covenant 2: Alone in the Dark with the House of the Dead.
