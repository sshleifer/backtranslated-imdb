I rented this movie because Elijah Wood did a good job and thought it might be a overlooked treasure. It wasn't a treasure. I don't know if it was right on the video, but it should be right on the listing. Elijah Wood fans will enjoy the fact that he seems to be shirtless in too short a scene. But no reasonable person would want this scenario. Imagine Memento playing teenagers, but ten times less confusing and a hundred times less credible. Example: Janeane Garofalo plays a caring psychologist (apparently "keeping the chain of mediocrity alive"). As if false memories and medicine of the supernatural mind were not hockey, the film also depends on one of those inexplicable psychic double bonds that keep the story moving and the audience confused. This same double bond creates a few too many fanciful love scenes between the Wood character and the girl from She is all that plays the secular sister of angry friend Karl Charles from the cancer victim. Adding to this Nature Scenario, Wood's other friends are a mentally disabled cancer victim and kidney, a young black boy afflicted with a mysterious kidney disease. When Dr. Garofalo becomes his own Walkman, the wish to die kidneys is fulfilled. This character's hackneyed feature in the story is offset by his on-again, off-again relationship to walking. Usually bound to a wheelchair, the kidney has several unexplained scenes that show that it pushes others around it. Kindey's characterization can be one small detail, but that is the indicator of this film's many other drawbacks. Bumblebee Flies Anyway, it's definitely bumbling, but it never flies.
