When I voted I was going to give 2, but when he saw that 1 meant terrible to hit a nail on the head. The depiction of Native Americans as blood thirsty savages is deeply disturbing to me. That's the third movie I saw from D.w. Griffiths, where men's races are stereotyped in ugly ways. A man is unable to tell his side of the story, so I'll try and keep away from Mr. Griffith's attack in person. Like this one probably did for much of the hate that is still with us. Some may say camera work was great, action first for that is the time. Negatives, it's like someone who takes you $ 10 and returns a dime.
