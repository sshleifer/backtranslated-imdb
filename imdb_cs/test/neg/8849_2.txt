I appreciate movies with subtitles from foreign countries and especially those in which the subtitles are weak and actually seem to be failing or really making sense, but this movie had too many parts that didn't make sense. Br /> <br /> All in all, I can admit a few scary and weird parts, but they are repetitive, I felt like watching a loop trailer; It seems that it was a short film made with different actors. <br /> <br /> In the RING and GRUDGE veins, but not near the humbug ... excessive length killed the excitement. <br /> <br /> If you're not a fan of these types of movies (which I thought I was), don't waste your time on this.
