What distinguishes some of the "Lone Star" films (and many others in Western and adventure films from the early 1930s) was their lack of what we recognize as a formal storytelling. To be sure they have a good vs. evil (an essential element of any Western), a boy meets a girl and some stockpersons like an old rancher and his pretty daughter or granddaughter, and sometimes an evil banker or other businessman, but the way the event happened is often different from the movie to film. 'The Lawless Frontier' presents Earl Dwire in his big star turn (not) as (for some inexplicable reason) Pandro Zanti, 'half of Apache, half American acting like a Mexican who speaks the language fluently. His greatest performance as a Mexican seemed to be his outrageous mariachi outfit. The only action seems to be to steal Ruby, the granddaughter of "Old Dusty" (Gabby Hayes). When she meets her for the first time, Dwire gives her a long look that puts him in great leagues with sexual predators. Do you think that since the opening scene shows that Zanti killed John (Wayne) Tobin's father from the camera, she would play a bigger role in the film. No. Too much chasing back and forth between heroes and villains. We get a lot of good pieces from Yakima Canutt, including pulling Ruby on his horse as he rides, jumping on "apostates" and knocking them out of their horses, horse jumping off a cliff into the lake, and even slipping the same down the sequence sequence that was in "Lucky Texan" (1934), although this time the powerful Yak uses the body of surfing log instead of straddling the tree branch and its inclusion this time is as illogical as they are in the desert. <br /> <br /> The highest point is a clearly measured and methodically well-photographed walk along the desert road after escape and on the way. Zanti stumbles with the fantastic Red Rock Canyon basalt cliffs (seen in countless series, westerns, and sci-fi "moon" movies) behind him. No fifty-step final duel with the hero running from the wooden stairs of the bar to hug and kiss the hero in this movie. When John Wayne finally catches him, Zanti drinks poisoned water from the waterhole and dies. After a few excessive chase sequences, Zantai's gang is finally captured in Dusty's cabin, emerging one by one from the back of the swiveling cabinet, which apparently leads to the canyon, now blocked by being dynamized. No Ride to Sunset or Mandatory Kissing Girl: Last Shot is Ruby, now Mrs. Tobin, on the phone now Sheriff John Tobin, "What would Sheriff Tobin like to have dinner?" The film also has poor lighting and editing at the beginning, stimulation is slow, some parts with the sheriff cause it to stretch and film chases fill the film. Despite various and unusual features, it becomes one of the weaker lone stars.
