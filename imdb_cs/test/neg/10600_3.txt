This film had great production values, good lighting, costumes, kit, cinematography and acting. But somebody, somewhere, took the script and replaced all the elementary school dialogue with hardly literate writing. I felt my IQ points fall out whenever a character spoke. Did they do it deliberately? Was it just the Brain Dead Studio managers' accident? We don't know at the moment. All I know is that this movie was one big mistake from start to finish. We won't even know how the team became a cop, so instead of any character development, we get what feels like a bad TV movie that comes from the 1960s. Or anytime. Find the writers, beat them with a quarter full sock. Everyone else, nice work, but next time read your scripts. <br /> <br /> 3/10
