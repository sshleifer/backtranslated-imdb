That might not be as bad as if it wasn't for the utterly horrible conduct Raymond Wallace had done! The guy is so bad that it wasn't even funny! His character was needed in the movie, but why they chose this guy to follow me. <br /> <br /> If you are looking for some quality Chinese movies ..... I can suggest "Pick up a red lantern" .... br /> <br /> Anything but this! I was surprised how many people really rated it! Really ... the acting of this Lord Wallace is so bad that he overshadows the other good parts of this movie. It was agreed by all 6 of us to watch this movie last night! <br /> <br /> Stay clear of this piece of garbage ........
