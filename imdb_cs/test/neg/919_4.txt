This film is about a struggling actor trying to find satisfaction in life, especially about the love he has not wanted for 5 years. It's basically a movie with a man with very bad social skills, and he says bad things all the time. The plot is hollow and created. The main character, James, is alone, but this subject of loneliness is not sufficiently explored. Rather, it is an empty statement from which further subplots come. Sadness and disappointment after dumping are superficial. There is a serious lack of emotion in the film. It's not funny like comedy. There are some funny one liners, but that's it. She lacks a happy and uplifting atmosphere to infect people with a happy mood. I didn't find "I want someone to eat cheese with" funny.
