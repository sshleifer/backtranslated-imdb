The production year says everything. The film is a maraing mess of politically correct left feminist selfappreciating drivel, so hard hands of symbolic diversity that comes as ridiculous today. Each scene aims to shed light on one of the hot issues of society, especially the role of women in the working community, the role of women vs men, women as sexual objects, consumerism, politics, war, etc. Each scene is commented on by the inner dialogue of one of the main actresses or by changing the scene to surrealistic joke. I have no memory of any conspiracy or who were the main characters. It is the kind of film where consumerism is ridiculed by the couple loving themselves in the furniture shop window while a salesperson makes a speech, or where a revealing interview of a stage actress turns into a full-blown strip act. Of course, "offensive gentlemen of the press are equal to a vigorous audience. Then we move on quickly, because we have to see the outbreak of war in a quiet forest, we have to see some inflammatory feminist public speeches that drown in the (male) blowing car horns or riot crowds and of course we have to see Stalin's cinema and all the other usual suspects. You have an idea. But all this doesn't matter at all. The film is an insurmountable piece of eyecandy for every (man) Ingmar Bergman lover. The film, which boasts Bibi Andersson, Harriet Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom at the height of their beauty, makes this reviewer totally committed and just drivel? and the pleasure of watching is so generous to use your acting skills in a movie I've never heard of before. It's hard to believe Bibi Andersson's face appears on the screen. Cinematography is beautifully controlled by bw, often revolving in overexposed (?) Dimensional Whiteness, and you simply never get tired of watching performers. How absurd that a film made with such a reflection on a feminist agenda, tirelessly advocating that women should not be regarded as objects of desire, has nothing better to offer to the viewer of the 21st century than to show amazingly beautiful girls. As mentioned, I do not complain. I can overlook it tomorrow.
