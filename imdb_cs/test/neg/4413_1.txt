I saw this film once at the children's matinee at the North Park Theater in San Diego in 1959 when it was released and I was 11. It was one of three features that was shown that day. I haven't seen it, but since I wanted it because I'm a movie enthusiast and I appreciate the horrible one with big, good and average movies. What I remember most is that the more sophisticated members of the audience, consisting of children between 8 and 15 years old, howling with laughter on the monster tree. A triple theater account showing 3 adventure movies is something that 11 years old doesn't forget, but I can't remember the names of the other 2 movies. (One star George Montgomery and David Farrar.) <br /> <br /> UPDATE: The other 2 movies in this triple account were much better. They were "Watusi," 1959, with George Montgomery and David Farrar starring and "Angry Red Planet," 1959, with Gerald Mohr and Naura Hayden staring. Ms Hayden has also written several books on health and fitness.
