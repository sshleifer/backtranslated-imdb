This film is proof that a good actor is nothing without a good direction. Ed Harris is terrible. How could you cast an actor built like Rambo to play "Maestro"? It shows no credibility at all and overlaps Beethoven. Long hair does not look good on the head at all. The main actress lacks all the trivia needed for her character. Camera shots are raw and too common. The lights are supposed to close the feelings of the characters. Bad casting and cheap direction. Very bad! The only scene that's worth the movie is when Beeth (I hope you're not interested in calling him his nickname?) Turning a girl's song to a joke. Anyway, I hope Harris will find his way back to the real movie, where he can really show his hairless talent.
