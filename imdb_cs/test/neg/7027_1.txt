"Mame" is a shame for many things - to Lucille Ball, to a story that has been told many times and to the whole genre of music. Mrs. Ball does not understand her nature at all and seems to be very calm. Bea Arthur is good, but not enough. Production is very delicate and inexpensive, songs are subpara and almost every misfires joke. Also, Lucy couldn't dance well, so the music had to be slowed down to a fairytale pace. Avoid at any cost, but look at the wonderful "Aunt Mame".
