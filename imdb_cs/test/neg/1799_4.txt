The film 'Heart of Darkness', based on the 1899 book by Joseph Conrad is one with little to no detail and has almost schizophrenic as a line of the line. If you have read the book, then you know that no important scenes have been inserted into the film to cover the stories. There is so much in the book that is left to the imagination and I feel that it is one of the parts that makes the book what it is. An example would be if Marlow had spent her timeless hours and days, even months waiting for rivets, and the whole scene had been dropped. Again, if you read the book, then you would know that this scene in the book is the one that almost describes the main theme of vanity, best. Finally, I feel that the film was too cut and dry. Insufficient though inserted into the original text and how it made the story of what it is today. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the book "Heart of Darkness" (preferably Norton Critical Edition) then you don't have to give up your time in renting or buying a movie. However, if you read the book, I think you will appreciate this book much more if you choose to watch the movie <br /> <br /> Eric 2007
