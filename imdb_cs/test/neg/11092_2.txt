I usually do not classify the movement as boring. I'm not big on action moves and my senses don't have to be stimulated during the movie. In fact, I like a reasonable logical dialogue and story. Unfortunately, this film has none of these properties. Diane Lane is the only saving pardon in this film and her beauty can't save her. Terrible revolutionary music equals moronic dialogue and acting. In fact, none of the actors actually join each other, and as a result, the film does not connect with the audience. I think scenes where some townspeople march somewhere assume they will join the story, but they seem to have been inserted just to fill the space. The scenes seemed jerky and incoherent. There were nice shots of ocean and beaches that were beautiful.
