This is one of those movies I watch every time it's not, because I like it, but because it's so bad I can't take my eyes off it (like "Battlefield Earth" or "3000 Miles to Graceland"). When I first watched, I waited and waited and waited to laugh, and I didn't get a chance of up to 3/4 of the film when they bothered the cops on their underpants and bound them in the park in a unflattering position. Besides, jokes aren't funny, characters aren't funny, their misfortunes and wrong steps aren't funny ... add it, it's not a very funny movie! Not even on slapstick! And what about the reggae soundtrack? It's a movie about two white garbagemen and music is all reggae. Looks like it is, right? If you like a good train, it's for you. If you like good comedy, look elsewhere.
