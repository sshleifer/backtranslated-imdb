Steven Seagal's late-late films were not quite good, but it is by far the worst of the Patriot. The plot has no meaning at all; it is never clear what the relationships between characters are, who works for whom or who is a double crossing. The film is totally disjointed, each scene seems to be more confused with the story than to be transmitted forward. Even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to track. Most of the blame must lie with the director's feet because he doesn't even understand the basics of filmmaking, but Seagal doesn't get light, as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame. And I didn't even mention how awful the act is, even Seagal's standards. Even directly on video feeds, it is not worth looking at even for Seagal fans. Give him a wide bed!
