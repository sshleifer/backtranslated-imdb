This film twists the facts of Anna and Mary's life into something unknowable. To make Mary Boleyn, who was in fact a somewhat stupid and foolish being, to make her a "good" sister, she is just stupid. It's Anne, who was actually a much more interesting figure, and that's why it's her life, not Mary, who has been so often said. In response to an earlier review, I failed to see how Anna's life was "criminal" ... for me it's Henry who was a real crime. Whether it is Anna's motives for winning the king and refusing her affection to win the crown and her husband, she must be taken into the context of the time in which these real events took place. Anne, compared to most of the majority of courtiers at her time, was a relatively innocent character. Most modern historians discount or have to refute most of the myths and slanders that keep this film about her, and I have never heard of anyone who truly believes the reputation before she slept with her brother. This film is so sensational and fake that it is crazy to think that someone who did not know anything about this period in history could leave to believe what this film has presented as "fact". I didn't win or get into a strange movie shooting ... but I'm sure the cameras weren't invented in the 16th century, so I don't understand why Anna and Mary are talking to one movie all the time. .. it's a really bad conspiracy to come up with and it's annoying and annoying to say it slightly. Anne of thousands of days is not even accurate, but is infinitely more fun and at least approaches the story telling one of the most interesting women of history. You don't think you can rent it ... it's two hours you never come back!
