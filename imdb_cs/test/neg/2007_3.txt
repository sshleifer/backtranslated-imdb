Wow, there's a lot of poison directed at this movie, and much of it is deserved, but it's not the whole movie of all time. (This is probably "Zoolander".) <br /> <br /> Anyway, if you're high on something, really drunk, or just in the mood for "B-minus-minus", you can be kidding it can be your a cup of tea. Yes, as others have said, in the first part of the film, you think you are following the update of Bram Stoker's novel. Two of the main characters are Van Helsing and Mina, the ship is Demeter and are in the Carpathian galaxy. Later you will find that Van Helsing is a descendant of the original, and it is just that he is on a ship in the 30th century with Dracula. Suuuuuuuuuuure. Oh yeah, and add to the originality, this "haunted ghost ship" has another character called Ash. Sounds familiar? There is paper character development and anachronism such as the aforementioned hand wheelchair, and Coolio and Tom Lister talk about black 20th century slang. But what really makes the film ridiculous is the end. If that's what happens to the characters, then the previous two hours were waste. As I said, you want to make a silly movie that plays "Mystery Science Theater" with, and your mind is in about the same mode required for viewing "Big Vegetation Rising" episode LOST IN SPACE, then you can find this divert. Otherwise, put a bet in it, it's done.
