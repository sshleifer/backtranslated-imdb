If you read Errol Flynn's autobiography, My Wicked Wicked Ways, you'll see that this movie is full of poetic license. Not that it made a big difference because Errol Flynn was equally honest with a poetic license in an autobiography. There is no need to worry about spoilers because there is nothing that could go wrong. For me it would be wiser to use a story about a fictional Hollywood actor; then you could go out and find a better actor than Duncan Regehr to play, and don't worry that the audience would say things like, "But he didn't have mustaches in Captain Blood." Another drawback of this film is that it shows Flynn as a two-dimensional character. Flynn was an intelligent man, well educated, well read. This film focuses only on its funster image. Regehr is a disaster. The rest of the cast fights scripts. Hal Linden is fine as Warner, and Barbara Hershey makes a credible Damita, though Lili Damita herself didn't think so. <br /> <br /> The best thing to do with this movie is to forget about it and let it gently slip away into oblivion. I can't imagine what I'm writing about.
