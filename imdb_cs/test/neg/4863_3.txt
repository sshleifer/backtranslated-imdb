Would you be surprised if I told you that this film deals with conspiracy? No? What if we told you the leader was a shadow puppet. What? You do not believe me? ... OK. Yes, I did it. It's too bad, this movie could use a sense of humor. I understand that Charlie Sheen did that at the time - another movie was more money - like Donald Sutherland and Linda Hamilton ... why? Don't even get me on Stephen Lang. He was as entertaining as Party Crasher in 'The Hard Way' and now this junk. <br /> <br /> Ah no matter what. All participants should be ashamed. If you're trying to make a bad movie and succeed - it's twisted - but I seriously doubt that's what they were trying to do. The story, the story stinks and we should take this yak seriously. Wondering if this movie still had a glimpse of hope. Seriously, I doubt it and in the industry so tightly with handbags, as it came first behind me. Maybe even more scary is how this dog pile is that way to theaters!? Oh ... Sam Waterson, how great you are in law and order. Why are you here? Demonstrating the role of President of the United States, which I could add, will be shot by the remote control of a biplane controlled by the gonzo killer. Then it's the masterpiece of George P. Cosmatos, whose "directorial" credits include Rambo: First Blood Part II. Hmm .... case?
