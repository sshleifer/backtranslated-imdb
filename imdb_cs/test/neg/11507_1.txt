OMG what Disney has done lately. Suite Life Zach and Cody are pretty good, but other exhibitions like Cory in the House, Wizards of Waverly Place Suck and are unnoticeable. Naturally, Sadie is simply stupid and stupid. It's about a teenager named Sadie who likes science and grows up and goes through her daily life. There are her friends Margaret and Rain and her older annoying brother Hal. It's all unpleasant and stupid. Especially Margaret, who thinks she's the most popular girl in school and thinks she's so pretty ... it's just something terrible. I hate all seasons of this show, it's just terrible in every way (the first season was better, though). <br /> <br /> If you value your life, you won't look at this crap, its painful and stupid
