I have no qualms about how the film won't catch New Jersey (like Zach, I'm out of there). Good. It does not matter. I lived there long enough. I don't need to see a film that captures the state of the garden. <br /> <br /> What I do is how bad this movie is. Let's do it for you. We'll use several bulletins. Some spoilers probably follow. (Not that you couldn't predict ANYWAY): <br /> <br /> - The location of the music was insanely forced and promoted. Example: Large: "What do you listen to?" Sam: "Shins. Have you ever heard of them?" "No." "Listen to this song - it will change your life!" And then they play the song Shins, which was at the McDonalds store. (You don't like the characters in the movie saying - spectator - how to respond to something? I love it! "Cry" "feel inspired" etc.) <br /> <br /> - The scenes were SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example: Full Movie. But no, really, an example: They are in a rainy quarry near the ark. Great outing - in the pouring rain (oh he is SO TORMENTED!) - on top of a piece of heavy machinery and SCREAMS! How he moves! But wait! Here comes Sam and his friend (addict), and ALL SCREAM !!!! ALE POČKEJ !!!! OH MY GOD!!!! Here it is! KISS! LONG, DEEP !!!! IN RAIN!!!!!!!! - The dialogue was SO BAD. SO Cliché. SO MELODRAMATIC. Example. They leave the chest and Sam says something like, "Hey. Good luck exploring the endless abyss." And the guy says, "You too." Oh ... Oh my! I never realized ... could it be? Oh my God! Big life is like ... ohmigod ... Infinite ABYSS !!!! Another example: Big and Sam at the airport. Sam says something like, "Is it goodbye?" Isn't it enough? OK, Largeman says something like, "This is not the end of the sentence ... it's an ellipse." And guess what happens when they try to go down and return to their LA life. You know what? Don't guess. It's a waste of time. It's a Grade Z Wes Anderson rip-off movie. When not busy being melodramatic and cliché, the film spends a lot of time with crazy and shocked characters. Hey, Sam's brother ... thank you to Zach Braff for his inclusion because it really made the movie much more textured. Also breaking Anderson: dialogue. Scene: Sam and Largeman are in the bar. In walks friends, "Vagina!" says one of them. Then he sees him sit with Sam, so one of the friends says, "I'm sorry I said the vagina." And Sam says, "It's okay." -Inventive cinematography, which is not inventive but unreasonable and unpleasant. Give me a break with movie speeding / slowing. Wes Anderson is once again doing this in his films. And in "Donnie Darko it was good." But in fact it was useless. Wow. Mad side where people take X and sniff coke. Better implementation of all tricks! <br /> <br /> -You can count good moments on one side (even if your fingers are missing). That's what makes it even WORSE. The retarded fourth thing ... well, that was good! The little thing he (largeman) says about getting into the quarry (something about how turpentine roams) ... that was good! Wait, that's about it. You know, Zach Braff is, I think, always a little too cute. But he's nice. But, man, this is forced, arrogant, melodramatic (have you got it?), Too cute, after all. This movie is terrible. It seems I am renumbered because the time is currently being scored at 8.0. However, if you are looking for something truly engaging and gentle and unique DO. NO. RENT. THIS. FILM.
