Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie. Nor is it terrible. Acting was wooden at least on Pinocchio. The puppet had all 2 expressions. Like most actors, except strange ... secondary characters ... Most of them were nice at the top. Special effects in this are nice "B" and as I said earlier, the puppet really exploded. Two Best Scenes Movie's Knife Over Hand ... Looked Pretty Good, I Think They Spent About 1/3 of The Budget On It ... And The Shower Scene ... WOW ... I Think They had to spend another 2 / 3s budget on a talking actress who did this scene to do it. Seriously this is a slightly below average "b" horror puppet movie ... rent Chucky if you have the urge to see the puppets kill you. The story had some interesting ideas, enough to follow me to the end.
