I hope it was done half a minute ago by dead and abandoned wounds because it was waste. The storyline was also confusing and basically just felt it was running out, maybe it was postponed and released to take advantage of the newer Seagals movies? <br /> <br /> 3/10 <br /> <br /> Not yet, bring on Siege 3 and lose some weight!
