I was shocked that there were 18 pages of good reviews. This must be one of the worst films, especially given that it was recommended. He has to admit that comedies aren't my favorite genre, but this movie did the worst in trying to be so smart that it made me watch it.

But remember, I think SNL lost its humor in the 1980s. humor. I waited for you to identify yourself as a zoo keeper and then tell us that there is no zoo in town. This is the humor you can expect. My only wish was that I could give this negative rating.
