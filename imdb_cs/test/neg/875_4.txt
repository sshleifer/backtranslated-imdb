I had great hopes for this movie, even though I didn't read the book. Richard Gere and Diane Lane together - should be good. However, the film does not fulfill this promise. I waited for the next depth of the characters and wasn't. I have no problem with the fact that they just fell in love with the weekend. That can happen. But we never knew the characters. I would like to focus more on them. The film reminded me of places in Madison County Bridges and the movie was much better. I really felt the characters in this movie, and there was chemistry (much greater passion) between Clint Eastwood and Meryl Streep that wasn't between Gere and Lane. Each of them is a very good actor in his right. It's just not the right movie for them.
