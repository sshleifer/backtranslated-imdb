I was in the 6th year and this film was broadcast on PBS during a series called 'Wonderworks'. I remember clearly sitting on the couch watching a movie with tears running down my face. Jesse, the main character, creates an unusual friendship with a girl named Leslie. Due to a very simple but careless error one of the two dies. At that time, I found this story very powerful, because the fatal mistake is exactly the kind of mistake the child would make, and so any child watching the film finds it very easy to meet him and feel the emotional weight of the tragedy that follows. . Last year I finally tracked down a VHS copy of the show. I was probably stuck in memory. I watched the show as an adult and was absolutely shocked by what a scary movie was. My girlfriend also had a similar memory of the movie and she was also quite sad how bad the movie was compared to his memories. Many adults probably have a good memory of watching this movie when they were kids. I strongly recommend that these people leave their memories intact and avoid seeing this film as adults.
