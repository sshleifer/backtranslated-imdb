When I read the script online, I thought "Capote" needed editing. When I saw it on PPV, I can tell you it wasn't cropped, it was like a miserable family! Example: in scenario, Truman dubs Shawn "adorable one"; here, he's "Mr. Shawn". Insufficiently amateurs behind this movie de-flame Capote and bash his circle (we really believe they thought so little of Nelle, they broke her little opus as an unpleasant in-joke?) turns Perry Smith into this oh-so-sensitive victim, even as he is shown dispatching. One thing is to confuse the facts, it is another thing that should discard the ball: executions were conducted between 12: 45-1: 19, April 14; Truman is shown in prison 22 HOURS LATER! <br /> <br /> I was absolutely impressed with "acting". Keener doesn't even try to sound like a native of Alabama. The way Cooper kept shouting "Alvin!", I waited for Chimpmun to appear! Hoffman doesn't give us glamorous gadfly, but a pathetic suck-up who sees the horrible act as his ticket in great time. When Hoffman whines about being "tortured" by endless challenges, I wanted to give him a shotgun to do us a favor and blow our brains out!
