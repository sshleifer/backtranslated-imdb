Poor action movies are cemeteries for aging star martial arts. In such films, they try to keep the dangerous behavior that made their early work successful, but they all fail. Seagal is too old for this type of role, but he didn't want to let go ... no matter how stupid he looks. Some hope that his current work will somehow bring magic, but there is no magic. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he belonged to Steven Seagal, and his work became a fan of me. I saw him fit nicely in the slot on The Sopranos, where his overweight body, sharp features and annoying attitude could find a home. I wonder what's the return to his live video streaming?! Because it makes them, I assume that $ $ is more than satisfactory. As far as the deal is concerned, we will be subjected to Seagal's poorly executed action films to its late sixties and seventies .....
