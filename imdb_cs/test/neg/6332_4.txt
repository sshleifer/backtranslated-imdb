I must say that I am a big fan of these "Last House on the Left", even those most people seem to hate. but one of these movies, which I didn't like very much, was Aldo Lada's "Night Murder Train", and unfortunately it would seem that trains and the Last House on the left are not mixed up because Terror Express is another indispensable rip-off. Something that really needs this kind of film is a tremendously ugly character of leadership; and while Terror Express offers up to three potential candidates, not one of them will increase and become such a rogue, so missing in the most important area. In fact, it gets a good start because three young men on a passenger train start to slightly irritate the guests on board. This leads viewers to believe that there is more in the store, but unfortunately it will never happen once the scene is set. From there, the trio ends up taking over the train and using its new found power to terrorize guests and rape women. It should be said that there is a fair amount of sleaze in it. a movie that will delight many viewers; but there's almost no blood. Director Ferdinando Baldi seemed to think he could get rid of blood with sexual scenes, and he could get rid of it; if he could shoot a brutal sex scene. The idea that these men took the train by force comes out of the window as soon as it gets to sex, because the people you'd expect to be powerful and energetic seem too excited to show their women a good time and, despite one, very tame 'sandwich' sequence, none of the sexes is particularly interesting. Since many movies are captured by these sexual scenes, it becomes a huge problem. Such films are often lacking in style, tension and credibility; but you know you're looking bad when you're bored. As one might expect, none of the actors is at all; and in particular the three central centers excel in being garbage. The direction is missing in style and there is very little voltage or voltage; makes it difficult to care for what happens. Overall, this is a rather annoying example of film exploitation and I cannot recommend it.
