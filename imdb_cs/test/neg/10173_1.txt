How can you read just that good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually look at his church! Anyway, the film had a good B-movie science fiction beginning, everything there was to be a good fun, easy-to-watch movie, then all that felt in this religious regime of Jesus-save-all-everyone who is brainwashing. The story begins with two main characters, 2 reporters, but quickly gives the first role to that fool of Jesus who is there to save every man's soul with this attitude. In a few words: this movie ranges from fun to brainwashing in about 30 minutes <br /> <br /> waste of time, waste of money ...
