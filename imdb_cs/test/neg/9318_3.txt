OK, last night I saw the world premiere of Exorcist: The Beginning at the International Fantastic Film Festival in Brussels. With all the buzz around the movie it was very much anticipated. The director was there, and so was the majority of the stars (except Skarsgard). Unfortunately, the film sucked in great time. It was a real disappointment to me because I'm a huge fan of Shrader and Friedkin (RIP) 1973. <br /> <br /> What was wrong with him? Most of it actually. FX (you would think that the digital revolution of the Matrix and LOTR never happened: it was so badly rendered!), Cut (no real pace or rhythm), acting (only Skarsgard sometimes could convince). The script was, IMO, ready to explain African scenes in the original movie. So the film felt that it was a scene that was just set up so that nothing contributed. The only thing I did was the Vittoria Storar cinematography, even though I saw him better (Apocalyps Now). /> <br /> All the while I thought it was just a rough cut, work in progress. And, given the (well-known) circumstances, it is probably what it is. But that doesn't change the obvious problems with the script. I had a chance to meet Schrader (very briefly), but I didn't have the courage to tell him what I was thinking about the film and I was so nervous (that's who wrote Taxi Driver for Christ sake) !!) that I forgot to ask him to sign his copy of his Taxi Driver script ...
