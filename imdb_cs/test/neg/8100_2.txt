Bela Lugosi is a real mystery. In the early 1930s, he was on top of the world after appearing in Dracula. Yet, over and over, he made miserable decisions about his career. Maybe he had a bad agent, maybe he was involved in drinking and drug use, or maybe he was just crazy. Regardless of destroying his reputation by appearing in almost every movie - from excellent horror movies (such as RAVEN) to big budgets (like NINOTCHKA) to Z movies for the cheapest and cleverest studios. Interestingly, although he agreed to do this horrible film, he actually rejected the role that later went to Boris Karloff in FRANKENSTEIN! As far as this film is concerned, it is a very stupidly horribly produced World War II propaganda film, which was a stupid plot and pathetic cuts. Lugosi spends most of the film murdering saboteurs - nothing bad at all. But in the end we find that he himself is a Nazi plastic surgeon and all the Americans-looking men he killed were actually Japanese !!!! The funniest part is during flashback. You see Lugosi talk to a group of Japanese men before he turns them into Americans. When the camera is scanned, the men are clearly Asian. But on all other non-close-up shots, they are all very Western looking - many with bald heads !! They looked absolutely nothing like Japanese men. I suspect that the conspiracy had to go through a transcript, which could be a reason for a manifest error. Or it can only be a bleak production value and adjustment. In fact, early in the movie, they show a street scene in the city and all cars (circa 1942) are old Model T Fords - apparently from footage !!! The bottom line is that the movie is bad but also very boring. Unlike PLAN 9 FROM THE OUTSIDE, it's hard to laugh at numbness - just let it sleep.
