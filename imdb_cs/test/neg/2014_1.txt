Dracula 3000 or Van Helsing "Dracula's Revenge" (Cheap Money on Another Lame Vampire Flick) as I saw it is a master class in how to make a movie. Rag tag collection misfit salvager aboard a previously lost cargo ship "Demeter" in a (cough) Carpathian system (which is later upgraded to the Carpathian Galaxy) and upward relentless evil (in this case a script). The film is a bizarre bastardization of the Horizon Event and no matter what the most famous Vampire movie of all time is. **** Spoliers Follow **** After a large number of production company logos and credit sequence most of the budget had to be thrown away, we open up with a kitschy Caspera (silly name) commentary that captain Abraham Van plays Helsinga (a stronger name) and continues to describe the twisted, unintelligible peculiarities that make up his crew, instead of the actual development of the characters. Van Helsing himself sprays his stubble and wears the body warmer in some retro 80's Han Solo tribute (I think). Captain Demeter reappears over and over again in some crazy video diary to tell us nothing about the consequences of a strong German accent (unfortunately, the subtitles are not included). Crewmember Mina boarded an abandoned ship (alone ???) armed only with a weapon-shaped torch and a thick East European accent, while Van Helsing on his ship's bridge (which is basically the only glittering wall). Mina wearing a gas mask with rubber hoses glued to her front will meet what can only be described as a skateboarder in a black cloak that constantly slides through the camera. Why this happens when a vampire is not yet embodied is never explained. This leads to a shaky camera that chases Mina down the corridors until it reaches the Humvee. It is possible that Will Smith could have been written to write Humvee's lines because most of them consist of a Humvee that reminds us that he is black every ten seconds and says the word "ass" enough to record the Guinness Book of Records, when she added it all. from the DA hood "accent (that's the year 3000," DA hood "even exists?) One of the main problems with this movie is that it is insanely trying to pretend its set in 3000. Unfortunately, someone with healthy eyes won 't buy it, because Demeter looks suspiciously like a Soviet ocean-going tanker, the film crew might have thought it would be okay to leave hammer and sickle symbols everywhere and a sexy Lenin poster next to lots of lockers and explain it as some futuristic communist comeback. they were ambushed from the Oxfam collection box (sealed since 1993) and armed with the latest 20th century automatic weapons (with an added 3,000 zing year when they are fired), which, of course, are absolutely useless. ) because simpering professor not only glasses, but is in a wheelchair ??? My God, what happened to everything geneti Professor is an interesting character because he is a direct rip off Alien Resurrection who had their own rag tag misfit crew with a guy in a wheelchair (who was strangely killed). Fans did not take Prof when he was afraid of many scenes. If I were imprisoned on a Soviet wheelchair-accessible ship chased by poorly acting vampires, and everyone left me because I was such a whining werewolf, I'd be afraid too. <br /> <br /> During the UN-dramatic scene Mina Chase, the pro informs us (feeling) "it's worrying". The rest of his lines are also a disturbing "bugger", and "We'll All Die" X 100, follows. Erika Eleniak appears as Vice Captain (what happened to the 1st Officers?) in what I thought would be tired, standard problem, hard nose, no nonsense, "don't take put me in the eye if I didn't tell you too, "beat 10 stuntmen at once super-babe, but this is Z-flick so basically wears tight low cut and even tighter leather pants. The performance of Coolia increases the ham factor by 90% and is a camper than a number of tents, but fortunately for us to die soon. Though he seems to be holding his heart on the right side of his body. After a lot of running up and down the same corridor, using the clumsy controls of the Soviet style and sitting in the Soviet-style dressing rooms, the crew found themselves stranded when their own ship exploded to find a more interesting crew (probably). Why Dracula even mentioned them is unknown because the main evil guy is called Orlock, which is Space Transylvanian for "crimes against fashion" as he creeps in a big inflated, scuffed shirt and even more sticky collar, so Hammer Horror Vampire looks smooth in comparison. Orlock stops to explain his entire back story (off camera) to Erice Eleniak, but he can't kill her in another Alien Resurrection trance. His back story is such a big piece of ground that it's not worth repeating. Since the budget cannot afford combat coordinators, special effects, original music, script (unwritten chimpanzee) and even proper end titles (the first cast I saw were the same characters but completely different and Italian names), the film begins to destroy anything you started with. Fortunately, the crew is able to fight with the help of a ship's computer that contains vague, millennium old links about how to kill fictional creatures and some practical 20th-century cues found in a ship's common room (in your "holodeck"). The end is terrible and a little suspicious, either they ran out of money, or the former Soviets demanded their ship back. I went into this movie knowing that it was wrong, but forgot how bad it really was.
