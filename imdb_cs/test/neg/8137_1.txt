Barbara Payton is a supposed sexy young hot Chickie wife of a geezer plantation owner somewhere in the jungley's back entered in a cheap studio in Hollywood. Raymond Burr wears his work shirt with a top button, which returned as a rugged, robust plantation master, whom Mrs Payton wants to blow up. There's another girl, some kind of peasant slave Burr used to whisper, but he gave her an old heath, so the obligatory squatty old voo-doo hag conjures up a good spell to throw on him and Payton's hiker. I only watched it partially because it's really terrible, so it didn't even get to see the star of the show - which I think it's a gorilla voo-doo hag turned someone into or anything ..... who cares. I'll give this half star out of ten. It's not even campy, just really bad.
