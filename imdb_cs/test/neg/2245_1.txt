Every Quentin Tarantino movie has become worse. I would like to believe that most people would agree with this statement, but when they see that "Inglourious (sic) Basterds (sic)" has 8.5 / 10 of over 100,000 ratings, it does not seem to be the general public has purpose. Even his best work, Reservoir Dogs, was not a "masterpiece". The problem is that claiming that you like Tarantina's work has become trendy. Once this happens, you get the shipping of people who are ready and willing to jump on another train. They will ignore the ridiculously horrible behavior and utterly benevolent writing, so they can be part of an exclusive club called "all". This film is so horrible that I swear it must be some twisted Tarantino joke to see how much torture his fans will tolerate and still praise him. Like another reviewer, he said: "Tarantino's previous movies were from a guy in love with other movies. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing." I couldn't agree more. This film is nothing more than a confident and witty ridiculous writing in conjunction with the acting skills that came directly from the high school game. But thanks to a general movie that is public, I'm sure it will still be one of the best movies ever made. Bravo, Tarantino. You pulled one of the best practical jokes of all time.
