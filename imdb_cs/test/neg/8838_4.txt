I saw how it started twice, I couldn't understand it, and that bothered me for the whole movie. So work with me: Wayne (GOOD guy) jumps on a stagecoach, disarms drivers (!), steals money (?!), and takes off. <br /> <br /> Deactivated, one driver is then killed and the other wounded by bad guys. Thanks to Wayne, who disarmed them, and then watched it happen. Then Wayne drops the dirt money, saves the girl, goes out to town, laughs with Yak (too bad for the dead guy, I think) ... and then later says he "found" money back on scene. And they're all fine. And is he a good guy? And I'm sure there weren't small, hand-held torches at the time. And Bell made the first phone demo in 1876 ... then they were in the houses? Thinking about this too hard? Normally, I'm glad I can suspend the verdict to enjoy the movie, but this bothered me. And that's a sign that the move didn't work for me.
