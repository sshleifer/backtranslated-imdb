After the mysterious death of an old friend, a group of teenagers are in possession of Stay Alive, a horror survival based on the horrific story of Erzebet Bathory, known as The Blood Countess. soon they are murdered one by one in the same method as the character they played in the game. As the line between the game world and reality disappears, our heroes must find a way to defeat the evil blood countess. "Stay Alive" is an incredibly bad teen slasher swipe without iota suspense.Writer-director William Brent Bell doesn't have a damn clue how to make a traceable horror movie. Almost non-existent and the story doesn't make sense. The dialogue is absolutely wrong and the actions of all involved are embarrassing. "Staying Alive" is easily one of the worst jet horror movies of 2006.
