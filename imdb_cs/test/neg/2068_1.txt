As a film reviewer for a local gay magazine, I automatically receive a post if a homo happens. Chicken Tikka Masala is in the background as I write. I gave it my undivided attention for 53 minutes before I found myself involuntarily screaming - like a suffering Tourrette - "This is a sh ** test movie I've ever seen". We are now coming to an emotional climax, where the son gives his father some sort of speech at his wedding. My father seems to be doing quite well. An attempt to kill honor at this point would at least revive the film. And he made it fun. <br /> <br /> For example, I have failed, for example, beautiful things, but at least I saw why other people did it. It was made with some professionalism and it seems that I remember having at least a few good lines. The lack of joke in this movie is absolutely stunning - even most average sitcoms will tend to have recognizable jokes. The closest to this movie was fun (at least in the first 53 minutes) was a subtitle commentary that was delivered to fat unattractive women. "Look at her with her legs open - it's like the Mersey Tunnel. Absolutely helpless and I did not smile, but I could imagine someone with a low IQ (who might be working in a chip shop) enjoying it. If not, I can at least deal with the fact that those who support lose a significant amount of money, because even a low-budget British film will return someone a few million. Seriously, when I met the most beautiful block in the world, and when I returned to my place to love love, I found a copy of it in his DVD collection ("Man, I Love the Movie"). into nuts and leave immediately. And from someone who has been gone for about six months without any of the above sweet loves. Oh Lord, I hate this movie.
