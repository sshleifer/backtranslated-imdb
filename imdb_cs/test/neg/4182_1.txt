After sitting on the train, which was the first Dark Harvest movie, I couldn't leave myself alone. When I saw that there was a continuation (or rather what I believed to be a continuation), I had to increase the level of pain. When he saw that it had nothing to do with Dark Harvest, it was supposed to be a good thing. We didn't get any scarecrow killer in this one, instead we went around a scaly rabbit who screams like little girls! and "Can you hear me?" so often. In addition, we got two (four if you included two girls who the director wanted to have the same effect as the twins in The Shining) an unpleasant little girl who couldn't act. And the icing on top of this mess would have to be Corn Cop. I should have known that this movie would be terrible if the dog got the initial credit. How I managed to stay awake in this movie, I never know.
