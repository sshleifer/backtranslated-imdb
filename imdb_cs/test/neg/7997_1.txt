This is one of those movies that is so bad it's awesome !!! He has everything he needs in the eighties: film pants, big mustaches, chickens with Farrah's hair, and most importantly, NINJAS !!!! I have a few moments to choose to wipe you out. Cole's military mate has a strange monkey face and seems to speak without jaw movement. He gets his ass, which is given to him about every other scene by thieves who want his country to get drunk through the whole movie. At one point, his farm workers finally return after they find themselves in gangster rent goons and Frank, I think his name is Frank, he's so moved to yell at the whole group "Let's fight the penis !!" and they all move happily to the battlefield battlefield to start the festivities. This is funny at all possible levels. Whether you take it dirty or literally, it still warms my heart. Another funny thing is Sho Kosugi's little grunts and through animated ninja style moves. I remember this dude when I was a kid and said he was the only real ninja in the world (he had advertisements in martial arts magazines), if I remember correctly. My friends and I were a little ninja crazy at the time this movie came out and I can remember seeing it at the local theater many times. I wondered how I saw it on Starz last night, why every type of slimy American gangster always has a fortress in Phillipines and wears a white suit Steve Martin. In fact, this guy goes far beyond requiring all his criminals to wear white suits Steve Martin. There is a scene where it looks like 20 Steve Martin imitators are attacking the 1970 Sears underwear model (Cole). When we finished for the last battle, Cole bursts awkwardly into the wrong guy's commander, and immediately the secretary spots him, alerting the guard, who fires an action shotgun from the pump at 30 feet from the bad guys and nobody. they seem to notice or take care of them. Cole, wearing a completely white ninja outfit, progresses by climbing up the staircase and then turning right into the area where everyone is evil. The other in charge tells him that he didn't have to kill everyone when they were expecting him, and then he drives him into a huge battle arena. Don't ask me why Cock Fighting is a huge part of this movie, but it is. When they come, Cole is still wearing a ninja mask, though everyone who participates in her is wearing a ninja mask. The final battle is coming, because Cole has killed everyone and now, as I like to call him, he reveals that he has kidnapped Cole's wife, Frank's wife, and they meet in the prettiest arena you have ever seen. Sho then, very politely, can add, release the lady and the battle is about to begin. They bend and begin to circle around. When they join the battle it appears Cole becomes someone else intermittently ala "Complete Game" a funny spoof on the completion of Bruce Lee's "Death Game". Cole eventually arrives at the top, Kills Sho, who dies with the honor of being decapitated and all of them in order. Next, we see Cole, after the destruction of each of us, the city will break up again, but not before the harsh death of a fat guy with a hooked hand and then inexplicably blinks at the camera, freezes the frame, credits, he does.
