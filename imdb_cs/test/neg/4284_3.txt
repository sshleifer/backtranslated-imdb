Man kills the bear. Man becomes a bear. A man / bear meets a bear. The man / bear will stay after meeting the bear man / bear. End. Seriously, that's the whole plot for this movie. Yes, I have simplified it to the limit, but you have the picture. I just wish I couldn't see it. 'The Man / Bear' mentions an American Indian who kills the mother of the offspring. And while it may be moving, it is certainly lacking to really rely on a potential conflict between the two parties. In addition, there was some abuse of two moose in the film. But it is beyond the point. <br /> <br /> Very well under par. Surely there was much more to be fun. Maybe more laughter from the secondary characters and more drama between the two main bears. That's what separates bad movies from good. "D"
