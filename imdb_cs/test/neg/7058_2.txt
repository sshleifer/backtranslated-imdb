When I was 13, I was lucky enough to find the movie. That was part of an endless Danish series of really kitschy things. But this was the best I ever owned - but I think I sold it too badly. What to write ... Better than "Manos: Hands of Destiny" and worse than "Critters 4". But it's definitely worth an hour and a half because the people who wanted to do it did it. Acting is not as bad as a few other 80th garbage - in fact, I'm like an old man, even though he didn't look at me. But I don't think you can have everything ... Do yourself a favor and look up ...
