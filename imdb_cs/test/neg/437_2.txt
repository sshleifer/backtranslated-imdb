AWiP tries to be funny, frightening, tense and romantic ... and fails in every respect. Playing is at best average but mostly silly. Special effects are not enough to replace silly devices, and chemistry between * ANY * is juvenile. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to be mad at yourself, don't pay money.
