Ask thousands of people what's the greatest unintentional comedy of all time, and they'll almost always tell you Battlefield Earth or Plan 9 From Space. He is wrong. Ninja American has these two turkeys defeated for many reasons, the smallest of which is a scenario that was not clearly thought out. While I fully support the B-painting industry to keep free lances like Michael Dudikoff at work, little work on the product would go a long way. <br /> <br /> For those who give the rat on the back, my next few paragraphs give away significant parts of the plot. First, when we get some basic information about the titular hero, we tell him his birthday, other relatives, parents, etc., they are all unknown. I don't know about you, but I expect the US Army to take the factual finding of its staff a little more seriously. They will also be able to effectively fix data continuity, even if I don't remember which data was right and when. It is actually one of the less apparent deficiencies of American Ninja. It has already been mentioned, but the frequent failure of many martial arts films is that when our heroes are confronted with a large number of antagonists, the antagonists said. after one attack. More recent movies such as The Matrix Reloaded Defy this Convention, but only about every film since the 1980s is the audience shouting, "Hey, why don't you attack all at once ???". Martial arts films tend to be much more impressive when fights are larger than one-on-one. The central premise was originally a joke, but in the light of recent events where the US military can't crush a mob of insurgents simply because they don't delegate to experts, it seems weird irony. Defenders Phillipina steal weapons from a local US Army division to sell to rich clients. It doesn't matter that such a robbery would invite the army to give local businessmen a responsible, or even credible, airline rectal test, it's a shabby action movie of the 1980s. But by far the funniest part of the film is the ultimate battle. As Joe and Jackson combine posing and fighting into an art form, evil Ninjas begin to explode for no apparent reason. I agree with one previous commentator that this film was to be called the Ninja Holocaust because I am willing to bet a total of at least three hundred evil Ninjas who bite it during the course of the film. In addition, the black star Ninja begins to fight with rocket launchers, laser beams and all kinds of ridiculous instruments that are not only poorly thought out, but poorly executed. You will never see the effect of a laser beam that looks cheaper. What is upstairs is that the movie is so damned. During the scene when Joe reunites with his old mentor, I dare the viewer not to laugh at the sad dialogue. Not that I know all the modern praises of Ninjitsu, but the logical part of my imagination is hard to believe that they have spoken in their history. During this mentoring scene, I half-expected the old man to tell Joe that he had to prove his masculinity by cutting off his head with a blunt plastic spoon. I gave Ninja 1 to all Americans in all. 1. It's a special score in my system that it's dedicated to the worst, most horrifying, most offensive movies I've ever seen, or movies that make me they laugh without trying. The American Ninja is definitely an example of the other.
