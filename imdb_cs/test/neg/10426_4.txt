This film tells the story of John Belushi, based on his biography "Wired", written by Bob Woodward. All movies are told about a flashback without a chronological order, where after John Belushi's death, we see one angel who accompanies Belushi during a few points. that for the one who does not know the book is very confused. But worse, they introduced Bob Woodward, who talked to Belushi before he died. For these negative points the film is just would-be an attempt to tell the controversial story of John Belushi. My rate is 4.
