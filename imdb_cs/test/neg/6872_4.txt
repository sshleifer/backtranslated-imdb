Jealous husband holds a car hostage dealer while Williams weighs the viewer his worn Mork shtick at every turn. Yawning. <br /> <br /> Pay channel. An unusually bad scenario, coupled with less than convincing Robin Williams as a neat talking, fake Queens vendor of cars, got into a workplace hostage crisis. Laughter is not there, the message or morality is simply wrong and the film cannot decide whether it is his comedy or drama. Pretty good casting of all gambling pretty badly. When the film gets older so bad you get smelly. There is nothing else but to say otherwise than avoid it at all costs. Textbooks average movies like this are actually more boring, and less enjoyable than over the top bombs.
