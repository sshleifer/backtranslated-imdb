Professional dancer Daniel (Tom Long) is kidnapped and forced to have eccentric sex for many days while walking to buy cigarettes. When he is released, director of his company Isabel (Greta Scacchi) has already replaced him and the girlfriend gives him a cool reception. Concerned and humiliated, Daniel leaves the dance company and travels obsessively in search of a kidnapper. Daniel has sex with many women who suspect they might be kidnappers. "The Book of Revelation" is a strange movie with a hopeful start that loses its initial strength and becomes a kind of too long erotic soap opera or soft-porn chic. The production is nice, the DVD cover is amazing, but the characters aren't well-developed and the trauma of Daniel seems to be excessive because most men would fantasize with the dream situation being presented? to become a sexual object of three sexy women. Melodramatic development with Isabel disease adds no value to conspiracy; The open conclusion is very disappointing and there is no explanation for the motive of women or title. It is clear that a woman wrote a script for male feelings. It was good to see the beautiful Greta Scacchi again, and her makeup at the end was impressive. There is a saying in Portuguese that could be translated into English as follows: "If rape is inevitable, relax and come." Daniel should do that and spare me watching almost two hours of meaningless story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "O Livro das Revelações" ("The Book of Revelation")
