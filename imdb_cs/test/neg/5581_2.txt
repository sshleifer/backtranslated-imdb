The kind of B-films from the 1950s that were so much fun for Schlocks is what Predator Island pays tribute to. Filmed in Connecticut, Predator Island is located on an island called the Hell's Beacon, which occupies only a couple that tends to control the lighthouse. In a typical sci-fi fashion in the 1950s, half a dozen young adults stumbled across a boat into the rocky coastline of the island, where horrible space creatures invade the island after a meteor attack. Animals begin to inhabit the bodies of their victims and at the same time devour them. Lots of curse and lame comebacks are the primary form of dialogue in this film. It's so hockey that you have to laugh sometimes. If you're looking for a movie that's stupid but fun, then this one fits into your account. Interesting note: I find myself in the film as a dead body in the background of the last scene. During the shooting, they needed about 50 bonuses, but about 300 people came to this opportunity. They eventually used almost 200 of them.
