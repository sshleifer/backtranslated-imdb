I rented this thought that it would be pretty good just on the cover of the movie. The referees and jury started a pretty good killer chasing a man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool weapon, but this movie gradually graded as it went on. David Keith is an amazing actor especially when he plays the role of such a bad movie was a piece of bullshit that really wasted his talent. The referee and the jury were absolutely stupid. I gave it 3 should give 2, I gave it an extra star just because David Keith's gun was cool.
