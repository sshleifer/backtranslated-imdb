This film, through its protagonist, states that the world is essentially sadness and pain, and those who ignore it are wearing flaps. It can be argued whether this is true or not. But even if you accept it as true, the end of the film either A) denies it by saying that there may be something good in tragic situations, or B) forgetting it and using a cliché cliché to make the audience feel elevated. That the film metaphorically adopts its protagonist by presenting it as a likable character, despite all the evidence that sympathy shows contempt for supportive characters that were most convincing in the film. <br /> <br /> So what you have in this movie is a script that's not consistent in its theme and direction that doesn't end in sync with the rest of the movie. There are excellent performances given by each cast member especially Spacey, Olin, Martin Donovan and Ann Magnuson. It is a pity that they were not supported by a better writer / director.
