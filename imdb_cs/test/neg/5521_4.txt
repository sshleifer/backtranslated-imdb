HAPPY DAYS was one of my favorite shows when it aired in 1974. However, critics have quickly shown their ignorance in combination with a complete lack of sense of humor by hitting this show because they thought it was a cheap cash attempt. Success of the US GRAFFITTI. There were similarities between GRAFFITTI and HAPPY DAYS. Both opened with "Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley & The Comets. They both took place in the past, and both featured Ron Howard as one of the lead roles. However, there were some major differences. While the US GRAFFITTI was held in California in 1962, concentrating around a group of high-school graduates who were about to make this big step into adulthood, HAPPY DAYS took place in Milwaulkee, Wisconson, and concentrated on a group of high school teenagers. joy and torment of adolescence. HAPPY DAYS was originally opened with a juke box playing the original version of Bill Haley & The Comets' ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK. But when the oldies warmed up, thanks to the success of the US GRAFFITTI, and the original version of ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK of 1954, entered the Billboard Hot 100 and became again a hit in 1974, royalties paid through the roof. So the "remake" of the song (the correct term is now "new stereo record") was quickly replaced. The current theme song for HAPPY DAYS was then presented for the second season, as long as my memory serves <br /> <br /> Fans and enemies agree that this show is escapist. Freedoms were taken and details were overlooked, making the show less than absolutely authentic. <br /> <br /> That's perfectly fine. HAPPY DAYS is supposed to be a comedy, not a history lesson. Sometimes, however, writers sometimes stretch their throats by touching controversial issues. One episode was centered around the Cunninghams, where refuge was located. Another episode was about a divorced woman who moved to a neighborhood with a dream to start a new life. The subject of prejudice was addressed when Howard was invited to the wedding of an old military friend who was just black (at a time when prejudice and discrimination were unfortunately an acceptable part of the American way of life). The design problem has even come to a later episode! Most of them were teenagers and as each year passed, it was obvious that they grew older, making the series aged with cast, moving series from safe waters of Eisenhower years to Camelot, all the way with JFK and then into the tumultuous late mid-sixties. This, along with writers who lack ideas, and later, cast members like Ron Howard leaving the show, wisely quit while they were forward, left me wishing everyone would do the right thing by pulling out the plug on this show and end up. while they were ahead of us. This, together with the audience audience, who could not follow every time Great Fonzie entered the scene, began to wear very quickly. This show originally featured fabulous fifty years when we LIKE to remember the era. Time heals wounds, you know. Everything has its place and although I would rather listen to "original hits" over the "new stereo recordings", the "new stereo recordings" worked very well on HAPPY DAYS. And this is where I apologize for having bought a DVD! Unlike the complete first season of the DVD, the original music for the second season was replaced by another music. While it is great that the original episodes were digitally restored to digital excellence, the removal of the original music destroyed what it made this show so fun to watch!
