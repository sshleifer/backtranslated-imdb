I saw most of the series because I left the TV as background noise in my dorm. <br /> <br /> I was a fan of Mencia, but this show doesn't mean much to me. He will occasionally say or do something to pull out laughter, but he has this aura of selflessness that will completely destroy it. I've always thought he was funny because his furious angry man routine is not terribly prevalent in this TV series. Instead, he's just smug. I think it just reflects how funny his comedy is: outdated and uninteresting when it's not in the right way of delivery. I saw him get into his show sometimes, but for the most part he just sat down and smiled and looked smug, and that didn't suit him well. But my opinion.
