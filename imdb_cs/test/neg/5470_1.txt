Low budget unsolicited for bloodthirsty cultists in Greece headed by Peter Cushing. It is Donald Pleasance's priest to stop them. Crown International released this crap in 1978, and it was "dog-on-the-week" on one of the episodes of Sneak previews with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. I forgot which of the two "persecuted" I see. The crappy movie has the worst performances of Peter Cushing and Donald Pleasance I've ever seen. The video box is a monster. There is no such beast in the film. Instead, you get a statue, but at least its atonomically correct. (Woo hoo!) <br /> <br /> Cultivists look like Klu Klux Klowns ... if there could be a group. Skip it.
