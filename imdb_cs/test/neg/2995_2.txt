I should live this movie, but not. To win international awards, it is foreign (I usually like such movies) that is slow moving (again something I like) and it has gratuitous sex or violence. The problem is that it is boring. We have two friends from the same village in Turkey, one "successful" the other not. Failed to come to Istanbul to stay successful in trying to get a good job at sea. Both live lives that are not fulfilled, meaningless and tiny. Well, it's not the first time this kind of movie was made. I didn't see anything new about this tired topic. There are long insists that they are just someone standing and looking at the sea or sitting in a cafe or watching TV. I understand that this kind of thing is there to show the emptiness of their love, though it does make me get the idea in the first 15 minutes. I don't have to be beaten over my head for the rest of two hours. The symbolism is also a bit heavy. a plate of live fish type fish with one off the plate and a flop around in his death throws. The symbols are best when they are not obvious, but they are there, in the background and create a mood that is somewhat below the level of the viewer's awareness. The film is so apathetic that it doesn't even score 1, so I gave it 2. For rating 1, it takes the talent to the wrong. This film didn't have that much energy.
