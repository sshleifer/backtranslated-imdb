Plodding, maybe it was supposed to be a title. Bad dialogue went dark. All characters are single dimensions except one. Unfortunately, this character has some of the worst lines, and it doesn't seem to fit into this clich√©. This film, which grew up in the 1970s, is missing in details, atmosphere and authenticity. Surprisingly, this was produced by Kelsey Grammar, someone who should recognize sharp dialogue and consistent narration in the script. Cameron Richardson is about a single element that illuminates this film. Robin Trower's music is also a welcome addition.
