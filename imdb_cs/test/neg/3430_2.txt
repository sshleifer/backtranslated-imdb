Except for John Krasinsky, this film was terrible. Lacey Chabert and Andrew Keegan's love story was as cliché as possible, full of incredibly bad lines about how parents would never let them be together and super-hammer-looking eyes. None of the "emotions" had any depth or reality. These two accented characters (Dean Edwards as Rupert and the one who played the weapons expert) ... once they saw the accents were bad, they couldn't decide to just drop them and rewrite a few lines to avoid giving the audience pain head? Apparently not. I don't even know where to start editing, especially with audio adjustments. If you hate obviously too much dubbing, just like me, don't look at it. As already mentioned, Krasinski was great. From the bat, I admit I'm a huge fan of the office and that's why I rented it. But he's quite entertaining as a "friend with an alien way with crazy ideas". He has the role of a cliché, but he still manages to be as entertaining as possible. The end was terrible. Just threaten. The idea of ​​the robbery that had disappeared had the potential, but Keegan broke up after the shot, until his studio, to fall onto Chabert's (which doesn't look like her), is the most beautiful scene.
