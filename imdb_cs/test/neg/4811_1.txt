Ni√±as Mal is not a film is a bad episode of a poorly conceived soap opera. Acting is no better than soap operas, I think the writer and director saw too many Mexican soap operas and couldn't imagine anything remotely. Give up, go back to your soap operas to please the audience. Stop our times and money and give a bad name to the once decent Mexican film industry. It's not a good or good movie, it's an average soap opera!
