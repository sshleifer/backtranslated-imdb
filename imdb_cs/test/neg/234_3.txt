Kid was born retarded. This stretches in half a dozen directions, the dialogue and action features lifted from much older and better known flops, and can be funny - if only writers knew what was funny. Disney stuff has gotten much better in the last few decades, but don't be fooled. They were supposed to give the Child a wide bed, sing it with a lullaby, then run the train to the gorge. Killing from grace.
