I watched this movie with no idea what it was about in advance. I was fascinated for the first hour. It was a big thriller. Very talented cast and good dialogue. Then it all broke down looking at the first vampire. I couldn't believe my eyes. A big thriller was flooded in the toilet. The rest of the film from this point was terrible. I gave him 4 stars for a brilliant start alone. I think it's a bit generous, but I was having a little time. I'm not a fan of vampire or zombie movies at all. If you are, then you can disagree with my opinion.
