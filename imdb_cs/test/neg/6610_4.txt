To begin with, I have to say that here in Russia there is a well-known and beloved saga Geralt of Rivia. Andrzej Sapkowski - a gifted writer, or perhaps a genius of some kind - has created one of the most realistic, honest, cynical and god d @ mn of well written fantasy worlds in the history of literature. And when such amazing material gets in the right hands, see the RPG game "Witcher" and you'll understand what I'm talking about. <br /> <br /> "Vedmak Wiedzmin" is an excellent example of the opposite result. <br /> <br /> Budget shortage. Insufficient overhead. Lack of good scenario. These three disgusting film whales fit into this movie, ate it alive. Acting is good, sometimes more than good, but it cannot save this project for God. Yet I still have some faith. I still hope one day to create new films Vedmak and the whole world will see the size and breathtaking beauty of Sapkowski's books. p.s. But before that, Uwe Boll must be expelled. Just in case, you know
