This is the final Left Behind film, which is a fundamentalist preacher and Tim LaHaye novel of what we can expect in our future in the last days of Planet Earth. If this is the case, we can expect an activist presidency in every sense of the word if Barack Obama becomes president next year. The Fantastic Four of Revelation is back with one change of cast, Arnold Pinnock, who would most know as an adviser in Derek's life, is now a minister holding the position of Clarence Gilyard. Brad Johnson as an anti-Christ pilot by day and Christian at night is there like his daughter Janaya Stephens and ace investigating reporter Kirk Cameron. These are the only four people on Earth who have divided the true nature of UN Secretary General Nicolai Karpathy and throwing sand back into their machinery. This time, the United States president, Louis Gossett, Jr., has allies as ally. He has one hell of a time, especially guerrillas on an RPG attack on Presidential Motor Murder of Vice President Charles Martin Smith. Toad is Vice President. Someone really went wrong here, because everyone, including those who would hurt them, know that the president and vice president NEVER travel together. <br /> <br /> It takes the whole movie to convince Gossett who exactly is Karpathy. Again the best in the film is Gordon Currie as Karpathy. Yet we can see another movie Left Behind Back, the door still open, though people assure me that they have exhausted Tim LeHaye's source material. I think if they make money and these players can't get a job in the main film industry. And there are some unresolved conspiracy questions involving Brad Johnson and Chelsea Noble who is Mrs. Kirk Cameron in real life. One of the Fantastic Four dies in this movie, so it will be a Fantastic Three or will have another fourth. Stay tuned.
