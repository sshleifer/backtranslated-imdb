Blindingly stupid guy from previously talented John Hughes who will soon make a movie with sperm from 'Look Who's Talking' if his stars get younger. He recycles the "Home Alone" formula to create this idiotic comedy in which the child moves around Chicago, while the unmanaged kidnappers Joe Mantegne, Joe Pantoliano and Brian Haley are trying to catch him, along a path that endures a tiring grotesque. If Mantegna and Pantoliano don't find laughter in your movie, then you will find yourself in trouble, but the film's laziness is most blatant in scenes where crowds don't notice the baby crawling on the sidewalk. Absolute nonsense.
