I thought it was a very bad movie. All the while I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think again and again how bad it was and how it was $ 3.69. The story was so nervous. At the beginning, they explained who was in high school, but bravely did a great job. Was it a supernatural thriller? Was it a regular thriller? Obviously you can decide for yourself because they didn't see the need to explain. Basically, I understood what happened, I think. What was I confused about was all that was with the bloody noses, phone calls, etc.? Did the guy come back? Was that woman "Carrie" or something? Who knows? You're not going to be following this movie.
