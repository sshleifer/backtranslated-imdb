I recently had to watch it for a project in the Sociology class and I thought it was the worst movie I ever had to sit on. It was like a bad movie cinemax with all the "good bits". Bad gameplay, a fake documentary scenario, a pointless plot, and a rudder-free rudder all make up a horrible, horrible movie. Female characters are basically just sexual objects. Consider this exchange: "He's hot." "He has a girlfriend." "Do you have a girlfriend?" "No." * the girl takes the boy's hand and leads him for some bushes. the boy comes out and sits next to another boy, the girl relaxes * "Did you hit it?" "No, I didn't want to take off my pants." "You're stupid." Another girl shows up when the guys are going to Beverly Hills, gets into a suitcase with one of the boys, and when they get to the cop, you'll see the car swing up and down. Homosexual pervert Clint Eastwood, similar to the trigger, looked similar, and what appears to be Luchador's mask contributes to contempt. One of the boys catches a cop, nobody cares. One of the boys is shot, nobody cares. Someone said that dialogue was mostly improvised, and that shows. Just awful. I would never recommend this movie to anyone.
