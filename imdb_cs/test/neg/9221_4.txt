This is a stupid movie with great singing and dancing. Negotiations are mediocre, but writing leaves something to be done. Buddy Epse's commemorative performance with a short but exceptional performance by Gypsy Rose as a bitter wife of a rich playboy. An incredible display of life at college, ending with an excellent exhibition of Alice in Wonderland. Many parts are worth watching, but don't be afraid to move quickly through parts of the movie
