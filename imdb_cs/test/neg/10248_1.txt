For the bad film connoisseur, Galax is a real jewel. With really horrible dialogue, gaming, and directing, this is not an option for people looking for the right movie. But as one of the most unintentionally cheerful movies of his genre, it's priceless. Especially good are the scenes that include the cult culture of Harley Davidson-worship motorcycles, and many other scenes represent an opportunity for cheap laughs. Unfortunately, the scenes with Dorothy Stratten can't bring, but since he's playing on android, I assume she can excuse her for playing wood. <br /> <br /> Poor movie lovers, they won't play!
