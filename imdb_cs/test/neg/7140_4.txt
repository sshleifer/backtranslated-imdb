In Pasadena, Mrs. Davis (Joanna Cassidy) sends her daughter Aubrey Davis (Amber Tamblyn) to Tokyo to bring her sister Karen Davis (Sarah Michelle Gellar), who is interned at the hospital after being hospitalized, back to the US. After their meeting, Karen dies and Aubrey decides to investigate what happened to her and gets cursed in the same situation, haunted by the house spirit. Meanwhile, in Tokyo, three high school friends Allison (Arielle Kebbel), Vanessa (Teresa Palmer) and Miyuki (Misako Uno) are visiting the famous haunted house and are also cursed and haunted by the ghost. In Chicago, Trish (Jennifer Beals) moves to the apartment of her boyfriend Bill (Christopher Cousins), who lives with her children, teenager Lacey (Sarah Roehmer) and boy Jake (Matthew Knight). Strange things happen to their neighbors on the side doors. "The Grudge 2" has scary sound and visual effects, with a scary woman and a boy, and I have been surprised several times when I watched the movie. However, a complex three subplot scenario is completely confused, so the intertwined story is a complete mess. There are too many characters and situations, and at some point I was completely lost with the story off and shattered. In the end, I was totally disappointed with this confused but haunted movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Grito 2" ("Scream 2")
