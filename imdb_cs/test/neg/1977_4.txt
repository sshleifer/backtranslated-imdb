I'm giving this movie 4 causes I'm a dead fan of the video game series. the graphics and animations are excellent and its nice to see the whole gang in the form of CG Sephiroth is still cool <br /> <br /> now the reasons why he has only 4 good figures feel like planks of wood with some of the worst voice acting that i have ever he saw (watching an epic movie) <br /> <br /> the movie seems like a cloud oriented enough to make fans who are embarrassed by the cloud and cloud. the clouds mentioned so much that it does not you want to see him in this movie <br /> the villains are worth the worst villains ever (I was more frightened by the wicked Witch of the West) <br /> \ t all the other characters in this movie are simply embedded in the movie for a nod to the fans and don't take it further than <br /> wtf is with cool chally ??? <br /> <br /> summary: waited 9 years for this movie and that's what i get a big nonsensical and boring cut scene i beg my head square cenix shoot the person responsible for this burn every copy of the movie and all one involved in it and create a new movie of ashes (it would be nice to make a movie in live action and based on the original game)
