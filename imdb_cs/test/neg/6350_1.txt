If you would like to see an example of not creating a movie, you have to look at it. I, I, without film experiences, could do better. The scenario is ridiculous with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure. To make up for this deficiency, you'd think the action would be decent, wouldn't it? Since acting, editing, and the overall fit of the film is frightening, the only salvation grace is a terrible performance of a leading actor. The reason he is a saving grace is that he is so bad at acting that he should win an Oscar for him. At least some recognition for laughing at him. Throw a dead woman in the body after all the men have fired (where did she come from?), Download a semi-automatic trigger ten times while the soundman removes two gun effects, Kool Mo Dee camera crew, one and only a musical track for the film WHOLE, a non-original script that has no logic; is the perfect recipe for a really bad movie. It's actually a lot more fun spotting mistakes than actually trying to find something positive. Avoid at any cost.
