You saw it in the cinema. I haven't read books. There's nothing new about this movie. the militants seem to die with several slashes no matter how many times our hero has stabbed a big sword that is still looking for the same (ish)! There are several action scenes, but they are very fake. It seems that the filmmakers are under the impression that whenever they can't bother the choreography of the battle scene, they just move the camera up close, move fast, and the music changes ......... That makes me again. I admire them for trying to solve a dark story without normal Hollywood cheese, but I apologize for the filmmakers' failure. Characters are two-dimensional. We hardly meet them or feel them at all. The leader has a charming farmer accent about arrr ..... although he doesn't seem to have much to say ... <br /> <br /> Don't bother looking at it if you're bored and you don't get half the blockbuster price.
