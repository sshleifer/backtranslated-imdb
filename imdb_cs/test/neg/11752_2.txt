I know the original Psycho was a classic and the remake was a mistake, a remarkable shot-by-shot remake. I think it was more or less proven by other comments. However, with this film it is much more bad than just that. <br /> <br /> The first problem is color. The original film was shot in black and white, but what few people realize is that the original was taken after the color film. The choice of black and white film was partly a budget issue, but it was also the stylistic choice of Hitchcock's. Now that doesn't mean the remake should be redesigned in black and white, but the colors of this movie are too bad. The most prevalent colors in the film are orange and green, especially on Marion, which is not to be a flashy character. Bright colors look like a happy movie, and when these terrifying events take place in these color schemes, it looks like a cartoon more than anything, and viewers tend to laugh rather than scream. The second problem is lighting. It is a dark dark story that should be highlighted with dim light, but this remake seemed not only to fail in this, but seemed to go in the direction of OPPOSITE. Most of the scenes are brightly lit, even when it's illogical because it's at night! Another obvious problem is the performance of Vince Vaughn. Yes, he will pull Norman Bate's grudges and madness quite well, I do not deny him. But the character he could not show is one element: softness. There should be some deceptive character friendliness, at least initially, which then disappears as soon as we realize the truth about it. In addition to being the character character of Norman Bates, it is a recognized sign feature of ALL PSYCHOPATICS !!!! There are several good aspects of this movie. Some of the shows are great. As I said, Vince Vaughn came close to pulling out a decent view of Norman Bates. Viggo Mortensen and Juliane Moore were great together and their chemistry was very different from the characters in the original, which was a welcome change. Anne Heche may have been cruel, but unlike Janet Leigh, who was falsely advertised as one of the greatest stars of the film, Anne Heche was given a final billing statement. I read on the front page a copy of the novel Psycho, which Gus Van Sant claimed was not a remake of Hitchcock, but rather a new adaptation of the original novel. I wish I bought the book and saved the note, because after seeing this movie, this note is perhaps the funniest thing I've ever seen. In this film, he did not try to hide the fact that it was a torn original, and it would be much more plausible if Van Sant tried to tell us he was really a three-ton monkey from Zafroomulax. So many shots were copied without any real thoughts as to why Hitchcock created the original shot. A scene in which Sam and Lila talk while their faces are completely covered with shadow. Hitchcock covered the faces of these actors in the shadows because they thought they were bad actors and wanted to hide their faces so that no one could see their terrible performance, not for some artistic or stylistic purpose. In other words, my review is just as unnecessary as the movie itself, replicating something that has already been said. Like everyone else, I recommend that you not waste your time on this movie and get the original.
