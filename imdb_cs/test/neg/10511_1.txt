It's 2005, my friends ... the time of amazing special effects and the age of technology. So why can't we see a movie that is a little more thoughtful than this poor low budget movie. I've seen a lot of low budget movies that rock my socks, but this ... it's almost as if he was trying to be horrible. Just ... don't look at it. I can look at the past lack of special effects and computer-generated scenes if the acting was at least good. I feel that a small child produced this whole film. There is no original plot. The Vampire Assassins, by itself, is one big fence hole with an attempt to taunt. Can anyone tell me if it's like a comedy movie and I didn't know? I wonder what it has for us, who loves the first installment?
