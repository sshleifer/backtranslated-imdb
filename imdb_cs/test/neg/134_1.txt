"Mississippi Siren" Fran√ßoise Traffauta had an unconvincing plot. The scenario required too much flexibility to suspend mistrust. The story went glacially. It started in an interesting setting, but soon it plunged into a flock of melodrama that lacked logic or intelligence. What did critics think? He is overestimated to be described as loser. Even Catherine Deneuvue, who charmed the "Cherbourg Umbrellas" and "Belle Doe Jour", was simply uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> We rented this movie at the same time we rented another movie Traffaut. At first we observed it and found it so bad that we sent the other one back to that time invisible.
