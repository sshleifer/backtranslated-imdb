I found this DVD in the store and figured out why not support a motionless movie and watch a great horror movie. Please save time and money and review them. Acting, screenplay, virtually everything with this movie is under par. There really isn't much story, and there's no character development. I found out that I didn't care about what happened to the people in the movie until something happened. Everyone has a college age, but they all seem to be in the mid-thirties, except for a woman who plays a mother who seems to be pushing. 40. The worst part of the movie is the fact that every single scene is displayed in the main frame. There are no adjustments, no cuts, or closing windows. Do yourself a favor and leave it out.
