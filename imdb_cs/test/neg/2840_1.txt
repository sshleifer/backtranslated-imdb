Lisa Grant (Adrienne Barbeau) is a real estate agent who is in danger of being killed by a terrified maniac who kills people in his profession who feel that home prices are too high. How motives go, it's pretty damn good. Lisa's friend happens to be the host of a talk show that the killer calls on. Initially, I was positive that it was supposed to be a comedy or satire of some sort, but as endless moments when the drone turns on and off, I realized it wasn't and the movie was just roughly incompetent in all directions, shapes and forms. I'm just surprised that something like this wasn't director Jeff Lieberman (yea, email me again to hate mail, Jeff get hack) Anyway back to film, poor, poor Barbeau, you can pinpoint when her movie career went down to the flames and everything started here. <br /> <br /> My class: F <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Movie Channel
