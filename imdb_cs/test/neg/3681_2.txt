I was addicted to the assumption that the show was about demons. From the hell. And the door to hell. What I didn't realize was watching some of the guys running around the tunnels chased by little kids, which may or may not be demons for the whole movie. Certainly there was some dialogue between, and great underground scenery, but the lack of conspiracy, developed characters, some twists or developments in the story at all was very missing. And there were no special effects of interest. The whole budget was spent on the actors' salaries, sets and a lot of time running around with the camera in the underground. The end was one of the typical unbearable boring ends that tell you: "This boredom movie I endured for it !?" If you want to see demons and doors to hell, I promise you that you should be better, if you were watching the trailers for Hellgate: London, which is shorter than this movie in 5 minutes, wrap up another dialogue, character development, action, conspiracy and satisfactory conclusions than this. <br /> <br /> overall low scores for failing to make a movie that would stand out and for promising promises much more than what was delivered.
