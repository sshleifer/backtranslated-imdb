A crazy attack on the audience's senses. This is mish-mash of various Hindu and English films - badly done. The name takes over from the more than seventies cast, which the 2002 version also boasts. The story is taken from the 1970s by Sunil Dutt / Reena Roy starrer - "Nagin" and visual effects (terrible attempt) from The Matrix, Terminator 2 and Mission Impossible II. Set in the college environment (Sunil Shetty, Akshaye Kumar, Manisha - High School Kids !!! ??? !!), Manisha Koirala is a victim who makes two mistakes students consider collective efforts on the part of our heroes. As it turns out, Manisha is a Cobra snake (Nag) reborn as a girl in this life and her friend from previous life, now a super powerful-all-and-any-shape-suppose (Ichadhari Nag) - Munish Kohli, is looking for her in this life. Manisha appeals to him to avenge her violations and murder. This is how a crazy death spree begins, where a loving vengeance starts singing every man in the band, with increasing abilities and trick-tricks. The effects are extremely inexpensive, with computer generated skeletons, morphing bodies, and motorcycle bits that complement the farce. Bring from Nagin Raj Babbar a playing Catholic priest who provides temporary relief to our boys with a more "Religiously Right" multi-religious medallion (the original Nagin only had "Om"). loving interest in Manish and the savior against all the mighty Munish Kohl. <br /> <br /> Music and songs are below average. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you don't want spectacular cheap excitement.
