Hopper has never been worse as if he felt because this film is worthy of only Class B performance and brings quite good. Beyond Madsen and Hopper, acting is terrible; You've seen better at your local college. Sound and occasional editing and camera shots are the low end of B-movies. The peep scene is from the movies of the most gratuitous nudist scenes I have ever seen (even in the movie). The script was probably a great 10-page outline, but when it comes to a feature film, there are more holes in it than the dead bodies it left behind. I must say that Hopper, dressed in a nice suit that controlled Hummer, had to laugh at me loudly, but I don't think it was the intention. Yes, there is a small style, and Hopper can always draw my interest. However, an interesting conspiracy concept never pays off and you remain wondering why you wasted time watching this.
