The story of this film is dangerously thin and only "star power" if we can call it consisting of Joe Estevez. I don't know what's more shocking. The fact that this movie was made, or the fact that some people actually gave good comments about it. If you ever see a video cover, you'll be able to read it. Someone even went so far as to say that the actress / writer could be the leading lady of the 1990s. Yeah! Joe Estevez could have more money than his brother Martin. If you want to look at it anyway I highly recommend watching the MTS version. At least you will laugh a lot without going crazy.
