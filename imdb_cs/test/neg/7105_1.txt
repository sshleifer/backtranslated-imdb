Maybe it's because I'm not a comic fan (but if the comics are the same "quality" as a movie, it's hard to believe there are any), but it must be one of the worst movies ever made. No conspiracy, ridiculous acting, stupid dialogue ... This movie is so bad it hurts. Many. That some people actually gave this 10/10 is an insult to some good or at least average (or at least bad) movie. If you hate, then watch Tank Girl! For another thought, if you hate having a lot, maybe you should commit suicide ... My rating: -34/10
