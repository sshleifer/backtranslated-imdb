That looks so good on paper - Matt Damon, Lawrence Fishbourne, Jean Reno, okay? And a $ 42 million robber - it sounds like a crime crime movie. Great disappointment - I assume that the stars got all the money because the production values ​​are miserable. But more than that a pseudo tank is an atmosphere when an easy crime goes wrong. It's a lot for TV stuff. All in all, unreal disappointment - that is the point that is for what it is - but loses it massively to be unpacked, not very interesting ...
