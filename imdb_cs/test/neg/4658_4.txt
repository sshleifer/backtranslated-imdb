I have to say that I had little expectations before I saw the movie. All the people in the neighborhood said it was great, but I knew perfectly what they liked. They like Aerosmith's song, which is really great, they like amazing special effects, they lived a lot, they like the movie comedy and of course many girls who love Affleck, which in my opinion is really a bad actor who didn't. be one, failed and now there is nothing. And all these things plus reviews and ratings that I read on the internet have given me a clue that the movie would be a huge disappointment because I'm a big catastrophic kind of movie fan. Well, I was right, but at least I was ready. The movie is really commercial. It has been said, but I will say it again. We have more than 100 million budgets, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors who are popular because they rarely agree to become part of a commercial movie cast unless their names are written with capital letters on the screen. Like Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi, who are highly respected actors, I also like a lot. They could play many characters in many different movies. They could improvise, they could turn the deadlines into jokes. Overall, small movies could turn into really interesting, funny or dramatic movies, people love and always love. Like Fargo in Buscemi's case or Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I'm really disappointed that they have attended Armageddon. Thornton plays a clever and refined person who is involved in politics if I remember well. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team that is sent to save the world by destroying an asteroid that is about to disappear. <br /> <br /> What I didn't like - well, I think I've already understood. I pointed out the wrong factors. The story is boring, formless and stupid. It is so obvious that the film depends on the effects and the dramatic end that is ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that could be considered art. At least it is not so obvious that the film is made for financial reasons. In addition, bad performances of all the giant stars. Jokes are not funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes do not make sense at all. In fact, I recently read that on the stage Ben Affleck asked Bay whether it would be easier if they were teaching astronauts to drill before the drills became astronauts and Bay's answer was simply "Shut up!" which is a really funny story that perfectly shows the despair of the creators. And when I conclude, I'll explain why I give 4 films to the movie. Well, I like "I don't want anything" and I was impressed by the special effects that are probably the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is unforgettable. These are the only two good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were 100 times better than Armageddon, which was and will always be one big bad movie.
