This show hates me (and many others) for their lives. Let's face it, Zoey is perfect; She is pretty pretty, gets good grades, everyone goes to her advice, is popular, goes to amazing school with amazing rooms. The reasons why I gave this show 3: 1. Playing is terrible. Sometimes I just want to hurt those people who put these unusual actresses on TV (especially Victoria Justice). 2. Characters are incredible and inconsistent. You have your typical favorite girl. A nice, shallow, stupid, stereotyped girl who is portrayed by a horrible actress. Then you have a typical guy who is somewhat normal and actually pretty. Then take a stereotypical clever girl who is crazy and of course does not fit in with her favorite favorite friends. Then a rich handsome boy was stuck, who would be happier looking in the mirror all day. Then she wants to be an actress played by another stinking actress. And the last ordinary guy. 3. The story is boring and lame. 4. I hate how these characters are spoiled. They can't just be normal! 5. Everything ends for them and we all reminded how much our lives stink.
