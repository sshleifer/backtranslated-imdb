A pretty forgetful monster movie from the 1950s has really horrible special effects - the "claw" in question is a giant puppet that Jim Henson would want to kill himself. I saw the movie last Thursday and I can't even tell who it was. That's a bad sign. I was told that when the film premiered, viewers laughed at him on the screen ... and that was in the 1950s, when the standards in special effects were much lower. Basically I had to go out of the theater once the words "produced by Sam Katzman" came on the screen when I knew what was good for me, but then I sat over "Harum Scarum" too, so I think I deserve it.
