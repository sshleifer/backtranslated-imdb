Ghost Story has an interesting feminist vengeance of the story, actor A-list veterans, color flashbacks with a clever young male counterpart. frightening staccato music announcing the upcoming horrors, the atmospheric atmosphere of New England in the winter and the outstanding charismatic actress in the title role. The story of Ghost Story could have been much more effective in a black and white environment and in removing some of the most complex special effects and presenting a stricter scenario (we shouldn't ask why there are two trailer parquets in the script). ) The biggest damage to the film is Craig Wassan (definitely separated from Bill Maher's birth), who is totally ineffective from maybe editing or just playing bad. It seems to be "specialized" in widescreen, wide-angle responses; It's not much of a personality. Revelation, however, is Alice Krige, a pale face, mysterious, scary under a quiet exterior. However, her Eva Galli is haunted even before she meets her fate; I mean a young woman who says things like, "I want to bite you" or "Dancing with me, you little toad!" it is no longer in the land of the living. Ghost Story would be much better in low key mode, Val Lewton. Excessive special effects have completely undermined the cooling factor.
