I just watched this movie with some friends who said I had to see it, but from the beginning I knew it would go from bad to worse. So I can only give this movie 1 because the effects used were so badly used to think that everyone can see that there are no "real" spirits. I feel the worst was this "old haunted house" that contained a lot of new things and some "comfortably placed things" that I could think of the effects that would look much better than a chair that was flipped by an invisible ghost (or say wire) ). Then later, when you review the tape chair flipping it flips in another way. Uh Oh that's a big mistake of continuity. If it were a really good movie, then they would catch it and all the other items of the "old house". This movie is like a rip off house on a haunted hill and the Blair Witch Project all rolled into one poorly thought out and assembled movie. I would be ashamed to put something wrong with the acting, effects and cheap video footage of the girls, and how comfortably the camera fits when something "paranormal" happens. This movie is an insult to the people who are there actually looking for ghosts and getting real shots on the tape.
