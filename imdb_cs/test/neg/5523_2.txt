Every year a company called Nu produces a couple of "action packed", "full tension" movies. This little nugget, called Shadowcaster III (Until I visited this site, wasn't a whole trilogy), is a great example of the good work the company does. Frank Zagarino is as average as ever and does a great job as an almost indestructible (?) Schizophrenic (??) android. I will not waste more words because I do not want to reveal an amazing plot and destroy you a few great laughs. Rating 2/10 (Revard for those hard-working workers) build this kind of garbage must be nervous.)
