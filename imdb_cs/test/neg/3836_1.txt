The worst movie I've ever seen. I still don't understand what Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen are going to do. Maybe they should pay the bills ... The best and iconic part happens during the flashback that brings us during World War II when the Nazi officer hides his Jewish wife. This is the beginning of the typical life of a serial killer! It seems to be directed in the early 1980s, but then a new beattle ... Amazing! This film was directed in 2001 ... I'm sure it took less than two weeks. I heard Dennis Hopper's wife asked for a divorce after seeing the picture and Michael Madsen's mother had a heart attack when the actor admitted he was a man under a yellow baseball hat. Pathetic!
