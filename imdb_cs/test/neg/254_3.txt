the usual disclaimer - movies that are harmless, bad, low budget, and stupid, I don't provide 1 stars, even if they deserve it. These movies are often funny and are rated 2-4 based on fun value - not as a representation of their exemplary cinematic art. This film fits perfectly into this model. It is a Mexican monster movie, riddled with voice description and extremely weak non-such special effects. Make-up isn't so bad, and acting is sometimes quite fun, but this movie is almost as stupid as Aliens vs. Predator and the script isn't half as slippery (Aliens vs. Predator can get 1 from me, but I want to see it again before I commit ). The storyline is ridiculous but deliciously convoluted. If you have read so far, you really need to know ... A group of remarkably unscientific scientists are the main characters. Most of them are heroes - something - but one is (of course) crazy and quite perverse. This crazy scientist devises a ridiculous nuclear robot (who looks a bit like a tin from a Oz wizard, but has a human face inexplicably placed inside his head). The Aztec mummy, discovered by the same "scientist" whose wife has become such an Aztec princess in her previous life (do not ask), is opposed to a robot for a great "top" of the battle scene alone is enough to be on the stack in the belly gave the most essential film watchman. <br /> <br /> For what's worth, given the budget and the utter stupidity of the script, it's a very fun, low budget movie. If you're in such a thing, go for it.
