So I caught it once in the afternoon as "What Lies Above" and actually watched him because the start was somewhat promising. The heroine, Diana Pennington, is an expert on mountaineering ... but that doesn't help her when her fiancé Brian gets hurt in the climb. When he goes to help and returns, he disappears from the mountain, he will never see again. Two years later, Diana is still a mountaineer ... but she doesn't go near a snowman Fold. This means that until Curt Seaver appears and tells her he can find the body of his lost fiancé with the new satellite program. They agree and they take off to the mountain with two Curt's assistants: Hugo's "bodyguard" and Tyler. From the very beginning, you know that a side motive is happening, but unfortunately it is not good and leads to a ridiculously bad chase of the program that makes up the last 20 or 30 minutes of the movie. The main disappointment is the red herring, most of which have supernatural undertones that they will never achieve. An object from heaven that has fallen into the mountains (which turns out to be not so supernatural), a story of how the Snowman's Pass came, and the most memorable of them: Diana dream sequence in the middle of the movie. But what disappointed me most is where they dropped the ball. Most of the film revolves around Brian's search, that's why I can't begin to understand for me why the secrets of what happened to him and where he was never solved during the movie. That was the main storyline. This is how the movie started! How will it NOT be packaged? <br /> <br /> I'd say too many people wouldn't bother with this problem ...
