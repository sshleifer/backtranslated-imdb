Hedy Lamarr, who could be held on screen by more men than any other actress, is again held by Kent Taylor, the playboy, and generally around the rat. On a Yucatan boat after Taylor gave her a brush, she tries to commit suicide. But Dr. Spencer Tracy saves her from drowning in the Caribbean. Tracy is pretty much all around a medical colleague. I think he never heard the word specialist. He leads a clinic in Manhattan for the poor and his journey has been a side part of medical research. Lamarr and he got married and she is trying to introduce him to her world and even becomes a partner of Dr. Louis Calhern. Of course Kent Taylor reenters the picture and Hollywood inevitable happens. Watching I Take This Woman seemed to me that writers were very influenced by Tracy's Oscar Victory Boys Town. Unfortunately, his role as Doctor Karl Decker is not a patch on what he did as Father Flanagan. Maybe they were trying to give Father Flanagan a bit of romance in his life in this movie, so to speak. Tracy and Lamarr didn't get too good. In fact, this film was dubbed I Retake This Woman because original director Joseph Von Sternberg left the movie, probably because Lamarr didn't work for him as Marlene Dietrich did. She made the Lady of the Tropics and then MGM returned to filming it with their contracting director Woody Van Dyke who was known for his production speed. And we've brought all the new support. Fortunately, both Spence and Hedy had a better position for both.
