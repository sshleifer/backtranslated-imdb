That must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. On the same level as Blair Witch and equally annoying. Flashing lights on the helmet made it difficult to see, and I think epileptics should take into account the moments when this film is even more annoying. I think if they were calmer, they would find their way out. Then, when you think a geek might come in trumps, he resorts to a nervous breakdown. Oh and when is the guy who has sex realized that when a girl says she can hear something. Really Hear Something. One of these guys must at least see Scream (where they draw your attention to such things). It's also a big break when the premise offers so many promises and then someone writes the script. So excuse the people I did on the weekly in the video store and I'd still like my money back.
