With a catchy name like Plainfield's butcher, this Ed Gein variation and Kane Hodder playing will undoubtedly fly off the shelves for a few weeks. Most viewers will get bored stupid with this latest take on the life of Ed Gien. The film focuses on Ed's rampage and gives us (a few) insights into his Psycosis and dwellings in the Plainfeild.Its these scenes that give the film a much needed jerk. <br /> <br /> What ruins this is the constant focus on other characters lives and less focuses on Eds.Big's mistake here. Kane Hodder is a special choice to play Gein, but he does pull it out quite well, and deserves more credit games before he gets these days.Prascilla Barnes and Micahel Barryman also show. <br /> <br /> 3/10
