NBC had a chance to make a mighty religious epic in the spirit of "The Ten Commandments" and "The Biggest Story That Was Ever Talked", and instead decided to make a half-hour cartoon that would be "Waterworld" than anything else. I do not remember the biblical passage where Lot turns into a pirate and attacks the ark, nor do I remember where Noah's son is developing a serious friendship with orange, nor do I remember that Noah is some crazy old loon who suddenly acts like him Naval Fleet Commander and running around screaming naval terms like "hoist up!" This was perhaps the worst marketing decision ever. Most people who follow it will obviously be Jewish and Christian parents with their children, so why does the film make such insulting on Earth for those people? If they deliberately try to offend, why not advertise like that and at least rewind the right audience? I hope that once he makes REAL Noah, he did one seriously and thoughtfully, one who really appeals to people and makes money. In the meantime, don't waste your time with this trash.
