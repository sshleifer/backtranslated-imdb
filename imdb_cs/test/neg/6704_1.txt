First and foremost, I am a homosexual, even though I do not live my life in the so-called "community" and it is because of films like this that gay movies are not my favorite genre because 90% of them are bullshit. Like this. I could give it a zero I want. (I don't understand all the positive comments, unless they were made by the people who made the movie) I actually stopped it in the 24-minute mark when the so-called "Anthony" kissed Adam outside the restaurant for no reason. And how does the son steal from the dining room if he doesn't live in the city? Bank transfers? Acting was HORRENDOUS! Sound Adjustment? (Listen to "Anthony" and Adam as he sits on the lunch fence. Every time the camera switches between two so-called actors, the sound will change as if the microphone's microphone wasn't) God forbid, buy this movie. story.
