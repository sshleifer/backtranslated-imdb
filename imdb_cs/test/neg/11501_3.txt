This is a good show that is neither the best nor the worst. I've been watching it for a long time and I don't like any new things. This show has turned into some teenage waste and lives a lot differently. I don't like that crap .. I don't have an IQ, why they completely changed the theme of this show. The first season was really fun and was somewhat fun. The second season is stupid from this world. I don't really know why writers / directors have changed this show. many more people liked the first season better than 2nd and 3rd place. I'll just watch the first season of this show from now on whenever I see a new episode, you wrongly change the channel. It gets 3/10 because I enjoyed the first season a bit, but hated 2nd and 3rd.
