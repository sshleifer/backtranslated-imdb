Northanger Abbey is not my favorite novel, Jane Austen, but she has a charm. This movie is not. He has some of the same character names as the book, but the story is drastically altered, and the sweetest man in all of Austin, Canada (unless Emma Mr. Knightley gets pride of place) is thought to be a heartless and mercenary. One or two wholly foreign characters are introduced, and a tangible air of corset perversion hangs over it. I was so disappointed when I first saw him in 1986; Even today she has placed high on the list of films that shame the books on which they are based. Even Robert Hardy's fans should give it a wide bed. He has nothing and I think N-O-T-H-I-N-G to recommend.
