Many consider Stu Ungar the greatest poker / gin player of all time - the extraordinary self-destructive power of nature - a tiny figure, but a huge heart for the game. <br /> <br /> What we have here is a kind of Hallmark movie about the danger of gambling. Sure, he wins, loses, throws him out for sex, drugs and other gambling we get, but where is the real game - where is what made him the biggest card player ever. Too Flat and Honestly Boring in Places, It Gets Four Because We Learn Something About Stu Man, But Stu Card Player, Nada. <br /> <br /> Nicely shot and presented to the point is a perfect example of how to make movies about cards: frankly, the ESPN World Series coverage is more traceable than this. Wasting a big chance.
