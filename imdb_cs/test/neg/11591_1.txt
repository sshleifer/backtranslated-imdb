Komodo vs. Cobra begins as 'One Planet' environmentalist Jerry Ryan (Ryan McTavish) & his girlfriend Carrie (Renee Talbert) hire Captain Michael Stoddard (executive producer Michael Paré) to take them to the South Pacific island, first at Stoddard. reluctant because the island is a top-secret military research base, but it will soon change its mind when a sum of money is offered. Along with a television news reporter Sandra Crescent (Jeri Manthey), they sailed to the island and once found on the shore that the army was funding illegal DNA genetic experiments that resulted in huge Komodo dragon and cobra kings that ate almost all other living things. there and Stoddard & what else are on offer ... <br /> <br /> Co-wrote and directed by the ever terrible Jim Wynorski under his pseudonym Jay Andrews it is just awful, it is just hard to sit over & is even worse than the usual garbage 'Creature features' Sci-Fi channel have nerves in the air if possible. The scenario is horrible, predictable and totally boring, some giant monsters of some kind are being created by scientists arguing with DNA, a group of people trapped with those monsters and trying to escape when they are eaten. That's it, that's the whole story of Komodo vs. Cobra, maybe it was trying to break AVP: Alien vs. Predator (2004) with title, but all 'vs.' the bit equals thirty seconds of garbage between the two titular animals at the very end, boredom as hell, and certainly a great disappointment for anyone hoping to have a mash full. The character is poor, the dialogue is horrible, the pace is slow, the story is predictable, and cliché rides and the whole movie is really fun with a lazy scenario that states that Komodo Dragon and Cobra are amphibious that are not. Hell, Komodo vs. Cobra isn't even worth looking at inadvertent laughter because it's so boring and hardly anything, even though the sight of a woman hiding behind the smallest rock on the beach by Cobra is pretty funny for the wrong reasons. How does Wynorski still try to manage work? He is probably consistently the worst director who is currently working, how can he still enjoy sounding movies in beautiful places with half decent casts and still spew such a horrible movie? I think this was shortened to get PG or TV because every time someone swears he's masked by a parrot! There's zero gore or violence and the monster scenes are flabby, people just stand there, monsters just sort of stalls out there too hissing or roaring & that's about it. CGI computer effects are terrible, that's really poor things that just look awful. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 450,000 it looks as cheap as it was, Hawaiian sites are nice to look at, but that's about it. Acting is bad from an uninteresting looking cast. Komodo vs. Komodo Cobra is a totally terrible Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' by Jim Wynorsky, the movies are not much worse than this.
