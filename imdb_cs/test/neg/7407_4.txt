* This comment may technically contain "spoilers," but it certainly does not contain a surprise. Unfortunately we didn't get too much laughter and we certainly didn't get too much fear. Fence Outline: A plane containing a daughter of a company head and some strange piece of technology in a fall area where our furry friend lives, so a leading company assembles a team of celebrities rather than qualified hunters to restore it. <br /> <br /> Things get bored during the first 3/4 of the movies. Mostly they are Big Foot shots that lurk in trees, where party members sometimes hear and pass them like nothing. We also see a few shots of the page through the Big Foot view and he obviously sees in thermal vision. <br /> <br /> To set the storyline, we must follow the sequence of the group sitting around the campfire to talk about the possibilities of justifying the existence and activities of the sasquatches. "Maybe he can avoid bullets ... when they see them coming." Sure, let's see it can. "There are many unexplored countries in which sasquatch could live. Maybe it's one of them that has been overlooked." And of course it is. "Maybe Sasquatch is upset because the plane hit one of his family members." And that is true. Along with these scenes, there is a couple of "Oh my God his sasquatch oh just waiting for you!" Scenes, and unfortunately, they are among the scariest. Then finally, people start dying. At least 2 people. In addition, the bodies of past victims are discovered. The death scenes are lame enough. Mostly it leaves our imagination by showing that Sasquatch has grabbed them, then sliced ​​into another scene, but first we've treated them with some horrible camera shouts. Finally, we get to see the main protagonist of the showdown with the monster. I have to admit, it took quite exciting. But unfortunately, it is quite short lived, and after we are treated to the end, which makes half assed efforts seem mysterious. Then some final text with somewhat boring conclusion. <br /> <br /> I can't say I recommend this movie. It's not bad enough to give Mystery Science Theater 3000, and it's definitely not that scary and boring to enjoy as a horror movie. Just don't bother.
