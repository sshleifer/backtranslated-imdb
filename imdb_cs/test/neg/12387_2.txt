I have not read this book and do not bother on the basis of this adaptation. I hated all the characters in this show - Miranda was slimy, selfish and mumbled miserably in a frightening dialogue, her sister was utterly shocked, and it was the worst depiction of a manic depression I had ever seen. I have a psychology diploma and it wasn't accurate. In fact, until it was mentioned, I didn't realize that Troy was supposed to be bipolar - I thought he was a normal, somewhat grumpy teenager. The only saving grace in this stupid show was David Tennant, whose brilliantly psychotic performance was the only thing that made me watch the other half. Obviously, writers and producers of this show have not done any research - Troy's mental problems are not remotely accurate, nor are they forensics involved in a "twist" end (and if you haven't found that miles away, you're big ole dummy!) <br /> <br /> Utter Garbage.
