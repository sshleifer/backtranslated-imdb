After seeing the film, I feel that father and mother are both sensible people, though not perfect at all. On the contrary, I do not like the author and his two sisters. Is a personal magazine the right portrait of myself? Most of the time people just write problems to their diary because they want to fix the problem. So the magazine is always the more negative side of the person. In this film, the author reviews his mother's life with his magazine. Not a wise choice. The author's older sister is so ugly, outside and inside. First she said her father's second marriage was "not fair" to her mother. Then she said she didn't love her mother. So he doesn't love either father or mother. I doubt he loves anyone in the world. Her face is so ugly, just a reflection of her heart. I feel the film, I feel that the author and his sisters are a lack of love and respect for their parents. However, I feel that a father's mother is very loving to their children, even though the author tries to portray himself as a cold, deceptive person.
