"Tokyo Eyes" tells a 17-year-old Japanese girl who looks like a man who is fed by her big buddy who is a cop. This lame film is about 50% fill and 50% talk, talk and talk. You get to see less than three star casts when talking on the bus, talking and playing video games, talking and staring, talking and walking and walking and talking, talking on cell phones, hanging up and talking, etc. when you read headlines waiting for something to happen. The thin stream of the story is not enough to support a film with low production value, humble cast and no action, no romance, no sex or nudity, no heavy drama ... just a constant yadayadayada'ing.
