To judge a film just for landscapes, decorations, costumes .... it's just not right, you miss the core: STORY <br /> <br /> The film has to tell something, tell the story will impress you. Yes, I was pleased with the sea, the cliffs, the clear water and everything, but ... Is there a conspiracy? These are more interesting movies with freaks, such as: LET'S CUCKOO "WITH NEST ... etc. Etc. This is about a crazy woman who is more attached to dogs than about her children or his husband "Just a clear psychiatric case !!!! Nothing special. Is there anything that came out of it?"
