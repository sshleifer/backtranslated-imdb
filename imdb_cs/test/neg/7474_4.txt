... recommendations! Gloria Grahame runs a kind of orphanage where the discipline spreads with a meat cleaver, orphans are hung on meat hooks to punish them, and bodies are kept in deep frost so that they can be brought out when social service calls. That an orphanage is attached to the money we know because Gloria puts all orphans on the job, and also because there is not enough clothing to go around - especially for older orphans (the age range seems to be 12 - 30 years). ish). However, the new arrival will prove to be more than just a match for Gloria - and she really married her own mother and mother (in a funny hammer and arson opening scene). Gloria ends up predictably on a meat hook. This one was made for tuppence, but it was / is a huge huge hit on the grindhouse circuit. My DVD cover promised "disturbing and politically incorrect scenes" and it certainly wasn't lying. I believe he is considered a citizen of Kane from a children's home set of torture porn movies. 4/10
