* Spoilers forward, but it shouldn't matter because I hope you're used to seeing this as well * <br /> <br /> If you plan to see this I must strongly advise you. Because it was one of the most wasted 1Â½ hours I've experienced. First, this is the complete rip-off of the big movie "Battle Royale". It's as stupid as looking at some lame American TV show like "Cops" or "Candid Camera". The chart is quite predictable. One of the callers who is pregnant and the other is a nurse, anyone who does some logical thinking understands at the beginning what should happen between those. This concept is torn apart, as mentioned earlier, and the film lacks the violence necessary to make this film enjoyable. I think preggo is shooting a guy in the back and no blood, no trace of a hit in the back. <br /> <br /> I could go forever without finding anything about it, so take your money and get a copy of the Battle Royale instead of watching this piece of crap. <br /> <br /> 1 out of 10, too bad, I couldn't rate it lower. Almost makes Scream 3 a masterpiece.
