You have seen the same tired, worn clich√©s, stories, characters, stories 1000 times before it only sucks more than others. First of all, there is no single character in the show that would be remotely likeable ... especially Michael Rapaport. Dave Gold is by far one of the biggest donkeys ever to have a TV screen ... nasty. If his father had been in real life, it was relentless, cruel and unjustly unsuitable for his parents. To call the remaining characters stereotypes would be too complementary. If these signs end up supporting life, the line that would have pulled out the plug would be long. As this show ended in one complete season, much less 2 is a mystery. FOX will cancel "Arrested Development" and keep it in the air ??? Tell me the terrorists don't win.
