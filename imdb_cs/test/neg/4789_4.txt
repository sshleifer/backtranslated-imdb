I agree with the comments regarding the downward rotation. The last show was a bit better, but writers certainly need another direction. I think the characters are still interesting, though sometimes they turn into "white waste" things too much. Subtlety and nuances go far beyond exhibitions like "Office". I think the target audience is somewhat similar to being at the same night and lineup. One would think that Karma and the whole Eastern thing of religion are big enough to bring some other interesting and interesting programs, but only scratch the surface of the subject. In my opinion, it shows contempt that many people in Hollywood have the intelligence of the masses. We can handle intoxicating content. It has been proven earlier in many other exhibitions.
