I actually saw a movie before I read the book. When I saw the movie, I was upset because I was wondering why Dean Koontz made such a bad book / movie. The film was confusing and had no flow at all, it was jerky and made me throw a stone on TV. I couldn't connect with the characters at all, so I didn't care about what happened to them (I usually love characters because I could relate to their personality or problems). Then I read the book and loved it. I often read a book and the film collects dust. I wish someone had made Koontz's film to watch his book plot, and the movies wouldn't feel so much. DO NOT SHOW THIS FILM YOU DON'T NEED TO EXPOSE MONEY!
