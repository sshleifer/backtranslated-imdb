I really enjoy this genre, but The Cell was one of the worst movies I ever watched. While about 25 percent of my viewer wandered in and out of the theater while watching (or completely left), I was stupid enough to endure it. The main problems with this story (there were too many to be all mentioned) is that with this type of movie you have to do two things ... one, give the fear of the killer (it's twenty minutes into the movie, who's gone) and you have to give the victim whose life is at stake (a girl in a tank) enough to develop characters that you really care about, whether they get to her in time or not. Not only did I lose track of the girl, I was a little peeked into her that she was just a blurry face, and when I remembered she was part of the story, I really don't care what happened to her. While the visuals were interesting in LSD-type flashbacks, it often didn't make sense, and it should be a lesson that visuals can't replace the lack of a good story (see Phantom Menace for another example) they knew or cared about what was with women kneeling in this field and staring at the sky? Ridiculous.
