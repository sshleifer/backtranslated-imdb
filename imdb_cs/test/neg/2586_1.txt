I saw this movie last night and came online to see if others thought it was as bad as I did. you are one of those people, fine - good luck. But I'm a patient. Before that I enjoyed extremely long movies. But this was torture for me. I honestly felt that it was one of those films that I have nothing to say about, and that it was more about style than about substance - but about style, too, I felt I was cutting my hair . Almost anything interesting in the course of the movie becomes OFF-SCREEN. It's like a deliberate attempt to make a film out of the outtakes - pieces that would usually be reserved for the deleted scenes section of the DVD if they were shown to the public at all. nor will you finally learn about the main character Francois. I had no sympathy for any of the characters in this film, except perhaps the violinist and his goat, and the old man who believes the octopuses live at 300 because they're really smart. Seriously, I was excited when he shot a shot of Francois holding the gun on his head. I felt so torn when his inevitable suicide turned out to be boring. And where was the editor? Also smoking opium? I swear, I almost screamed every time I was exposed to a vast shot of absolutely nothing going on except that maybe someone stepped back and forth, and then finally a very sudden cut to the next scene, and that would be a year later. , and we have thwarted all the interesting things that happened in MEANTIME, and they were all STILL wearing the same clothing garments ....!!!!! ??? So finally, if you liked it - great. However, this overview is intended to be an antidote to flamingos, "you will love this movie if you like film", which I have seen published here and elsewhere. (I saw? I hated the movie and I put a cunning link on it!)
