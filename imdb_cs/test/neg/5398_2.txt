It may include *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Where to start on this particular wasteland? It would be nice if they actually had a plot. Talent behavior, decent dialogue, tension, humor, hey, even gratuitous sex would help this film. Unfortunately, there was only a lot of gore, (though not doing well), shooting automatic weapons and missing. Protect the trunk bodies he murdered, and his team was followed by a team of the Federal Special Team who dressed in civilians (?). Most of the time it was a violation of one of the basic rules of conduct in the movie Horror, separating from the group, so you can be picked up one by one. Do you think this team would know better, especially since they are actually the third team being investigated, the other two teams will disappear without a trace. When they finally realize they are picked up, they make one of several stalls and shoot weapons just to hit the trees. The tree scene repeats endlessly in this film to save money. When they do not shoot trees, they watch this spirit, which leaves no trace (who knows how to watch it), and splashes a lot of macho BS. By the way, I mentioned that most of this team are women? Interesting listening speaks hard to them. It's not very fun, but interesting. <br /> <br /> All in all, you can find better movies in a convenient Kmart basket.
