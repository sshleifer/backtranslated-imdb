At first I thought this little fantasy excursion would be a little fun. I was wrong. Good cast (Roy Scheider as president) didn't help him. The story had every possible worst-case scenario that could happen in a terrorist nuclear disaster. And none of this could happen! Truth - President kidnapping could only be accomplished with internal help from a traitor in the secret service (ala Air Force One), but all they depicted about FOOTBALL and the helplessness of our country if he fell into enemy hands is ridiculous to the Nth degree. Seriously, neither the president can fully control our missile control. The case is only used to transfer orders. In this situation our system would completely erase the codes and the whole thing would not go anywhere. The destruction of Beijing could not happen - there would be no rocket launch because the silo crews would be instructed not to (include the hardware system). There are only too many safe guards to prevent such things. It is true that film like FAIL-SAFE and STRANGELOVE has given some credibility to the concept of losing control of SYSTEM. But this movie goes too far and doesn't stop my incredible concept. And that makes the experience a loss of viewer time. This movie is a failure.
