As a big fan of the latest fantasy movies, I really enjoyed it. I was not familiar with the character, although after hearing some general stories about comic book style and good movie reviews, I thought I was in a real treat ... <br /> <br /> Ever since the lead character started talking in her forced stupid voice, I could just say that I wouldn't like this movie. I found that the story is weak and predictable, the actors poor, the effects were very good for a small movie budget, but did nothing for a total plot. Maybe as a comic book fan, you can get a little more out of it, or I'd suggest you skip it and not waste your movie fare on this boring adventure.
