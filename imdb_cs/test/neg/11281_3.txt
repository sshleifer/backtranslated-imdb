This very loose story begins with a high note with a smoldering, sexually sincere dance between Senagles' prisoner "Karmen" and her female overseer, but live opening minutes will never ignite into any coherent film. One minute Karmen is the whole sexual predator, another is dancing in protest against his unjust government, and then he is suddenly a high seas smuggler ... Although the film deserves recognition for postulating the first carnivorous bisexual Karmen, the wide strokes he paints are so vignette -such as unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes as a schizophrenic, undisciplined melange "Basic-Instinct" meets "Bound" meets the African version of the Bollywood musical.
