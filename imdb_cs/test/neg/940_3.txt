With this movie I wasn't so overwhelmed that I found it quite tedious and simple. The plot line was interesting, the child created his own college and enrolled hundreds of children. The jokes weren't really funny and I didn't hurt any of the scenes. The characters weren't interesting and I didn't feel at them, not even dawks, a fat kid with glasses trying to join the frat group. It was a good first watch, but it didn't blow off and its not, which I would recommend. Comparing it to other movies in the same genre, ie American Pie is just cruel because there is a movie that was laugh-and-plenty. This ACCEPTED couldn't wake a smile!
