There have been many 'haunted' westerns made in the 30s and early 40s, and although this has a strong beginning, it is not one. Randy Bowers (John Wayne), who stopped at "Halfway House", finds herself dead bodies, a bartender's corpse that has changed over a bar holding a gun, eyes watching Randy from behind her eyes, and piano player plays "the most beautiful night of the year." It was the result of Marvin Black's robbery to get Ed Rogers' $ 30,000. Randy is an investigator who "works alone", wasting little time in arresting, escaping (with the help of Ed's daughter Sally) and literally landing in the middle of the Black Gang hiding behind the waterfall. Everything moves quite quickly. Just one too much chase after Randy slow down. We even got George Hayes, clean shaved and playing two parts - Marvin Black, the craziest villain, as well as a good citizen, Matt Mute, who communicates by hand. Having him play two opposite roles was a good idea, but writing a thing thing gets old really fast, even for him, as he finally gives up doing it near the end says Sally: "Oh, I am enough of that with this one! " In "The Lost City" (1934), you can find George playing in a vile, ugly, double thief thief. I think this is the only movie "Lone Star" whose title refers to or is mentioned in the movie! Sally offers Randy a hand and says, "He's not alone!" Then they cut themselves around as they looked toward the lake. Sally runs away with Randy, seems to be too sudden and unprepared. Too much time spent on the sheriff's horse run. It's not so bad to consider everything, but not that big. I'd really give him four and a half.
