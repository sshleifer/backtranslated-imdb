What is the point? Wasn't that earlier, better? And again? Why does Werner Herzog waste his good talent and time with such waste? Shouldn't he shoot a movie somewhere - I mean a real movie? It was all false from the beginning. Werner Herzog would never try to make a film about the myth of Loch Ness - at least not on such a small scale surrounded by losers - so the plot was not credible from the beginning. Actors who were supposed to act as if they were not actors were obviously actors. The story was not interesting, "everyday people" needed in every mockumentary were invisible, celebrities were outdated, jokes were not funny, effects were not convincing and the end was nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> I just don't see it. It's a fake movie about a fake movie. Hah, hah. Maybe if those who came up with such a film tried to do one that would ridicule people who really were to find a real Nessie that could have some potential. But Herzog is not a believer and has never claimed to be. Mockumentary about the cryptozoologist crowd would have much more fuel. She was a lady.
