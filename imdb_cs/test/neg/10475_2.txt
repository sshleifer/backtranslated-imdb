This film was not very well directed. They almost overlooked the book. I think they were trying to save time. The only thing up 2 was that the actor who played the final was cute. Some of the main character dialogues looked a little gay, which wasn't in the book. The main parts of the book were cut again. You've lost an excessive effect that wasn't as scary as a book and left me very seriously. Also, a strong language, though brief, was very pointless. I was also surprised (not pleasantly) by a new character who wasn't in the book. One of my favorite characters (leper) was misinterpreted and portrayed. He seemed to be somewhat more sinister in the film than the real leper in the book. Despite all the disappointments.
