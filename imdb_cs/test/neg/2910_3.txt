Following World War II Japanese attack on US forces at Pearl Harbor, "Children of the East": Leo Gorcey (as Muggs), Bobby Jordan (as Danny Connors), Huntz Hall (as Glimpy), David Gorcey (as Peewee), Ernest \ t Morrison (as Scruno) and Bobby Stone (as Skinny) want to serve their country. But the US military and navy are rejecting them as too young. "Boys" who want to "go about a million Japanese" are attacking an Asian official who turns out to be Chinese. The unfortunate incident, however, leads the gang to help reveal some nasty Japanese and German. If "too young" is defined as "less than twenty-one", only Mr. Jordan and Mr. Stone would be rejected for military service. But it is possible that the recruiters were turned off by the office procedures displayed by Mr. Gorcey and Mr. Hall. "Let's get hard!" it was created when it accurately describes the scenario as an "open season on the Japanese" - for this and other reasons it didn't get well. It is an unnecessary effort, but they regularly perform stupidly when Tom Brown moves the story, just like a Jordanian spy brother. <br /> <br /> *** Let's get stiff! (5/29/42) Wallace Fox ~ Leo Gorcey, Bobby Jordan, Tom Brown
