This is a really spectacular bad movie, but it's a rare kind of badness that is endlessly, jaw-droppingly fun! I want to add more comments on this movie. "Rock band" on the plane looks like three skinny drunks from casual work wearing bad wigs. Watch a serious problem of continuity with a baby stuffed tiger: it turns into a lion, a leopard, and back again; It's dirty or clean depending on the shot. <br /> <br /> SPOILER! A stuffed tiger turns into a real beast to save the baby (and writers)! A look at the little Jimmy floating over the Amazon in the coffin, clutching his stuffed tiger and pulling it away will keep it permanently in memory. Listen to one of the most unfavorable sound effects: late in the story of a priest on his way to Jimmy, the guide asks his monk's cloak to pay - the priest falls to one knee at the moment of resigned meditation and the bell sound , not a deep "BONNNNG" church, but a "ding" bell from a boxing match! <br /> <br /> This is a sheer kick to watch.
