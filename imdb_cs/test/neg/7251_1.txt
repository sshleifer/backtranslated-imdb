While my exposure to world cultures is limited, I try. It was a movie I tried and hated. Worst of all, after listening to so many people, they refused the superficiality of a typical Hollywood fare and its stereotypical cartoons; and he wants to be a waiter. I always say. Brad Dorif, or his fax photo, or a pretty curly wig on his wand, was hard to say to offer Clint rental if he got his shoes. Clint, and an enormous escort, apparently wanders across England and tries to get some shoes. Eventually he ends up in a suburban home. Whose is not clear. Mom helps the girl to shoot. Now there is some realism for you! Mrs. Brady could have been a ridiculous stereotype of American housewives, but she had never helped Mars bind and find a vein. Good God! Dad comes home and sings several Elvis melodies and then chases them. Why did Clint not borrow some money and buy shoes in a second hand shop? Why didn't he go to church and ask a kind nun for help? Why didn't he appear before the shoe and hoop shop? Just don't know! None of these things seemed to be under him. Charity groups like Goodwill and Salvation Army have stores that help people. I know the people who work there! If someone who has no money discovered and needed shoes, they would give the workers some shoes. Maybe not Prada or Gucci, but some form of foot covering. Not many of these groups hand out mobile phones to disadvantaged people, but shoes are usually not a problem. What a stupid concept. The world, or at least its western part, is simply not so cruel. In England, maybe it's from the "Royal Royal Charity" rather than Goodwill, but the people who need shoes get them. <br /> <br /> In addition to finding shoes, there was no discreet plot to get in the way of action. Not that it made the movie any faster or bearable, you think. Despite the fact that I checked the cassette jacket several times, I didn't see a 20-hour extended version, it just seemed so. Did Clint Get Shoes? Did you hire a cardboard cutout of Brad Dourif at the restaurant? Have I ever watched anything else? <br /> <br /> [spoiler] Yes, yes and yes. <br /> <br /> As for the fate of this movie, I decided to end it All. I took out S&W .45 and fired a half inch hole through the cartridge. Blammo! (I made sure I would have to rewind it first.) I put it back in my sleeve, returned it to the rental shop, and HAVE NOT ARE HOW TO HAVE ANYTHING FOR IT !!! Which, of course, means no one else rented him for at least the remaining three years I lived in this city. Others knew something I didn't do. Live and learn. BTW, if you rent something you've never seen before and someone actually put a bullet in it, take it as a sign. And if you're working on Kroger videos, I'm kidding. Note: This classic has not yet seen the light on a DVD that we should be eternally grateful to digital gods. .
