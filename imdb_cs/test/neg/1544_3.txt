It is hard to believe that director Barbet Schroeder once made a majestic and very humorous Maitresse (1976), and now he seems to be doing it "by numbers" of Hollywood thrillers. This is a very lightweight material by John Grisham, crossed with the TV movie. Bullock is Cass Mayweather, a feisty and independent crime investigator specializing in serial killers. Ben Chaplin is her reserved police partner, Sam Kennedy, and together they make an unpleasant duo. It's not good if two unbalanced college maladriots (Gosling and Pitt) decide to send them to a wild goose chase - by launching very clever and misleading forensic evidence at the scene. Sufficient, but at the same time Bullock and Chaplin can't create any sparks, we also have to endure a few boring overly melodramatic flashes that illustrate an important event in Cass's history. Of course there are frequent footage of a log cabin where the OTT is undoubtedly set to end. Oooh ... atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Watch all CSI episodes. It's in place and much exciting.
