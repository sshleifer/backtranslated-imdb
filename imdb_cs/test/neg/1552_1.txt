I rented this smelly only because of his relatively high rating. It's completely sucked! I can't imagine how anyone would consider it a good movie - even an OK movie. None of the characters had any qualities. To varying degrees, they were all selfish and witty - or abused and damaged personalities who had no idea of ​​the spirit of Christmas (when it happens!) I know Canadians and I like them - but I can't think they think that it's a good movie. I'd rather stick sharply in my eyes than watch this insulting movie again. Colossal loss of time and money. Do not believe who wrote the opinion that it was "worth watching." This person would probably like that dentist drilling his teeth without anesthesia, too. I don't want to be insensitive, but for my life I can't imagine what this person thinks. If they didn't have side motives. Maybe he was a director or producer. If so, I'd like to ask them to give me the money back. If your money is important to you - save it instead of renting it - or rent something (something!) Otherwise. I'm getting good reasons not to hire this movie. If I was Canadian, I would ASHAMED that it was supposed to be a favorite Canadian movie. If so, I would say that those who think it are definitely in need of a great deal of effective medication. NECK!
