This film was physically painful to sit, perhaps because (like many people of my age and younger) I grew up with Dr. Seuss and loved his books - funny, clever, whimsical and subversive at the same time. "Cat in the hat" sucks in all the interest and sparkle of the story and Mike Myer's performance as a cat is mostly overwhelming. Why Borscht Belt accent, indecent patter, inappropriate jokes, awkward costume? I had to go back and read the books again to see the real problem: the books are SIMPLE. This movie is OVERBLOWN and way too long. You don't expect each child's movie to be Toy Story or The Iron Giant, but this is a new minimum. How could Mike Myers need the money?
