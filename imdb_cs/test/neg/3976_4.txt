In fact, the film wasn't that bad, especially the plot, but the actor he chose for the lead role was a bit chintzy in the acting department. I'd choose someone else. The idea of ​​"going to America" ​​was very sophisticated, and the main character who questioned everything he had ever known made him somewhat likeable, but not so much when there was a pasty blob for the lead actor. The story was interesting. It raises the question of how the subject of cloning will be addressed in the future. Certainly cloning would not be allowed for film purposes, but it is still a valid argument today. Clones are still people ... right? The film was not particularly special, but it is still much better than some cheeses released in the 1970s. Let's not forget the giant spider invasion. I give it 4 because it wasn't completely stinking, but the MST3K version does this movie 10. (I still like Dr. Super Mario!) This movie will make you enjoy it, but it won't be your favorite.
