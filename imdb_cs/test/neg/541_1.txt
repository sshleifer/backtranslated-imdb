This ultra-low budget kitchen sink is a type of film that can only be produced in the UK in that anywhere else in the world, the fact that the market will have to exist before green light is given. Most likely, self-financing is an unequivocal attempt to remedy important issues, but ultimately undermines its existence in that the question must be enforced, who would ever give money to distribute it, and secondly, if viewers do not exist to watch, buy or rent this movie, why would anyone bother first? My opinions may seem unjustly cruel for the first time to the director, but that is the kind of film that only undermines commercial viability and quality standards that have only retained the existence of the British film industry.
