After the movie, and after Surya marked the film as PATH-BREAKING, I went to the theater and was expecting something big. The boy was disappointed. First, characterization in the film is so special! Which woman would do what Kundhavi (Jyothika) did? Idiotic, coo-coo? And what was the point of her position in the rain with her baby (Baby Shreya) after her husband and her husband? What was the purpose of the scene? To start vulgarly shoot "Maaja Maaja"? Not only was the song not aesthetically conserved, but it wasn't necessary in the script. DO NOT NEED ALL! Second, the first half had virtually no story. The first half was dragged. Each scene in the first half of the film had no meaning what had become the true story of the film. Also, how did Aishwarya (Bhoomika Chawla) change so radically? And both Gautham (Surya) and Kundhavi had a happy life together after six years, even though they were so unhappy that they got married? And if Gautham loves Aishwarya, as he said yes, why did he even marry Kundhavi, though it was his uncle's death wish? WHY? This is the question you are asking while watching a movie! And how fair is the end of Aishwarya? After all, was Gautham's first wife? The director of the film, Krsna, claimed that he had been working on this film for two years, but his script is filled with gaps and the audience is completely irritated! Third, Krsna's non-imaginative painting by Rahman's amazing is only disappointing. Surprisingly, Anthony's editing (usually excellent) for "New York Nagaram" just gets angry! The whole song looked like it was a presentation on Microsoft Power Point! "Munbe Vaa" The Rangoli Choir was wasted by showing Gautham PLAYING THE FOOTBALL !!! Who wants to see such a crazy dude playing football in such a beautiful choir?!? What's more, the whole film needed only two songs. Munbe Vaa and Kummi Adi. The rest of the songs including "Machakari", "Maaja Maaja", "New York" and "Jillun Oru Kaadhal" just isn't needed. Rahman's gentle effort is simply pointless on a silly amateur film! Fans from Rahman are asking why Rahman is still moving to Bollywood. Looking at the way his songs are shown in Kollywood, why would he want to stay here? What is more irritating is that after Kšṣṇa decided to include Machakari in the film, the song was shortened by half, which really, really bothered. and packaging in such a powerful design. His expressions in all the songs he was indeed on do not really fit the way a singer sings songs. Was Jyothika even in the movie? All she did was CRY! Would you say anything weeping? One of her worst performances ever! What's more, her new hairstyle doesn't suit her. She looked better in Vettaiyaad Vilaiyaad. Her costumes during the song "New York Nagaram" are gone. Bhoomika Chawla is simply amazing during the movie and she manages her role. Vadivelu's comedy is ANOYING. When someone watches him, he wishes they could hit him on the face. It is Santhanam, who is a showman in comedy scenes. And why did Sukanya even agree to make such a tiny role that anyone could do? And why is it so difficult to have perfect skin? Hudba A.R. Rahman is just amazing. Special mention is made of "Machakari", "Munbe Vaa", "New York" and "Jillunu Oru Kaadhal". R.D. Rajasekhar's cinematography is fine and not as good as his previous films, although the scene during "Kummi Adi" deserves special mention. Anthony's editing is really disappointing. The film is just crazy and can be cut. Kšṣṇa's direction just sucks. Dialogues (A.C. Durai and Krishna) are simply too ominous to spend especially the part where Bhoomika professes her love for Surya. The scenario and script (Krishna) are terrible. The film is moving at an increasingly uninteresting pace. And Krishna's script is just filled with inexplicable parcels. And for the good, why was there so much advertising in the movie? Pepsi, Maggi, Suzuki, you name it. Was the producer of the film (K.E. Gnanavel) low-budget or desperate? Overall, Jillunu Oru Kaadhal is a wet squib. With such a title, a love story could be expected to please hearts and cool, but what you end up is a painfully botched love story. Really, really disappointing.
