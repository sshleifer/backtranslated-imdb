There is nothing but ghost or evil in this film. It's just so boring. Dull is a photograph - the film store looks old and faded and washed out. Maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm, no. Dull is a script that is boring and 'Jules Pfeiffer'-ish. This is a kind of boss-nova cocktail party in the sixties. Like our beatnik grandparents, they could talk if they tried to look really straight. The "slice of life" characters were mostly unpleasant. True, they were real to life, but hey, if I wanted to see really ordinary people doing truly ordinary and ordinary things, I would just look at myself. I wouldn't catch all the way down to the cinema and blow up five quid, and in the evening, watch someone else do. <br /> <br /> I was expecting a funny, bright rom-com. What I got was what two intelligent and slightly talented 19 or 20 airmen could make on the first day with a new camcorder. <br /> <br /> I gave it 4 out of 10 because someone tried.
