I don't understand what it's hard to beat about this movie! I don't understand why high school kids should watch it! I don't understand why it should bring me to think about something in the least! <br /> <br /> * Spoiler * <br /> <br /> When an unseen girl is on her way to suicide, was I the only person who cheered her? The clichés of classical music, the long tracking footage, the melancholy emotions of the film have turned me at this stage to what was intended. I would be happy if she went into the room and the whole cast was where the scissors would be held to cut their wrists. Why? Because I went to high school ... and to be honest, I'm sick to death when I saw a movie after a film in Australia with teenagers in it, based solely on horrible clichés. I waited for the younger person to write a film that could be covered by this stereotypical piece of emo garbage I received instead. It was like a dark version of the heart that needed a predictable end. Why are all teenagers in the Aussie drama depressed or have truly strange problems that just aren't credibly said? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, it was more fun than Blurred. I needed a good laugh.
