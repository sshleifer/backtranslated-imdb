(HR is what Himesh calls in the movie, I think he also likes it.) It's amazing how intelligent people, talented even fall into the same trap. <br /> <br /> I really like Reshamiya. It's amazing what he did. Nobody in recent years has returned from the wild and made a mark for himself. And I really expected a great movie (What about a 50 Cr budget and a cute actress). As I thought, as intense as Reshamiya would excel in the sentimental and emotional role. Ironically, it is depicted as well, but what care? Pure incompetence, carelessness, horrible action, background banal music, insensitive direction make her real pain. (Example: How can the German police issue public instructions to a loud speaker in English? They communicate with each other in English!) Unfortunately, this incompetence has become a standard in Bollywood's mainline. There are some excellent directors, but many bad too. The worst part is that most don't care. <br /> <br /> Songs are the only salvation ... <br /> <br /> Repeat this HR and don't consider yourself a good director (low budget .. No problem). The thief should really shave his head instead of the wig you know ... after all it's a 50Cr movie.
