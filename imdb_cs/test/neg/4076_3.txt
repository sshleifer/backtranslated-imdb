If you are not a fan of the 80s and need to be a particularly strong fan or one of the two leaders, we do not recommend anything about this movie. The story as others said is boring, almost after the basic idea of ​​characters and the idea of ​​doing a slightly manic comedy. I was looking at it for about an hour, hoping to turn around the corner, get twisted, or somehow kick the equipment, but no ... It's not rude, it's just boring. It goes. These are pieces of running crazy, lingering foot shots at strange angles, screaming insanely bits, but I haven't got a real sense of energy or manic fun, it just came as forced. Needless to say, do not laugh at all. A little mild amusement here or there, but nothing more. Don't be fooled by mentioning feminism by the way, all in this case means that almost all the main actors are women. If anything, it's actually a cloning ... Two women lead, all right, excellent, drug dealer is a woman, all right, their owner is an owner, all right, their friends are women, all right, the only other person we see who She lives in the same building, oh, woman ... I was not on the lookout, but after a while I felt that a conscious decision had been made that the film would be filmed in such a way that it seemed a bit forced and cloning again. . <br /> <br /> If you're a fan of the 80's of fashion and culture, there's plenty to see on this side, and if you're a Helena Slater fan, it's fun and fun. There is also a time for Carol Kane that is great, but not sufficient ... <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10. If you're a huge fan of the 80s, Helen Slater and Carol Kane, you could reach out to 5 for them, though it's still the fact that it's a comedy that's not funny, which prevents it. If you are not a fan of these things, you can also do 0 because there is nothing else.
