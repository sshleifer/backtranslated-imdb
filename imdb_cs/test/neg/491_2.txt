Slam Rock (glam) 80s is like the 90s of music or contemporary boyband: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes her a little cult today is that it's been a long time ago, so we can laugh at his stupidity. Too bad 'Rock Star' has no laughs at all because it has to be one of the most boring films of recent years. Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is a singer of Steel Dragon. When he kicked the band at the same time that the real singer Steel Dragon was fired, he became the next lead singer. You already know how it will end when Chris loses him with sex, drugs and R&D and forgets his longtime friend Emily (Jennifer Aniston). There is a way too much (boring) music in this standard-packed apology for the movie and it should be worth it at all costs. Watch (overvalued but still fun) Almost famous place, or better yet, a film about real people playing real music that has real emotions, what you do. What is stinking. 2/10.
