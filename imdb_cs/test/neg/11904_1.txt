I watched this movie on TV and it was so incredibly awful that I couldn't turn it off. Every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the story of Oscar Wilde's screenwriter, which has been released. It hardly matters because a sinister act, working with clich√©s and cloning music would still destroy something that resembled a decent scenario. The worst performance comes from Patrick Stewart, who as the wisest, most powerful and mild false Shakespeare nincompoop acts as a ghost. "Get out of here!" he screams at one stage while waving his hands like a pantomime thief. A really horrible movie and why he wonders why Stewart, who can act when called upon to do so, has dirty his reputation by making worthless bullshit pieces like this and XMen.
