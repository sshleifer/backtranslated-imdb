College students (who are actually in their late 20's) on campus in Boston (which looks odd as Isle Of Man) are threatened by wild monster (gathered during the Blue Peter episode). The new teacher has to save the day (even if he's really ... Oh, who cares?) <br /> <br /> I'll start with the positives ... there is a nice shot from Eastenders new gal Samantha Janus can in the compulsory school scene his best friend, Katy Lawrence. A bit of side trinkets: Katy was hired when she came to audition with her sister, as well as the moral support of her sibling, but ended up landing. Joy. I chose from the darkness to get ... flash her pert buttocks in a senseless scene added for titration, then killed 30 minutes for her problems. Her last (and just another role) is like probation assistant # 5 in reconciliation. I wonder if she could look at Keir Knightly (if extras and stars mix) and wonder: where did it all go wrong?! I'll give some Katy tips: If all the other members of the British cast are asked to talk to the American accents in a convicted mass marketing attempt. If you look at the paycheck and it's just about covering your lunch and bus ride home, you won't play in a movie with a trillion dollar budget. If many family members of the fourth director's assistant take part in the premiere and provoke laughter when Stickyback spoils the monster in the canals, it would seem to you that this is not a completely stranger. Or Critters IV will find it. So Katy, in your next life (I am a Buddhist, you see), you may be slightly more selective in your choice of debut feature than impulsively jumping to the first pile of stupidity that leads you. Flashing skin in your first film does not guarantee long-term success. If you're not Sylvester Stallone. And he had a scenario for Rocky to support him. <br /> <br /> For all intents and purposes, it's a 0/10 movie I've ever seen. However, for sheer unintentional laughter and net camp value, she gets 1. Good Job;)
