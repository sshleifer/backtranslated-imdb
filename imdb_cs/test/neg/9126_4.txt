The original original frames "American Graffiti" provide one-line abstracts of the film's fates by four central male characters. While somewhat sexist in omitting female characters, the end of the original film provided all the information about those people who even the most ardent fan of the movie would want. However, someone felt that mega-bucks could be made by detailing the hopeless lives of these characters after the original movie ended. Bad move. Doing an insurance vendor and his wife, a private nerdy in Vietnam, a driver of a hauling race and overgrown hippie to interesting characters in interesting situations was far beyond the talents of those who wrote this almost unknowable film. While most of the original cast is back, with only Richard Dreyfuss having a good sense to stay away, "More American Graffiti" is a mess of stupid situations that include protests, car races, country singers and the Vietnam War. The use of split screens, once innovative and bold, is overloaded to the point of distraction and confuses the already confused events. This is a sequel that demonstrates almost everything that goes wrong with continuing. Maybe they should be shown in film schools as lessons. Even the use of period music, which was delighted in the original, is badly done here. If you want more "American Graffiti" look at the original twice.
