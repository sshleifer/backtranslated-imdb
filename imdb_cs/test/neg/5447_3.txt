I'm not really sure why people are so free about this strange movie. I said I was actually sitting for 2 hours and I can't say it wasn't quite fun. I think the key issue is that Frank Marshall is not a real director and that is clear in the movie - he's an experienced producer, so we'll see a movie that happens many times and understand what's going on gets. But I think it's completely different than if we could actually make a film - the direction was competent, but somehow flat and directionless. Marshall has more experience as a unit or second director, and that seemed to me in the finished product - it seemed to be a group of files that couldn't really have any continuity in their sense or character. Funny, attentive, but good? No.
