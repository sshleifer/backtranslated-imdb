I wouldn't like anyone to watch this movie "inspired by a real story" and draw conclusions about a real event. Few things they managed were overshadowed by things that were simply not true. Ed Gein had never pulled anyone off the car, had never met anyone in the cemetery and hadn't killed them, no evidence that he'd returned the body parts to the cemetery. The things he did were terrible, why was he trying to make it worse? This film is one of my 10 worst eye wastes. "In the light of the moon" is a much better film on the subject, it is more factual and acting is better than that.
