This is a bleak story of self-absorption between two unlikable people, one of whom is married to someone else. It's high on my list of the most boring movies ever, and I've died hard romantic. My husband decided after the first hour of his three-year period when little happened. The desert scenery is spectacular, with endless sand and sun on Catherine's golden hair. However, cinematography is not a great movie unless it's a National Geographic travelogue. The spectacular Saharan scenery in this ill-conceived story is like putting a perfume on a pig. The film revolves around a heavily burned dying pilot named Laszlo de Almasy who is left under the care of Canadian Army sister, Hana, during World War II Italy. He seems to remember a little of his life, but through the book in his possession, his story is VERY DISCOVERED with the help of a man from his past called Caravaggio, who mysteriously appears on his deathbed. Almasy was a Hungarian cartographer employed in the Royal Geographical Society to map the Sahara Desert. He made an affair with his wife, Katherine, an explorer fellow who proved to be a British spy. Meanwhile, Laszlo currently has a sister's own affair with the nickname Sikh Kip, who is involved in the dangerous work of disarming down. <br /> <br /> My disputes with this film are many, lengthy and boring to start with. I have no doubt about acting, it's just not a good story. Caravaggio seems unnecessary, his connection with Almasy is superficial. It provides a scene of torture, but it does not seem to have a basic purpose in the film. The main problem is that both sides of the matter, Almasy and Katharine, are pitifully unsympathetic figures, shallow and boring. They just aren't very nice, so there's no one to cheer for. Almasy is cold, reserved, haughty and finally disgustingly possessed by another man's wife. Catherine is also detached and ugly, not to mention that she has an unwavering lack of guilt or feel for anything for her imperfect but loving husband ... except that at the end of her eye, when she dies, she controls one tiny tear. This is the story of LUST rather than love, with such pearls as 'I can taste you'. Almasy has a ridiculous affair with his colleague that his erotic obsession is imprinted on his beloved's neck, which is certainly more indicative of a focus on Catherine's body. The victim of this relentless adultery is the unhappy husband Geoffrey, who is treated as an unpleasant harassment. It's all scandalous and disgusting, Katharine's charade feels weak so that these lovers can indulge in their much-praised unbridled passion, all as Silent Night is sung in the background. I'm not sure if the intention was to contrast the purity of the carol with their selfish lust, but I was definitely not involved with the sacred undertone. We have full frontal nudity with Katharine, but their sex scenes meet as cold, selfish, lusty and sometimes downright hateful ... not warm, loving, giving, or even really passionate. If one of these two feelings feels different emotions, he is a totally selfish man and certainly NOT love to define the word. Almasy's return to the swimmer's cave to get his body his beloved comes rather as invented than moving. Katharine only had to expire a little earlier when she had a brilliant color and barely seemed to be napping, not like a corpse at all. Of course, it's all for a dramatic effect, because the romantics watching this story (usually one of them) wouldn't appreciate the crumbling corpse. To gain his body of adulterous lover, he betrayed his comrades and allies by making his maps to the Nazis, casting them as villains of this piece. Regardless of whether he kept his last katharine promise, his treacherous act is not something I admire much. Kip seems to be a nice friend, and Hana is generally sympathetic, but their romance is not in the least engaging, just a short battle with parties that suggest little trauma after parting. Between the two settings (past the Sahara Desert and present-day Italy) he moved back and forth, which was distracting and uncomfortable, but both stories were boring like washing dishes. The only spark of interest in the whole picture was Kipova's tense, disarming scene. I wasn't totally unfeeling and had some sympathy for the present state of Almasy's heavily burned and dying state. However, maybe my main complaint about this film is euthanasia at the end when Hana commits her patient by overdosing him with morphine. We should feel that it is justified and morally acceptable because he seems to be affectionate to Almasy, crying as he prepares a deadly syringe, and reads aloud from his supposedly passionate Herodotus book to comfort him when he dies. Director David Lean's great work should not be offended compared to this pathetic, immoral story. Yes, Lawrence of Arabia also has a desert, but in Lean films (Doctor Zhivago, Brief Encounter) there are those who deal with affectionate characters who show admirable restraint, guilt and respect for a betrayed husband, unlike total self absorption . this pair. In Ryan's Daughter, the husband's cuckold shows touching loyalty and forgiveness. This film is said to be an intellectual, enormously overrated bit of a boring and disgusting drive that, unfortunately, will happen as a great love story. His best Oscar picture does not speak well for the academy. For those who wonder why people are so strong on this film, the answer is simple. That's horrible.
