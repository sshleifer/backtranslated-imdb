So we should find it funny that this woman travels to the jungle - the warzon - just to find out why her fianc√©e didn't travel to Switzerland? Or should we take it seriously? It's not funny, clever or fun at all - it's stupid - and so is the movie. The main actress is one of the most annoying characters I've ever seen in the movie - worse than Jar-Jar Binks. Dialogue is very trying to be funny (almost all the time), but it never is. The number of funny jokes is somewhere between zero and nothing. And when it comes to conspiracy, have they ever bothered us to explain what rebels (other than anti-government) are fighting for? I don't think anyone cared about it - neither the rebels nor the characters who blindly flew to the battlefield. Don't waste your time. "Coronado" is neither funny nor fun.
