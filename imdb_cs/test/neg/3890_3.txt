Before I start, "little" correction: IMDb says Richard Gere is 180 cm tall. Poorly! I walked past him 10 years ago, and he can't be an ant ** greater than 165. I'm 183, and he looked like a kid next to me. Should be called "Wheatlands"; a suitable title to complement Malick's previous (and much better) "Badlands" movie. This film shows that not all directors have their main goal to have fun. In fact, some of them have as their main goal to show wheat in all its beauty. The film is depressing and relatively undeveloped, with a mandatory tragic end. Nothing more than an average and predictable drama with a love triangle, with two-thirds of a triangle that did not survive the film. They praised their visual quality; while it has those realistic 70s feel to it, there are limits on how the wheat field spellbinding can be. You can shoot them with 1500mm cameras, for everything I care about, but they're still a wheat field. Gere, who initially appears to be wrong as some sort of lower-level factory that turned to Wheatfield. The employee is quite solid, while Brooke Adams seems to be remote and cold for most of the movie, so one cares how much he loves one of the two hunters. But for those looking for a film that shows all the wonderful colors of the wheat field, look no further: you've found your dream! <br /> <br /> If you are interested in reading your "CVs" by Richard Gere and other Hollywood intellectual difficulties, contact me by email.
