The retro puppet master starts in Kolewige in 1944, where puppet master Andre Toulon (Guy Rolfe) and his live puppets plan to escape from Germany, sticking to the puppet championship Inn Toulon recalls his early life and the moment he learned the secrets of giving . the life of dead objects returned in Paris in 1902 when his younger self (Greg Sestero) drove the Magic Theater. He describes a fateful night when he met a 3000-year-old Egyptian wizard named Afzel (Jack Donner) and a possible love for the life of a young and beautiful Ilsa (Brigitta Dau). It tells the story of how Afzel donated his life and gave his life to his own wooden puppets, which were part of a theater magic show. However, the gift of life was also a curse like the ancient God Scold, which was stolen by the secret in the first place Afzel wants him to come back and all those who have learned the dead ... <br /> <br /> Later I was a bit of a puppet master bender as a big fan of the first three, I decided to watch the rest of the franchise & as such I saw puppet master 4 (1993), puppet master 5: final chapter (1994), curse of puppet master (1998) and now retro puppet master in space weeks and boys it was hard to go through them all, especially this one because it's so far worse in the series. The retro puppet master feels like a cross between puppet master III: Toulon's Revenge (1991) with his period setting and puppet master 4 and puppet master 5: The final chapter with the Sutta seeks to kill anyone associated with his alienated life that gives secrets . Again, there is not much continuity, again there is no green serum in previous films and despite the fact that Andre Toulon committed suicide in 1939 at the beginning of the original puppeteer (1989). Most of the story is told as flashback and focuses on Andrea Toulon himself rather than puppets, the film focuses on his relationship with Ilsa and his teachings of the mystery of life, and it is rather dull and boring to be honest. Even in just 80 odd minutes, the Retro Puppet Master feels long and cushioned without a real pace and without a central concept, because the plot never really adjusts and generally takes a lot. Of course there is a decisive decision to completely rework the puppets that I found incredibly, I think, why would the creators take one basic thing that made the puppet master movies so unforgettable and totally rid of it? Puppets are briefly seen at the beginning and the end, but otherwise we get these rubbish-looking wooden cartoons that are not nearly as cool as their modern rework. It is never even explained why these puppets have been used, rather than those that all puppet master fans have come to love, though one suspects that Full Moon hoped to make another sequel to this issue. <br /> <br /> If a bad story and a complete lack of our favorite puppets wasn't bad enough, Full Moon decided to go with the PG-13 rating for this Retro Puppet Master to be the only "R" puppet master in the US. apparently other countries have their own film rating systems, and therefore there is not a single drop of blood in the whole movie, puppets do not kill anyone, neither promises nor nudity. This is harder to tame than children stuff all the way. Except that the puppets themselves are garbage, the special effect in this series, too, there is no motion stop animation, no CGI computer effects (certainly in 1999 was CGI cheap enough?) And all the effects are stiff rod puppet effects . Whenever you see a puppet walk, the camera is always placed over it and waiting, so its legs may not be displayed and of course there is some production assistant that pushes it all, that's as complex and modern as the special effects you get. One positive thing Retro Puppet Master does is that it looks pretty nice, period design, costumes and props are actually quite impressive and it's a pretty nice movie to watch occasionally. Apparently he filmed in Bucharest, Romania, which doubles quite well at the turn of the century in Paris. The performances are terrible and perhaps the worst of the series. The retro puppet master is more or less the last puppet master movie as another puppet master: Legacy (2004) basically edits the shots of the previous seven films and that is a pretty lousy way to round off the series, which has begun Well with three outstanding & distinctive little killer puppet flicks. Don't bother with it, just watch one of the first three and don't forget the good times ... The murderers' puppets will return in a terrible spin-off film Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys (2004).
