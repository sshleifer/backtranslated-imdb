Ms! What can be said about this bizarre, stunning mock-up-mentor of cross-dressing Ed Wood's fantasies? One word that comes to mind is incoherent! Wood uses raw boards of harmless, random tracks and then creates a "story" around them - and what a story !! Wood itself plays like Glen, a regular Joe who just happens to enjoy lounging in underwear and sweaters. I think what Wood wanted was a plea for tolerance for all the Glens of this world by showing that Glen is just like us all in Angora. Ummm ... ok. But then we get this bizarre cut of some horny devil, a slave chick, some rough, pointing man, some backstage work, and eventually bewildered Bela Lugusi, playing some twisted, invalid puppeteer. Lugosi is howling, pouring such waste as "Beeevaaare ... beeeg greeeen dragon who sees at your doorstep: radiates leeetle boy, puppies tails and beeeeeg snails!" Um, ok, Bela ...: = 8 / There's a strange, twisted type of wood logic. Finally, he reminds us that "7 out of 10 men wear hats and 7 out of 10 men are bald". Hmmm, it must be an alien / cross-dressing / habidashery cowspiracy-thang !! Glen or Glenda plays a myriad of (no matter what it is ...) reliable wood actors, including Lyle Talbot, Delores Fuller and Timothy Farrell. . Everyone knows Bel's sad story: at the time he used the wood for this flick, he was probably Jones for further repair and he needed moolah, but for him, it's still unfinished depths. One of MooCow's favorite wood mooments comes with stock footage charging buffalo scene - it's a sooo loop demented !! MooCow says "Puuuull de schtriiiiings", and git yer hooves on a copy of Glen or Glenda - you won't believe it! : ??
