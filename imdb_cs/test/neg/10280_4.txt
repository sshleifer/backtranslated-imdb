For a long time I wanted to see ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE. I have always been fascinated by the title, star and desert, but for some (now quite clear) reasons this film will never be seen on television, or I miss it when it has ever been shown. Well, after watching the DVD, now I know why the movie is rarely shown: it's because it's not that good. I'd say it's a lot of mess. ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was created by the first director and shows. The film is mainly a vignette series with nothing else. Rather as a collection of short films accidentally strung together. The film can be reduced to this: intro (murder); cop and girlfriend together; intro credits; cops to work; a fool tells a story; a cop finds a dead body; cop and boss and girlfriend at the bar; chase the scene; etc. Scenes just don't stand together. They are very different from each other and therefore the characterization is weak, borderline amateur. The scene at the bar with the girlfriend, the scene on the hippie farm, the Big John scene, and the chief were shouting at each other, they were good. I almost stopped the movie during those (terrible) moments. The film's lack of experience is proof of the film. The style, like the 1970s, is all over the map. Intro Credit Scene is a movie to look like commercial for law enforcement. Then they try to be a friend movie (Big John and Zipper), then a murder mystery; then a melodramatic love story; The film doesn't have to have one special style to be successful, but I'm afraid the style in ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE was confused. You can clearly see that the director had no idea what he was doing or where he was going with him. The film is not a complete disaster. While the content of ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is almost amateur, the look is extremely (and deceptively) professional. The camera is stunning. Each picture is worthy of an exhibition at the art gallery. Or, because the first (and last) time director was involved in the music business that deserved the album's cover. The beautiful appearance of the film gives the product more credibility than it really deserves. And thanks to the play of Robert Blake (really badly written character), the film maintains a certain level of realism, although nothing else makes sense. What is remarkable about the film's appearance and composition is that it has been copied and duplicated a million times. Intro credits reminded me of something like TOP GUN, which was created 13 years later. The scenes from Johnny's dress, with clothes on the bed, reminded me of the American Gigola. Strangely enough, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE has a very modern feel, due to stunning visuals, although the story and philosophy behind it are hopelessly outdated. So, ELECTRA GLIDE IN BLUE is, on the one hand, a remarkably underrated and overlooked film, because it has affected many future filmmakers out there in appearance and composition. Very few movies can claim to have achieved this, and legendary cameraman Conrad Hall should have full merit. On the other hand, EGIB is also deservedly forgotten because of bad characters, confusing story and confused direction, none of which is worth remembering.
