This movie was horrible ... As someone might think this movie was like the old ones in "good old days" when Tim Thomerson wasn't even in it. And to make matters worse, they used clips from old movies. This is just awful. NO trancer movie is complete without Tim Thomerson. I like Fullmoon movies, and I watched them because I was 4 years old. I went through everything they did, and this movie almost lost me. Now I have a few lines to fill in, so I'll continue. Their way of breeding new trancers is just as stupid as the way to send Jack in time. What happened to the TCL Chamber. And finally! What happened at the end of trancer 5, where the linse says and quote "Jack gave me something special" And her and some other wide look at her stomach. I don't know ... maybe there's BABY. There were so many other places to go, but S'd the Bed fullmoon
