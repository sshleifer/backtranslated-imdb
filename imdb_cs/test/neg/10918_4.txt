CUJO is a film adaptation of the same name novel by Stephen King. I've never read a novel, but just scanning the notes page gave me some insight. I noticed a link change change. The storyline of the film is as follows. Bernard swallows an angry bat and goes to a deadly spree. The plot sounds pretty worn out and has been done in various movies. But when the king wrote a novel, it could be something new. Or perhaps King's novel has put into the story what has never been reflected in the film. Anyway, the first 40 minutes of this movie have nothing to mention that it was different from a dog bitten. Nothing else happens - nothing terrifying, nothing fun, nothing that adds depth to the characters and nothing interesting in any other way. I found that this section is difficult to sit on and constantly shouting on TV, "come on, get started!". The events I saw on the screen resembled a TV movie about a dramatic genre or an extended episode of a TV soap opera. Unfortunately, there was only one of the families in the film that concentrated, so it couldn't work at the soap opera level either. The dog was the best character in the movie, but he didn't have enough time on the screen in this section. There was nothing to suggest why this dog would go on a deadly spree later on. <br /> <br /> After 40 minutes, something finally happened. The dog suddenly turned from a lovely pet to an evil machine. Some people started attacking. There was also an interesting cat-and-mouse chase when two characters became trapped in the car, unable to leave because the dog would attack them. Even in this too long second half, tension develops well before it dies again. It was just a stop-go situation that was repeated over and over until the film reached its conclusion. <br /> <br /> The tension of the scene when it's on the screen is exciting to watch. Some large camera angles add a threat to the dog's evil nature when attacking people. This is especially important because as others mentioned St. Bernard Dog is nowhere near as scary as, say, Rottweiler. Unfortunately, the movie can't use thrilling music to support on-screen images. Music is more melodramatic than thrilling. This can fit into a TV movie, but it looks incredibly out of place in what should be a dark-toned film that will present a live nightmare to the viewer. This brings me to the wider problem of this film photography. Camera-work and especially the choice of colors to make it look like a very cheap TV movie that one would expect to see as a daily movie on Channel 5 here in the UK, where I write this comment from. The two best actors bring good acting performances to help breathe life into boring film segments. Dee Wallace and Danny Pintauro should be recognized for their excellent work with the poor material they are given. I could forgive a few short moments of overloading by paying more attention to the dialogue, which in my view could not allow any other interpretation. I will not judge other actors because they have practically nothing to do. As someone who is a fan of SALEM'S LOT and STEPHEN KING'S IT, as film adaptations of Stephen King's famous novels, I have had great expectations for this film. But it turned out to be a huge disappointment. Overall, I don't recommend Stephen King fans or horrors to watch CUJO in general. This is one of those moments when I have to recommend a book rather than a film. Hopefully it will revive the story by failing to film.
