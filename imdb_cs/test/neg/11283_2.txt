While being promoted as one of Turkey's most sincere amateur movies, ice cream, I Scream is more like a caricature of sincerity. The story opens with Ali's dream, a traveling ice cream salesman in the western city of Anatolia, where he sees himself becoming successful with the same marketing methods of big ice cream companies. He dreams of playing in the TV commercial of his product with beautiful bikini models, dancing around him. When his dream turns into a nightmare, he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan woman who refuses to make sex with him for 6 years for no apparent reason. Is it because he is not successful in his work? Apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from ice cream companies. But that's what he says; in fact, we don't see him suffer so much: he still sells well, travels around the surrounding villages, while his apprentice stays in the store and sells ice cream to the people in the city. Ali accuses big companies of using sweeteners and dyes while he uses real "sahlep" (powdered roots of mountain orchids). Ali buys a motorcycle with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local television channel that prefers both broadcast and news in the local dialect. His wife doesn't like his ways of doing business, they always argue, and Ali threatens her to do very bad things at the moment of madness. On a very successful day, his lousy bike is stolen by bad little boys in the city. When looking for a stolen bike, Ali goes to the police, blames the big companies for theft, but nobody takes it seriously. Annoyed that his wife is annoying, goes to the pub and gets drunk. One of his friends at the table, a wannabe socialist of the city, gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalization and jumps on the subject of global freezing without a real connection. Ali returns home and decides to kill the poison. His wife wakes up and prevents him. An old neighbor takes him on a night walk and advises him about life. According to him, Ali can even sell a hot sablep drink if the world faces a global freeze. When he returns home, we suddenly find that his wife understood his value, treated him as a hero, and praised his manhood. Meanwhile, thief boys have fallen ill to eat too much ice cream. They admit to the doctor that they stole Ali's bike. Ali forgives them and comes to a happy ending. Although the plot may look promising, it's a story that makes this film infallible and cheesy. First, the director does not show much effort to visualize the story; everything is based on dialogue. Dialogues never stop showing us that cinema is actually a visual art. Even Ali's problems aren't convincing, because we don't see it, we only understand his words. The director puts his film on the market as a fair fight against Ali's big ice cream companies, but there is nothing about big companies. We don't see their pressure enough. The film actually mocks Ali for believing that big companies are behind theft. And when he finds his bike, he solves every problem: Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband. It is not a real criticism of globalism. Secondly, the film is raw because of humor. Perhaps the people of that part of Turkey are cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily lives, but the vulgar language and rude humor are not enough to make the film funny. Maybe I accepted it, if they were both vulgar and "clever" but they're not smart jokes at all, they're just cheesy. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe American people may like the oriental version of the American Pie humor style. But American Pie has never had any claim to be an Oscar candidate or a political message! If you think you can laugh by seeing his big erection in his shorts (and we had to endure this joke twice!) Or an old villager who says "f ** to you," then you can find this movie funny.
