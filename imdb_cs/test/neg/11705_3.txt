I must not see the same film as the one referred to here. At first, I think they should have a Ghost Story serialized story if they should ever shoot it. The shortened version they came up with was terrible. I felt that the performances were brought up and so much was left out of the story that such masters like Astaire, Douglas, Houseman and Fairbanks looked like hammy. Alice Krige was excellent as Eva. Craig Wasson is a good actor, but he was just adequate as a protagonist. The decision to occupy Patricia Neal and shorten her role was not good. Imagine what Anne Bancroft would do with this character! I blame the scenario that was wrong. Production values ​​were dark and stimulation was slow. Disappointment, the pursuit of pedestrians. The book is one of the five greatest thrilling novels of the 20th century, IMHO. But the film was disappointing, though it was a great introduction for Krige.
