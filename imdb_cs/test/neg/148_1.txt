I came across this film on the internet from fluke and I was horrified by the content of violent violence and the scenes of torture. it was a relief to know that it wasn't real after reading the comments. what dangerously ill animals do something like this and for what purpose goes beyond faith. I was even more shocked to see people who rated the movie in the comments section of this page. it is a very disturbing film that could change your life forever. the people behind it should be redeemed by justice. Today they showed that a girl tomorrow gets rape and injuries on the screen, it could be a baby. even his fake or not his very deadly intrusive, really hostile.
