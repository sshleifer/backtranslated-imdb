I've never heard of this movie until it comes to DVD. Immediately I was interested in everything: actors, title, cover and especially the author. Arthur Miller, you can't go wrong with him, do you? Yes. I didn't read the novel, but I think it was much better than the movie. I had great hopes for this movie. I love Macy and Dern and it looked interesting. Unfortunately, this film will never stand out on news of racism and fanatics. If you've never seen any other movies that deal with this subject, or if you never knew that America was based on bigotry, then maybe this movie will marry you. Others are likely to find it predictable, musty, and overall bland.
