Naach would win Razzie for the worst film in 2004 (may be overall too) if it was global. When it comes to causing bad (aka showing attitude / yawning / over (not) playing) Halle Berry is not a match for Antru Malli. While the catwoman had a warehouse, supposedly a hot actress in microscopic costume, and some action sequences, Naach had nothing at all. One of those films that makes me wonder why IMDb allows a person to rate a movie as 0/10. Still, I think the film doesn't deserve 0. It must be something negative or minus infinity. OK, what about the plot of the land? It is a fundraising, arrogant, full-bodied choreographer who encounters a useless, helpless, whitefighter who tries to be an acting story. The story is so short that if just another sentence, IMDb can disable me from writing a spoiler. About telling? It's like a bunch (sorry for 2 people for the most part) of people moving in super slow motion. Do not try this movie if you purchased a new DVD player. You would end up believing that either the DVD is in bad condition or the DVD player is struck. It's not his fault at all. <br /> <br /> At the end of all this, you'll give the director some credits. At least he realized that Antra Malli and Abhishek Bachan (at least at that time) could not convincingly speak, so there are not too many dialogues in this movie. So you can go through the film at least once, with some unpleasant sounds from these Antra-malli song sequences. <br /> <br /> Watch this movie if you're new to Bollywood Cinema. Once you tolerate this movie, you will be able to see and enjoy any Bollywood movie. Can't be worse 3 hours of torture than this!
