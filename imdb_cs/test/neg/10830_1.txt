This movie doesn't even have a saving grace to be so bad that it's good. It's really scary. She's closer to a parody than a disaster movie, but unfortunately they were serious. Made for television, but not so good. It contains every clich√© and kitschy moment you can imagine. Will he save the city from the flood? Will his wife admit he still loves him? Will they escape before the floods drown them? I can't explain how bad it is. A terrible predictable plot that makes you so shabby. Bad effects (although it was fair I saw worse super-stored bubbling water). Bad script. Sad talk. Hidden. So bad in the fact that you should probably get drunk and watch it.
