Possible Connectors As Peter Jackson has so brilliantly shown in his "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, it is possible to create good films, even big ones, in the fantasy genre. The genre distinguished literary ancestors, dating back to medieval knight novels, particularly the Arthurian legends, on which Tolkien and other authors drew. But the "Lord of the Rings" is difficult to think of any other sword and witch movies that are good. I would agree with a reviewer who said that the best of the bad bunch is "Willow" Ron Howard, and even the one who achieved a different difference from being just an average movie, unlike a positively bad movie. However, "Red Sonja" cannot achieve an even more modest difference in the fact that it is simply a bad movie as opposed to a scary movie. As in "Willow", many of the conspiracy elements in "Red" Sonja are derived from `Lord of the Rings'. An evil ruler is trying to gain control of an artifact with supernatural powers to attain the ambition of world domination, but he is thwarted by a variety of heroes. Set in the Hyborian Age, a barbaric era in a remote past on Earth, the film begins with a criminal of this work, the wicked Queen Gedren, who makes an unwelcome sexual advantage to heroine Sonja. When they are rejected, Gedren (not the woman who wouldn't answer) responds to the murder of Sonja's parents and brother. (In 1985 it was probably still considered politically correct not only to make a major villain woman but also make one of the major motives for her villain frustrated lesbian lust). Gedren's next step is to capture the Talisman, a kind of fluorescent green soccer ball with magical powers, by defeating a terribly dressed female priestess who protects her as much as she is supposed to destroy her because they feel her powers they are too dangerous. Among the dead is Sonja's sister, her only surviving relative. However, Sonja herself was not idle, but enrolled in the martial arts academy, where she attended summa cum laude, and herself goes on revenge. Along the way he associates with Kalidor, the heroic wandering swordsman-king commemorating Tolkien's Aragorn, Prince Tarn, the corrupt childhood ruler of the kingdom who fell upon Gedren's forces, and Falkon, Tarna's loyal servant. The rest of the film is quite predictable because Sonja and her allies are trying to overthrow Gedren and prevent the destruction of the world threatened by the destroyed Talisman. <br /> <br /> What does it do? film so bad? Well, actors, to start. As Kalidor, Arnold Schwarzenegger gives a kind of typical wooden, poker face that has become his trademark, at least in his early career, complete with a heavy foreign accent. However, compared to Brigitte Nielsen as a hero, she looks like Laurence Olivier. Miss Nielsen seems to have had even worse language difficulties, with each line earning the mechanical, expressionless voice of someone who has just finished a lesson from the "learn-self-English after correspondence" course. One wonders if she was busy just to make Arnie look good. Other characters, even if they do not lead their own private struggles against the English language, are simply cartoon cartoons, especially Prince Tarn, who must be one of the most annoying young people on the screen. Even worse than playing bad, however, the film is almost a complete lack of imagination. This is a particularly glaring mistake in fantasy film, as films of this genre need to rely on their imaginative power to convince the audience to suspend the natural feelings of infidelity that would be provoked by a fantastic plot. Watching Peter Jackson's masterpiece, we can at least convince for the next three hours that we are in the Middle Earth, that elves, sorcerers and hobbits exist, and that the destiny of the world really depends on the destruction of the magic ring. Watching "Red Sonja," we are convinced of nothing but watching a lot of actors with bad accents fighting on the slope to hold lime-green football. This lack of imagination even begins with the title of the film. British science fiction writer Brian Aldiss, when attacking the exotic names given to his characters, replied that it made no sense to create a fictional extraterrestrial society with its own distinctive culture if you wanted to spoil the effect by calling the hero Joe. . (Sure, Tolkien was able to <br /> <br /> get away with giving the name Sam to one of his main characters, but it was because Hobbits was supposed to be a soothing familiar, Middle-Earth equivalent of tweedy, pipe-smoking English) . Likewise, the heroine of a story seemingly fitting into a long-standing barbaric age is called common girl names like "Sonia" (which is how the name "Sonja" is pronounced), as appropriate as her "Betty" or "Mary-Jane" call. <br /> <br /> It seems that the movie was made on a very small budget, which makes me wonder why they bother. Fantasy must be done convincingly or not at all. This was apparently shot in a remote mountain environment, with little or no attempt to design a distinctive culture. Of course, several of the buildings we see, such as the Talisman Temple or the Gedren Palace, are cheap. We realize that the capital of Tarn was destroyed by Gedren using the power of the Talisman, but we do not actually see this event; we see only what can be a storm on the other side of the hill. At first you wonder how Sonja wants to overthrow the whole kingdom with just a few allies, but when you see how a small army of Gedren is available, it becomes more understandable. When the earthquake threatens to destroy the palace, you wonder if it's a Talisman at work or just a crew member who inadvertently leaned against the orchard. If we can enjoy this film for anything else, we can at least enjoy it for its unwanted humor; a great example of such a bad school is funny. Ed Wood would be proud of this. If it was shown on television in California the night before the memory elections, Gray Davis would still be the governor. 2/10.
