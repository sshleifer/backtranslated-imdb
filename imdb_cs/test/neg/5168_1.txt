I feel the same from all the bad comments on this movie and their addition. It may seem that Australians are weak, instead they were brave soldiers. It was very horrible and too graphic in this movie. I haven't seen enough heroism just another cowardice that is ashame because of nothing I read. We do not need the extreme of violence, as if we could use our living ideas of what they went through. It's like saving a private ryan where the Nazi slowly pushes a soldier into a knife. For example, Mel Gibson is through extreme director for his films not because of violence but for the level of historical inaccuracy. The letters Iwo Jima was one of the war films that were close enough to history (although I was wrong), except for the Flags of Our Fathers and the Kwai River Bridge. It is better if you read that it is an insult to the victims and if you do not say it correctly, and the film goes too long, there is nothing interesting about the dialogue and not enough to repay the aussies to kill the Japanese soldiers. Just read the internet history, magic and books. Films always kill sense of realization. What they did to prisoners of war in Singapore and the Philippines was terrifyingly terrifying to civilians. It's just proud of me to see that goodies beat the baddy, but movies like this will ruin it.
