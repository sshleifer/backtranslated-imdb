when I looked at this crap, it reminded me of the name of the film FIRE, which is where the waste belongs to the fire. I don't even know what to say, it's a fake, the fire looked really fake, Andy's chicks aren't exactly supermodels. And finally, I don't know what people complain that I'm actually this damn movie, yeah best to me Well I think it might be worse I could be watching left behind 2. And making things worse I got the whole file on a DVD fire, volcano, earthquake, avalanche. All I miss is an amazing tornado movie that I hear sucks the balls. Well up to my next movie crap peace
