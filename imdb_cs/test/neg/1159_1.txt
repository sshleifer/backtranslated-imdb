Ed Gein, one of the most famous serial killers of all time, was the inspiration for famous movie killers like Norman Bates, Leatherface and Buffalo Bill. He is also one of the most sick and disturbing killers of all time, watching a documentary on him, so I know his story well. When I saw it, I was curious because I thought it would be like a documentary re-enactment, but I have to say that it was just a pathetic waste of time. First, the facts are very bad, with a few minor exceptions, and secondly, it was just a stupid Hollywood story when these terrible murders really happened and they just did it as a cheap buck. Not to mention that if they got into horror, it was wrong! Ed Gein lives in a small town in Wisconsin called Plainfield, but he has a little secret that the whole city is being done, digging dead bodies and brutally killing people. Bobby, MP, is on the case to get Ed Gein, no one knows who the killer is in the first place. But things become "personal" when Ed starts talking to a family of cops and friends. Of course, this movie was just laughter and a totally offensive real story. I always thought bad acting was an essential tool for a horror movie, but for this story it should be a better film, not to mention that it should be a documentary rather than a stupid horror clich√©. Please stay away from this movie, it's totally pathetic and untrue to Ed Gein's story. <br /> <br /> 1/10
