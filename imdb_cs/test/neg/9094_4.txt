The chilled and bloody story of the couple inherited a 150-seat Italian castle while mourning the loss of their young son. The married couple seems to be on the rocks due to a car accident that took their son's life and left her daughter blind. After taking over the castle's inventory for future sales, the vicious, tortured and disfigured creature will be lost from the bowels of the 12th century castle. Pretty bloody with a great horror atmosphere and some sexual overtones. Starring Jeffrey Combs, Barbara Crampton, Jessica Dollarhide and Elisabeth Kaza.
