Messengers is a bad, general and boring 'horror' movie. The film has a big problem: it doesn't scare. Performance and scenario are absolutely stupid. He uses old tricks to scare and all the supernatural events make Laughter. The only good thing about this movie is that it's short, so the bullshit won't stay with us for so long. Unfortunately, ignored while this crap is all achievements at the box office. So I do not recommend this weak and pathetic horror that is called Messengers.
