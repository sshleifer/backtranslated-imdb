Emraan Hashmi post MURDER has done some good roles in Bhatt's movies, but another director has just used his kissing and naughty picture. <br /> <br /> AKSAR is one of them and came after AAA, JAWANI DIWANI in a row and I was already Already enough and such roles have <br /> <br /> the film has a nice twist at the beginning, felt I was like a film by Abbas Mustan, but then it turns into a routine movie with sudden love, sudden jealousy and a bad climax. Anant Mahadevan makes horrible movies Music saves grace Camera-work is fabulous <br /> <br /> Emraan Hashmi just repeats his act from his earlier films and has 2 expressions throughout Dino. talks as if he was practicing Hindi and in some scenes is fine Udita is expressionless and irritating
