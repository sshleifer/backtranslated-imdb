First of all, I would like to mention - for the record - that it is incredibly stupid to call your movie "Embryo" when the topic concerns solely scientific research on fruits (human and human) at the age of 12-16 weeks. The embryonic stage ends at the end of the eighth week of pregnancy and from then on the unborn animal gets into the fetal phase. Well, in all honesty, I didn't know all of that, but I was trying to find out, and that's also the smallest thing the "Embryo" creators could do. Do not worry; I'm not just stumbling over the details or being overly bitter because there are several other reasons to state why "Embryo" is a huge failure. Real science can be considered boring and inaccessible, and so the Science Fiction is a film genre specifically designed to make the otherwise lengthy but educational science themes more interesting and understandable to a larger audience. By depicting ambitious scientific experiments that happen terribly wrong, or space missions that encounter evil aliens instead of light years of emptiness, filmmakers usually manage to entertain people with spectacular special effects while also instructing them on useful little things about science. In order to make a good or at least half a decent Science Fiction movie, writers and directors have to follow only one basic rule: Don't be boring! If they cannot meet this condition, the viewer can read theoretically the exact book. Something had to go wrong during Ralph Nelson's "Embryo" production. The basic assumption is potentially fascinating and even engaging because we are all sensitive to saving the lives of the unborn. There have also been some very prominent names involved in the production, such as the main stars Rock Hudson ("Giant", "Seconds"), Diane Ladd ("Chinatown", "Alice Here Doesn't Live Here Anymore") and director Nelson himself was responsible for the acclaimed Classics "Soldier Blue" and "Charly". So what went wrong? Simple. The scenario is incredibly boring, cliché, and the whole thing seems incredibly foolish, because lab scenery and scientific equipment is obviously too primitive to achieve any breakthrough in health. Rock Hudson, in a very poor performance, plays a doctor who has not made any passion in his research since his wife died. When his car hits a pregnant dog on a rainy night, his passion returns and does everything in his power to save the germs of dying animals. Can keep one fetus alive, impressively accelerates the growth process and trains it to become an extremely intelligent dog. Because his progress is so successful, Dr. Paul Holliston convinces his hospital friend to repeat his human fetal tests taken from the womb of a pregnant teenager who committed suicide. However, the female body grows unexpectedly at a fast pace and after only a few weeks is a full-fledged, breathtaking and super-intelligent woman. A good doctor naturally falls in love with her, but a breakthrough new treatment for growth is also beginning to show horrible side effects ... Absolute Nothing Happens During the First 45 Minutes of a Movie, Except Many Unlikely and Too Melodramatic Mumbo-Jumbo and One or Two Deeply Impacting Dog Tricks . The second half of the film contains a bit of (grotesque) action and tension, but at that time the stupidity of the dialogues and the unlikely reversal of the plot destroyed the potentially fabulous idea of ​​Sci-Fi. There are some really cool scenes, most notably a chess-showdown between Victoria and Roddy McDowall (in a very memorable and ultra-annoying support role). The grand finale is absurdly grotesque and literally on the verge of ridiculous, and almost feels like Ralph Nelson, who put into this last catastrophic blow because it was a general rule in the current thriller & Sci-Fi cinema. The last sequence, including a terrible stop at the end of the frame, certainly does not match the tones of the previous 100 minutes of the movie. But anyway, my honest admiration and respect for the dog and his coaches. An animal with such intellect and talent deserves to show its tricks in a much better film.
