First of all, this movie is not nearly completed, my guess is that someone actually bothered to steal every other page of the script. The movie contains bizarre time-traveling without warning, inconsistent dialogues, misconstrued details all over, music is not very bad at all, other then badly placed tracks, and besides the volume goes up and down between different feet. The cutting room actually did a downward job and it says a lot. Lost sound effects will destroy the tension, though. Luke Perry does what he does best, just looks worried, and occasionally coughs from punching from hell. I really appreciate this movie as the worst of 2007 and I saw a few bad ones. Don't spend money on this, it's not that bad, it's laughter, it's worse. Rating over 1 star should make a blacklist on IMDb because it's a damn lie.
