It's hard and I didn't expect it ... But it's really the worst movie I and my wife have seen. Horrible dialogues that unintelligible extend over time without any obvious reason, except for the time of completion. Do stories not follow exhaustively? Everything is a mess. Actions and dialogs appear on the leaps. I was most disappointed when I saw Dominique Pinon, one of my favorite French actors. uh? I don't even know how to describe it without being polite? The rest of the actors who are on the poorest. Susan Paterno made a terrible interpretation of her character, making flat bland performance. Bad special effects. I don't think it was a complete waste of the movie, but is it close? To say that I would advise everyone not to see this movie. I think it would be a complete waste of time. Sincerely, I never said anything like that about the movie, but? it's always the first time.
