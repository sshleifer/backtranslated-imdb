There is something else on Earth than to be more tempting than to learn what awaits our fragile bodies after, um, death. Spanish director Ignacio Cerdà (a related soul of his German colleague Jörg Buttgereit) answers our curiosity and invites us to an exciting journey into the world of preparatory tables, scalpel, surgical saws, human guts and warped minds. . Welcome to autopsy! I don't know which parts of the film, in addition to his reputation, could help him get a high enough rating. It is quite simple and straightforward - a day in life (in fact half an hour) of a restless coroner (or perhaps a pathologist's assistant or whoever it is) who is full of his routine morbid duty and relieves psychological tension in an unconventional way right at your workplace. I am confused about what particular message the authors tried to deliver with this plot. I think it may be somehow inspired by the unpredictable performance of Udo Kier's character in Andy Warhol's Frankenstein. <br /> <br /> The artistic values ​​of the film are also questionable. It is difficult to evaluate the performance of actors who do not squeeze a single word. Their emotions are hidden behind medical masks. Also, there is not enough space for great camera work - basically the whole action develops mostly in four walls. Authenticity - Effects and make-up are impressive and the settings look very plausible, but only a few medical / forensic experts can judge how true and anatomically correct autopsy is done here (if someone cares). I honestly thought that autopsy was done to investigate the condition of the individual organs and find the cause of death. Now I know that the dead bodies are separated, raped and humiliated, the intestines are torn, the brains are pulled out of the head, filled in the abdomen and mixed with the intestines, then the body is stitched and washed - nothing personal. Are these poor boys expected to write in their fraudulent autopsy reports? Shock and Disgust Factor - It is very unlikely that an unsuspecting viewer will find that to his horror, the disc that was worn by his wife and children watch next to the Christmas tree turns out to be a graphic video manual. about vivisection. This obscure subject is hardly available, coveted by people familiar with the subject and not easily offended. Therefore, it would be pointless to warn everyone to shoot this film. They are well aware of exactly what they are watching and what they want to see. Cerdà is a really talented and stylish director who is clearly evident from at least two other parts of his "trilogy" - the previous Awakening, amazing black and white short and thirty minutes "Genesis", a visually stunning and moody piece with off- beat and interesting concept. And I'm sure he will one day recharge the audience's heart with his new, more focused material. And sooner or later the "Aftermath" will become a rarity for careful collectors of his "early" warm-ups. But in the meantime I'm afraid it may be recommended strictly for medical students or specialists who study mental disorders and sexual aberrations.
