The impressive but weak James Bond movie mainly because both the hero (Bond) and the villain (Blofeld) were seriously culpable. Lazenby is too big and innocent to play Bond. It looks and behaves more like a kindhearted but grim sidekick in a police action film. The director and writer is trying to establish his credibility, but his proverb, such as "Royal Baluga, North of ...", is simply not effective in establishing it as this secular and savvy rogue. Savalas doesn't do a bad job, but his characterization and behavior is more appropriate for a mob gangster. The best characters of the film are Tracy and her father. But the performance of these actors when sharing a screen with Lazenby serves only to highlight his shortcomings as an actor. This movie is too long (140 minutes.) For the Bond movie and offers no excitement until Bond's escape from the mountains where it starts to rise. This film is trying very hard, but it doesn't. Many Bondian elements are present and the climate battle is first and foremost, but I always feel that something is missing in watching this thing.
