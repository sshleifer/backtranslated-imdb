Drab, lousy and total loss of my time. The plot is incomprehensible (so don't think too much). Acting is special and wooden - I swear it was all professional body builders trying to play happiness, but that could be an insult to bodybuilders. There are no interesting special effects to redeem this catastrophe, but a lot of fires, explosions, unreasonable sex scene, etc. The only thing that intrigued me was the fact that this is happening after the US-Iraq war that somehow goes nuclear. ..hmmm. Is Roger Corman psychic? Hopefully, "Iraq" was just a lucky choice for Corman, and the rest of his script could not be fulfilled. <br /> <br />
