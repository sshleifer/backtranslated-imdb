I remember very well the bad press that got this movie because of a producers' court order against Clayton Moore using the name "Lone Ranger" or dressing up a black mask for a personal appearance. Whatever the quality of the film, it was the absolute height of myopia and stupidity on the part of producers and their lawyers. I think this lesson was after this film movie, which was widely perceived as some kind of karma for the boss responsible for a lawsuit against Moore, well learned. Recently, it has become a habit of reviving a legendary film or television project to invite the original star or stars to perform in portrait and correctly. Show some respect, you idiots! And even if noses appeared at the prospect, which happened, at least the offer was made. This is proof that film producers, studio executives and entertainment representatives are not too stupid and arrogant to be taught by example.
