The film opens with a scene that just can't be. The man wakes up and while his wife stays in bed, he starts his morning prayer in his bedroom while his wife sleeps peacefully. Morning blessings are recited, but only Gitai finds them controversial. the remainder is omitted. Then, while in philactories and tallis he kisses his wife good morning! It is not a precise display of Jewish prayer in any house, let alone a Hasidic home. Amos Gittai is not interested in accurately portraying the Chassid life. He is interested in how to add to his ever-growing list of melodramatic and empty movies. The rhythmic bath ritual footage is far from accurate, and his Jewish wedding was ridiculous because it was not even closer to the atmosphere of a Chassid wedding. I have many problems with the Hasidic way of life, but I have no sense of comment by Amos Gittai on these issues. He would have thought that chassidim are all dense comformists with severe bouts of depression. I must not agree with the Chassid lifestyle, but I recognize that Hasidic life has many layers. Amos Gitai is blinded by his own secular pseudointelektual stubbority and is therefore unable to portray the exact depiciton of Hasidic life. In addition to his bad research and unbalanced portrayal of Hasidic life, Gitai fails in other aspects as well. The storyline is full of holes, dialogue with silence, the soundtrack is too repetitive and acting, while sometimes mighty was too often loaded with melodrama. The film stretches and turns on and the end isn't worth it. watch if you need to, but be warned. If you want to learn about chassidic life go to communities and talk to chassidim. Don't rely on Gittai's movie!
