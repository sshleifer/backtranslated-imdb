There are many worse Wayne movies. This movie is being edited poorly but has a camping element that allows you to watch it enjoyable. The villain is an Anglo actor who sports ridiculous Mexican clothing and affects an over-the-top Mexican accent that is cheerful. The girl is dressed as would-be Jean Harlow, that's the end of 1934. At least the location shots are beautiful and enjoyable. Watch it and laugh. Don't expect a reputable western but rather light and superficial story with bad behavior but an occasional flash of humor. Wayne is almost ridiculously young and handsome and one can see his acting skills blooming years after this regrettable venture.
