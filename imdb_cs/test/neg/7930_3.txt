This is another pseudo-intellectual "let's make the Nazis look really bad" movie. The Nazis were pretty bad, no doubt - most of them already know. However, it does not necessarily make every movie on a good theme. Discovery Channel presentation "Wannsee Conference" would be much more interesting. "Conspiracy" falls on his ass between two categories: documentary and dramatic. It's not like a documentary, the movie is too "staged" and the presentation is too "common". It doesn't cut it like drama, characters are too shallow and conflicts are too "solved". Another thing is the slogan: "One of the greatest crimes against humanity was committed in a just hour." As the film shows the Wannsee conference, the meeting had nothing to do with reaching a consensus on the final solution. SS The only purpose of the meeting was to make all major stakeholders commit to an already established plan: no decisions or plans were made at the Wannsee conference, there were only threats and coercion (some needed less than others). Finally: One thing the film shows (though in no extraordinary manner) is, man tends to turn to culture and aesthetics in an attempt to conceal for himself the fact that he commits scary atrocities.
