Wow! I just don't know where to start with what made this film so awful. Maybe I should start by saying that during the "warm confrontation" between the opponent and the protagonist, I had to leave the theater because I was so strong. Yeah. The meeting was really so bad. Although it wasn't even the worst. The graph was almost completely displayed in thumbnails. Characters are grossly backward. Dialogue and "dramatic moments" are ridiculous. Bad is cartoon out of control, power drunk, sadist. But hey the actors are nice, so guess it should have been better.
