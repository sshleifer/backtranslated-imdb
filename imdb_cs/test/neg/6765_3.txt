We decided to see this film as an alternative to Polar Express performance at our local IMAX theater. What a waste of time and money! First, it's not cute. The snowman sometimes seemed demonic. Other times he was just a zombie. Most of the time he had no expressions or emotions, and his hollow blue eyes were just scary. Second, Santa introduces a film about the spirit of giving at the beginning. Santa and the snowman who claim to war each other is a film about giving? I'm just a little parody, but it just wasn't fun or fun. The idea that a snowman flute is his voice is different. Too bad you never see or hear a snowman playing his flute ... not even "thank you" Santa. The only funny part of the movie was "outtakes" at the end of the movie. Too bad they didn't use them in the movie. It would be better.
