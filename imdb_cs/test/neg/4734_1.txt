This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and it takes the price of a rotten movie from 2007 (made by me). poor performance, the story is just stupid. I'm really, really disappointed that they could do better than this piece of waste. I just wasted my time and money on this movie. I wish the manufacturing company could return its money. Anyway, I would expect high expectations in this movie and I am disappointed. I do not recommend anyone to watch it. So if you want to waste ur money on something you do on some other thing than this piece of waste.
