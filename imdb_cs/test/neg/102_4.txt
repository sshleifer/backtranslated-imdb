Of course I saw previews of the beginning of some other Lv gate extravagance, so of course it was just the best and therefore it looked interesting. And it's to the point. A young college student (Sarah) finds puzzles everywhere and becomes obsessed with answering them, unknowingly joining a game. Now it is quite interesting, but unfortunately it all got somewhat confused and becomes so complicated that the viewer (like me) will most likely be frustrated. Characters appear with a small introduction, and you're not sure who they are, or why Sarah knows them or is quiet with them. All of this has something to do with this woman who tried to drown the young boy years ago, and her reason was that it was "the whole piece of design." In fact, it is part of a "superficial script" and when the movie ends, you will feel that you have lost about an hour and a half of your life you want back for more productive use of your time, such as cleaning your bathroom. 4 out of 10.
