I watched hundreds of kung fu movies and I heard something good about this movie so I decided to try it. What I saw was one of the worst examples of making a movie I've ever seen. I can't help but feel the director wants to have every guy in Hong Kong in this movie. Everybody drowns into stupidity. Even Conan the barbarian had some courtesy. This film has only half-developed men screaming in every scene and silly women who have no self-esteem. The narrator's character should be killed for sucking so much ... she really didn't deserve to live to the end. The whole movie was a melodramatic disorder, with terrible acting, bad guidance, and misconduct. They should just rename this movie to 'The Stupid One-Armed Caveman with Blade.' Any flow, the film tried to show intensity, but it became almost ridiculous.
