A child puppeteer, for a publicly accessible children's show, overcomes a profound ending when he finds that children having fun at the hospital have been victims of terrible abuse. This film has some of the worst indescribably monstrous parents you ever met. It is not a exploitation film, nor a special school about the risk of child abuse. Mr Rabby, seemingly harmless, takes things into his own hands when the police seem to be castrated by the lack of evidence to condemn the outrageous parents about their terrible mistreatment against their children. Children are emotionless and zombie (.. due to the amount of abuse on them), parents loud, incomprehensibly rough, despicable and aggressive. Especially mothers are so obscene that you will be the root of their execution. They are basically miserable people who take their frustrations on children. Our detectives are tired, frustrated by the entire lawsuit, as the police procedure often fails to prosecute those who have defeated their children into submission. While crimes themselves are abominable, the film does not explicitly regulate grisly activity on the screen. I would say that the reason for seeing it is the performance of Tom Basham as an unbalanced man-child who slipped into psychosis. Between Mr. Rabbey Basham and his guardian, he is shortly after murdering the parents responsible for their child's death, how he lives in fantasy, and how what he has just made an indelible mark, a strange strange table. .mark out changes in behavior, impressive work, from innocent to spooky). Peter Renaday is Lieutenant Hayes, a detective in charge of killing cases, and expresses on his face the tension that is being picked on him. It is the early performance of John Ashton as Detective Matthews, who always raises the wrath of Hayes because of his inability to follow instructions, not to mention how he believes that parents are abusing children. An unpleasant blues score that seems unsuitable for such a movie. Controversial conclusion that even children can tolerate so much. A little slow movement to my taste, but it's an effective use, I felt Basham eyes before he takes care of the business, waiting patiently as he prepares for a strike.
