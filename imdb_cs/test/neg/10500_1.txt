Normally, I won't give movies "1." Even though I am a HEARTLESS critic, I try to find anything that is worth the film worth. The main thing I'm looking for is a coherent plot. If he's alone, I can watch it! Let's start by saying that it doesn't even deserve a movie, it's more like a primary school project ... it went awfully wrong! And I've seen every special Sci-Fi movie ever created. Many times I have read professional critical reviews that say it's like "I played this as TV-made ... (etc.)" and I kept saying, "Come on, I wish to remember REAL criticism. "That's worse ... much worse! This is really the worst "thing" I've seen that lasted the length of the movie (if I considered it a movie, it would be my new worst movie of all time), and I saw every Uwe Boll movie made! This movie makes Uwe Boll look like Francis Ford Coppola! :) I'd rather watch Jaws the Revenge all day and see it again ... even 5 minutes ... was one good scene and it was END! ;-P OK enough to hit the works of Ron Hall, now for serious criticism. The script is poorly written, the dialogue comes in a wooden way, the effects are cheesier than those in the Power Rangers show, and they don't even start moving on the screen in transitions (ugh). Someone was actually watching this thing, adjusting it and then saying, "Okay, release it"? I'd rather burn it than release him! In the end, all I can say is "Thank God and DVD and VHS players have Stop and Eject!" My advice ... don't rent it, if you do, you'll be glad you got a stop and get fired too! :)
