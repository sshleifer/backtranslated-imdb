Quick Resume: Almost non-existent, poorly selected music soundtrack, stable video shooting without fixed, but with lots of coffee and overactive cameraman, no conspiracy and nothing will happen at all. The film passes from one dialogue to another, sounding hollow, never reaching depth, never creating the illusion that you are actually inside the conspiracy web, and anyone who has a relationship with everyone is just a boring apology that shows the main actress in nice underwear. (which in combination with her rusty voice is definitely nice, but nothing to be based on) The highest point for me is the opening scene and the movie just dropped from there to the point where I wanted to leave the movie for about 45 years. into the story. I'm sorry I was sitting.
