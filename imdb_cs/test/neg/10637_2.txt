When I first saw this movie in the theater, I was so angry. In my opinion, it was completely thrown away. I haven't seen it for decades, and then I've decided what the hell we're gonna see. I look at all Hellraiser movies to see where it was wrong. My guess is that it was with continued 5, which was the first to implement the whole "I am in a dream omg I see strange things, oh noes what's going on, oh its a dream, oh its not a dream, oh wait something I see scary, oh don't mind" -sucky story. These sequels do not even require the box to be opened, or follow the rules of the first 4 movies, which, if you saw a pinhead, are largely closed and dead. The first three hellers held on to this storyline, which made it so scary in the first place. Nothing fancy, nothing strange, the box opened up the boom they came up with. Kirstey was the only one who could negotiate her way, first for Uncle Frank. Then, because she had information on cenobites. At least this film is trying to stick to it all, even though it was a bad story, it was still somewhat hell. No, I'm sure Part 5 was the first part to totally and totally destroy the Hellraiser series. Now they're being redesigned 1, and I don't even think I'm gonna watch that. Oh, who am I kidding probably will and probably will be disappointed .... again.
