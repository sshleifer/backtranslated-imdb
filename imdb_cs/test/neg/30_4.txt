Rita Hayworth is sometimes just overwhelming, and for me the only reason to watch this stupid movie. Despite the overhanging lipstick of the 1940s, Rita was one of the most beautiful women in Hollywood. In fact, I can't imagine for a couple of years being someone who looked better, except for Elizabeth Taylor in her premiere. The star show, Gene Kelly, doesn't play his normal, at least the guy we know of "Singin 'In The Rain." Here, Kelly is "Danny McGuire" pouts a lot of time. Phil Silvers, whom I loved on TV on "Sgt. Bilko", is as stupid as "Genius", who just crouch and listen to his stupid jokes .... and they're stupid. The visuals are good with a great Technicolor, which almost looks amazing. You'll also see lots of pretty women, not just Hayworth. Unfortunately, the story is not that much. It centers around Hayworth making career choices. On the way, we get a normal shabby treatment of marriage and get an insultingly stupid ending. All in all, infallible film, with the exception of Hayworth's beauty show.
