If you are looking for a movie that allows you to sleep, then the Heart of Darkness is your heart. The book wasn't what I expected to be, and the film disappointed me even further. The cast list was pitiful and the whole plot was pathetic and not like a book except for a few scenes. I understand that everyone has their own opinion when reading the Heart of Darkness, and they create their own film in their heads, but the director cuts through important scenes and adds meaningless scenes. If there were someone in the film who should be from a certain culture, they should use the actor who was from that culture. There are actors from every place, and I'm sure they might find better to fit the role. Joseph Conrad was a decent man and created a book that will keep you entertained if that's what you're looking for, but the movie was cheap and useless, and someone who could make the film as decent as the book did. If you want a film that pulls you into the dark, then the movie Heart of Darkness is for you.
