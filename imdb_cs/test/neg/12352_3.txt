Rabbit Fever is one of those movie traits. It is a pleasant 90 minutes, it requires only a few viewers and adds so much, and on any terrestrial TV channel, even in a first-class time frame, I think Rabbit Fever would be well received. Which makes me wonder why it was pushed into the cinema. The film is filmed in the style of a television documentary and presents us 6 women who have an addictive relationship with the Rabbit vibrator. The film is primarily focused on exploring the supposed addictive quality of the famous sex aid product. The story is 100% language in the face around the world. The storyline is a powerful, introduction to some well rounded and sympathetic characters, some nice back story, peripheral characters and situations evolving into an engaging story, and conclusions. Unfortunately, there is nothing that is smart or new. Rabbit Fever has a few sharp moments, several switches that indicate what writers are capable of, and all credit is not just 90 minutes of button gags and allusions. my mother. But there is laziness about some of the scenes that keep her back, you've done these moments for her when you want it to be outrageous, and all you get is a cluster of sit-coms. I laughed, I left the theatrical feeling of empathy for the characters, but I also kept the bitter thought that someone took a 90-minute disc made for television, light entertainment, and tried to put it in the national cinema. I think Rabbit Fever achieves some of what she has set, it's an unpredictable item, a rounded story, a well-presented cast and a good 90 minute diversion. But there is nothing that could justify the extravagance of the cinema environment. On the contrary, several commercial breaks would give the viewer a chance to catch a breath of life that apparently does not.
