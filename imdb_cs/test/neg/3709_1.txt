ZERO Stars of **** <br /> <br /> Infinite descent has absolutely no redeeming values, be it ridiculously bad acting, ridiculously awful special effects, incompetent direction, stupid script or torturously annoying musical score. It is a kind of pitiful production that makes me wonder how such a film could have even the slightest consideration of being greenlighted in the studio. I don't think I'm going to plunge into a plot than say it's a lot of people who are trapped underwater and have to kill many false-looking creatures. <br /> <br /> Let me take a closer look at what's so terrible. First, the deal is just terrible. Jack Scalia is ten times worse than Sylvester Stallone, a performance that is tough enough to do it. Supporting performances are no better. And what about actor Luis Lorenzo, the guy who plays the cook, Francisco. He has a high voice and an accent that sounds good for comedy, not a science fiction horror movie. <br /> <br /> Special effects are even worse. Creatures range from strange eels to giant starfish and "most". The effects look like something you would see in the muppet movie, and I don't think I have to go further in this problem. Director JP Simon has a mild cult status for all the horrible movies he has made. I'm sure some will enjoy the Endless Descent in Ed Wood's style, but I don't think it's that good. Everything he does is poor, especially a cameraman. The man can't control the movie, that's all there is to him. This was the last of four underwater movies and it certainly does Leviathan and Deep Star Six (both bad movies in their own right) compared to they start to look masterful. Either way, just stick to The Abyss.
