Like JAG. It has a spell, but lately it is for many propaganda in it. For an outsider (non-American), the patriotic feeling may be a little larger. I don't like the fact that Rabb and MacKenzie come from lawyers (as it was in the early days of the television) to become a super heros who will stop the wars and save the entire continents. It's almost like watching a US Army recruitment video. I'm still watching the show, so it's not that bad. But I'd rather want more episodes when Rabb and MacKenzie investigate military accidents and will not save the world in the future.
