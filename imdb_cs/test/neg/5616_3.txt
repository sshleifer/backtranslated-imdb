For one, I actually expected this movie to be pretty good, maybe my expectations were a bit high, but the fact is I like Judd Nelson. In fact, this is the only reason why this film is worth watching and its role is not so great. The main points of this film are exciting sex scenes and boring dialogue. If this is the best, I'm sure your pretty good idea of ​​what movie it is. It is certainly the reason why it was a TV movie. You only see it if you can't do anything better on Friday night, or just waste money on video stores. Save time and rent The Breakfast Club!
