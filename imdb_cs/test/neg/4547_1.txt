When I decided to try to watch a cryogenic zombie movie, I didn't expect much. That's exactly what I got, and then even less. Except for the lack of special effects (squibs?) And the serious lack of some acting talent, "Chilling" also sports the absolute worst scenario I've ever seen in the movie. I had to stop the tape several times in the first 45 minutes to repair the damage caused to my intellect for witnessing such a nasty dialogue as it is here. In addition, a collection of characters is so formal and one-dimensional is ridiculous: a corrupt doctor; his assistant, played by Linda Blair (we know she is his "assistant" because he repeatedly refers to her by that title); a recently widowed gold merchant with a romantic interest in Blair's character; his criminal son; an alcoholic, insulting, unemployed friend of Blair's character who we are presented with in the most beautiful use of flashback; and, of course, a rough, hard, bearded security guard who becomes a hero. Apparently, the preservative fluid used by some cryogenic laboratories on their bodies is highly conductive, which naturally results in a catastrophe when all of the lab's containers end up in a remarkable sequence of events during a lightning storm (on Halloween Night, not less). As for the zombies themselves, if you love watching people in green latex masks walk in suits of aluminum foil, then "The Chilling" is a movie for you. The zombie action is very weak at best; It seems that the primary method of killing zombies has grabbed people by the shoulders and shook them to death. The merchant and security are doing most of the zombie fighting, including a very thrilling scene of re-freezing undead with liquid nitrogen. Let me tell you that the steel mill scene at "T2" has nothing to do with "The Chilling" in portraying an enemy that has frozen in its footsteps. How Linda Blair ended up in the middle of this piece of dreck is truly a mystery. It is true that her career in the 1980s (unfortunately) did not escape, but this film is embarrassing for her. The script does not have the decency to use it for good use. Most that her character is set to do, is to shout things like "Here They Come", "Do Something", "Fast!". All I can say is that poor Linda has been compensated for her work on this film in food doses. The hero is Grizzly Adams himself, Dan Haggerty. In this picture he faces a tough acting competition of his beard and security dog ​​and does everything in his power to overcome both. The only frightening part of "The Chilling" is an introduction that brings the factual elements of cryogenics and suggests that "the movie you're about to see can happen in your own community". When I counted the number of times a few names were repeated in the final credits, I was on the floor to suddenly see that Lucasfilm had received credit. Fortunately, it was just for the film's sound production. 1/10.
