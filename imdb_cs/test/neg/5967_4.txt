I saw the original Italian movie. It has to be said that acting and interpretation is most heavily polluted by the trend generated by television stations, speaking with a heavily muted voice, not with moving lips, with exciting tones, as shown in "It's a real life" and "Let's-raise" - Your audience-with-couple-tear-screen-playwriting. Late Massimo Girotti relies on other characters for intensity, clarity of expression and intellectual honesty. The film has some good advice, but (like in another commentary before me), it lacks focus and dribbles away in many fences that have less and less relevance, another trend drawn from television productions, well known to Italians. Several drops of style, such as Confectionery Dessert (cooking charm and aesthetics, and sensual utility of sweets, see Chocolat, Lunch Babette, Vatel, etc.), could be saved to the public. Hammam and fairies are definitely truer, Ozpetek has learned the tune of Italy in the early days 2000s and buzzing together ... I'll give him a last chance though ...
