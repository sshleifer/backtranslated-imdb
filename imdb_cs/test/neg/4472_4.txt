4 out of 10. <br /> <br /> This film was neither witty as a whole nor worthy of any emotion being invested in characters. Eugene Levy is probably the most funny .... The rest of the cast do their job, but the story never gets too deep and there are plenty of holes on the plot that will never fill. It wasn't much fun, though sometimes it was fun. <br /> <br />
