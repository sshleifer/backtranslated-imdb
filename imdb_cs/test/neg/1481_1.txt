Classic waste! Basically, what we have here is a story about several American teenagers (one male, one female, both beautiful people) who seem to be psychically connected, because each time they get asleep, they can inhabit other dreams and express all the other innermost desires ... I think Mills & Boon meets X-Files and you'll be near the mark somewhere. Actually, it's more like an unfortunate hybrid between one of Ed Wood's great B-movies and the particularly silly episode of Melrose Place, so special effects are so cheap and so amateur is acting. Actors who inhabit (I wouldn't say act) this movie say their lines like reading from cue cards and handcuffs when they are supposed to be showing emotions, and it comes as no big shock (or loss to the industry) that since time disappeared into the unknown. The whole thing is just a ridiculously misleading blend of styles that are unrelated at all, and the end result is an interesting curiosity that, no doubt, in the years when such bad film directors break down in good movies, pilgrims will take care of them. come. I will probably be the only person to ever comment on this movie, but if you read and see it, please come back here, it's a little lonely.
