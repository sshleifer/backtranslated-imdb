As a fan of the former C.J. movie, The Last Days, I really wanted to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br /> The nicest thing I can say is that it's NOT a THREAT movie. There are some good performances, and a few funny scenes. Especially Tori Spelling has a few great scenes where she talks to her fiancé's former friend. Overall, it's a nice week. The script often relies on strange coincidences and clichés of film moments. (The main character went to Stanford for a golf scholarship and his high school friend doesn't even know he plays the game?) Most of the time, this movie had no idea where it was. it is what he is trying to say. There are lots of scenes that are slightly cute, but eventually it turns out to be a waste of time. And you could easily cut half the characters out of the movie without losing anything. Yet, for all the mistakes I would have to say, it is one of the better gay movies of recent years. What he says a lot about how bad is most gay movies. I hope another movie by C.J. it will be better.
