I am usually not inclined to write reviews about movies that I don't think deserve mention. But in an effort to grow as a writer and film critic, I think it's important to express our thoughts when I don't like film. "Queen of the Damned" is one of those films. The popular horror stories of Anne Rice about Lestat, the bisexual Vampire, first appeared in 1994 in the successful "Vampire Interview." Play two of the biggest Hollywood heavyweights at Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt, a stylish aesthetic and gothic mission en film captures the audience. Although it could be a way to style through the way, there was something about working, despite his chess (I've never been so fond of the Vampire genre in general). Since then, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise have gone on much bigger things. It is likely that both of them would roar with laughter as they asked to continue. If they had seen the final result, they would be even more. "Queen of the Damned" is cr * p Hollywood is happy to release at a low price, hoping to earn a quick reward thanks to the average soundtrack and big marketing campaign targeting 13-17 year olds. Needless to say, this film is terrible from the beginning. Lestat, now played by Stuart Townsend of "Shooting Fish" fame, wakes up from his dark grave to sound ... you guessed it, Nu-Metal. Invokes some confused punkish musicians and joins his band on condition that they only appear at night, with the sun that burns on the skin and all day ... Jesse (Marguerite Moreau) A student studying paranormal (perhaps vampire study 101) tries to find out if Lestat really is who he says he is. On his way to him (something to do with her strange past), he has little competition in Queen Akasha (Aaliyah), the queen of vampire demons who returns from the underworld to gain Lestat as her chosen king. > <br /> The film is shamefully self-confident, yet its camp tones leave some room for its disgusting humor. Anyone who sees this movie for nothing but a good laugh must see more movies in general! Watching Townsend is nice. He knows that the role is totally over the top and does everything he can to walk the rope between total hamming and serious action. Unfortunately, the late Aaliyah is terrible in the title role. She has minimal screentime, and what she does, she doesn't use to the fullest. Bad makeup and special effects don't help; sometimes it sounds like she is talking over the voicemail. It is said that this film was directed right into the video until Aaliyah's premature death last year. With the possibility for people to view their final film, Warner Bros. has published it. Otherwise, it would be one of those movies you see on the shelf in the video store, but avoid because you can say it's just awful. Undoubtedly, there will be films like this. Check out the teen rom-com rip off or spoofing this genre alone with movies like "Not Another Teen Movie". If there is a market that uses Hollywood, it will. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem I have with this movie is not the film itself. Hollywood is about making money, so if there is a market for this movie, they will watch it. That's business. But what worries me most is that people will be actively going to the movies and paying money to watch it! I think this is the biggest argument in the world of cinema: is the first film art and entertainment the other, or is it the other way around? The only people who can decide is the audience. If you like and are impressed with good movies, stay out of this turkey.
