After consuming "Human Pork Chops" and digesting it properly, I felt compelled and obliged to inform potential viewers that chewing this product was NOT a FUNCTION and its nature LOW nutritional value. <br /> <br /> According to the blunt nature of this movie, the next WARNING will be more than REVIEW. This is the first time I wanted the IMDB to have an IMDB "I-don't-to-rate-this-movie" button because the only response to this boring piece of TRASH is stasis and indifference. Any possible assessment would make injustice to all the other items listed here, "10" is in any case off the question, "1" could convince some readers that this is one of those "when it's so bad that it's actually really bad and it's kewl! ", and" 5 "is also unsatisfactory, people may think it's OK and it's fine if you want to have some funny fun that's not ... Honest to God, it's not even "10", zero or 5, it's nothing, a black hole, FUTURE EMBRYO WORK. " I bought a 3 DVD region that was cheap (7 bucks !!!) and had a good image quality, I bought it mainly thanks to positive and promising reviews that were posted under my own record. Oh, boy, I was supposed to be AMENED. This film is neither shocking nor disgusting, neither unsettling nor ... it is not even ridiculous, it does not take too seriously to laugh, but it is still serious enough not to be comical. Really unreal, amateur effort. The only sequence I found MILDLY DISTURBING is when two giggling robbers put a nasty dog ​​into a bag and bash it against a brick wall ... but even such a cruel assumption only led to a poor performance. The next quoted TOILET SCENE is unrealistic and filmed without any sense of tension, suffering or humiliation - feces look like painted swamps !!! At the end of the loooong there is a butcher's scene where three men dressed in plastic raincoats (a set that one can find on the front cover of the DVD) will begin to destroy the female body. It reminded me of "American Psycho" and "Shallow Grave", now these movie creations are worth watching and real masterpieces. Be REALISTIC once and no hurry to make every Asian like a mythical haunted movie, as it seems ... <br /> <br /> If you're looking at some Eastern horror then try Danny Lee's masterpiece from the same (English) title "Ba Xian fan dian zhi ren rou cha shao bao" (Human Pork Chop) since 1992 and has - without reason I could add - was compared to " Henry: Portrait of a serial killer ". There is also a similar film telling the same story by another film crew called "Ren tou dou fu fu" ("There is a secret in my soup") of the same year, a kind of competitive production. It is available as Region 3 DVD and most regarded as superior to "Peng Shi Zhi Sang Jin Tian Liang". I could add a few more words about special effects ... what special effects ?! ... there are several chopped limbs, they look terrible - in the wrong sense - probably "Made in Hong Kong". /> <br /> This is all the information I can share on this topic, hopefully it will be useful ... Enjoy your food!
