Parrots? PARROTS? I've been around this old country longer than most and I've seen almost all the Westerns who have made. The history of the old west is my passion. Comanche Moon is one of the most poorly produced, directed and played stories I've ever seen. There was very little historical accuracy, but then, it is obvious that you were working on a budget line that <br /> <br /> played a significant role in this insult to intelligence. I'm glad I did TIVO. It was bad enough to sit and watch the movie plus those ads. Once again, there was no actor who was convincing. I was hoping it would improve for three days. POORLY! I am ashamed to say that I spent 4 and a half hours of little time left unnecessarily.
