It is a poorly written and poorly directed short film, clean and simple. What is interesting and to a certain extent follows the values ​​of production. The video shot seems to have a bad scenario and a wrong direction, one would think it would also have a terrible production value. This is what the viewer expects when they watch a movie that is horrible and shot at the video. But not in this case, they spent some money and it shows. Keeping me very interested in what comes next, just see! Probably the worst short movie I've seen was that it looked a big budget Hollywood, though it was shot on some kind of video format. Instead of spending money to spend on somewhat impressive stage design, it would be nicer to see a better done story with some good direction. But then again, how can we expect it to be new filmmakers when it is not even Hollywood.
