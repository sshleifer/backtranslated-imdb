I have seen "professional" reviews claiming that Julia Roberts plays herself was "smart and very funny". I think not. The actress plays herself? And do it with her usual dizziness whenever she tries to comedy? Talk about Hollywood narcissism at its maximum. Why doesn't he just go there and go: "Me, me, me. Look at me!" The director and writer should be shot for not thinking about something better than what could have been a charming sequel. and by the way, Steven, when viewers start paying more attention to strange camera angles than the story you have a problem. Capra, Hitchcock, all used some creative cameras, but they were talented enough not to lose their audience or just show up with the camera. You seem to have forgotten the basic rule of filmmaking in the name of "style". But Pitt and Zeta Jones are quite good, maybe if the film is more focused around and dropping narcissism that might work. Zeta Jones again demonstrates her talent and beauty. Unfortunately, this film wastes talent and fails on many accounts. I want my money back.
