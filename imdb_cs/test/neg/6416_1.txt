In a word, a terrible god ... too many conspiratorial holes .. um, yeah ... Who takes his child to dig a dead body in the middle of the night? and what's going on with the wife who stole the skeleton ... who does this? why did the stinging of the throat go down? And the whole dog thing .. I mean, really! Having a Sparrow to tell from the beginning also just totally ruined the tension for me. ? Of course, in such a film you expect holes in the movie. But there are so many of them that I completely lost about the story. What Name Is Fingerling? Or Topps? Why did the woman dig her body? (Who does it?) Or go to that crazy haunted asylum? Where do all the candles come from? Why does the writer have his PO BOX in a crazy book ??? I think come on ... And the book just happens to find its way to the bookstore next to the wife? Too comfortable ... Oh and happy birthday Honey, this is a serial killer book .. What a gift! The book is 20 pages long, half of which is empty and insists that FOREVER reads it. If he's really obsessed with this book, wouldn't he read it all in one shot? A little suitable for him to run into his future wife (carry a cake!) About 23 seconds after being released from a psychiatric hospital .. how old was he? 36 ?? <br /> <br /> Was I the only one who took the bus at the end so that the guy actually started? It's not good if you eventually stretch it to bite the protagonist. It seems that the committee wrote it. I imagine that the first draft with number 23 had nothing to do with it. ... It looks like they need some striking hook to help the audience think that something supernatural is happening when it finally seemed to have nothing to do with anything. I didn't expect a godfather or anything, but everything about this film was completely abandoned. Without all the numerologies, this movie could be fine, instead of some hackney Se7en knockout. It is not a frightening, unintentionally cheerful and otherwise complete snoozer.
