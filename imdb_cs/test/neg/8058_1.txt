This movie was incredibly bad ... It's cruel, but violence is too much to the point where it looks extremely false and predictable. Since everything will show you, there is nothing on the imagination. And the plot ... what plot? There really is nothing! Stimulation is incredibly slow (despite the violent acts of violence) and the script must be written by a beaten 12-year-old boy who kills for fun. So this movie was banned in 31 countries? I saw why ... not because of gore (boring and trite), but because it was a horrible movie. It should have been BANNED since existence. Avoid it, such as plague. 1 out of 10
