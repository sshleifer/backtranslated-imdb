I know most other reviews say this movie was great, but I have to disagree. Sure, it's a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was little. But it's not just for theaters. Maybe a short half-hour short, but I don't see how they could make a small children's book into the whole feature film. It's a cute movie, but I would only recommend it to really small children. Older children will not be interested. Adults may be slightly more interested if they look at them with their young. But every age 7-adult will have a snore-fest. <br /> <br /> Sorry if you disagree with me, but this is my opinion. :)
