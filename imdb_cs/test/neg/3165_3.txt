This love story between an American journalist and a Eurasian lady doctor does not contain much conflict because it is largely westernized (studied in London) and no fireworks because it is rather restrained. What little interest the story can lift is even more defeated by their wooden dialogues. They are supposed to be two cosmopolitan intellectuals, but they speak as if words put a Hollywood hack in their mouth that is not very alone. The film also suffers from the incredible lack of realism - a totally abandoned beach in a crowded little Hong Kong that has surpassed a million Chinese refugees? And probably a perfect American journalist at the age of 40 who doesn't know what a hysterectomy is? Hollywood ideas. Finally "song". After learning about twenty times throughout the movie, it started with credits, tends to lose some of his emotional impact, sorry to say that.
