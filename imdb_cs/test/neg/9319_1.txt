Well, I remember when the studio dropped Schrader and hired Harlin to take pictures of this movie, but they were right when they did. Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist is simply a bad movie, it's boring, It would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who condemned Harlin's version in such great words even if no one has ever seen it, they would be right. But they weren't. In short: Schrader has no idea what a horror movie should be and shows a great way. Droll, boring, unintentionally funny at all the bad places and bad support cast. <br /> <br /> Save your money and nerves, you don't see it.
