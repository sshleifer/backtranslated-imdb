He just watched Joe Morton see him in an early role, and he sincerely wished I hadn't bothered, could, and had far better results than that crap. I cannot understand why someone will find such a kind of stupidity funny, but everyone to themselves; it is utter mess and the smallest joke. No waiting, the ONE line was just funny where Mr. Kent (Joe) and his family have dinner with this nut because he was invited to dinner (The Lord himself knows why). Pest to Mr Kent: You know what a dog is like, you were there Mrs. Kent: Recently, Joe's expression was funny, but that's because one line doesn't make a great comedy and this is so far from it Be funny. to be sent to the nearest basket, it's just good. Joe Morton - glad he no longer appears in such waste; you are far better and great actor.
