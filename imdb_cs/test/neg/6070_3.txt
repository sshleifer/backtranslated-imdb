Trite and unoriginal. It's like someone watching the Immortal Beloved and Amadeus and deciding to mix them together and steal other formulas from other movies in this process to create more. As with most historical films, there are some inaccuracies nowadays, because history is manipulated to better suit a story that is largely understandable. For example, during the remaining days of Beethoven's life, it was necessary for other people to write what they needed to say for him to understand them. Of course, that would be annoying if I had to show up on the screen. Although the script is filled with some quoted lines, it does not fully capture the feeling of the time, and along with some misbehavior, it seems rather contemporary. Diane Kruger is pretty pretty looking at her, but she's still busy at her craft. Ed Harris doesn't work for me like Beethoven, and I blame Gary Oldman for that. Overall, it was not a very good interpretation of the musical life of the maestra. It's better to find a copy of the immortal loved one. <br /> <br /> http://iwascalledclementine.multiply.com/reviews
