This film is a complete waste of time. I can't understand that someone is sitting over this piece of waste. I'd like to love it when I was seven. I think a seven-year-old child could write and direct it. There is no scenario, no play, just garbage. The best part is that fighting cocks. I think I could flog ninjas and I'm not someone you think is hard. Absolutely unconvincing and not providing the least interest. By the end of the first ten minutes of the movie, I yawned and laughed. This is the one that would turn people away from martial arts movies. Great comedy, bad action.
