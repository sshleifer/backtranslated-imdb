He just saw it ... story, storyline, script doesn't make sense! His Samvise brave part 2 (without RING), his characters appear from blue (no reason), her Hercules hated everyone (no one knows why), his Leelee Sobiesky showing her real talents (two of them), his lousy special effects, his a few good actors wasting their talents (I mentioned two talents of Leelee ???) ... do I have to say more ??? ARE EASY, even for NBC-TV standards !!! It's just the lowest .... what waste! By the way: how can you give people this mini-series so many stars ????? It's behind me! I have to make 10 lines so this is my last word: avoid, avoid if u are considering buying!
