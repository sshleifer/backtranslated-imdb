A ridiculous thriller in which a group of students kidnapped their bad and neurotic teacher (Mirren) just to prevent her action against them. An interesting assumption could make a good movie, but this is just lame and far more appealing. At least boring at least with ending embarrassment. Mrs. Mirren is trying to give this misfire a dignity, but even she - a good actress - does not doubt it - she could save this waste. I give it 4 (four).
