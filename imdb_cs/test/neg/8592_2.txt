When I first watched this movie, I thought it would be a good rally because it was my favorite actor of all time. It gives excellent performance, although it is quite obvious that it did not have to live more than half of a finger to do the job. It is the only good thing in it if you are not in explosions and the American clutch workers' basket (which I am not). <br /> <br /> I don't get it. How can this film escape with the fact that it is so diesel. A little bit that the little boy was saved, I think, come on! You can't tell me he would be rescued without wearing any glasses (I know there would be a black pitch and you can't see more than a few feet before and no breathing equipment (he'd choke after 2 minutes!) the movie was bad, OK? <br /> <br /> Why Robert? WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY ???? !!!! <br /> <br /> Sorry if it's your favorite movie.
