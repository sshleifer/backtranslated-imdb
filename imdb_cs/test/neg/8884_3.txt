I did here this movie was good from different people. And like Natalie Portman and Javier Bardem, as well as director Miloš Forman. After watching this movie, I really had nothing to admire about it. First, acting was very below average. The performances were not strong enough to really feel shocked by what the Inquisition was doing. Javier Bardem made a solid performance and was probably the only one who actually had a Spanish accent. It is quite obvious why this Bardem was the only one. Natalie Portman, which I think is a very good and coming actress, really didn't like me to be tortured. Like the movie, there was nothing to admire her performance. Stellan Skarsgaard, who I like, gave a very average performance as well as other actors who have a boring performance. This film was basically about him because he plays Goya. Yet he didn't become what he needed to make this film good. And what about Randy Quaid? You gotta be kidding me. He played King Carlos IV. See that he is great in comedies, but he plays the king who just describes the whole movie for you. The director was just terrible in this movie. When the film is a mess, there are usually two people behind it: the director and the writer. I feel that Miloš Forman really didn't want his actors to give a Spanish accent. From very few battle scenes, they were all displayed terribly. Also, as a director, he must give you a sense of shock from what the Inquisition did. After this movie, I felt like I couldn't care about this event. To sum it up, he was wrong in filming scenes and mistakenly actors. Writing, also written by Milos Forman, was just as bad or maybe even worse than directing. There really was nothing unforgettable from the movie except one saw where Bardem was getting the same treatment that Portman got. Otherwise, the film didn't give you a sense of time and at least it could be spent with quote or two. <br /> <br /> After completing this movie I was just watching TV. I'm thinking OK why should I care about it. I take care of me and I'm interested in history, but when movies like this appear as if the producers robbed you of something good that could be removed from the movie. When movies are so bad, we point out many technical mistakes in the movie than if it were good. As accents. I'm not sure people would stress the lack of Spanish accents if the film was good. <br /> <br /> The whole point of this review is to say that don't look at it.
