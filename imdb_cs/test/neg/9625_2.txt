Well, that was a loss of Dave McKean's talent, right? Don't get me wrong: when it comes to graphic design, Dave McKean can be the best in the world right now. A layered, textured look that can only reach a few pencil lines on rough paper expends people like Peter Greenaway and David Fincher to what they are: hackwork. McKean was the godfather of the revolution in comics, film, and even magazine ads that lend a distinctive effect to the collage he was promoting. But this movie? It's junk. Complete waste. Unfortunately, the story, by Neil Gaiman, is exactly what Gaiman has given us since Clive Barker first broke off: a pseudo-mythical, crowded dreamscape, populated by characters who have titles in all caps, rather than names. Everything is allegory, to the point that it is impossible to get any human drama, emotion or empathy from anyone. People are making overwhelming postings, speaking in riddles that remind of what Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead sounded, as if Tom Stoppard was suffering from a debilitating stroke halfway through his composition. Really, Gaiman, go alone. You're not a prophet. You're fucking. McKean's overhead does not help - his stimulation is bad, taking half an hour to actually turn up the main picaresque chart and then simply provide the disconnected sequence. events, none of them got any weight. Monsters do not worry because they are not heralded, simply thrown onto the screen. The story doesn't matter because we don't really care about rancid little protagonists. Half of the dialogue, muttered into the shirt-queue and the ubiquitous masks, is unintelligible. Some of the visuals are nice and I'm sure the fans will lick it. Damage. Think of the amount of really good work McKean could produce if he wasn't in this lame project. <br /> <br /> Level: D / D-
