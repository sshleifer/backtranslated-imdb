This very finely crafted film commits an unforgivable (which is ironic, given the film's theme). Nobody who comes to this film knows what they are for. Worse than that, 3/4 of the way to the movie, no one yet has a clue about what they are in, because everything is a different film to that point. a leading fan of the first two Dutch films, who have so far easily competed for the best 2 Mormon films (competing with Saints and Soldiers and now, New York Doll, seen during the screening), the Dutchman wanted to see his movie very long time. I was there. I wanted to believe that I will see another big Mormon movie, one that would hold Numero Uno for a very long time. But not. Three quarters of the film shot the sharpest left corner and dragged me through something I didn't want to go through. He Takes Mt. Everest of all moral questions, yes, both of them, with little time or emotional ability that has been given enough attention to them, but instead will lead them both by nodding to Jesus as if they did it all right, instantly. (It's true that Jesus rescues. Don't blame me for not believing it. It's not the Dutchman's problem.) <br /> <br /> Is the film filmed well? Indeed. Acting actors? They kept their pants. Was music appropriate? Everything but what was over the final credits. Everything about this film was excellent, except for a story that was so dull and bad that nothing else matters. (I learned a "dank" from the New York Doll, a very decent show, by the way.) The third act of the film was neither desirable nor pleasant or believing. I know the Dutchman bent back to do it, but at that moment I was pulled out of the movie so that nothing, nothing, could bring me back. The absurd incredibility of dozens of details has not helped in recent minutes. Anyone on a mission knows what I'm talking about, especially everyone who? Spoiler Alert? He is familiar with events around someone who is sent home from a mission soon for moral and / or psychological reasons. It is as if the parallel universe suddenly appeared where normal rules or behaviors do not apply at once. There's a million good things on this movie, but they were created and beautified just to be trampled and thrown away in the "ooh, that's really the" elitism. Therefore, unforgivable. I can only hope that when the Dutchman finishes his other films ("Apparently Falling"), he recalls that film critics can only buy so many tickets and that fans pay. That is why God's first army was such an unqualified success. The Dutch shock and respect for attitude show that when it comes to great questions, it is on its way through a head that has neither spiritual nor creative maturity. business sense that is needed. I pray, I pray, he learns his lesson and those years from now we all look back, with a grin, and rejoice that he has pulled his head out of where the Light is not shining and really, successfully, taking on these and other issues and thanks it will change the world forever.
