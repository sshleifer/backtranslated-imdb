Well, because it is called Porn Holocaust and director Joe D'Amato, I went to this movie expecting sleaze ... and when I got it a bit, Porn Holocaust was a huge disappointment because it's so damned BORING. The title suggests that the movie will contain porn, and it's not bad - Porn Holocaust is pretty much just porn, and most of them are still the same thing, I was fast forward before the end. The first sex scene is between two women and it has my hopes up, but after it just degenerates into normal porn, and the rest of the movie (in the first hour!) Is formed by talking, and you can imagine how much fun it is to sit ! The story focuses on a deserted island, where something or something is happening, believe it or not. Naturally, it's not long before a group of people - made up of several men and some scientists who become sexy women - land on the island. They have sex several times and some strange things happen, an hour later they are attacked by a mutant zombie creature with eyes for ladies ... This must have looked like a good idea of ​​original porn - a zombie who likes it but it is not surprising that it does not work at all. The film is shot for only ten minutes less than two hours, which is too long for a movie. I have no idea why Porn Holocaust is as long as it is; If only one minute they broke out of every sex scene, the film would be under ninety minutes, and that would be much more tolerant! Zombie takes what appears to be eternity to appear (it's been a long time before there is a sex break long enough to actually travel to the island in the first place), and when it eventually appears, it's a huge disappointment! I realize this is a low budget B-movie garbage, but D'Amato certainly could try a little harder and come up with something better than that! Nor will I bother to mention acting, the atmosphere, etc., It makes no sense. Porn Holocaust is basically just your average boring porn movie with a slight sprinkling of horror, and I can't recommend it!
