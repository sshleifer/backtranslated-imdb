This is unique in the Hitchcock movies I've seen, in that I really enjoyed it. In fact, I found it quite predictable and unpleasant. Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are newlyweds. It's a kind of "lovely Roamer" character you've seen in many movies without being nice to me. In fact, it was barely believable at best, and at times it seemed particularly untrue and unlikely. Grant is unable to withhold work and try to live a rich lifestyle and is encouraged to borrow money he cannot pay. Fontaine believes she is trying to kill her to get the money she is insured for; and probably what her late father was worth. The average and rather uninteresting whole round actually, but as usual you can see the impact on the movies that came later.
