This is basically your running miller violent biker movie complete with handy slangs, crashes and music. OK, just slang and crashes. It's a slight notch above much of the other MST3K fare, but it's still the equivalent of nail-to-knee driving: slow and painful. Giving a conspiracy would run out of my energy, so I'll just say you should skip this.
