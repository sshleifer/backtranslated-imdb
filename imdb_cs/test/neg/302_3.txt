"Secret Life" begins with the worst possible narrative: "The crimes committed by Jeffrey Dahmer are too terrible to make a film about ...". Okay, so what do you suggest? That we shouldn't bother to keep track of how the film won't be accurate or bloody? And they were right! The film is not a bit shocking and contains almost no blood or gore. Although I think it is mainly because of low budget production values ​​and not because of Dahmer's crimes that are too terrible. Basically, "The Secret Life: Jeffrey Dahmer" is just one sequence to repeat over and over. Young, pitiful and mentally confused Jeffrey raises the victims (always men because he was gay), kills them and then talks about how it wasn't his intention to hurt them and how lonely he was. This is boring and very fast and even the admirable performance of unknown actor Carl Crew cannot save this film from the overall bagpipe. However, this version is much better than the pretentious and hopelessly confused "Dahmer" released in 2002.
