I have to give Billy Deem recognition for trying to pull it out. Knowing it was a blaxploitation movie, I started my DVD with some expectations. I knew it would be a low budget ... an actor's par ... but he hoped there would be a few gems in it. If some diamonds or gems appeared in this film, they would be successfully buried under tons and tons of coal ... or they might be excessive. As an actor and filmmaker, I often crouched when potential annoying moments were destroyed by malevolent performances. However, I must admit that I could not look any further. I don't know if it was like a car wreck from which you can't turn your eyes or some mysterious power in a movie that held me there. This film is a good example of an excellent story that has been told badly. If Walter Kronkite were to say a joke to the "aristocrats," it would be a total flop, even though the joke itself is merry. Let Dave Chappelle say it, and we all laugh on the floor. This movie needed "Chapelle". Now, with that, if you can buy this movie for a dollar that I did, do it. Worth the money. Maybe I'll take another dollar, buy the rights to this movie and make it. Who knows ... it doesn't have to be better, but it can't be worse.
