Most of the comments on this movie are positive, so I thought I'd try to balance. I came out of this movie and wondered what was going on. Now I know and still consider it a bad movie. In my mind, I discounted a dream sequence that seemed too obvious. I was glad to have a free movie ticket or to ask for a refund. Film reviewers and critics love this film, which only confirms that most of them would sound more intelligent than read how viewers can enjoy a movie. Rating 8+ this film is so misleading. In 20 years, this film will not be compared to real greats like the Godfather. The film has fine performances from both leaders, but that is not enough to save the film. (nor lesbian scenes!)
