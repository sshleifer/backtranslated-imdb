The first season was great - a good combination of work and brother and friends at home. it was actually a pretty funny show. Now it reappears and my brother and two hot girls are gone - and the whole thing revolves around the airline. Even the old man running the company went down the hill - too high over the top, where it was perfect before. /> <br /> This is what happens when you let some execs get on the show. You can almost see a meeting "The old man is funny, lets you focus on him to get him over the top and do it all about the airline .. it will be a nutty version of the office!" Anyway, no hot chicks, no watches.
