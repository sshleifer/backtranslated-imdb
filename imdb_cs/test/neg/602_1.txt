This movie had terrible lighting and terrible camera movements. This film is a nervous horror movie that has no meaning at all. Fractions are completely false. Looks like this 17-year-old idiot wrote this movie and a ten-year-old made it. You can find the worst acting ever. People are tired of knives. At least weapons or fire. It has almost accurate lines from "when an alien calls". Only horrible people would enjoy this movie with horrible murders. Obviously, the writer doesn't have children or care about them. I want to say some mercy. To sum up, this movie is a "B" movie and it's angry. Just for yourself, you don't even think about losing time by watching this crappy movie.
