This one is a real stinking story. The story is just not so much with most other TZ episodes. It's pretty boring, although seeing Peter Falke, who is made up of Fidel Castro lookalike, is a little fun. <br /> <br /> Whenever the Twilight Zone is broadcast in an unannounced hour in my hometown, I would catch a sandwich and drink and settle for quality entertainment. 9 times out of 10, it ended up being this episode! Strange thing? This often happened to my mom (another fan of TZ like me). It has been so many times that one of us would say to others: "I was set up to watch the Twilight Zone and guess which episode was a" Cuban dictator! " Obviously, some people like this episode because it gets a rating of 6.7 ... I don't know how it happened - but that would make a great Twilight Zone chart!
