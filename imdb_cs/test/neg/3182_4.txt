I rented this movie because I enjoy watching things with Lauren Graham. Well, it was the peak. Everyone else seemed to be from the picture department. Still looking around for those who watched the movie with you, huh? However, she provided some clarity, as she was the only normal character in the picture, which actually does not say much for the film. Personally, it was too far for me. However, I am glad that I rented it, though I would never want to own it. I still feel Lauren Graham turned out to be a strong actress and even thought she wasn't the main character, and she seemed to have stolen the movie. My husband and I were happier and more concerned with her character, which ended up with Josh's character before we were two main characters.
