I can usually tolerate twisted movies, but this is a really sick obsession movie! First, the writer / director is a totally suicidal man full of sick jokes that are not funny. All. Second, he is also a sick pervert who manipulates and eats the child's mind! I can't believe my ears when I hear sick and perverted monologues talking to children! I'm sorry Zane Adlum and Devon Matthews. They are both very talented, but they have fallen prey to Eric Schaeffer's filthy movie! And what the hell happened to Eric Mabia's good-looking face? He met this girl to marry, but he wasn't at the wedding! In fact, he's his bald guy! Did he really have to fly so fast? Anyway, don't waste your time seeing this movie if you don't want to be poisoned and manipulated by one sick Eric Schaeffer!
