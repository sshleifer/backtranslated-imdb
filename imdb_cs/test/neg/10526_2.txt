I thought this movie had an interesting name, and it just might prove provocative, but I was wrong. This film was boring, especially at the beginning and in the middle. I can't comment on the end because I couldn't stand watching the whole movie. There is no point in signing a student researcher just because he goes to your lab. This student had an interesting type of moving robot in his apartment and, unfortunately, enough liveliness is more interesting than the characters of this movie. So if you are having trouble sleeping, I suggest you rent this movie.
