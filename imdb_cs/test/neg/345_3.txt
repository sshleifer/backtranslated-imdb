I think it's safe to say that if you really watch standard movies at the box office or any premium product, don't bother with this movie as you hate it. If you're too critical of a movie enthusiast, don't bother. If you like sci-fi movies and don't care about the capacity you get, then you will have a little fun. It is very clear that the budget for it was super super low, but what they did with the money is worth leaning on its back. Some of the burning fire scenes were bad enough, and the evacuation scenes were terrible, but it was obvious that they had good support from a computer perspective because the planet scenes and extraterrestrial images were pretty inventive. Dialogue is okay, but it doesn't work completely wrong. As far as the story is concerned, I'm not too sure what actually happened to tell you the truth.
