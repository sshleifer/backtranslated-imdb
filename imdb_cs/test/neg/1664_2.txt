Linda Arvidson (as Jennie) and Harry Solter (as Frank) are enjoying a romantic stroll as they walk around their father Charles Inslee; furious, chasing Mr. Solter out of the house. Intrepid, he goes to the balcony and begs her to run. Mrs. Arvidson is nice and packed. Then the thief George Gebhardt arrives to rob the place. Though he doesn't get much in the way of prey, Gebhardt's thief manages to use Arvidson's suitcase to escape the police? Contracted comedy. Note that during the balcony scene, Solter goes off camera, so Gebhardt thief can enter the house unnoticed. And Arvidson travels very easily because there is nothing in her heavy suitcase; Maybe she just wanted a beau Solter? Director D.W. Griffith, Robert Harron and Florence Lawrence are famous extras. <br /> <br /> ** Calamitous Elopement (08/08/2008) D.W. Griffith ~ George Gebhardt, Linda Arvidson, Harry Solter
