I was just watching Lonesome Dove, Return To Lonesome Dove, Laredo Street and Dead Man's Walk. Everything great. This apologized piece of junk mail is cheaply done and misbehaved. Despite the fact that every other actor plays Caption Call every time everybody quickly won me. In Dead Man's Walk, the boys are believable as a younger version of the experienced Texas Rangers. In the Comanche Moon, they are just a few chubby blushes. I had to stop looking. I suspect that many of the glowing reviews for this show were written by people who made this smelly pile. It's sorry to end the otherwise big franchise.
