The curse of the wolf begins as the reluctant werewolf Dakota (Renee Porada) manages to escape from her 'packing' and into the city where 6 months later she works in a vet. The rest of the Dakota package is unhappy and wants her back, their leader Michael (Todd Humes) says he will return to them, but the fat werewolf Franklin (Brian Heffron) chooses her smell and the package decides to force the problem and get her back using her affection to her human friends including her friend Danny (Dennis Carver). Can Dakota rescue Danny and finally get rid of werewolf pursuers? I doubt you will worry about it ... <br /> <br /> Executive Producer, Written & Director Len Kabasinski, who also had a big role in the film Stick, which I feared to watch the Wolf's Curse because Kabasinski was the man behind Swamp Zombies (2005), which is certainly one of the worst films ever made. Unfortunately, my worst fears have been confirmed and one has to say that Curse of the Wolf is a really horrible movie in every way, both conceptually and technically. The curse of a wolf is a type of film where a low budget dictates what is happening and a scenario rather than a budget dictating scenario. You get the impression that everything was written and conceived to take advantage of the few sets and actors they had, you can almost imagine that the creators say we have a couple of actors, some basic equipment and a few places, so it makes a horror movie around them . The story is terrible (Michael finds Dakota by looking at the big dog two women take for a walk), the character is terrible (a big fat werewolf who farts a lot), dialogue is terrible (almost every Line in the matter) and never there is no motivation to do anything that happens (why is the package so desperately trying to get Dakota back?), people just do seemingly random things, and because Kabasinski's background is in martial arts, he insists on putting a lot of random martial art into history. No offense, but this is horror, not martial arts, is it? In fact, in addition to the presence of a few werewolves, you would be forced to describe Curse of the Wolf as something close to a horror movie. For almost two hours in length it looks like it's going forever and is so slow and carefree that it's just not funny. Director Kabasinski apparently worked on a low budget, but filming that bad should be a crime. There is no continuity between shots, battle scenes look horrible and so poorly staged that it is untrue, and sometimes it is impossible to watch what is happening because they are jerky adjustments and bad camera angles or the fact that it is sometimes so dark that you literally don't see anything. Seriously there are times during the Curse of the Wolf, where the screen is totally black & you don't see anything, I'd hate to have to sit in this low resolution fuzzy VHS. The sound is awful too, you can hear the wind and the wind against the microphone! There are also many other unpleasant and unwanted ambient sounds during each scene. Did production actually have any lighting equipment when you do it? It doesn't feel like it. Special effects usually consist of a werewolf mask that looks like something that stores sell on Halloween for kids, basically look terrible. The technically curse of the wolf is as bad as they come, I'm sorry because I know it had a low budget, but it's really horrible to sit and try to get some fun from. That's the quality of a college student, I'm sorry if it sounds ruthless, but it's a fact. The deal is, you can guess, so I stop here before I say something else negative, I think I've done enough and I'm really not happy about it. The curse of the wolf is terrible, both conceptually and technically it's a real chore to sit. The curse of a wolf is a type of film where while your time tracking seems to be calm, it's a type of film that takes almost two hours and still feels like two years. One of the worst movies you see is sure to be avoided.
