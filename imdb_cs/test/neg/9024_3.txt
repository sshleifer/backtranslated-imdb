John Wayne, the most murderous believer, will cover up when they watch The Lawless Frontier. Even for a studio with poverty, this is one stinkeroo. Unusual for Westerners, we have criminals who are perpetrators of sexual crime. Earl Dwire plays a white and Indian semi-act, pretending to be Mexican, hockey accent and all for reasons that aren't explained. Dwire sounds like Frito Bandito advertising fame during the day. He and his gang take place at Gabby Hayes and his daughter Sheile Terry. They really have nothing worth stealing, but Dwire just wants an apology to kidnap Terry and have her way with her. She hears the terrible fate she has in the store, and she and Hayes flee the ranch. Where they meet John Wayne, who is on the trail of bandits. They also came across one very stupid sheriff who believes Wayne is one of the bandits. Again, for the reasons why I cannot fully understand. It was a difficult way to make a living by grinding the horses of horses like these dukes. Fortunately, things were better on the way.
