I don't understand the humor in this movie. I also found it offensive how Koreans were portrayed in this film, although it is just a cartoon of Koreans in these areas. First, the actors are Japanese, and they make the most crude expressions of Koreans in that movie. This disgusts me how these people are expressed. I felt anger just watching one scene, and how badly exposed they were in the movie. Humor only lasts for one laugh, and then you don't understand why it's funny. It is a rude humor with the most outrageous representation of society. I found out that this is an overall offensive film ... Maybe it was just because I never lived in a "hood" or saw any "hooded" movies, but I don't intend.
