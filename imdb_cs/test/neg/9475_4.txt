First, the twins are exactly the same. There is no one's girly and one is a tomboy (Ashley is taller than Mary-Kate though) and their friends are not even French, so it's bad because they are false accents. Lamo. It's not too bad, not their best. I'm a big fan of Mary-Kate and Ashley, don't get me wrong. the storyline is fine and it's fun to watch. this is not the type of film you would watch again and again. But hey, when they made this movie, they were still new in their own film stuff. Girls also behave more than 13 years old, but if you're a young spectator, it's a good movie. It's not so good if you're older than 13 if you're not a parent watching a movie with your kids. then it's OK. Good luck MK + A with your future movies!
