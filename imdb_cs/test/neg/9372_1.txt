Eliza Dushku is a very talented and beautiful actress. He can be the rock center of "Tru Calling", but that is not enough to save the TV series from mediocrity. It's a real pity that a woman so attractive and talented as Dushku should go from a massive supporting role in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" to this clunker. "Tru Calling", unoriginally and desperately trying to be hip, can't excite at any level above the hormonal. An eponymous heroine spends a lot of her time running back and forth over what must be a very small city to avert the death of good-looking corpses to meet at the morgue where she works. Despite everything he does, he always comes and seems to have just stepped out of a portable air-conditioned locker room. In every episode, Eliza Dushku and the rest of the cast try to breathe life into bland, formless scenarios, but it is an unnecessary exercise. "Tru Calling" just lies on the board and looks helplessly at the ceiling.
