Unfortunately, the boring movie, and of course the only way to see it, is the murdered bootleg Public Domain version, which is so blurry and dark that sometimes you have a hard time doing where the screen is. Leaders are a nuisance. The man spends most of his screen time trying to look steadfast, glamorous and sexy, completely forgetting what the movie is about and being murder suspect because of a woman playing him a goose horse. The lady alone is just going through a quick move and is dignified if she is not busy. It's pretty badly written stuff, never interesting or funny. No good camera, no unforgettable soundtrack, no charming actresses or atmospheric sets. It just scratches the genre's surface, and nothing happens if you omit this totally unacceptable swing.
