When I first saw "Race Against Fear" (I don't like LMN movie titles?), I still had to scratch my head. Should it be serious? Why couldn't the main character run like a regular man, much less like a star runner? How did I know the coach was bad for just 1 minute in the movie? All these questions and no answers. Then I just left a modest scenario and terrifying direction to take me away ... it was easier to resist ... then the movie became a minute more fun and I now rank it among the top ten LMN movies. Some have said that Ariana Richards is really talented, but that the material was defective - I disagree. Not only can he not convince me that he is an athlete, he goes wide-eyed through the rest of the story, as if he has just landed on the ground. Maybe the coach went out of jail and ended it ... at least I hope.
