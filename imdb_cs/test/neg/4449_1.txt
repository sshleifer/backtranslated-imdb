Just to save you money and time, I'll go ahead and tell you that this movie is definitely not worth the match and the gas that would burn it. Don't waste your time. As a matter of fact, you'd rather forget that you've ever wondered how you follow it. I really saw better B movies in a language I don't understand. Anyone who has ever given permission to do so must be sewn. The only positive thing I can say for this film is that it could be a great story with the new script and the right director and actors. Let me break it; A virgin conceives a demon, a child, while inside her womb she wants to feed people. He is trying to balance the fact that it is perhaps the worst movie ever with a curse and nonsense. All in all, Totally is not worth the dollar that I have permanently rented.
