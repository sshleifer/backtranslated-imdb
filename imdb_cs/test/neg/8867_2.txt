It's painfully obvious that people who have never seen this "movie" have such brilliant spoofs as "The Naked Gun" and "Hot Shots". This movie is horrible, and so are the actors. They wouldn't know that they would play, even if they hit them in the face as I felt when I was looking at a total pile of garbage. I'm sure I could make a better film with my friends. For me, it's amazing that a movie can fail. Not a single smart or funny line. No sign of intelligence behind him. It is a pathetic film and I would like to meet a person who really likes this film. Ugh!
