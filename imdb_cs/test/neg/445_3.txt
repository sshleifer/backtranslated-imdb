Once there was a great American movie. Which combined horror and comedy with the same excitement. This film was a smart direction. Breakthrough special effects and excellent comedy and serious acting. It was named 'The American Werewolf in London.' Sixteen years later, the long-awaited sequel was finally affixed to the poster outside the local theater. Certainly it would have at least some of the original excitement. Think again. "The American Werewolf in Paris" is an incomprehensible mess from the beginning to the pitiful end. Problems start with the lead man. Tom Everett Scott's performance is tough and tiring. From the outset, he seems to want to prove that all young people are sinister. In his defense, even the seasoned Shakespearean thespian could have gained good performance from youthful and ruthless dialogue. At one point, one of Scott's deceased friends, who is the soul's doomed to walk around the earth after being carved by one of the werewolves, is finally able to leave for the afterlife. Then he grins at Scott and his friends. "Okay, guys, you see." What is unforgettable goodbye. Julie Delphy soon appears as Scott's mysterious European interest. Basically it's a French girl playing a French girl. It's not too much to stretch. But all this stupidity is not the most pleasant about the film. Special effects, as an integral part of an excellent original film, are far behind in this flop. Werewolves look like cartoons. And no matter how well you carve with a sinewy lycanthrope muscle. It's still hard to get scared of the cartoon. Instead, an American gang on vacation, led by ultralight Scott, still seeks excuses to return to the werewolf lair. It's much easier for this incompetent special effects crew to keep computer creatures or absurd beast masks under the cover of darkness. Some said that if you don't look at this movie as a sequel, it's not that bad in comparison. I disagree, this film can't stand alone, and it's still a shame compared to a brilliant original. If he doesn't want to be pursued as a sequel, he shouldn't borrow most of the 1981 title. I don't care how much you love werewolves. Or how much you worshiped the American werewolf in London. like me. This one is not worth the waste of time. "Okay, guys, you see." Grapes. 3 out of 10 possible T.H.
