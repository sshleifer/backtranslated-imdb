To each of them, but I thought Gibson's Hamlet was the worst rendition I had ever seen ... as a subtly nuance like a paper bag, and how it was inspired as a telemarketing call. The only reason I watched the movie to the end was that I was hoping either to be better or to become unintentionally funny. No luck. No disrespect for supportive casting or Zefferelli's production, but nothing can match the bungling of the main character. I saw Hamlet well depicted as an African prince, as an animated lion, as a harsh warrior, as a romantic poet, etc. Etc. But IMHO was only a rich lack of joke along with most of the weak ham.
