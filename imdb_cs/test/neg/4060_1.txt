[WARNING: Some spoilers have been included, even if it's a document.] <br /> <br /> I bought this document because I like the work of directors D.A. Pennebaker and Chris Hegedus, including MOON OVER Broadway, STARTUP.COM and WAR WARS, all the amazing documentaries I would highly recommend. Looking at this ultimately boring and fearless account from the 1988 Depeche Mode tour, I realized they had nothing to do with it when they were going to edit this movie together. Band members were certainly less than ready for the camera; therefore, undoubtedly, the competition for adding fans to a weekly bus trip has been added to revive things a bit. Really, I mean now. Who thought a concert of a good group concert with three keyboardists and a singer would be a good idea? I'm sorry that I like the music of Depeche Mode, and Martin Gore writes good tunes, but seeing them in a concert never seemed interesting, and this movie is positive. If you're not a huge Depeche Mode fan, stay away from this document .... it's a complete waste of time.
