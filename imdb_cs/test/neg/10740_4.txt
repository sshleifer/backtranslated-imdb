Homecoming; what a huge disappointment! After reading the summary of the events (the dead who returned to the vote - against George W. Bush !!!!!) I could not wait to see it. It started interesting and immediately caught my attention. Unfortunately, however, he slowly descended into a boring political satire that I did not have to see (I can only observe some good old Aussie comedy!). There were only one or two scenes of horror and they weren't so scary. I couldn't believe it came from Joe Dante, who could easily pull it out with the same balance of excitement and satire. <br /> <br /> The worst episode ever. <br /> <br /> 2/5.
