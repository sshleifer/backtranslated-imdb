While Aeon Flux was a slightly fun and somewhat better way to spend a Wednesday night than a pub, I was glad to have bought one free ticket. he didn't know anything about the movie as I went in, in fact I didn't even know it was an animated series before I read this site, I was ready for anything, and as some other viewers noted the trailers show well filmed, good looking and interesting a piece of cinema pulled me into the middle of the movie, though I was a little disappointed, reminded me of the fifth element, but I also felt that it lacked just a little more depth and left me empty. and enough unnecessary and slightly boring fighting with weapons, if you do them, do it with some style, not just the amount of blasts and incapable guards falling down. personally, I'd rather see a little more about the story and the people in town, or learn more about how the chairman was being undermined than about another long and loud fight with the gun.
