I couldn't believe how awful and boring this Hollywood remake was. It's so terrible. It easily lands in my top 10 worst films of 1998. The only thing to go for was Bruce Willis, who should stick to action movies, as a completely emotional killer who would kill his own mother at the right price. But I'd rather listen to Robbie Coltraine talking to the American for a week before listening to Richard Gere's grudging Irish accent. But this film is also unlikely, unconvincing, uneven, unimaginative, unimaginable and hostile. maybe a career comeback.One for filmroll-footie purposes altogether.
