Watching this movie really surprised me. I have never been found to stop watching the film in its entirety, because $ 3 to rent a movie is a good amount of money and damn, I should at least look at the whole thing and get my money. I did it over about 30 minutes of this totally crappy movie when I thought I was a little more after watching this movie. I can't believe the director and the actors in this movie actually had such respect for themselves to be free! There is nothing I can say that other reviewers have not said, but even in the worst films, there is usually one or two decent performances ... not in this piece of wasteful waste. I saw better playing in high school. Everybody and I think that every "actor" is wrong out of faith, and what is really amazing is unity of badness ... gosh, it must be a director. Where did these people get? This is perhaps one of the worst horrors I've ever seen. Though amusing in places due to its ridiculous scenario and even weaker acting, and I use that term very freely, it is unfortunate that this film was not sent to B movie hell for all eternity. What could have been a good idea was destroyed by a very low budget, bad sound, and effects and actors who probably earned their wings on children's television and poor children's television. <br /> <br /> Please DOWNLOAD FROM THIS FILM. Not a minute of your time.
