I think it's very interesting, this movie is called a thriller. It's different than exciting. <br /> <br /> Most of the time you hear the sounds of the piano. Then you hear the sounds of the piano. Then some people talk about facts that do not concern anyone. Then again the sounds of the piano. To be honest, this movie was the reason I signed up for IMDb because I think this movie is one of those that humanity must be warned about. Spoiler: By the way, the part of the action that most resembles the action happens when a can of hot chocolate spills. Also very interesting: "actors". Yes, quotations are deliberate, as you may think, because they do not. They play the piano and make smalltalk, but it's not what they do. I think I never left the cinema before this movie and I didn't feel angry. Indeed, this movie made me angry. Angry at the time and money I spent on him.
