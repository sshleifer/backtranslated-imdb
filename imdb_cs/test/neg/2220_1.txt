There I sit at home in the morning, suddenly my brother turns around, which seems to be the dumbest I've ever seen. Since it was the 70th and the special effects were not sharp, this film almost matched the definition of bullshit. Stupid monsters, stupid storyline and stupid settings from this worst movie I've ever seen. So bad in fact I didn't even finish, I did it up to a certain point then continued to see how long I could go without putting the rope around my neck and hanging myself. (im just funny haha) AWFUL MOVIE
