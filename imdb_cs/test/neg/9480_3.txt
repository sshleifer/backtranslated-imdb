Oh yes, I admit that I committed guilty of crime that I saw this piece of waste. I can't say I was forced by aliens who showed me a gun to my head, tied me up with a chair and made it impossible for me to close my eyes and then turned on the terrifying apologies for the movie. No, I did it with free will. I was deliberately tortured. Let's go through the fact people. - Negotiation is an insult to humanity. - The storyline (if any) is ridiculous. - The evolution of characters is terrible - The characters that appear in the film are so clich√© that you know them in your average comic. - Adjustments are sloppy and unimaginable. - Camera operation is low. - Dialogue is simply the worst in film history. - Directed by, say, I bet it wasn't Hitchcock. Then, to add to these facts, there was no talent at all that was so important. The director must now smoke crack to forgive him for causing this poison to the world. The Bottom Line: The passport to Paris is one of the worst films ever made. PERMANENT!
