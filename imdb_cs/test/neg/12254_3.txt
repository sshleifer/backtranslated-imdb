Although this must be the nadir of season six, this schmaltzy episode is not badly written or acted on. It's just that most of us looked at X-Files for tense, gripping horror / thrillers ending with no easy answers and moving toward dark but sincere conspiracies. Season 6 gave us a stream of language comedies that undermined the show's continuity and, frankly, did the Simpsons' Halloween Specials look like a great thriller television. a long-standing friend of a man who pretends to be a rainman. However, her meteor chief is the one who really loves her, and Mulder says he's got to give him advice to get out of town. There is some playful fun with chemistry between agents and some fun but not very sophisticated characteristics of Midwestern hicks. It's nothing you want to see more than once! It's hard to come to season 6. The creator of X-Files Chris Carter seems to be bored with the whole story of the "Syndicate conspiracy" and black comedy writers leave responsibility.
