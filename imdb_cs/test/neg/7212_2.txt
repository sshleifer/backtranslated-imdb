Let us be righteous. Watching a cult classic like Road House is not an easy task. Now subtract Swayze from the equation and get a monumental task. So she's not on board with Patrick, whose idea of ​​a skeleton was to do the same and make this piece of waste? I will blame the director, who has not even provided a 5 minute decent record during the film. I was actually shocked to have Will Patton (Armaggedon) jump aboard. Johnathon Schaech did OK with the leadership, but the writing was cruel. When I turned down on my partner brunette with a bomb (Crystal Mantecon) in the first 5 minutes of the movie, I wanted to throw it right there. But I got stuck with the movie, I hope to see the great cheesy humor that worked so well with Double Duece. No such luck. The DVD cover is hilarious, they show these two stacked blondes that make one 10 second look in the movie. Costar Ellen Hollman also gives a decent performance. But again, the effort is futile in garbage and shame like this. Was Jake Busey ever cast in a decent movie? Couldn't they force at least a few actors to do some nostalgic treatment from the first movie? Even one of the old bouncers or two, or Jeff Healey for the show would be nice. Take this movie immediately from your queue. -LostFlix
