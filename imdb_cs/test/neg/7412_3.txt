I read the other notes. I didn't think it sounded good, but he decided to tape it anyway. Maybe not so smart to read all the bad reviews before watching this movie because of course I would have noticed all the same weird stuff. Excessive use of fading to black, a few strange camera angles and a cross section dialog for different conversations with the same people running at different times! But I noticed everything I thought: Well, that would probably be boring if it went chronologically. Interviews are not so exciting, but mandatory. And the constant fading of black after really short scenes really makes it feel like the story is too fast to move too much to the interesting part. Skip boring bits. It's a little exciting at the end of the movie. Will they survive? So I really liked this movie? No, not really. The director had some interesting ideas to keep the audience bored when trying to introduce characters. But he exaggerated it. This is unpleasant and sometimes confusing. That was probably just the second movie he directed, so maybe he'll learn and do really good things in the future. And if you sit there (in the future), it reads whether the famous director pays off the second film today. If it's good in the future, sure, watch this bullshit and think how it got to third. Otherwise, this movie is really not worth the attention if you are not interested in filmmaking, and want to see one way you can reduce the obligatory boring opening scenes to something traceable.
