I can't believe I bought this movie on DVD. I don't even remember that it was on television last year. Why couldn't they make a real sequel to one of the best Christmas movies they ever made in the world? Hell and Randy Quaid seem to be on the same drugs as Jerry Lewis. I didn't know about this movie until I bought it tonight and I thought I'd look at it on IMDb and see how it was rated. The boy made a mistake. If your reading this review be warned to stay away from it and just keep the first Christmas holiday. At least I didn't pay more than $ 10 for that. Maybe I can replace it and get half of it on Tower Records. Then maybe not again. PS I haven't seen it yet, my DVD player went to fritz tonight and watched another amazing movie The Chronicles of Riddick woo freaking hoo.
