This movie was the worst of 67 out of the 71 best pictures I saw. First, I found a conspiracy somewhat absurd - absent husband 25 years / still in love / not a letter! Give me a break. And why was the guy who had been absent for so long working on an oil rig next to the congress party? The film also exhibited some of the worst stereotypes of African-Americans I've ever seen. It makes Gone with the wind (see Prissy) look downright progressive! I barely saw a movie that I love. UGH!
