I didn't like Underdog! I think it was really unnecessary and needed a big face lift and then it might be clear, but for the main part I didn't like it. I'm not even one of those films that parents (who grew up watching cartoons) wanted to come with children to see it, so the film didn't ask me in the least. I don't think Jason Lee was the right voice for Underdog to make it sloppy and really unintelligent. Then it was really predictable, making you feel tired and crazy. One thing that bothered me most of my thoughts was how almost everything from Underdog's mouth was sarcastic or gross. The meeting was clear but required some improvement. All the means to see that you might like unlike me. Star rating: 3.5 out of 10
