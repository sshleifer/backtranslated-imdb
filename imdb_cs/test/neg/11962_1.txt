I knew I was on LONG 90 minutes when the opening voice skipped the word "scarecrow" (it sounded like a Scare Crew). And certainly 90 minutes later, after witnessing horrible acting, tiring drama, haunted strikes that did not lead to their intended goal, but "still" hitting, Ken Shamrock "acting" and the stupid illogical ending, I saw in my life (Ok, no, I'll take it last, in about a week). After I passed it all, I openly wept that I couldn't go to Lacuna la Jim Carrey and just totally wipe it off my mind. Any thoughts that I might have had that director Brian Katkin could make an OK movie in the light of the circumstances I had after watching "Slaughter Studios" are completely and completely out of my mind. <br /> <br /> My class: F <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Tara Platt and Lisa Robert get to the top <br /> <br /> Where I saw it: Starz on Demand (k available until 22 September 2005)
