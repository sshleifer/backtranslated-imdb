It is important to remember the true meaning of the phrase "Inspired by a real story" while watching Pride. It's kind of like "You could save up to 50%," which can literally be translated into "You can't save more than 50%." It all sounds great until you realize that the bottom "up to" is "zero". Similarly, "inspired by the real story" means that someone has heard the story, and that has taken them into account. The only certainty is that the real story and the one you are about to see are not the same. There is a real Jim Ellis who started training the swimming team at the Philadelphia Department of Recreation in the early 1970s, but I feel that the real Jim Ellis must not be able to hide some of the feelings of disappointment about the way the film is . It is clear that the story of his life takes wild liberties, and I just see him reacting to the strange look of his friends, wondering why the film is so different from what they know. At Any Speed, one thing to be proud of is being portrayed by Terrence Howard, one of our best actors, who has played alongside Bernie Mac, who, despite the lack of an original and powerful story still gives sincere and moving movement. performance. The film takes place in the 1970s in Philadelphia, a time and place where racism was the norm, not an exception, and the educated and professional Jim Ellis, who is also a perfect swimmer, has trouble finding it worth teaching, until finally he descended to the crumbling recreation center, which is assigned the task of clearing it before demolition. We can understand his lightening feeling. When we first met Elston, a handyman (Bernie Mac), he is a disillusioned grump who sits in his office surrounded by heaps of rubbish that touch the ceiling and watch daytime television on an old, dusty TV set . Needless to say, when Jim appears to have started cleaning the site and clearing it, Elston is not friendly with him. He knew his rec center had been closed, and all his anger about being transferred quite smoothly to Jim. Due to his past as a swimmer in college, Jim has a special interest in the pool that cleans and fills and brings into top shape. A group of black teenagers playing basketball just outside the rec center are interested in the pool when their basketball rim is taken away and the heat remains stuffy, and soon the group has a developing swimming team on their hands that enter the city. swim. Of course we call them scammers, it would be a little. They are unorganized, unprofessional, poorly trained, and have no idea how to behave while swimming. Of course it doesn't matter. The film is your standard sporting story, so the first athletic trip is absolutely unimportant as something other than an educational experience that is a catalyst for their much harder and much more focused training that will lead to the ultimate athletic trip. matters. So far, the only thing that a sports film is about is that the protagonists do not have to win on top of the film, we only have to understand the meaning and importance of their efforts. Sadly, the film has all the signs of the development of the old movie Seagal. Good guys are good guys because they should be, and those bad guys are ugly white swimmers who laugh at our team and make racist jokes. And there's one scene where one of the white boys kicks one of the black boys underwater while he's in the middle of the race. I didn't know it was really possible to kick someone underwater like this, but you get an idea of ​​how deep the character development is. We understand that this is a group of children Jim Ellis has turned from children hanging on the streets doing nothing with their lives and into an organized and competing team of swimmers, but besides we really know nothing about who they are. The biggest problem is that the only real statement the film makes is that the effort and organization lead to success and racism is bad. Both of them are so obvious that when the film is made with them, the feeling of emptiness and uselessness ends. Racism was much stronger in America in the 1970s, feeling like a huge loss that the film directly tackles with this problem, but actually said nothing about it. It is like a good movie, but when it ends and you realize how much it should be said, it is much bigger than what has been said, a feeling of good feeling turns into a sad disappointment.
