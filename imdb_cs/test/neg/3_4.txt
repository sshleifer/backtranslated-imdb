Wow, another movie by Kevin Costner. Postman, Tin Cup, Waterworld, Bodyguard, Wyatt Earp, Robin Hood, even the baseball movie. Looks like she's making movies specifically to be the center of attention. Characters are almost always the same ... heroism, mistakes, size, fall, redemption. Yup, during the 1.5 minute film, we all were supposed to be in awe of his character, and it builds more and more from there. And this time the story ... the story? ... it's just a collage of different movies. You don't need a spoiler; You've seen this movie several times, even though it has different titles. You'll know what happens before it happens. It's like mixing an officer and a master with a backdraft, but both are better movies. Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made ... and also how good but slightly underrated actor Russell plays the hero.
