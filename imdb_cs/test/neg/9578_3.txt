They call this film "horror". Well, it's not horrible. The film takes place in Europe, so yes, it is "euro". Garbage? Oh yes, it's waste all right. <br /> <br /> You know you're on a great movie by providing you with on-screen text that apologizes for print quality right from the start. look again. Expect cracks, strange sharp cuts, and the film doesn't fit the screen. Plus there's a sound - at first I thought I was watching a dubbed movie. Then I watched my lips carefully and realized that no, it's so that the sound quality is embarrassingly bad and unsynchronous. The storyline itself is pretty goofy - an old, disfigured woman named Dr Bannister kills the scientist for his youthful formula. I'm not too far away because when you see an "old woman," it's pretty obvious he's under a layer of thick, badly applied makeup. Anyone who makes sense sees a false age, knows what's next. Yes, the "old cube" is miraculously transformed into a beautiful young woman - complete with facial makeup and a long hair wig! Zones! When I say the old woman is mutilated, I think she has cornflakes stuck to her face. The film does not try to explain how the cornflakes got there. In this respect, he is not trying to explain anything at all about the character. They never developed above the level of finger puppets. Two policemen watching our anti-heroin roam, obviously confused by the simplest clues. The murdered scientist worked on a youth serum, the old woman disappeared and we still run into a young woman - how do these pieces fit together?! What does it mean ?! One of the cops sweats a lot and smacks his face with the cloth. The other is smoking a pipe. This is largely everything we get, characteristically. Dr Bannister (skeleton, now beauty) goes around wearing special costumes and then takes them off so we can see her body. He's dealing with men. She gets into a fight with a young woman in a nightgown. He goes to Geneva to see the lake there. She sinks a little with her, then takes off her wet suit to reveal the strange bikini of the bead curtain. He takes off his clothes again in a strange ninja striptease costume. <br /> <br /> End? Well, without giving up, it's just a bizarre conclusion that is as small as the rest of the picture. It's the thing the author comes up with when the director wakes him up at 4 am and says, "Quick! We need the end for our movie! What happens next?" The writer mumbles something up and the director runs with him. <br /> <br /> What's good about the movie? Some music is camping and fun. That classic 60s organ music that is so frantic that it is that you laugh out loud. There are some strange seduction scenes, bizarre dialogue, goofy moments. It's very close to being so bad it's good. I managed to watch it from start to finish without digging out of my eyes or sobbing. I think it's praise.
