It's hard to imagine that two actors of this class and experience such as Michael Caine and Michael Gambon are involved in such an embarrassing movie. Responsibility for this poorly judged production must be borne by writer Neil Jordan and director Conor McPherson. I doubt I've seen such a bad movie with such good credits for a long time. The comedian, Dylan Moran, who has made his mark as an irritable and incompetent bookstore owner in the TV sitcom, Blackbooks, is changing here in exactly the same routine, with the exception of such a surplus and lack of comic control to make one of them curl. It's easy to see how the story could get to work because the situation is interesting and packed with comic potential. The classic actor (Caine) is trying to rip the crowd (Gambon and co) with the adjutant of the cut-to-be-fellow (Moran) with predictable results. It could and should be good. Unfortunately, it shouldn't have been.
