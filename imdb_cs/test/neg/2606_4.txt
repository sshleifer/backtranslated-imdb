When Family Guy premiered for the first time, I was not in a discriminatory mood. With the 1990s, containing a number of smart, surrealistic cartoons, why should I be? Nickelodeon produced Doug; Ren and Stimpy and Rockos Modern Life among other fine cartoons (Yes, that includes Spongebob). All had unpredictable, dreamy animations and surprisingly sophisticated stories and dialogues. The Simpsons has become an absolutely phenomenon, perhaps not as brilliant as its greatest defenders claim, but a very fine investment of your time and firmly rejects the false axiom that all television is unsolicited. South Park began as a raw but cheerful attack on everything with a unique and intelligent satire below. It evolved to become a Monty Python-esquire show with outrageous images and brutally fast and sharp social criticisms (such as their defense of noble bottoms of gnomes) and eventually settled to be entirely self referential and "meta" as the Simpsons did, and has \ t t unfortunately jumped shark. Family Guy is superficially like The Simpsons and South Park. He pushes buttons and is popular with college students and enthusiasts. However, what it has in loquacity is missing in the true joke. <br /> <br /> The show is known for its use of tricks, especially for flashbacks. Many are references to bad TV sitcoms or commercials. Some are funny (especially from the first two years), most are not. Are the links inherently funny? I'm not sure, but it's mostly what the show is about, that her characters are painfully uninteresting. Where Homer and Bart have magic, and Cartman has artillery self-awareness and pure outrage to support his horrible behavior, Peter Griffin has no excuse. It's just a loud, unpleasant pig. Everything funny about his character is just because writers forget how to be that day. Lois is also very shallow and dull; Meg is prop, only to be abused; Chris is bounded by retarded and only occasionally entertaining, and the two main stars of the show (Stewie and Brian) are so contradictory in their characteristics that it's really meaningless. Other tricks I can't stand when a character points to something obviously and persists for a long time. It has become a lot lately and I can't bear it anymore. It's not just about the chicken that likes to beat Peter, I'm talking about painful moments when he talks about pop culture and prod, as if they were alien viewers. This is not a joke or even ironic humor, it is completely boring and lifeless. Not that the show could not be fun, in fact some of the earlier episodes let me roll. The most important is the pilot episode where Peter loses contact with reality after losing his precious television; when Peters' religious fanatic father appears and causes confusion; When Peter becomes a narrator at Megs School and an episode of "Pancakes". I think these are episodes that mistakenly incorporated real human traits into their characters, or they were just times when the writers had a real comedy inspiration. The last thing the show is not offensive. It's just insulting to those who wouldn't be in the first place, so it's almost like a circular blockbuster of the hips.
