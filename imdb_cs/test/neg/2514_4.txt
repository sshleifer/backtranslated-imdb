When I saw Carl Lizzani's documentary on Luchino Visconti, I was tied to a higher expectation than I watched this movie created three years later by Adam Low. But the viewer, like me, was dissatisfied ... I faced the need for a critical opinion that I generally do not like, given that there are no documents to satisfy every viewer. There are also no documents that will examine the topic completely. But when I read reviews that were already written on this title, I also felt a little confused. Sometimes people don't know what to criticize. Therefore, to make it clear, I will divide this film into two main parts, which differ greatly: the first one about Visconti before his directorial career and the second about director Visconti. Aristocratic background, all the hobbies, the wealth that Luchino loves and loves are clearly presented. His pursuit of racing is mentioned as well as his relationship with his mother so upset after the divorce of his parents. We also get a very precise idea of ​​where Luchino was brought up as the true number of Milan: in riches galore, with nannies, cooks with access to everything, in TRUE ARISTOCRACY. This is evidenced, for example, by the beautiful villa of his father in Grazzano and other beautiful villas. There is also an emphasis on Visconti's vital visit to Paris in the 1930s where he met significant people ("left wing") who later had an influence on his style and statement in art. This clearly explains the idea of ​​communists with aristocratic upbringing (contrast at first sight). However, the section on his director's career, which began with OSSESSIONE during World War II and ended with INNOCENTE just before the director's death in 1976, is poorly practiced. His films are not well discussed. Why? Because there are very few people who have something to say. Director Franco Zeffirelli remembers the works of LA TERRA TREMA and that's fine. There are also some interviews with Franco Rosi. But later, such films as IL GATTOPARDO, LA CADUTA DEI REI, LA MORTE and VENEZIA or LUDWIG are mostly discussed by Helmut Berger. Although I liked the actor in the role of Ludwig, I didn't like his conversations. In addition, some of the ideas he reveals are not accurate in such a document because there are no significant works of Visconti as CONVERSATION PIECE, there are no interviews with prominent actors Burt Lancaster. There should also be a mention of Silvana Mangano and Roma Schneider. There is one record of an interview with Maria Callas that seems interesting, but that's just a short piece. Franco Zeffirelli, even though I respect him as a director, makes it all more than something really precious. He mentioned, for example, how Visconti separated from him after years of service. That's why I say: simplified and unsatisfactory. What I consider very important are the conversations with Visconti himself. As a result, we can get his own opinion on his works. I greatly appreciate, for example, the words that say about death as normal chapters of life and natural as birth. He also discusses his health problems after a stroke during LUDWIG filming. I believe it's better to see LUCHINO VISCONTI (1999) Carlo Lizzani than this doc. Although shorter and condensed as a whole, you get a better idea of ​​the director. Visconti would be enraged at it, and his fury usually changed human emotions and opinions on stone ... 4/10
