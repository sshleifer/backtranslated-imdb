Eaten Alive is a small film that opens in New York and in the Arctic region where a tribe of men shoots a snake venom to a few people, then a woman enters a police district trying to find her sister who disappeared after 6 months Sheila is from Alabama , but her accent sucks, she is teamed up with an adventurer who seems to just want her money and seems to say a lot throughout the film.They go through the amazon just to find a community with people and they find a sister, they 're confronted A mad man who probably saw too much Jim Jones preaching. He will bring them to a better place, it could be heaven, but no, Mark and Sheila find out later his actually suicidal cult. Why am I calling Eaten Alive a "little movie"? I will tell you, but when I watched it, I was in all Canadian runs, Robert Kerman has a different role to his cannibal holocaust professor. It's a bit annoying once we meet him in a wrestling match that looked just like Russian roulette we know that hes a tough guy. Plus a powerful misogyny just makes you cringe and it looked like I saw it somewhere, oh scenes of animals killing each other. But the whole movie revolves on these scenes, its like being actually watching pictures of nature with parts of the movie But after watching this movie I realized that most movie scenes are taken from other cannibal movies, even extinction of two characters, well .. most of the movie is. call it a bit of a movie when I found out that the scenes were borrowed, I felt like I threw a disc across the room, it wasn't just a movie assembly.
