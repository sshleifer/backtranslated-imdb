This document was very amateur. It could have been done by college students. Assuming it was, my rating is as follows. Content: C, Sound Quality: F, Camera: F, Acting: D, Soundtrack: F, Casting: C, Boobshot: A ...... Total Mark: D <br /> <br /> The illness, as we walked the streets with the characters, rocked up and down with every cameraman's movement. \ t Extensive post-production editions and CGI would not help this bomb. These students would "barely" pass my course. My advice ... do not waste your time or money on one "A".
