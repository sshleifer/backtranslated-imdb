Before "Miracle on 34th Street," Maureen O'Hara and John Payne did it, this movie. I wanted to describe it, but I can't find the words how much this movie showed up. The subject of child acceptance and Maureen's disease are very serious and sensitive issues, but this could have been much better than it was. It was so extreme in his portrayal that she wasn't real at all. Probably his problem started with a weak scenario. Another example of a writer with a novel and a weak film. (See my review "A Stranger in My Arms.") The beautiful O'Hara was often saddled with such clunkers, another being the Forbidden Street (Britannica Mews), which I can finally review. <br /> <br /> If you have emotional ties since childhood, you will be a kinder, more lifeless, colorless and expressionless film. But for something that is in this sense, maybe you can find his TV-remake movie. It has to be better. It has to be.
