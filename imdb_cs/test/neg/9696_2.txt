I will skip the obvious review of factual inaccuracies. They are too numerous to be named. A much shorter list would be what they are right about. 1. Dude named Noah. 2. Ark with animals on it. If you want a much more accurate picture of Noah's Ark and the destruction of Sodom, go rent a Bible (1966). It depicts the story of creation through Abraham, who attempted to sacrifice his son Isaac. It is a much better film, and it may be that an abomination called "Noah's Ark" (1999) made you look for such a movie. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060164/ <br /> <br /> I really couldn't stomach watch the whole movie. From reading other comments, I see that atheists also considered it roughly inaccurate. As a Christian he was unbearable for me. Maybe the worst movie ever. No real point to this movie either, except maybe show off their sub-par computer animation. Was it a complete waste? Maybe not. God can use evil for good. Romans 8:28 says: [28] And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to its purpose. Genesis 50 says: [20] But you thought you were evil against me; but God wanted it to bring, as it is today, to save many people alive. In the second example, Joseph's brothers wanted to kill him, but God turned his evil into a very good one. Maybe he did the same with this movie. People were so impressed by the lack of biblical foundations that they probably broke out the dusty old Bible and read the story for themselves. To learn about Lot and Sodom, they would have to go all the way to Genesis 19 before God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Until then, they had read almost half of Genesis, so they would like to finish. The next book is Exodus, of which the film "Ten Commandments" was based on (and much more accurately). If they saw the movie, then Exodus becomes easy to read. So now they've read at least two whole Bible books, just because they've been watching a poor movie about Noah's Ark, I'm sure it happened to someone out there. God works in a mysterious way.
