I found that this film is preaching and unrealistic. He is trying to be a film that shows children fighting against the system, but it is not a positive solution either. I think I didn't really feel like children. I can understand what their grasp was, and I know how bad the school is, but I have found a solution and the way the external solution handled it to be a big phooey. If it's on TV, don't waste your time. Watch the short circuit again after 235. time.
