I spent the last five years in the entertainment industry and the last time I worked for the company that made this movie, which is a real shame, because I love these people, I just can't believe anyone could do something so bad. like this? That was stupid from every angle. One of the worst movies I've ever seen! The actors in this film looked as if they were taken directly from the porn that was shot in the San Fernando Valley and settled on a set with an even less talented crew. I just can't overcome the fact that I was sitting on some of the best materials I've ever read, and industry contacts that would help my dream come true and hit all sorts of obstacles? Yet the people behind this film show no problems with its connection and in fact, they sleep well after its release. Life, what a trip!
