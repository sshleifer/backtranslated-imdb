When I first learned about this movie, I was eager to rent it, believe it (mistakenly) that it was one of those bad movies and that I was on healing. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> To begin with, the pace is meaninglessly slow. The tempo won't even lift up to the last 15-20 minutes of the movie! The story was boring and the end was meaningless and confusing. For those who are looking for a horror cheese movie with cheap excitement, look elsewhere. This film provides kitsch in spades, but is very missing in "excitement," cheap or otherwise. Try "Child's Play," instead.
