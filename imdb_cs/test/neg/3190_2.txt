I give this piece of Hollywood basket 1 out of 10! Seriously! I mean comedy as well as another guy. I can also take a simple stupid comedy and actually sit and laugh with it. But this film had nothing to laugh with or with it. <br /> <br /> I like almost all the actors in this movie. So I thought I'd overlook what many people told me about it (my mistake for not listening). I was just silenced on how stupid this script was! Just ridiculous and not funny. The only funny scenes were in the previews everyone saw in the theater when they saw other movies or on television. I was very disappointed and I really want to know why these otherwise relatively good actors would read this script and then sign up for it! Bad decisions about their parts ... <br /> <br /> ********************* MAJOR SPOILER *********** ************* <br /> <br /> Well - here's my biggest question on this movie ....... If the characters look back at this jewel story (Liv Tyler ) After Paul Reiser went to a therapist who remembered the past!?!?!?!? He dies in the last scene by crushing the dumpster !!!! Can anyone answer me?!?!?!?!? Major goof made by filmmakers ..... no one noticed?!?!?!?!?!?!
