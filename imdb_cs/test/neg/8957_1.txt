It was a shocking bad movie and I gasped for the first time when I saw the Blue Screen puppets. Imagine the worst special effects you've ever seen to make it much worse, and then combine it with poorly made rubber puppets and Play-Doh that look like something from a semi-preschool art. Then add some screeching, Yngwie Malmstein-esquire, melodic-metal guitar solo stuff that is too loud and takes too long. The overall movie is absolutely horrible and "Feeders" looks like "Rashomon". It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, with every measurable metric that spirals down, like a waterlogged lawn in the eternal, slow whirlpool of a broken Rest Restroom. Yet, like "Actium Maximus", you must not miss a bad movie franchise out there, even if you just watch clips on YouTube or somewhere. This movie is a little eye opener if you can stomach ride. I think this director may be mentally ill, which is a little debasing. If you watch him discuss the project, you feel he really believes he has created something amazing. I think he's a "star wars boy" gonzo of filmmakers. Such a mess. :-)
