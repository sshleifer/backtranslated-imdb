I only signed up for IMDb to warn others about this movie. Hwo has anyone ever funded such projects? It is secret. Farewell to Harry could be the worst movie ever, except that I tried to erase others who compete with this crazy idiom. Bad conspiracy, no-credible logic runs around the world. I can't spoil this movie for you by revealing something that would make your experience less enjoyable. There's nothing pleasant about this movie. I have a CD and I'll send it to you for free, it's so bad. First comes, just served. If I know you, this offer is invalid because I wouldn't make this movie to anyone, not intentionally. YOU ARE WARNING.
