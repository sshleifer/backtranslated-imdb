I don't know what some of these filmmakers think, by filming the same type of cliches over and over again to win bad guys (bad girls in this case). Weakness and very predictable. There is nothing original about it. The same film was made over and over again - it was no different from GOODBYE LOVER (1989), SLOW BURN (2005), or at least ten other films with exactly the same story and end. There's also a lot of holes in the movie. It's as if he ran out of money and stopped shooting. Or maybe they missed their ideas. Don't waste your time with this. This will only leave you upset by unnecessarily keeping your time watching it.
