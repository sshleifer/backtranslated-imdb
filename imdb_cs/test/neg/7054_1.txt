My brother worked in a movie theater when I saw this movie; I saw it for free and I still left. I've seen a lot of movies in my time, but this was the worst. When people ask me the worst movie I've ever seen, I mention this movie in less than a second. This movie is bad because it goes from one lame plot to set-up to another, supporting stereotypes about blacks that are outrageous and the flow is terrible. If you want to see how to make children cry and vomit while studying this movie. Well, this movie is not good "bad" but terrible bad. If you're like one of those people watching horrible movies for fun, just like me, you won't even be able to do this through this very short movie. Please for the love of God destroy all copies of this film.
