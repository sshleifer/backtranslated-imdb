Cookie-cutter gets overtime in this obvious and unoriginal love story. The storyline, such as it is, was done before a trillion times so there is no need to depict any of it. All you have to do is say that all 12-year-old girls will love this movie, while the rest of us will have to make a face. Even the soundtrack is terrible! It's not like I don't like figure skating, although I don't like the fact that I don't like clich√©s, bad movies.
