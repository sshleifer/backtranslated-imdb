Yes, it is true that Jessica Alba led me to this film because I should never pick it up without it. But it's long, boring and above all non-original. All the while I thought the story was full of clich√©s and directing very boring. So it was a surprise that the director and writer are one and the same person. I noticed that I remember to avoid all his other movies. It's a shame because all the good things were at hand: Malaysia is a beautiful jungle, it was a British empire and the cast is amazing: Jessica knows how to open her soul and for one time, she found the right movie for this. Bob Hoskins has shown a great experience and should win the prize for this role. The only positive thing is that the world map opens me to find this island because if you think it's happening in South Asia, you don't know exactly where! Ah, a plane with small planes in Indiana Jones !!!
