Well, Dude Where is my car can be at least a novelty as one of the few Hollywood movies that seem to be written, cast, filmed and edited in less than a day. I honestly can't believe it was done (or that I allowed my friends to sit around).

Oddly enough, unlike most thoughtless grotesque comedies, this film actually has a TOO MUCH plot - every scene seems to represent a new moronic and uninteresting subplot. Of course, they probably went to moronika, but it doesn't work at any level at all ... There is only one aspect of this movie I enjoyed: Donkeylips of the old Nickalodean show "Salute Your Shorts" has a very small role.
