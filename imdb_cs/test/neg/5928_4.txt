Sometimes I think somewhere in the "Lifetime" office complex there is a room where the writer hangs up with a big wheel on the wall - something like a big six in the casinos. You have plenty of places to win money and less for higher amounts until there is a couple that can pay more money. But I imagine that a canal wheel has about six different genres of its bike, with two of them appearing the most, labeled "Psychotic Neighbor", or "Husband with Hidden Past or Secrets or Both ". "Lifelong" films have several repetitive storylines, and these two seem to be the most ubiquitous. <br /> <br /> The category "Wife ..." may have a husband who has a long-standing relationship, but someone appears, or an event occurs, exposing that a good woman was once a hooker, one of the couple was involved in some criminal act long ago, or that something else in one of the backgrounds in other than supposed - etc., etc., or, like in this film, one of them came into marriage with the most vulnerable goal. One constant, in all its genres, is that the husband or other men are usually clueless, helpless, and slower to have some idea of ​​what's going on in hell until the climax, or at best very late in driving (unless the man is bad). It is not so. Whether or not a referenced unfair person can be a "neighbor", or as in this offer, "wife," it is always fascinating how easy, successful, and effortlessly they progress with their sad actions. They manipulate many others, beat them as needed, assume different poses, and juggle more fraud than you can count on - with unshakable success just before the end. The main actor here, as many other movies of this channel are the old hand. I noticed that the next movie he played was called "The Perfect Neighbor". Finally, the vengeful "perfect wife" in this film sends those in her path with more expertise and ease than the most experienced and competent "button man" in the Don Corleone family could gather. And I couldn't help but imagine that Jack Nocholson's character, Melvin Udall of "As Good As It Gets", with his massive OCD disability, could advise an anti-heroine to help solve his obsession, which was the basis of this opus. .
