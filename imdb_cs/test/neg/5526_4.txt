Now this weird movie. He was listed as a comedy, but I certainly did not find anything to laugh at. Actually, I'm trying to find something positive I could say about this movie. Here I am. Alex Ferns is not bad in the lead role and I have not chosen the end for change, but besides that, it has no big direction of firmly two-dimensional characters and is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious or dark enough to be any form of decent drama . I would never really have to look at this film again and I think it does not benefit any of the working class characters they are trying to portray. It was hard for me to empathize with a character, and I didn't get enough information about the lead character Jimmy believed in his motives. Best to avoid.
