Although it is certainly a well-crafted movie, it is without any entertaining value. <br /> <br /> If you're already depressed, this movie will send you over the edge. If you feel somewhat depressed, this film will be just one thing in your life to feel bitter. You will feel that it's just your luck that you decided to watch a movie that turns out to be a complete waste of time. Otherwise, you might be able to pass this film unscathed. , BTW), safe knowing that your life is much better than Jim's. Then you might think again that you were deceived, and that is actually a much worse situation than you previously realized. Maybe you will feel a little upset about Jim for notifying you. You might want to hit him a little with wet fish. The sad truth is how I liked this movie ... I hated it. On the way of oblivion, it took a rather long unfortunate journey, and then suddenly, without any reason, he looked back at himself and then stopped. Jim has no revelation, at least not the one on the screen. Jim has an unhappy life and an unfortunate set of options. He will not discover anything that may concern and make no significant progress on his way of self-knowledge. Of course, no one who lives can write the happy ending of this movie. As others have said, it's not a Hollywood story, it's bold and it's real. It's good. Sometimes life is quite a fight. If someone knew the "answer", they would do it well to shout it out of the roof. Still, I feel cheated because this film pretends to have something to say. You feel that it will say something, that if you suffer a little more, it will have something to say. It stops you and thinks. It's not. Again, this is a well-made movie. Therefore, it can be valuable for a film student with the affection of eg lighting techniques to use color palettes. <br /> <br /> It's totally wrong for the rest of us.
