Carlos is not perhaps the most original comic, but the first series was fun, his direct comments and observations were fresh. I missed a few seasons, but after all the allegations of material theft, I caught a few episodes of Mind of Mencia at the end of July 07. Carlos is much more in toilet humor and sex jokes than race observation. In one episode he assumed he was in the same league as Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle. I think not. Maybe Comedy Central will give him one more season, but the episodes I saw sounded tired and more words than Osbournes. Carlos, return to stand-up for a few years, get fresh stuff and try again.
