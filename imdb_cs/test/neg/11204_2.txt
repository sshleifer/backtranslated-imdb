Gordon Scott has made some good Tarzan movies, but this is not one of them. As I watched, I tore at the bad, apparently inner sets and hollow wooden "cloning" sounds as they went through the supposedly Dirt Trails, and crouched for bad dialogue and worse talks between the support cast, I'm still wondering, "Sheesh! This is a TV show level!" Then I found out that it was, actually, three television show pilot episodes woven seam-fully into one. It's nice to see Scott get out (alone) away from lame orchards in a few scenes; and fighting has pretty nice moves ... but oh, ow and ouch like to dialogue. And did I mention acting? Heck, Cheetah (or "Cheta," in this version) was a better actor than most people. And it doesn't say much. It's something like a stitch to see a younger Sherman (ie Scatman) Carothers act as a native. But probably not worth the total time-investment.
