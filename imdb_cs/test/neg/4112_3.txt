I will start by admitting that I like many movies that have low ratings on this site. I found that when I see what the creators are trying to do, I can find their work. Thunder was a story that interested me. I wanted to see what angles filmmakers would attack when telling a story. Overall, they tried to create a fun movie. The storyline was created, but most of the action movie's land is. Ed Burns does not know how to carry a rifle, but still keeps his own good as an action leader, given that many are not asking for it. The main problem is destroying the whole movie!, It's a terrible CGI. It is totally unacceptable that animals and backgrounds look very fake. Aside from the fact that animal images could be really good as well as action scenes, they failed because the production failed. It could have been a really unforgettable movie if they just finished it. It looks like they wanted to go back and fix all the horrible CGIs, but they ran out of money and still released them. Save your money because someone failed this movie. I give him three stars, because it could really be good, but somewhere completely wrong, I can't say enough.
