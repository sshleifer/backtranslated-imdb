I can't believe I watched the whole movie. Another "Ishtar" in that I waited to get better, which never happened. The sound is terrible, from too low to hearing conversations, to one-second sound. The storyline is totally unlikely, it is a mediocre act, although Keaton does his usual good job as a mental case, although in this role it could certainly be considered negative. The director knows nothing about hospitals, medicines, science or anything technical. "Sociopath" ???? I wonder how they came up with this diagnosis? There are so many bugs, goofy things and bad things in this movie that if we were to list them all, it could lead to some kind of record. Demerol as a general anesthetic? Motorcyclist on highway wearing off-road helmet without DOT / Snell. San Francisco ??? The paper walls move when they tap, the helmets emerge from the air, the guns point in one direction, but they hit another, the light appears and disappears, and the scene that contains no error is barely moving. My wife, who is an RN in an oncology unit, has finally left the room so disturbed by all medical errors before the end of the movie. I gave it 2 just because Keaton was acting, otherwise it would certainly be 1.
