Ridiculous film, horrible shearing, worst case scenario, ridiculous play, a story that's totally incomprehensible ... <br /> <br /> If God decides whether films will go on, we judge this, the whole world of film industry would now he was dead ... <br /> <br /> A beautiful movie that shows that a movie theater shouldn't be made by people who think they can make movies. I was still wondering who the two girls are in the movie for more than half an hour and are never introduced ... <br /> <br />
