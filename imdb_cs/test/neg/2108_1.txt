I really thought it was a spoof when I saw it in a rental shop, but I realized it was just stupid, I can't even believe I didn't close it, as we all know that these snakes weren't rattling. and Gardner's, the acting was lame and oms i still can't believe the end of the loll, if your going to watch it just watch it in the end it was a really precious way, better than the 6th sense, i don't even know if the movie makers actually thought this The title will fly, the only time it really will fly is when I throw it in the dustbin ...... just to watch the laughter it was merry in the dumbest way, don't buy JUST RENT.
