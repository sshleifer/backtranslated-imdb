I was excited about this movie after reading more reviews. What a disappointment! There are many ways this film is bad. At least computer graphics was missing. I found out that the actor is tough and incredible. Watch the sand as lost "e-pods" (what the original name!). Where do all the tracks come from? I immediately recognized portions similar to other films, ie Alien, Pitch Black. Come on, one big ship to transport one prisoner? And what about the prisoner? He talks, can he talk? I waited for something to combine pieces of the story together, but it never came. If this movie was made on a low budget, it shows. The only part I liked was the film. I don't think I liked the end, no. I really liked the fact that it was over. A trip to the dentist would be more pleasant. In my opinion. Don't waste your time on this.
