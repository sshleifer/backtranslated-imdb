Many have described in detail the level of seriousness I consider amusing, but not *: <br /> <br /> FILM. (cue dramatic music) <br /> <br /> It's just so bad, it's a good, absolutely unreal, Jackie Chan stunt for all. Women warriors are absolutely kick-butt and Jackie is definitely in his place. This is a movie you want to see with some good friends on a Sunday afternoon - surrounded by munchies, ready to roar with laughter, cheer good guys, boo bad guys, and keep yelling, "WHAT?" when something totally bizarre happens. Great fun !!
