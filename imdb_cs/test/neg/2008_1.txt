It is about 1000 years in the future and we have finally broken the travel by a huge distance between the galaxies !! But unfortunately we still use weapons that shoot bullets, blacks still call each other brothers and get tall stones, fight, etc. Common stereotypical urban blacks still get the short end of the stick! Babes in tight black rubber pants that look like they are from Baywatch to share a narrow alley with a captive and crew. Frozen people still need wheelchairs, no cure drugs, implants or robotic legs to move. Dracula still looks and acts gay. I need to go on ... In short, this move was shot on typical sci-fi sets with low budget props, actors, and no real special effects to talk about. The beginning, middle and end were pathetic. I have to go away and shoot now there is nothing for life.
