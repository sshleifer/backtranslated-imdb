The school is the result of a new trend in Turkish cinema. After using the same stories, new directors come up again with different ideas. Of course, that doesn't mean they're all big. I think Okul is one of them. It's supposed to be a scary movie, but it's not. Nor is it successful in being scary. So what is it? Actors are so mediocre, especially Deniz Akkaya is quite annoying with the role of a teacher. I'm sure it might be better if it was tried harder. Maybe concentrate on one topic like making it scary or vice versa. But this time the directors missed the goal. ** outside *****
