"The Wizard of Menlo Park" was deeply responsible for the many things we took for granted in 2007: although he didn't invent them without rivals or assistants, he gave birth to electric light, phonograph, video camera, car battery, power grid (maybe his the most important but least-mentioned invention), prefabricated house and innovations on telephone and telegraph, as well as a print cartridge manufacturing machine and an early voting machine. The total number of patents is over 1,000 - much more than any other American inventor. But Edison was a ruthless business competitor. He often had enormous legal fights over the merits of his inventions over rivals. The best example is a phone where he was one of seven or eight opponents with claims against Alexander Graham Bell. Actually, Edison's invention was not the central idea that Bell and Gray came in 1876 independently, but to improve the sound quality of the receiver and transmitter that Bell had not developed. It was still part of the Supreme Court's vast decision of 1888, which was the longest decision of the US Supreme Court (one bundle of their reports!) Written by Justice Chief Morrison Waite - who, incidentally, killed a poor Chief Judge overwork in weeks. finishing. In 1886, Edison found an equally ruthless competitor in the electricity grid for big cities. That was George Westinghouse, the inventor of the railroad break. Westinghouse has been assisted by a new inventor and former assistant to Edison Nicola Tesla. Tesla developed an "AC", which was a rival system to Edison's "direct current". The Edison system was essentially a direct circuit of electricity. Tesla's systems allowed the current to be switched from one circuit to another - in fact, it was a better and more efficient system. But Edison was determined to break this rival with a promotional campaign. It started with power lines. Edison had an underground line at the start of the line so that they were not threatened by the weather. But Westinghouse was forced to have its lines on open telephone lines. When there were several casual deaths by linemen repairs on Westinghouse's lines (particularly one incident where a repairman was burned alive before hundreds of horrified viewers in Manhattan's business district), Edison began to insist that AC was far more dangerous that DC \ t The result of all of this was Edison, who helped some of the secondary inventors in getting Westinghouse generators and dynamos for an electric chair. Edison himself has always denied that he invented an electric chair, but on the way he helped several smaller characters - read EDISON & ELECTRIC CHAIR by Mark Essig (New York: WALKER & COMPANY, 2003) for the whole story. Edison is experimenting with cats and dogs (experiments he likes to show to the public). In the long run, despite assisting in the invention of the new method of implementation, Edison could not squeeze out public support for AC power. But he never stopped trying. In 1903 he had the opportunity to combine his campaign against Westinghouse and A.C. He helped in "putting off" the well-known public elephant ("Topsy") who killed several men. He did so by catching a poor beast with electricity, but killing them on film - and you can still see it today. It is a pitiful-looking film - no matter what the bad "Topsy" was, it was a poor beast - not a Machiavellian killer. The moment we see the explosions of electricity sparks showing the elephant's death, we are aware that it will soon end, but the sudden collapse of "Topsy" is still an unpleasant sight. The film leaves a bad taste in the mouth of modern movie viewers. Sadly, it seemed to Edison's earnings - his film description in his film catalog points to his success. In 1903 it could have been exciting fun for many Americans to watch it. One is glad that more people scare him today - sometimes one may feel that the human race has improved a little.
