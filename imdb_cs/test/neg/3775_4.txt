Veber is not renowned for his outstanding directorial skills. In fact, nobody cares if they get laughter, few to be honest, scattered throughout the process, thanks to the half-space characterization of Depardieu and the dialogue of Veber in the mouth. But this is not enough to make a great comedy happen, because there is no film outside the usual Veber premise: a tough guy is doomed to connect with a very naive character. In L'Emmerdeur, La Chèvre or Les Compères, there was a real story about the water fire. Le Diner de cons, although it was a game, was able to create a real tension about another catastrophe that Pinon would cause. In Tais-toi, revenge backstores are both superfluous and too weak to arouse our interest. Plus they are heavenly on screen and in the script. <br /> <br /> What's wrong? Veber wraps it and creates no action, no rhythm. Instead, he systematically uses and overlaps ellipses (perhaps he met William Goldman in Hollywood) and "music" really emphasizes the lack of nerves and spine in the story. So you have to be satisfied with the performance of Depardieu.
