I was only cautiously enthusiastic about hiring "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane" as I immediately recalled hearing and reading a wide range of opinions? both positive and negative ??? in a short period of time between his short film release and videostore distribution. It was probably the most intelligent and refreshing new horror in the years, with non-stereotypical teenage characters and unpredictable twists of plot to change. Well, the underlying concept may seem sound innovatory, but the scenario will inevitably revert to the same old and irritating slasher clich√©, and once it has gone through this point, skilful stylistic marks can't save the film from terrible mediocrity. The opening sequences are truly amazing and are literally bathed in a moody melancholic atmosphere, which is all the more painful as we see the film go down to the "ordinary" level of rudimentary film. After the lofty intro, showing a drunk macho boy miscalculating his jump from the roof to impress the titular beauty, "All Boys Love Mandy Lane" turns out to be just another textbook and an uninspired horror about a bunch of idiotic kids getting stoned and horny on a remote ranch before, before an unidentified maniac kills him. The whole thoughtful setting of the movie is falling apart faster than the confused house of cards: we never get the right explanation why Mandy herself behaves so frigidly and haughty to all her admirers (because an orphan has grown, maybe? Oh, boo-hoo), the boys will soon prove that content with sex with any random bimbo and not exclusively with "divine" Mandy and the last twist? though undeniably offbeat ?? is simply plain. The middle part is somewhat boring and does not offer any real frightening excitement (shotgun killing?) Or authentic rancid sleaze. My generous rating of 4 out of 10 goes into a grainy and disturbing 70-year-old film style (with faded colors, bizarre but beautiful photo images?) And a surprisingly amazing soundtrack. Director Jonathan Levine opted for Bobby Vinton's classic "Sealed with a Kiss" to play during trailers and end credits, while I was initially convinced that the film would inevitably include the "Mandy" cheesy Barry Manilowa.
