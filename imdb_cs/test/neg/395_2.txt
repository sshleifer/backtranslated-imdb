This is one of the movies I watched and wondered why I watched it? What am I so interesting about? I was driving the truck driver myself, I didn't think it realistic. No, I never used "a lot of lizards", I never saw or heard about who would travel all over the country in a brand new seventy thousand RV. The same thing about a pimp that never caught the lady in question (until the end of the movie, and well, he's still not done ...), and just $ 50 for a "cut" when a prostitute gets $ 200.00 ( well, $ 150.00 after his cut, yeah ...). I still laugh at a lot of the lizard comments Ivey did (it's Lot Lizards, they screw up something with 20 bucks and some are men dressed as women). or something equally strange, which means we're better than them because we can still be prostitutes, but we get to pay BETTER. Otherwise, it's just a story of a young woman who wanted something more from life than working in a dead end while living at home (she's 18 years old, remembering?) and embarrassed by her mothers basically doing the same thing ( dead end work). At least she had a roof over her head and work. She turned five tricks on the road ... I wonder if it costs $ 750 she did? I think not.
