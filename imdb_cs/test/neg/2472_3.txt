Well, this is a standard Hollywood schmaltz that you can see as it approaches miles away. It's nice in parts, but just so predictable. I have to admit, I didn't like it very much, but I find it very difficult to please and many of my friends loved it. It's pretty sweet and the actors give good performances. It's a nice background and eye candy is pretty good. But the irritably predictable, unoriginal and really very boring story holds the film back. Personally, I can think of better ways to spend a few hours of my life. <br /> <br /> The genre of chick swing gets some bad print, but there are some really good chick flicks out there; this is not one of them.
