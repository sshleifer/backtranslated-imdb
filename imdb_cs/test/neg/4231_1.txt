The main character, Pharaon, has suffered the loss of his wife and child in the pre-film past. He deals with emotionally closing. Too long a movie, too much time spent on Pharaoh's faint face, too much time on the road (one of the TV bans: moving cars, trains, etc.). without reason or emotion. His best friends, Joseph and Domino, are no more their sex-based relationship (this film may give a new meaning to "gratuitous sex"); Dominoes and Pharaoh's mother are two characters who show some emotion but not much. It's hard to say, with all the characters in this movie: it's indifferent, indifferent writing, or simply indifferent characters portrayed by good writing and good acting. The characters in this film speak very little to anyone; It's surprising that their emotionally isolated, which is all the more bizarre, because it is clear that they live in a neighborhood where people are friendly and know each other.
