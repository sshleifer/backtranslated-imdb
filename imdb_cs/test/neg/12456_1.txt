I'm not going to waste more time describing how bad this movie is. Bottom line: It was terribly acted, had a huge plot of hole and went absolutely ALSO. The only good thing about it was the description that my digital cable gave for the movie: "A married man with a fighting business has a flirt with his secretary." Huh ?? Bad film apparently, though it could have made things somewhat more interesting if any description was true. <br /> <br /> --Shelly
