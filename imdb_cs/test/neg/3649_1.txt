Theme: Good Acting: Fair (some of it) Fence: ridiculous <br /> <br /> Details: Sound comes from a totally inaudible sound; music is not completely horrible (but mostly is); dialogue and characterization are ridiculous; the process of discovering the main character is obvious to everyone but himself (and the writer); animal scenes are simply stupid (singing "Moon River" in off-key, forgotten-lyrics, stupid duet to "herd" wild boars for hours, as one example). Finally, the "wet shirt" competition is so overly stupid that it must be seen as incredible. (Tip: 'Girl' who wins is not ... well, I won't give it.)
