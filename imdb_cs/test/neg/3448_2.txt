Two Stars <br /> <br /> Amanda Plummer looks like a young version of her father, Christopher Plummer on the move, stars in this movie along with Robert Forster - who was really supposed to give a little shoe black on top of that bald one <br /> I've never seen Amanda Plummer in a good movie. In films that do not complement, he always plays these tiny characters, and so he does. Firstly, we have two young women, sisters, who do not resemble the smallest, who allow them to be raised, separately, by dubious men along the roads. Amanda's character, Sandra, has at least a good reason to get Dr. Jake (Robert Forster) first pick her up. She was running away from the road, seemingly a maniac, and her car is largely destroyed. <br /> <br /> Warning - Spoilers Forward! However, as we go on, we realize that Dr. Jake doesn't play full deck more than Amanda. Makes all decisions based on rollover coins. <br /> <br /> When Dr. Jake and Amanda arrive at the motel we see, but the maniac car, and what Amanda does, but get to his Wagon station and start snooping around. What was her motive to do, it is never clear that a man is probably dangerous and can try to kill him. One would think that the last thing she would do is put yourself in such a precarious situation. Not only does he snoop around, but he finds some money and takes it. Shortly after that, we have a few other things that do not add up. Dr. <br /> <br /> Jake, with Amanda as his passenger, runs out of gas and two of them leave their car and walk. One would think he would cross the desert, check his gas gauge - that is very unlikely to happen to him. Later it is seen driving the same car. When or how did he get back? Dr. <br /> <br /> Jake tells Amanda she knows she took the money. How would he know? He didn't see her knowing it, and she didn't tell him she did. Later we have a character named Santini (David Thewlis), a man who was driving a car, giving them a lift and dare if he doesn't know that Amanda also took the money. How would he know? <br /> <br /> Losing credibility at an alarming rate, the more we go. When Alice, the sister of Amanda (Fairuza Balk) gets into the clutches of the killer and decides her fate to throw a coin - one would think she would be very, very careful to make a coin they exchange for a trick coin, it was definitely a trick coin - but it probably isn't. this, it ruin some credibility this film may have had.
