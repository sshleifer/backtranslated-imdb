The movie slogan is "Do you think you know who you are. You have no idea." I rejected both the proposed idea that I have no idea who I am and the suggestion that this film tells me who the people really are. If people are really such people in real life, then man, we're fucked up. A funny movie I entered late and left prematurely. A film that is so wrapped up in its goal of becoming the Racing Film of All Time, which loses sight of the tools the film must use. The rules of Hollywood are as follows: if you show something in the first half, it must be used in the second half. So the weapon that the daughter cares about buying her father gets somehow in the second half of the story. Hollywood rules are supposed to make the dialogue "real" - a concept that changes with every decade. Is this "real dialogue" somehow less ridiculous than Kevin Smith's "real dialogue" ten years ago? Hollywood rules state that we have set the scene, and as the action rises, the camera moves closer to the faces - in this film primarily to see the supposed shame, humiliation and transcendental realism of the characters. The strings increase, the frame rate slows down, and our heart is designed to break. This movie is as awkwardly manipulative as it is a vapid. I have my own prejudices against L.A., which I freely admit, so I will not say that this is a natural situation from the place, but rather from the author and the director to combat this prejudice. The writer, Paul Haggis, has already shown a taste of controversy over mankind in his Million Dollar Baby, which at least had a director who understood how to make a film vision to invent the best of his ideas. Now that Paul Haggis has his own hands on the camera, it is clear that he not only does not know how to write a true, natural human drama, but also does not know how to photograph or control it. Paul Haggis comes from the country of television, let's not forget: countries with reduced expectations. Everything is as obvious as a TV movie, simply introduced for simple minds - Haggis growls into us, over and over, that while on the surface people may seem horrible, they have hidden hidden pains. This is a nice idea, but so boldly presented that the whole juxtaposition of bad / good has an amateur feel. The film is structurally divided, in the tradition of Magnolia and other older films. Editing is so typical and commonly "kinematic" as it could be - when it comes to dramatic movements such as opening a door or driving a car between an object and a camera, editors use this extreme motion to create a cut that is more kinetic quality. The problem is that, in addition to trying to move things around, there is very little intelligence and thought behind the cuts - everything is kept in books. Not only are the puppets of this ugly racial strike and Judy show awkwardly processed, but the curtains are reduced and increased by incompetence. The film desperately tries to introduce reality, but there is no talent. Some of the actors are good, some actors are bad and all performances are blocked together, due to the low, low aesthetics of the movie. We have cinematography that is technically clear: we can see the scene, we have a clear idea of ​​what's going on. Not only is cinematography not only remarkable, but it is also a mindless camera and framing that believes it is inspired. The result is a small stylistic flourish that one knows, but in fact adds nothing to drama or pathos. For example - and this is a spoiler - as a father holding his dying child (his father could also be shot, I didn't get around to find out), the camera sees his face and gives us a familiar Vertigo / zoom track. Vertigo shot !!! At this point the film became hysterical and I had to leave. I had to leave because it was so bad. I was leaving because I was in the middle of a crowded theater and I wanted to tell the viewer that I was sick of Hollywood "art", which is full of sound and fury, but nothing (according to Bard's own words). I hate such good Shakespeare references to something so remarkably lost.
