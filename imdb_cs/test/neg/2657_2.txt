Why is it that such "romantic" movies that never go anywhere always start (and probably end up) with lousy jazz? It's not smart and makes it look like a bloody television movie. This film was content, slow, boring, unoriginal, wooden and I said it was boring? Harrison Ford was probably trying to be mysterious and rude, but it was just crawling, a mumbling cop who seemed to go to a congressional woman's house as everything was fine when he acted like a pervert - staring at Thomas with a perverted look, barely bothering to talk. And why the hell are they always taking British actors to get on the lousy accents - they're casted because they're famous, and everyone knows they're British because they're famous!
