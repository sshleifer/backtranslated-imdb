It's like someone has done a fantasy video game and put it in a blender, and the resulting mishmash scene is what we have to sit around. Now let me go to the record by saying how much I love Chinese fantasy movies. From fun and silly to those who focus on martial arts, to more dramatic and romantic types? Films like "Chinese Odyssey: Pandora's Box" and "Chinese Odyssey: Cinderella" (both of which were written and / or directed by Jeffrey Lau); "Bride with White Hair"; "Butterfly & Sword"; "Green Snake"; "The Chinese Ghost Story"; "Swordman II"; "Zu: Magic Mountain Warriors"; "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"; and more. Which is why I was looking forward to the "Chinese High Story". One of the characters of the film is "Monkey King" (aka Sun Wukong), an extremely well-known character in Chinese mythology, first told in the stories of "The Way to the West," an epic adventure written about 500 years ago. (The story of the Monkey King and his disciples is also the subject of many films by the Chinese Odyssey, among others). Other well-known characters appearing in the film are Zhu Wuneng (Pig Character) and Sha Wujing. So how does it not all work? Consider an example known to Western viewers. And what about Robin Hood's mythology? A well-known story from the old days. Let's say our movie Robin Hood played Wesley Snips as Robin Hood and Haley Joel Osment as Friar Tuck. Marian Maid is none other than Rosie Perez. Let's also give Sir Robin Uzi, because you never know when you have to lose a Nottingham sheriff. They could also need rocket packs, and give them a tactical nuclear weapon, because it will certainly come in handy. If you think it sounds like a real statement from Robin Hood's story, then "Chinese High Story" is for you! As mentioned above, this movie is a messy mess. In the first 30 minutes we are introduced not only to Sun Wukong, Zhu Wuneng and Sha Wujing, but also to the monk Tripitaka (who is actually the main protagonist), kidnapped children, the "millennium demon" (who shoots laser beams), the underground tree of God, the lizard imp tribe, angelic girl in intergalactic egg, Chancellor of the Lord Chancellor, King of the Sea Dragon, still morphing magical golden staff, little girl from the hut, girls in space and Four Heavenly Knights. That wouldn't be too bad - stories and myths that have passed over the years have certainly all sorts of fantastic elements. But I guarantee you that Chinese mythology will not contain most of the things we are exposed to in the last half of the film. (Helpful Hints for Filmmakers: Just because your computer effects guys can come up with cool looking spaceships and depicting intergalactic wars doesn't mean they should). Did you know that your Chinese mythology film is on the wrong track when the director asks (and don't do it? It's a direct quote from the commentary) "I asked the composer if we can have more rock-and- roll music when it turns into some kind of Android. "Is there a hidden story somewhere? Yes. Yes, there he is. Most adventures follow Tripitaka (played by Nicholas Tse? "Gen-X Cops," "Time and Tide," "My Classmate Barbarian") and Meiyan, Imp Girl Lizard (played by Charlene Choi and Computer). Choi is the best thing in this movie. You can know her as half of the Canto-pop group "Twins" and other movies like "The Twins Effect" and "Just One Look" (a surprisingly good drama / romance / comedy). Poor Choi, who is a lizard and everything, is barely recognizable with warts, ripped his teeth, clogged his nose and stooped. This is until the computers get caught and beautify her, which somehow worsens her. Tse is clear, but all supporting actors were helpless. A few recognizable faces in bit parts are useless. In one place I debated with myself when "A Chinese Tall Story" was a spoof. I almost convinced myself that it was when the intergalactic egg girl (played by very pretty Fan Bing-Bing) got out and switched on Marlboro (!), When she talked to Tripitaka, who was practicing martial arts dressed in Spider-Man costume (!! ). But it's not a spoof. Of course there is a typical Hong Kong stupidity, but the film is taken seriously enough, with enough scenes of romance and pathos (scored with violin mating and evocative cello) and exciting action and adventure. You may think that you could watch it for renting Netflix and nothing would happen to you. (Oh, but it'll cost you, okay). Is there anything good to say? Sure. Colors are alive (they're the best on this movie). And the filmmakers certainly tried very hard. Too bad all this went into a movie that's no more than a bad video game.
