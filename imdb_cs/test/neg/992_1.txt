Saturday matinee in my hometown. I went with an older friend (he was about 12 years old) and my mother let me go because she thought the movie would be fine. I was attacked by loud music, strong images, no conspiracy and stubborn refusal to make any sense. We left half because we were bored, frustrated, and our ears hurt. I saw it 22 years later in the theater. My opinion has changed - it's even WORSE! Basically, everything I hated was still and the film was VERY 60s ... and it dated badly. I got all the jokes ... too bad they weren't funny. Constant shifts in tone quickly annoy and there is absolutely nothing to allow them to grip tightly. Some people will love it. I found it frustrating ... at the end of the movie I felt like throwing something heavy on the screen. Also all Monkees songs in this SUCK movie (and I like them). br /> <br /> Ex-hippies only ... or if you're stoned. I give it 1.
