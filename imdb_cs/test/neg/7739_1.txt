Every boy finally learns a lesson that just because a girl is good looking doesn't mean she is good. Well, lemme give you a lesson at the age of 19. It's hard to say what's worse: Kathy Ireland's acting skills, or her ultra-high-pitched voice; the one that sounds like a whistling mouse on helium, scratching small tiny claws across the board. With an incomprehensible plot that takes place in space with dwarfs who need Kathy's Irish Bones for some dark reason, this film is bad at many levels. If there ever was a candidate to revive the Mystery Science Theater 3000, it would be.
