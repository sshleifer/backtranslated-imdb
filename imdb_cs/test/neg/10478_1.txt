First, I must admit that Separate Peace is my favorite book. Of course, I have some prejudices against any attempt to edit it for a feature film or television movie. But as I started watching this movie, I was more than willing to give him the benefit of the doubts. The original version from the early 70s, although shot at Phillips Exeter Academy where the author of the book attended school, and although it remained as faithful as it could to the book, lacked any real depth of feeling and failed to capture the nature of the characters. Initially, it seemed simple about movements. Reading trivia about the movie, you'll find it was mostly cast with non-actors. The original has an amateur feel to it and eventually fails. This new version, although I grant it to capture the appearance of a period better than the original, seems to have thrown this book all together. The scenes are rearranged, the characters are stored where they do not belong, characters that have not been in the book, and no attempt has been made to delve into deeper conflicts that make the book so compelling. And the cardinal sin of all: the tree is not considered a vital, almost central figure in the book. This is inexcusable supervision by filmmakers. How could they downplay the role of a tree? Why wasn't it introduced immediately? Why start a dead poet? And what was God's name with Gene's accent? This movie is to be blunt, garbage. Separate peace should not be a difficult book to adapt to a scene or screen. John Knowles wrote it in a completely subtle linear style. Filmmakers should trust this story as it has been written; make changes, sure; Decorate here and there, sure; be sure to take a slight dramatic license. But to destroy one of the pearls of American literature in this process? What did they think? In their story corruption, they restricted any possibility of tension or drama. The whole film falls and fails miserably. <br /> <br /> If you are a high school or college student who is supposed to read this book and think about skimping and watching a movie ... don't even think about it. This movie won't help you. Unfortunately, we will have to wait even longer before the story of this story comes to the screen that actually manages it.
