Enough. It's a terrible TV. Camera work is scary (I must remind you of crunchy gravel so loud that you barely hear actors talking) Lady Bertram has the most unpleasant voice in the world. Anna Massey is "acting" so incredibly. and the lack of chemistry between fanny and edmund is far beyond. Also, bertram girls are not pretty nice, and the one who plays Henry Crawford is terrible. to say that camera work is risky is underestimation. I followed this adaptation during Christmas and I think that in any other circumstances I would not be able to endure it, and I would certainly not be able to justify unnecessary time. I'm a fan of faithful jane adaptations. so I couldn't carry a film adaptation or a recent pride and film of prejudice. but see other adaptations instead, even emma is better than this.
