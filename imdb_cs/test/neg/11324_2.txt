Wow, I swear it never happened to me before. Yesterday I watched "Golden Temple Amazons" and I didn't have the slightest memory of anything that happened in this movie. This is a great movie, I think! I can only remember now that I was tempted to watch him because of the incredibly attractive DVD cover that shows an incredible drawing of a sensual amazon who prepares a bow to fire on an unspecified target. I often confuse the appealing DVD covers? especially Jess Franco you? and I have not yet learned to resist literally hundreds of terrible experiences. Oh, well ?? After reading the other user notes, some parts of my memory have returned, though I still suspect that this movie is with another Frank Frank masterpiece I saw the day before, "Kilimanjaro Diamonds" (and that someone had amazing work) DVD cover also). "Golden Temple of the Amazon" opens with the position of a hot white African Amazon? I am aware of this contradiction, but do not blame me? Parents defeated fragile young girls because they crossed the lawn with the intention of stealing the golden treasures from the temple. Several years and hormonal changes later, the girl returns to the jungle to get revenge. She is accompanied by a lot of slender adventurers who are less interested in the act of revenge, but he wouldn't mind taking the gold home. The basic assumption is obviously a secondary display of the ubiquitous female nudity and unreasonable sleaze. Analía Ivars, Eva Léon and other nameless amazons are regular Frank's elections and are willing to walk proudly with exposed breasts. You better look at all these perfect female curves because the rest of the Golden Temple Amazons is a boring and incompetent mess. There is hardly any violence or action, and not less than half of the film is pure fill, pieces and pieces of National Geographic documentaries adapted to the story and such kind. The amazing DVD cover would certainly be a great addition to your collection, but opening the box is absolutely useless.
