This is clearly a French film. It is a young group of idealistic / revolutionary / anarchist people. It moves very slowly. It takes a long time. LOng closeups. A minute or more is dedicated to trying to light a pipe full of hash / opium. Long reflection on how a group flips a car and burns it. It's a black and white movie. The headlines were white, so about a third of the time was unreadable. (Why do they do that?) I went after about an hour and three quarters when it was clear that this image was not going anywhere, slow. I wasn't the first to come out. It was the first time I came out of the picture in a long life. (Well, maybe the second one.)
