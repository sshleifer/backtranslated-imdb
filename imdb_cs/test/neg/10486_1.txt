This film was painfully awful. Most of the film consisted of people running in the woods, walking through the woods or dancing in the woods. At least half. Then two children, who discover two "terribly mutilated bodies" in the forest, return to the forest the next night for a romantic walk. ????? There is no time continuity. his day, his night, day, his really night, his twilight, his playground black, day. All forest scenes continue this way until you think you will lose your mind. really bad. The Sheriff discovered a five foot claw print embedded in the dirt of the forests and theorized that the super big alligator had learned to walk upright. A really stupid movie with no real motivation written for characters. It could be fun for little kids as an alternative to really graphic stuff.
