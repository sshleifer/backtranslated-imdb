OK I was bought this couple Christmas in front of my brother in law who took me to see "Get Shorty" in the cinema, which both were used to be "uber" amazed. And they watched them get short and cool one by one. I read reviews of people who haven't seen getting shorty and thought this movie was pretty good .... I just think its another way of making a movie company cheat on a paying customer. The only thing I say about this movie is WTF? After almost 10 years and Chili Palmer became a pussy .... The script was basically the same, they joined Travolta and Thurman after their success Plup Fiction, threw a couple of big stars (plus a shed of nobody) \ t good ..... Vince Vaughn's character was just annoying, although I was a fan of both he and Rock, both actors were so underused and unrealistic. Basically I am glad that it was bought for me as a gift, as if I paid the money for it I would be super angry.
