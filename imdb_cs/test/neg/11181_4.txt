Father Brown's thesis is that a good dose of Roman Catholicism will solve all life problems. A little proselytizing I don't mind, but it gets a little absurd at times. Some fine actors played Father Brown over the years, Kenneth More and Barnard Hughes are two good examples. Alec Guinness plays him in this movie and does it well, but you didn't see any great demand for Father Brown's future films. <br /> <br /> I assume that if you are a committed Roman Catholic, it all makes perfect sense. It is more important to catch the thief and transfer it to your religion than to see it brought to justice. But it was asked to accept it here. In fact, there is a preliminary story before the main action of the film. Guinness in a clerical garment is caught trying to return the stolen items that one of his parishioners, Sidney James, had ripped off during the robbery. This is a story that gives local cops and of course this is something James has told him not to break the confessional. <br /> <br /> Now for a bigger game. Master Thief Flambeau, played by Peter Finch stole the cross that is entrusted to Father Brown and was said to belong to St. Augustine back in the day. But Father Brown is more interested in getting Flambeau back to his faith than to bring him to justice. So he's putting the cops to fulfill his mission. I'm sorry, but the whole thing was too much for me to swallow. Father Brown wouldn't like to say he's guilty of obstruction and should have been arrested. And he had no duty not to disclose anything about Flambeau, the man did not come to him as a penitent who would seek absolution and spiritual advice. <br /> <br /> Author G.K. Chesterton, a well-known Catholic layman on his day, considers it all very reasonable. Based on the logical conclusion, we should replace all police forces with the army of priests. Father Brown. Although Brown is much smarter than the other two. There's also a little Colonel Nicholson in this view. In Bridge on the Kwai River, Guinness also played a character who is a somewhat strange interpretation of the rules causing him to lose sight of what was important in the situation in which Nicholson was. Father Brown is a fun colleague when he solves mysteries and makes the authorities stupid. We enjoyed Brother Cadfael, who did it in a medieval setting, and American viewers liked Father Dowling, who Tom Bosley had played a few years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie should be stuck for fun.
