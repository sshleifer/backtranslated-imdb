All I could think of while watching this movie was, "Will it ever be over?" Watching was unbearably boring. I wished I could just turn it off, but I wanted to do it to try to fight a good fight and withstand the torture of watching this movie to the end, so you, a good reader, don't have to wear this pain as well. <br /> <br /> This movie sounds as if it is a great prerequisite if you read the assumption on paper. But the real film does not bring this assumption at all. The opening scene is at the beginning of the 19th century, when children bring dynamite to tunnels that are not big enough. for adults. It seems to be a prerequisite for an interesting movie. But after 4 minutes it is clear that this is not the case. Adults who have committed these crimes are never punished; there are no consequences in the film. The opening scene is better than the rest of the film and is completely irrelevant. The last time when the opening scene distorted the film so badly, the opening scene was 28 days later, which was the only good scene in the movie. Wicked Little Things / Zombies (a movie so miserable that they have changed the name to try to disguise it as horrible and resell it) is exactly the same in this regard. The opening scene is the only traceable scene in the entire movie. Instead, the movie begins to flicker forward to the present. Single mother and her two brothers, girls in the mouth. It is here that it would be wise to press the STOP button and never get closer to the movie. In the first hour, the zombie children are almost invisible. They get a total of 3 minutes of screen. All they do is kill the pig, that's it. He spends the rest of the hour showing his mother and her stupid children, buying things in a local shop, walking in the woods and talking to each other. Silly teen daughter goes and hangs out with some other idiot teenagers and smokes weeds with them. <br /> <br /> There would be no reason to worry at all if the zombie kids sent someone in this movie. Each individual character is both silly and unpleasant. Not to mention one-dimensional and cliché. This movie would be * significantly improved * if the mother and her stupid kids were sent by zombie kids during the first 10 minutes as they went upstairs. into their new house, then the end credits rolled. This would immediately change the score from 1/10 to 10/10. Honestly! When the dumb mother gets out of the way and almost hits the pedestrians on the road, her daughter scolds her: "You almost killed us, Mom!" Of course, everyone with common sense knows that if mummy hit a pedestrian, it would be a pedestrian who would be dead - no people would have safely locked up inside the car. I think this line was inserted into the film to show firsthand that the sheer stupidity of the main characters does not know the boundaries, and runs in the family. Wicked Little Things / Zombies runs for 1 hour and 34 minutes, but it certainly was about 5 hours or more for me. Trying not to see was a huge challenge. It's not more than an hour before an hour and 34 minutes have passed that zombie kids actually bother to kill every person. Then the scene shows silly teenagers drinking beer and making in the car and saying lines like: "If you ever want to get into my pants again, you should start the car and get my ass out here." . Teenagers are so cliché, one-dimensional, poorly behaved, stupid and annoyed that when the zombie kids finally get to hacking 3 of them for 1 hour and 5 minutes into the movie, it's like a reason to celebrate. Of course, the "princess" of a silly weed, the stinking drinking daughter of a slaughtered drinker of the main character, gets rid of the slave. What it was! She was on the screen longer than the others, and she was the hardest of the four of them, and she deserved the pickaxe most. Another reason you should be sent in the first 10 minutes, as mentioned above. If you want to keep it around 1 hour and 5 minutes, it is absolutely inexcusable. The reason is, of course, that feature-length movies must be padded for at least 1 hour and 30 minutes. When she kept her alive for a long time when she should be, they have another 27 minutes to run the movie with her and the mother through the forest. Within 1 hour and 22 minutes, it's a * second * time in a movie where annoying daughter is trapped in a vehicle where the engine doesn't start while the zombie kids come to get it. Zombie Kids are absolutely general. Never say anything. None of them has any character development. Finally, all three unpleasant, idiotic main characters live. Which, in my opinion, is the way in which filmmakers make a final observation of the bird's gesture to the viewer. In my opinion, filmmakers know for sure that they have everyone who has a great disaster to watch the whole movie. Why not rub your face in it by not even giving them the satisfaction of seeing one of the three main characters that should be shipped in the first 10 minutes to die. Avoid Bad Little Things / Zombies Like Bubble Plague.
