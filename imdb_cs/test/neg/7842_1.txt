One commentator said if you like Austin Powers you will enjoy this movie. I liked Autin Powers and I was disappointed with this movie. The film works hard, maybe too hard for laughter. Maybe it was that all the villains in this movie were screaming, as if the screams were to be funny. I got to where they were trying to go with this movie. Cross between Zorro and Scarlet Pimpernel, but it just doesn't work. Austin Powers, if he is stupid but intelligent, Zorro Gay Blade lacks the wits of Austin Powers, The Big Lebowski or Kingpin. I waited for laughter and I was wondering when someone was actually paid. screenplay. My 15-year-old daughter also thought the movie was flat. My 17 year old, who chose this film for his title, left after 20 minutes. It seems that many people liked this movie on IMDb, but I missed good timing or good comedy jokes.
