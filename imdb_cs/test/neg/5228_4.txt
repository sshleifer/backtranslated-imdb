Based on Stephen King's novel, UNCOVERABLE THINGS provides intrigue and strangeness to put you in place. The mysterious man (Max von Sydow) comes to town and soon becomes the most famous citizen. Could it be that the devil himself established a shop as an antique shop in a small town in Maine? von Sydow is masterful and dynamic in this role that dominates the screen. They also play Ed Harris and Bonnie Bedelia. Harris is steady and Bedelia deserves your attention. Also in support are J.T. Walsh and Amanda Plummer. It's not the best or worst adaptation of King's horror on screen.
