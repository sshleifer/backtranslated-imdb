Promotion for "Clubbed" project Neat looking movie based on club scene of eighties. What we end up is a film with identity issues. Sub-parcels ended up taking over what viewers would consider the main plot, so focusing on this movie, which mainly concerns "clubs," ends up in the trough. Boxing, depression, self-hate, gangsters, bouncers and drug stores all hurry up to 90 odd minutes. On less than four occasions, I had to check the time of the movie, because the fear grew that this film was forced to disappoint. What club scenes we see are bland and repetitive, featuring approximately 3 extras dancing in what is hardly recognizable as a "club", barely capturing the atmosphere of the day. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a film about the 80's club scene, forget about "Clubbed" in the spirit of "Human Traffic" in the late 1990s.
