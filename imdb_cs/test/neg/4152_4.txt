Those who were born to Vietnamese mothers and GI fathers were often not found. A beautiful country is the story of one such child, Binh, rejected by his country village and then trying to find his American father. The film begins with a green and wild land, but descends into dirty sweaty ugliness and boredom. The considerable talent of Tim Roth and Temuera Morrison is unnecessary in the absurd and ill-conceived roles aboard a rusty cargo ship carrying Binh and dies his brother across the ocean with what appears to be stocks of stormy seas. New York City offers slave labor and clich√©s. While the very uneven is the great curiosity of this film from the start, it is the ultimate segment. Nick Nolte is given the highest bill. I was joking that he would probably be on the last scene and wasn't far from the truth. As the journey brings Binh to Texas and his father, the film sets out for a quiet and austere simplicity. The gentle coexistence of these two men connects the father and son into the family. Ninety special minutes of garbage we've just watched are rewarded with Nolte's profound and subtle performance as they interact slowly. The credits rolled and I was surprised to see the names of Badlands executive producer Edward Pressman and Terrence Malick, a native of West Texas.
