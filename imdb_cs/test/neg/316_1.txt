Warning Could contain spoilers <br /> <br /> I unfortunately spent $ 5 on this movie on amazon and I would never spend it. I've never seen sucking terrible special influences or acting. I think the Jack-0 is just a ridiculous monster and his costume looks like something you can buy in a Halloween shop or make it. Acting is just horrible, especially Sean Kelly, I think he'll come up so pathetic with his little lines "COME gets me a PUmpkinman" low I laughed so hard at his just stupid. I think the film is so horrible that they had to put a few minutes of nudity in it just so people wouldn't stop it. I think the most ridiculous scene is when a woman in a toaster holds a butter knife and gets an electric current. I think he came that he looked so fake and the dummy I could buy that at any Halloween store or get it myself. Well, I recommend not to watch this cheesy movie because it will be a time when you never come back.
