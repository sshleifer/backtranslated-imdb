This movie was so badly acted. What was the accent with Jeff Bridges, terrible and incredible. Should it be French, Scandinavian? If you want to have a heroic journey over your friend's grave when you run away from Jeff Bridges ... Are you kidding? How convenient it is that Jeff brings his dirty shovel to the house after getting rid of the bodies in the lawn. Don't these people just believe in the cops' calls? Well ... I'll take you to the car, why not? DUH! Why was Bridge's daughter obsessed with her father's affair, is her mother bad or just boring? I didn't see the original, it would be hard to look after this movie.
