This appalling adaptation to drama will be carelessly stretched by the plot of the magnificent book Dickens, which will replace the emotional impact with hurried transitions and outer places with drawings. It's not because of the actors and the production team that the budget is so low, of course, but you have to question how to do it first when there's no time or money. Scrooge Michael Hordern is too gentle at the beginning, so his transformation lacks power, and that does not help him lack of reaction from him as he watches the vision. Other actors range from acceptable (Clive Merrison, Paul Copley) to non-binding (Bernard Lee) to look as if they want to forget their lines (John Le Mesurier). This is not even a point to be honest.
