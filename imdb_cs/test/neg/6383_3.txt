I know Terry Gilliam is considered a good director, but he says this film is good, he's just foolish. What was the movie about? What is spoof? Imagination? Comedy? Satire? No answer from Gilliam's script. Totally confused and absurd, he raced from one historical age to another. I find it fun that some people call this film magically. Is it because he has to praise any film that is unclear and indecisive about what it is about? 3 stars for special effects with respect to it is 1981. Roger Ebert has it right in his review. The film is ambiguous and it seems that Gilliam is converging with money just to make a vague children's movement a historical review. The film also attempts to confuse would-be viewers by giving John Cleese and Sean Connery the top bill.
