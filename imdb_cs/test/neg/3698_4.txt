This is the kind of movie that BEGS will show on TV at 3 or 4 in the morning, if at all. There is no doubt that the filmmakers responsible for "Attack of the 50 Foot Woman" thought they made relevant statements about women and philandering and the danger of demon rum, all wrapped up in science fiction allegory. Or maybe it was a tax depreciation. In any case, "Attack" will prove to the viewer in the following circumstances: a) extreme intoxication, b) seeing two-bill with one of those Jacqueline Suzanne movies (maybe "not enough is enough"?) or c) just the night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a bit perfect. Pop in "Attack" and you'll feel great, guaranteed! It's good for laughter at the expense of the hokey script, the rubber special FX, and the four-legged sheriff. And I think the last line should be engraved in a memorial somewhere in Washington D.C. - It's just unforgettable. Four Stars for "Attack of 50 Feet"; buy a copy, send it to Gloria Stein - she'll love you for that.
