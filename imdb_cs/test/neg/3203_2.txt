This film, which tries to fit into the genre of scary space comedy, falls into two of them. This really happens in space - but it's neither funny nor frightening. The plot is dismal and one joke about the computer's intellect is played to death. To say that Paul Whitthorne like Ethan, Angela Bassett as Fran and Brad Dourif as Al Bert are making their script the best. Homo-esque relationship between Ethan and Al Bert is hinted at, but never explored while attempting sexual tension betwen fran and rick is so rude to laugh. All this is the turkey that is best suited for late night television, best when ironing.
