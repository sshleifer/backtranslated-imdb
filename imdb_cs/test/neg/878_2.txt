This is one of the most romantic movies I've ever seen. Casting: Richard Gere is already too old to find romantic leadership roles. Diane looks a little eager to please and frown as usual, but the romance does not seem to be convinced. The support cast is not very memorable. Story: The medical drama she has to deal with is not convincing and not interesting. The story is weak - not enough about the film. There is nothing new to say, nor a new way to say it. The setting is a bit grim and the house where it is located is unattractive. <br /> <br /> It's NOT destined to remember.
