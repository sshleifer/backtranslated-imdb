Half Past Dead was unlike any movie I've ever seen. Very little of Segal, alone in action and I agree with the last rating I read, Nia Peeples steals the show. Here I saw nothing new, the same old things from other movies have changed a little. The best action scenes were Nia when she kicked her ass again. It was interesting to see her as a bad guy after watching her for two seasons at Walker, Texas Ranger, still kicking his butt but for good guys. <br /> <br />
