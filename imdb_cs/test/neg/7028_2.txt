This movie could have been much better than it had been if it hadn't been Disney. I thought the young girl who played Shirley was fine, you could say he's really trying to do the right job. The teenage Shirley Temple wasn't at all. I think they should have spent the last time in childhood, the first lesson was about young Shirley, then the last lesson was about older Shirley. It was a boring movie, and not a good story for Shirley Temple.
