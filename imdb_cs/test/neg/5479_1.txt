This could be the best game ever! But the creators of the game after 3 assassinations and in the end !! This is a combination of Prince Of Persia, Hit-Man, GTA, and Age Of Empires II (Saladin). Yes, these four games listed above are considered to be one of the biggest games ever made. br /> <br /> Combine four and get this game !! It has all the good aspects of four games such as acrobatic skills, stealth murder, open world and HISTORY !! For the first 3 assassins you feel that this game is the biggest! But after the third, things seem so repetitive that you just hope GAME will end. <br /> <br /> I played it on a PC and the PC version is terrible with glitches and stupid side missions are pointless. <br /> <br /> WE LIKE ALL. This is a good game but get it for XBOX360 or PS3. Don't get it for the PC. Finally, this game comes from the creators of Prince Of Persia. The producer is certainly hot, but the game is not hot and not better than the four games above !!
