Don't get me wrong, I love Stephen King! And this is a good movie. Angry Cujo is very scary and the movie is exciting. But after the first few minutes, when poor Donna and her little son Tad were captives in their Pinto at the angry Saint. Bernard, imprisoned, I wondered why she didn't do anything to help. She could have pushed her foot out of the door and pushed the car back (I think it was Pinto for Pete and they were down the slope) and rolled into safety, but then it would be a very short movie. When she started the car, she jumped into it and hoped to get on the driveway at least? No, he's trying to make a three-point turn in the car with a bad alternator. She managed to get out of the car and look for 45 seconds or so in one place to try to get to the baseball bat lying on the ground nearby - a waste of time! I mean, if you're going to a bat, do it and at least you'll have something the dog would get. But forget about the bat. Were there any tools in the car like iron on the tire or something? I couldn't see her looking into the spare car. Really, why wait until you get bitten and weak from dehydration and your son has seizures before you stand up against the animal? At the end of the movie she was beaten and torn, but God, she still had high heels!
