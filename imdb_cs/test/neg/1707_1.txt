There was a time when Michael Jackson was worshiped as the king of pop. Then came the time when he attracted negative publicity just as lemonade attracts wasps. It is now time for this man to be really sorry. <br /> <br /> This "movie" is another reason. I promised an angry Michael Jackson fan to watch her. You know the type of fan - someone who tells him that he likes everything that has been affectionate. When I watched this movie he had seen twice, I realized how far it was. Probably far enough to rate this movie over 1/10, as some people have miraculously done. The film attempts to be a parody of many other films and series, especially Cast Away, Lost and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, it unfortunately fails at any level. Acting does not save an absolutely horrible story, filming has the quality of an often played videotape, special effects have been better made in Be Kind Rewind (for those who do not have this film: with aluminum foil). It would all be funny if the film succeeded, well, funny. Unfortunately it is not so. It hurts to watch it. And then Michael Jacksons looks in this garbage. He appears on a projection screen to deliver an important message, and manages to come across as mobile as Jabba Hutt and as serious as a 4-year old. When I thought that "who is the horrible man who lured this poor man to participate in this film and once again made a total fool of himself", I (finally) achieved the final credits and found that the film was actually partially shot in Jackson's movie. Neverland Ranch. In other words: He. I like. This film and its commitment is really worrying. Don't look at it even for "haha, movie in IMDb Bottom 100" effect. Or be warned.
