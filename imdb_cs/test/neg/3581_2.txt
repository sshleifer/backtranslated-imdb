I don't know what happened to director Abel Ferrara. Since the "Body Snatchers" remake has lost. "King of New York" and "Bad Lieutenant" remain two of the best films of the 1990s: the unbearable charge of decades has gone wrong. With films like "R Xmas" (no matter what it means) and "New Rose Hotel", he seems determined to disgust and bear his former supporters. This film has NO LIFE in it. While in all his actors in all of his projects he achieves excellent performances, the result of this mishmashu ideas simply does not. Whatever the point - that the new drug dealer breed is more or less the same as any other upper middle class New Yawkuh - the numbing scenario and the boring direction are lost in mind. I saw this opening night at 4-Plex in downtown LA In the lobby, when buying tickets, I was surprised and pleased to see that it was filled with a large, racially mixed group of men and women in their twenties and thirties. Then they started the theater, but it was a theater that featured "8 Mile", not "R Xmas"! A theater that shows "R Xmas" (remember that it was the opening night!) It had a total of 4 people watching him, me, my wife and two others! Way to go, Abel! <br /> <br /> 2/10
