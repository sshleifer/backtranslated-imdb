Forget that most people expect an action movie Seagal. This film just had no substance. Very long, stretched and boring. The scenes were much longer than they had to be - the camera often focused on something that was going on long when nothing happened. Cure insomnia. Worst Seagal movie by far (I like some of his other movies). 1/10
