I caught this at the True / False Documentary festival in Columbia, Missouri, and I was quite disappointed. I was expecting a great documentary to protest and activism around the RNC, but what I got was largely wrong, bad behavior, fictional, conspiracy, conspiracy of a badly woven tale. I have heard of his neo-documentary technique, "mixing truth and falsehood," but I was expecting more in the spirit of a fictional story developed for a better embodiment and creating a sense of unity between real conversations, but that was more. horrible line made pro-conspiracy theory TV movie. Overall, he's terrible, except for Rossario, which is not surprising when the director said during the screening that most of the leading characters were not acting. Training, his excuse is that he wanted them to be real. It's a hint that real people can't act, but actors can usually act. It wouldn't be that insulting insult if it wasn't obvious how much he wanted to push this extremely hard. A radical conspiracy theory on us throughout the film, especially hysterical when we get a scene where the director enters and starts to brag about ridiculously stupid theories and secret agendas. The film also does a good job of laughing stereotyping each individual role, it strives to so strongly romanticize these street activists and stamp the great 'Good' or 'Evil' on each character. <br /> <br /> Skip, you may appreciate a nice documentary /
