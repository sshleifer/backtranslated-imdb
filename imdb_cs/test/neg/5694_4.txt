I'm willing to tolerate almost anything in the Sci-Fi movie, but it was almost unbearable. While several special effects are very cool (landscapes), it is no "battleground" rather a disjointed strange relationship mother / daughter with a science fiction concept that is thrown in. With "hand-to-hand" combat scenes funnier than any Hong Kong chopsocky movie, this movie is bored. The plot line is convoluted and the devices used to move the plot along (narrator), inexplicable jumps of the scene, and lots of deus ex machina reinforce the idea that the writer cum director is not a good idea. Save your Sci-Fi love for something else instead of losing it a little.
