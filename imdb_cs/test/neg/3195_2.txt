Wow. One night I watched McCool yesterday and all I can say is "Wow." Here I am. MAJOR SPOILERS. Would you like to summarize the story just to see how stupid and meaningless this film is? I would never tell anyone to look at him if I shouldn't cause them pain. By the way, here is a view (or a huge piece) of a plot. Randy works for a bar, McCool. He meets this woman named Jewel, who convinces him to have a surprising sex with him. Her ex-boyfriend is trying to rob them and kill them. Randy and his cousin and detective at the crime scene fall behind a gem. As a stupid mascot, he uses each of these guys to get what he wants, including a DVD player. Randy hires a man to kill him, and finally the detective is killed by a former friend's brother and a hit and a jewel. And it is done. I barely left anything except a few other sex scenes and the almost pornographic scene of Liv Tyler as a Jewel using a hose that boasted about her sexuality. What was the meaning of this film? To be honest, I think it was so that producers and directors could show off their male desires. What, in my opinion, is totally erratic and simple stupid. When I watch a movie, I want a conspiracy. I want characters. I don't care about a sexy woman who boasts anything she could have. Something should happen in the movie, for the good. This is as bad as a fighting club. It's even worse. John Goodman is a detective dedicated to higher being. I myself was wondering why Goodman would play something so incredibly pitiful, but then I remembered being in O brother, where are you? also. His reputation went a little further. Liv Tyler was an amazing actress in The Lord of the Rings series. There is nothing more in this film than an unintelligent bitch who wants nothing but her journey. Her reputation has dropped by seven or eight notches. I'm impressed, just confused that people will work so hard to do something so stupid. The music is totally miserable (with "YMCA" playing while John Goodman's character is being killed, really doesn't fit), the characters are totally unlikely, the conspiracy is one of the stupidest things you've ever invented, and above, it doesn't even fit into any genre. The closest is pornographic comedy. If it was funny. What wasn't that? <br /> <br /> I think I've done ranting now. But let me assure you that no one in their right mind would ever want to see this movie. If they don't want Liv Tyler, just like the characters, that's it.
