This movie is about a party set up by a high school "scary girl". On the illogic of these types of films, she gets permission to keep the party at the house, which used to be a crematorium, a dubious place long shut and locked. It seems that the history of this work is one of those urban secrets that are left unnoticed among the people, although the legend is told among the young. Why was this crematorium really turned off? What actually happened in the past? <br /> <br /> I like these movies killing supernatural killing if there's something that's not copied from a hundred other movies. The highlight of this film are the petty theft of "7-11" robbery by scattering a clerk with a vivid look, changing the clothes scene "good girl" witnessing her sticking out younger brother, eventually the extinction of an ugly neighbor who hates vacation, the scene of a haunted mirror and a flowing concept water is a barrier to supernatural; the best part of this film is when the obsessed party sponsors the BAUHAUS dance in front of the fireplace; the rock scene.
