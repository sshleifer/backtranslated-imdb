Poor second-brief feature from Universal Pictures about Mom's boy movie actor doing a criminal investigation into work for the army, fending off the advances of a tough young woman, he was assigned to romance. Robert Montgomery directed and starred in the adaptation of Come Be My Love, and his performances at this time are undoubtedly lazy. The storyline is sappy, predictable stuff, and writer Robert Carson put all the really funny lines (as usual for movies of this period) to black maid feisty. It's always nice to see Ann Blyth and Jane Cowl in support, but they can't do much with this hockey stuff. * of ****
