It is reassuring to see that other IMDb reviewers have made good sense to have this unsatisfactory film, at the risk of blasphemy against the great Vadim, Malle and Fellini. These directors can be talented and artistic in their own right; however, attempting to transmit this hodgepodge of attempted eroticism and the 60s elegant as * in some case * related to the stories of Edgar Allen Poe, they exhibited themselves as cheats. Either (A) didn't bother to read Poe stories, or (B) read them, but they were so lagging behind their own egoistic agenda that they didn't pay any Poe minds. Imagine if Metallica plugged their guitars, wrapped the amplifiers up to 11 and moshed out the 3 chords claiming it is Beethoven's 9th Symphony. This is the feeling that you will get after sitting in this movie. If you're a Vadim / Malle / Fellini (Metallica) fan, you'll kick him. If you are a Beethoven fan (Poe), you will vomit. <br /> <br /> METZERGENSTEIN ... <br /> <br /> Here we start with a bizarre porn version of Poe. OK, "porn" can be a bit of an extreme haha, but at least you have to call it a Barbarella version (including, no doubt, some of Jane's outfits that come directly from the scifi romp set). Vadim falls into his own clich√©: the girl lies on the bed and is pleased with a man while we see apathy in her eyes from the pillow cam; general lassitude and ennui women who do not find satisfaction in hedonism. Cute stuff, but "Metzergenstein" is no place for it. And besides the barbarella outfits and irrelevant erotic themes, the scary American accent Jane Fonda and the unconvincing performance as the European Countess have made the worst castings since Julia Roberts in this miserable version of Dr. Fonda. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde. Here's a great Poe story about the madness that claims to be a man when he realizes he is no longer unique in the world. If you really want to see a fantastic visual interpretation of this topic, check out the Star Trek # 27 "Alternative Factor" episode. But here, Malle glaze over this central theme and instead focuses on ... any estimates ...? yup, erotica, sadism and debauchery. Hm. The role of Brigitte Bardot is a perfect work to achieve this goal, and the director again distorts the classic Poe's story into a masturbation catharsis of his own unrepeatable sexual problems. Do it in your own time, Malle. I thought we were here at Poe's tenth. <br /> <br /> TOBY DAMMIT .... <br /> <br /> Absolutely the worst of the three and perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Alive ". At least Fellini showed some change in name, but his departure from the original plot, theme and humor of the story is so huge, I wonder if he just chose this reel from his private collection of home movies, stamped" Edgar Allen "Poe story "on it and submitted it to this collection. I strained very hard to find some thread of credibility with Poe's work, but there was absolutely no. The Original Poe Story ("Never Bet the Devil Your Head") is a short and cheerful dark fable about a man who constantly exclaimed, "I'll bet a devil's head ..." your offer. The result is the worst and saddest thing you've ever read. It was Poe, a comedian, in his best (yes, Poe wrote many comedies. Also look at "A Prediction" and "Devil in the Belfry" if you want the taste of his funny, satirical work). <br /> <br /> This version of Fellini? It's bland, mindless and not funny at all (unless you consider it fun to see a drunk stumble after 45 minutes). Fellini's egoistic rant is about an artist struggling with the hypocrisy, pretense and mediocrity of the film. Most of them are set at a ceremony where Fellini defeats us with sarcasm, cynicism and the classic "sour grape" stance found in all of Fellini's cinema films. Note the sarcastic strokes at "Critics", a repetitive theme in Fellini's films. For someone who thought of the critics, Fellini spent a lot of time talking about them. In any case, I feel that Fellini just took some outtakes of 8 1/2, put them together and sold them as a Poe story. The worst "adaptation" ever. I think I've put more effort into writing this rating than any of the three directors in Poe.
