You must respect Arachnia in a way. It is clear that this is a tribute to the great films of the 1950s, and while the special effects look terrible; at least the film doesn't have CGI. On the other hand, however; you cannot respect the film too much because it is a lot of waste. Acting is terrible, special effects (as mentioned above) cannot be taken seriously, and once you have seen one huge spider thrown out; You've seen them all, so it's bored quite quickly. The story follows a lot of people who are unlucky to be in a plane crash after a meteor shower. They go to a single house in the area; which is simply a house where a giant spider has been used as a circus attraction. Coincidentally, at the same time, a meteor shower caused more giant spiders to rise from the underground. All characters in this movie are bad cartoons; none of them has anything similar to the third dimension and will soon get bored. You must feel like director Brett Piper because he probably didn't have much to do with this film; but that doesn't mean that Arachnia is worth damn, and overall there are gigantic movies than this, and that's why Arachnia doesn't get a seal of approval from me.
