Don't waste your time. The story goes, the characters are wooden and uninteresting, the motivations of their actions are completely incomprehensible. He waited for a "romantic" or "comedy" and nothing happened. Worse yet, the love letter is not even romantic, but it sounds like someone desperate to set a date. I mentioned that the "conspiracy" we saw coming from the 15 minute to the movie was "smart" Hollywood, which means it is intended to shock, but due to the Hollywood mentality - it does nothing and instead is vaguely offensive. It's not even $ 2 for rent. Don't bother to see it.
