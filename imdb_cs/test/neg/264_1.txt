Oh, how critics fell apart to praise their goldsmith Paul Schrader (author of Taxi Driver) when this movie came out. I have never seen the qualities they find out when I watched this movie during the day, so I checked it again to see if I was wrong. Mishima is extremely uninteresting. It is a cool, extraordinary film about an author living / working in a cold abstraction culture. Flat renovations will not keep your attention because they are emotionally upset and stagnant. And the rest of it just sits where it's horrible ... with soldiers singing songs about masculinity they promise, a hairdresser about cleanliness, admiration of swords, etc. <br /> <br /> It must be a triumph when you learn that you landed with Philip Glass; but then you have to get something out of it. The score glass does not leave a slight difference from its other work, nor does it give the film any noticeable value. In 2010, it should be clear to everyone that Schrader lost his career at work with no impact or importance (Cat People, AutoFocus, Light Sleeper, Patty Hearst, American Gigolo). He can give you a piece and kill the momentum of the movie, faster than anyone. Schrader made a biography full of lousy, amateur movies.
