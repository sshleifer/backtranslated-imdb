Chuck Jones's 'Odor-capable Kitty' is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world? somehow. There are several key differences between Pepe that we know and love (or hate, for some people) and the character in this cartoon. For one, a hidden cat that Pepe lovingly watches in 'Odor-capable Kitty' is clearly male. Also, Pepe is exposed as a scam, whose real name is Henry at the top of the cartoon, his French accent falls off when his wife and family turn up. Pepe is not even a leading character here, focusing on a put-on cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare his enemies. For the most part, the story largely follows the usual format of Pepe Le Pew Caricature, but Pepe's aggressive courtship lacks the usual wisecracks and directly to camera addresses that make him such a great character. He is not nearly as handsome as he would have become and somewhat awkwardly animated. In fact, 'Odor-capable Kitty' is a fairly ugly and clumsy-looking cartoon all round. His main source of appeal comes from his concept that was original at this stage before it became a template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed. This subsequent development robbed 'Odor-capable Kitty' of any impact at all, and for modern viewers it just looks like a rather boring Pepe Le Pew short with a strange end of surprise. I hated Pepe Le Pew as a child. As an adult, able to appreciate his more sophisticated, verbal and risqu√© humor, I love the character and most of his cartoons. 'Kitty', which feels like a bad smell, brings me to the kids again!
