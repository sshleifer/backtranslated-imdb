I talked to her about how girlfriends see it. John was a good guy, sweet, sensitive and looked great without a shirt !! I thought it was a love story about both, but mainly about his reactions to her letters. Savannah was a likable character at the beginning of the movie, but once she was thrown away, I lost respect for her. She said she tears herself away from him, and it was hard - he was a million miles away, killing people and the only contact he got was through her letters !!! She had no hard time, she had family and money, and he had the service! I was so frustrated at the end when he forgave her - he was too nice. I would have waited three years and welcomed him at home with open arms.
