This television show is stereotypical and appealing in many of its aspects. <br /> <br /> Especially setup. All characters visit the PCA, this incredible boarding school with painted stylish dormitories. It seems that the campus has no reasonable rules - for example, boys are often seen on girls' dormitories and vice versa. However, this can be simply because a college advisor, a stupid character who basically bores the viewer, rather than amuse them, as I suppose he is supposed to be her goal, sits and does nothing. I have friends in boarding schools and laugh in many aspects of school in this show. <br /> <br /> Next characters. I was so disappointed when I found out that Nickelodeon was not creative with celebrities in this show. Everyone represents a characteristic that is exaggerated to the extreme: Zoey is reportedly perfect in everything she does (look, grade, sport, guys, judgment, creativity, etc.), Michael is an athlete, Logan is an arrogant jerk who basically does nothing In addition to the deterioration of all characters, as well as our poor viewers, Nicole is a preppy idiot who knows nothing, but somehow keeps her straight-And, Dana was a tough girl, Quinn is an unrealistic 'clever kid' who's always having fun, Chase is the one who is afraid to admit their "real feelings", which really makes me worse when the show goes on, and the new girl - Lola or something - is just another clone of Nicole. The two main characters that make me worse are Zoey and Quinn. Above all, I do not understand Zoey's character. Apparently, it was designed to be a "perfect" character, as I said above, but it seems to be the most serious of all of them - in most episodes that create a problem, then it has to fix it. It is frustrating that we should love it and think it is amazing when they have not yet created a very realistic character to begin with. On the other hand, Quinn is bothering me because she is exaggerated to the point that her character is completely offensive. The impression I get from Nick about her character is that "geeks" and "idiots" are people they can, criticize, ridicule. In the spring break episode they did a year ago, they introduced two more "crap" that the characters had to do "cool". I found it very offensive and stereotypical. What message does Nick send to these children? It's: Don't do well at school, don't get good grades, don't study hard - you'll end up being a geek and we'll be ridicule your profession in future TV series in the future! Because that's the message I get from these badly built characters, and it's a terrible message through them. All I can do is hope that one day, one will realize that by putting off smart people in our world they don't do anything good.
