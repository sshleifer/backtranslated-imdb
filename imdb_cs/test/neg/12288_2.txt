Well, I watched this movie when I was very small and the day we cleaned the locker, I saw it, I thought, "I have no idea what the movie is," so I went into it. !!!! This movie is so damn bad, I never thought this movie could get so close to my favorite movie as I did, but I laughed because all the jokes were so frantic and ridiculous. funny because it was SO STUPID !!!! This movie is nowhere near good.I would have to say if you want to watch this movie definitely better don't expect something big and if you have already seen it, believe me, I also feel your pain !!!!
