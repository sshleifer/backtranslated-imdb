* spoiler alerts! * it just gets to me nerve some people have a remake (and i use the term freely here ..) good movies. In the American version of this Dutch thriller, someone decided that the original end was not sufficiently pasteurized for the American audience. So what do they do? create a new one! A stupid, unlikely, i-pretend-i'm-dead-but-come-to-life-again-so-good-guy-can-kick-my-butt-some-more kind end. do yourself a favor and get the original.
