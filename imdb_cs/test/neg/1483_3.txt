One of those films where you bet on who will die first and who will survive at the end. There was just something about the movie that made me zone out. I think because I'm still looking back and thinking, "I'm still in the tree ... still looking at the water". Bad character development. I didn't feel anything when they were in danger. I voted in favor. It was hard for me to believe that croc would try to tilt the boat in the first place, and then when it jumps into the boat I find it unlikely. Croc sometimes appears too supernatural ("everyone knows everyone sees"). Also, when croc attacks its behavior seems very unrealistic. It is a killing machine and would not let the victim escape two or three times in a row, especially when attacking in the water.
