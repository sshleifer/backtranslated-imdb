I got a discount copy of it. I saw it a few years ago. My only recent experience was "Mystery Science Theater," where it was spoofed. Nobody ever gets a chance to get into these movies for all the byplay. I love the early 1950s horror movies. They give us a pompous lecture on defense systems near the Arctic. They were there to protect us from the expected Soviet invasion, but they should come in handy because of the threat of a very large insect. This particular is flying. For some reason, despite its exoskeleton made of grasshopper things are made of, they can still repel air to rocket air and turn off fighter aircraft. Anyway, it's much more fun - the first, mandatory case that saw a flying thing cooling the heels in the hospital (it just teaches one - to see insects as big as a house - keep your mouth closed. if the poor man has to go home after they have found a mistake. I still have a kick from these movies and this is usable.
