It was an incredible comedy in the seventies that had fun in the psychiatric profession and in Beverly Hills. It didn't bother me, but I objected to being a marriage and a religion: two themes that secular filmmakers (meaning everyone in Hollywood and elsewhere) just can't stop trashing. Walter Matthau plays a scuzzy character, "Donald Becker", who walks with a cleric collar that offends me, but when Hollywood ever feared Christian insults? Yet, despite this nonsense, the film has its fun moments and even magic. Dan Aykroyd is good at paying the nut-case and Donna Dixon ("Laura Rollins") is a knockout. I'm sorry she didn't have a bigger role.
