Although allegedly autobiographical, this film shows a very small view of both the protagonist's psychology (resulting in a flat, fragmented characterization) as well as more extensive historical processes, and my hope of learning something new or improving my understanding of contemporary Iran has remained maintained. unfulfilled. Instead, I found that my feelings were somewhat numb when, in a series of bearded Islamic rascals, they mocked, tortured, or killed ruthlessly victimized middle class Iranian prototypes whose Western cultural sympathy was patented (and whose justification the film undoubtedly seeks). Understanding the film seems to be evidence of the mass media market as it serves to nourish the prevailing popular ideologies (the so-called "mob of pleasure"). The film, which has been redeemed from being totally boring, was his creative animation - a truly minimalist image that has always held the screen rich, expressive and unambiguous - no small celebration for which I give it some stars.
