"Escanaba in da Moonlight" is Jeff Daniels' first talent show and his direction. I've seen worse debuts, but this isn't so great. "Escanaba in da Moonlight" begins as a decent parody of this part of American culture. The film takes place in the upper areas of Michigan and has all the normal clich√©s of the characters, but there is a warmth that tells you it's not an average ghost. Well, Reuben Heading to Soady Deer Camp and giving him a native American necklace, his happy hat and two forms of fluids you don't want to know about in front of his wife (Kimberly Norris Guerrero). who believes in him, finally gets to his dad's camp, Albery Soady (Harve Presnell), and his brother Remnar (Joey Albright) is about to show off. there are a few laughs, a few moments when we are But most of the jokes are used several times and many times. The biggest is the spiritual / native American storyline. When you settle down with the characters, these strange things appear. But special effects are so cheap everything, it's a big flash of light and then the head swings fast. And finally, it's worthless. The move itself was not a bad, unpredictable character, and the fun parody was good. But it was supposed to stay. Instead of having a stupid spiritual awakening that looked like a rejected scene from some demonic film. I give "Escanaba in da Moonlight" 4.5 out of 10.
