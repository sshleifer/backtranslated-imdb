Jumpin 'Butterballs, This Movie Stinks! It's a dull and unreal move that never stops. It's a miracle that someone even bothered to be Groucho in his bizarre eyebrow and mustache mark because he has nothing funny or outrageous to do or say in this work. Chico must have been so uninteresting that he forgot to use his Italian accent. A character in a loudmouthed hotel manager and another annoying comic in Frank Albertson, and the journey gets even worse. <br /> <br /> A true ignition failure.
