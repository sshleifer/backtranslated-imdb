I saw this career on TV when I couldn't sleep. It didn't help in the slightest. I found myself looking at the ceiling and trying to forget the face. This cartoon never hurt me, just because of that face. Now don't get me wrong - I love fairy tales and rivers like anybody else. But this twisted and scary release is simply distracting. It's mainly cruel laughter and exaggerated features that scare me, and that's why I still have nightmares. Please, I urge you not to allow your children. It's far, FAR too scary. Please, please keep it up.
