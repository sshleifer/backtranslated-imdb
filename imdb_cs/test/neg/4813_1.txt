Makes "Invasion USA" as "Apocalypse Now". This can only be recommended for skinheads in the US, John Birch supporters or militia members. The message is very simple: let's shoot them all - gooks, commies, latinos, everything that is not an American. Besides, it's bad, badly written, misinterpreted, incredibly stupid, but no fun at all. This film could be used as a toorture device by the CIA torturer. Oops, sorry, there can't be any American torturers because they're GOOD
