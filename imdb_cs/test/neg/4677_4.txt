Save this file to "How are movies made?" column. Seventy-year-old indie version of `Macbeth ', edited fairly faithfully (but nonsensically) in the conventionally unconventional style of black-comic. The cast gives him a chance, with Christopher Walken phoning in eccentricity like McDuff, and with Mauro Tierney rising over a boring script like Pat McBeth. Other actors are useless as well as audience time. Knee-jerk fans of this brand Quirk likes it. 4 out of 10.
