Alfred Hitchcock did this mis-marriage comedy in 1941 but his heart doesn't seem to be in it. Carole Lombard and Robert Montgomery are a couple who find that they have never been legally married and the film spends bickering their way back to true love. It has little reputation and it's easy to understand why. Jokes are known from better movies, but they're not gel. And the wires are unpretentious. Lombard's performance is trimmed and starchy, and it's doubly sad to think she was dead only a year later. Robert Montgomery seems to know he is in the ear of a sow, and tries to make a silk purse without any great success. Best performance comes from Gene Raymond as "second man" (has a beautiful drunken scene). This is one of the few really bad Hitchcock movies.
