I love beach boys and their music. So that I'm a filmmaker, I thought, wow, Beach Boys Movie sounds great. Well, WRONG! I just shut down HDNET, the channel on which the movie was playing because it was so bad. Someone mentioned above about editing ... well, they should at least watch the monitors when they shoot. I don't know if anyone else caught a mustache that fell off the face of one of the boys after he kissed his wife and then smoothed it with his hands. Have you ever heard of taking a scene! The deal was terrible. The direction was terrible. Make-up was TERRIBLE !!! Maybe the worst makeup work I've ever seen. Brian Wilson's "fat" face looked like pl-ado. That's honestly the first time I've ever commented on IMDb, and I know it really doesn't make a difference ... but come on, what the hell did producers think? !?
