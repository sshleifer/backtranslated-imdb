He just finished watching this movie, as it was on TV and I had nothing else. I went straight to the IMDb page and looked at the little page and looked at the user's comments by chance. And what can I find? Every stupid idiot brings this movie to the sky! I would'nt even write anything but when no one else takes the time to spread the word about this sucking-ass movie I thought I could. <br /> <br /> Actor sucked from almost everyone in cast. The worst was the one who played Brian Wilson (I think I have a name rightly) because he was excessive, especially when he was tall. The rest wasn't as bad as him, but nobody was good. I'm not an expert on beach boys, though so much I can't complain about the story that much .... except for being sucked. No motivation to decide on characters most of the time, but hey, maybe they were real life idiots. And what I found the worst was that I thought it would be a movie about the boys on the beach, but you really have only a few things. I hate doing it in movies, the same thing in the doorway, even though I like the movie more. You have no energy to write more ... it was saturated! don't buy or watch!
