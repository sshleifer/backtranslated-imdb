I am horrified to see that so many people have made positive reviews for this "movie". This film has no balancing factors. Music is not good, acting is pathetic, I have a difficult understanding of how someone could enjoy this film, let alone singing its "praise". The idea is terrible, some conspiracy scenes (such as the Continuing Love Story, though the men's romantic interest is SHRUNKEN HEAD) are so bad that I wanted to hurt them while watching them. The fact that there is a scene in which the shriveled head flies under the girl's shirt to "feel it" And she likes it, is why everyone who is associated with this film will perish. The link to West Side Story can only be a mockery because referring to such a great movie in such a horrible movie is the only reason to destroy all copies of this movie. To make the long story short, this film is terrible in every way. And if I had my way, everyone who loves should go straight to hell.
