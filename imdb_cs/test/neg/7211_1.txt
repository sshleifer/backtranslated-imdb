"Direct-to-video" is a phrase that never sounds promising to consumers if its a direct transmission to the video in the first place. Despite this, the studios insisted on publishing numerous direct-to-video sequels over the years to cult hits. I don't think it should be mentioned that this sequel is one of the worst titles of all time, including HITCHER II, STARSHIP TROOPERS 2 and CRUEL INTENTIONS 3. It's that ROAD HOUSE 2 was Helium Scott Ziehl as he was also a man in charge of destroying the Cruel Intentions series. Like his entry into the Cruel Intentions trilogy, Ziehl takes the elements that made the first ROAD HOUSE a great guy, and revives them again without success. This is not a sequel, it is a remake all the way. Different lines from the original are repeated, cut and pasted plot points and scenes from the first frame are almost replicated. One thing that could not be duplicated was the amazing battle scene that made ROAD HOUSE what it was. Here we get awkwardly directed combat sequences that are either too short or too long and seemingly scheduled and filmed in one hour. Compare it to your predecessor's battle scenes that look like they're preparing months and months. Ziehl is able to control the action as he did well with the 2001 remake of EARTH VS. SPIDER, but none of the talents that appear there go through this mess. It's not entirely his fault, because the script is very, very poorly written and clumsy. I don't care if something goes straight to the video, a good script is still required. Someone should keep this mind in the running of these low-budget movies directly on DVD. Skip it completely. 1/10
