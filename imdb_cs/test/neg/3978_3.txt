Now I suffered through parts, Clonus Horror. <br /> <br /> To have the word horror in the title of this movie is an insult to real horror. The story was about cloning-central owned by "man" They grow clones for harvesting organs from clones later for original people in need of transplants. One clone escapes, the government gets angry and kills everyone, but the story escapes. It's really shameful how a film with potential destroys amateurs like Fiveson. The only thing he really did was to cope with the concept of human rights and the very philosophical aspect of what makes a person human, and would it be OK to grow clones for organic harvesting? Sadly, the average actors were chosen and the plot left the city, until the very end, in which there is a pathetic attempt to summarize it. <br /> <br /> But !! What worried me most was the introduction of new characters lacking real meaning for conspiracy. Despite this, Fiveson feels the need to kill them in a bad explosion that only Sir Coleman Francis himself would be proud of. <br /> <br /> The setting was interesting. As Fiveson thought the ripping of plastic sheets and running water over them would be over me, but I think if you were to compare the settings with the gray paste of Coleman Francis, this movie would win. Br /> <br /> Maybe Coleman has changed what bad movies are for me. 3/10
