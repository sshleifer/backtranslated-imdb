"The Chilling" directed by Deland Nuse and Jack A.Sunseri is one of the worst zombie hits I've ever seen. Why Linda Blair ("The Exorcist", "Witchery") appeared in this stinking thing is beyond me. Stupid: Frozen bodies in a cryogenic lab are revived after a lightning strike and turned into cannibalistic zombies.The characters are completely one-dimensional and silly, zombies look horrible and there's no gore. My rating: 1 of 10.
