This film was sucked. The problem was not with the cast. I think the cast was great, lots of good talent, lots of great acting. But the script was TERRIBLE! It was mostly just a frame work in which Steve Carrell could improve. And that's what he does best, but here it just didn't work. The script was hard to follow, the story was pointless and the scenes were random and lacking direction. Also, much of the action was extremely fictional and ill-considered. It was a good effort, but as Max says, they missed it by ALSO! I'm shocked to see how many hot reviews this IMDb is for this smelly here. Obviously, film producers are getting people to write a lot of positive reviews about their movies and filling in the IMDb records. If you read the positive reviews and compare them with negative reviews, it is quite clear which of them are original reviews from regular users. This movie was full of trouble and jokes that just didn't work. I loved Steve Carrell in Anchor Man, and I love his comedy and style. But I'll tell you that I was never allowed to watch this movie. Yes, I had a few light moments, a few laughs, but no real laughter. Nothing that hit me. <br /> <br /> Spoiler Warning! One absurd scene was when Max had his hands tied on the plane and he went to the bathroom to try to escape. He uses his special Swiss army knife ... but instead of using the SHEAR BED, he tries to knock down his miniature crossbow. And when the crossbows light it and shoot small arrows over and over again (almost unloads EYE), Max won't give up or try the blade instead ... no, it's just shooting with a crossbow. What did he really expect from this crossbow? It seemed to be the best choice on the knife to try to remove the ties. It just made no sense. This is a good example of typical circumstances in the scenes that made this film. They were ridiculous, poorly thought out, poorly motivated, and made of pure nonsense. And that was really distracting. <br /> <br /> As I said, this movie was a big downtime and I recommend that you avoid it. IMDb Note: You should do something about these fake reviews that people leave. Reduces site authenticity.
