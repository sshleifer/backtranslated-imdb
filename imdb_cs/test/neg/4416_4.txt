After looking for this Bruceploitation for several months, and then randomly bought cheap, it was disappointing. I heard about it on DVD-R and it sounded crazy. But no, what I got was a pretty bad martial arts movie. Kung fu-ing wasn't too bad, but the rest of the movie was pretty bad, and the movie looked really, really long, much longer than the 85-minute run. a note, the monkey was funny for a few seconds (especially when I think they only took a close look that it's a face from another movie), and a black man who appeared halfway was funny because on one line he said, which made one hand that all blacks look like complete simpletons. Unfortunately it wasn't enough. <br/> <br/> 4/10
