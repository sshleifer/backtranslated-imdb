Undoubtedly, this is the WORSE comic film that everyone is making. TIME!! Yes, it's worse than Dolph Lundgren's (1989) Punisher. Yup .. Worse Than 1979 & 1991 Captain America Movies. Yeah, it's even WORSE then Christopher Reed Superman IV script: Quest for Peace movie. Sheeshh .. that movie was so bad that the one who played Nuclear Man just played in one other movie and it was just on T.V. = oP <br /> <br /> This movie is "D" quality. I had a chance to look at the SciFi Channel in 1997. I heard it's pretty bad, but I had nothing else at night, so I made it up. That's a waste of an hour and a half. I'd rather watch the repetition of different moves. In addition to seeing lamestas' special effects and worse performances, the entire script was just terrible and not directed at all. Fortunately, NEW Fantastic Four is happening and hopefully this version will make heroes justice. I was hoping that a new SPAWN movie would appear in the future, but it didn't happen yet. <br /> <br /> Don't let this movie be rented. If it happened to you that it is being broadcast on cable, look at it. But be warned that after the first 15 minutes you will prefer to flip the channel.
