The only interesting part of this movie was jazz and reggae New Orleans. He is trying to be one of those films that have two struggles that the heroine has to overcome, one from the past and one from the present that cannot convincingly do. Behavior is bad and the direction is even worse. I wasn't surprised that it went directly to the video. The end result of this film leaves no one satisfied or convinced, including the actors themselves.
