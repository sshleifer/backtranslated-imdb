Drifting around on bootlegs, sometimes thought that the urban comic legend, the first FF movie is nearly as bad as everyone is afraid of. I think Marvel Comics now pretends there is nothing to do with the 2005 version of the theaters earlier this year. But it's out there, a reminder and the last of the first wave of poor, low-budget Marvel super-hero adaptations (Captain America, Punisher, most TV movies). "Low budget" is too simple a description for this FF pic. Due to virtually no funds, showing the power of the super foursome was limited to very fast shots (Mr.Fantastic), quasi-animation (Torch), and disappearing (Invisible Girl-Easiest to do). Thing was not bad and probably half of the budget; The face was particularly convincing. Playing? Alex Hyde-White as Reed is pretty good; the other 3 are all right, Jay as Johnny sometimes behaves as a jerk to show off his "fiery" mood. Dialogue is a comic book style, and it's a supportive cast that ends up trying to make it work. Dr.Doom is over melodramatic and unintentionally comical, and his two main followers are a case study of how to act or write dialogue. <br /> <br /> The storyline? Not very good. It was quite faithful to the origin of the story of the FF (more than the later Grand Budget version), and although no-budget, again, limited showing for example, the actual landing touchdown, it kept the basic ingredients as they discovered their forces in the isolated area - it is the best part of the image, tho you have to wait full half hour for it. I also found music in places; when 4 are bathed in these cosmic rays, a kind of church choir is heard as if it were a religious experience. But the rest is hopeless. Even without a budget, the story could do a non-jeweler character (reminiscent of the thief Mole Man's book); he spends too much time with him and his underground gang, as well as with blind Alice. These sections are a waste of cellulose and very boring. Climactic fight with Doom & his men starts fine, but degenerates into a terrible mess as Torch races a laser beam (cool animation but belongs to the cartoon). Fans can laugh at the bad FF FX and the clueless story if they don't get into depression and outrage first.
