This film is about the gap that exists between the real world and the world of the dead. There's a lot of mumbo-jumbo about the Internet (that is, when you install a program on your computer, you'll see dead people - much like playing a videotape you die in RING). Frankly, most of them looked rather stupid and lost me. Interestingly, the dead live in their own existence - they are absolutely forever. This was sober and fascinating. I like Japanese movies and compared to most Americans I have seen a huge amount. However, one genre that has become popular in recent years that I just can't cover very well are these horror films. I know they're super popular - especially because they seem to be overworked in the United States. I saw both RING, RING, JU-ON and GRUDGE, and despite their popularity, I was rather ambivalent. The only recent horror movie I really liked from Japan was the SEANCE - a reworking of the great British movie SEANCE ON A WET AFTERNOON. And what do I think the SEANCE did different? Unlike other films, as well as KAIRO, gobs and gobs of money were not spent on special effects or tried to scare the audience - instead, the story was emphasized. The bottom line is that these other movies are very similar to American movies like HALLOWEEN or Friday 13th - with scary things that jump just to scare the audience and the plot is purely secondary (at best). For me, I want a story - not cheap excitement or ghosts as the primary focus of the film. With relatively high ratings, I know I'm a minority, but I just can't find this very satisfying movie. Too often there are small things that might startle someone a little - but the characters start screaming and crying and acting as if to say, "This is the most scary movie ever made, so you'd better start shaking." Well, I think he's trying too hard, and I wish he focused more on the afterlife that was seen at the end of the movie and the plot - not a frightened tactic.
