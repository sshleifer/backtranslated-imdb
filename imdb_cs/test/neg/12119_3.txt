I loved the latest Bellocchio movie, the masterpiece of "L'Ora di Religione". He had a great script, great actors (well, I have to say that Castellitto is much bigger than the others), brilliant use of lights for great cinema. Buongiorno Notte is another story. Ridiculous scenarios of exploding tons of morality (and we could talk about politics for weeks, you know we're Italian ...). Poor cinematography (it's too easy to imagine the dark years of the 70s with dark colors and dark lights, do more people's efforts !!!!). Bad use of music: what is the use of psychedelia to represent the tragic racionality of Brigate Ross? And to all the people who won the Grand Prix in Venice, I say, "Are you nuts?" ?? Maybe the Russian movie was bad, but not as bad as this one. I'm with P.E. Don't believe humbuku !!!!
