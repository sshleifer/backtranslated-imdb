The good news for IMDb is that this movie was so bad that it made me register and comment. I should add that I am a film enthusiast who seldom undergoes cruel judgment. Sometimes, however, the film is so poor, poorly conceived, poorly edited, with such a poor storyline that it is criticizing. , and beautifully shot this movie was. Finally, I can only say that the actor and crew are active posters. The action was extremely thin. The pace of the film was painful. I gave him new chances for every move (mainly because I didn't want to feel that I was wasting Saturday morning in New York), but with every new scene it was going on longer, bringing characters I wasn't interested in with which he couldn't I am united, for which I could not empathize. <br /> <br /> When I see negative reviews on IMDb small independent movies like this, I sometimes wonder if the poster has a personal ax (something like that). he used to gaffer dating, she fired him, and now he will blow up everything he works on). But here, no. I don't know anyone working on this movie. And I wish it was great. But the film wasn't dark (as some mentioned) or depressed (as others say). . . they suggest I'm connected to the movie. . . No, Henry May Long was too long, empty and boring. This is Tomas Take.
