I don't think it could be legally qualified as a "movie". The story was so fragile, the dialogue was so shallow and the lines were so horrible that I couldn't believe anyone actually wrote lines down, he said, "Holy sh * t!" manufacturer. I am still impressed for one and I remember this film forever as a sign of the degeneration of intelligence in America - and of course "Crossroads".
