I had great hopes for this movie I even gave up watching the Stargate watching for this movie. I have found that it has a hasty feeling, and many key biblical moments and facts are missing. I could be a little tired and spoiled for the 1956 version because I watched it every year for the last 20 years. I doubt it gets into the realm of the yearly classics as the second one does. If you haven't seen the 19546 version, you might like it, but I seriously doubt it, and I urge you to skip this option and go rent or buy a classic. It has some handy special effects, but that's not what I'm looking for when I tell a movie as the Ten Commandments. I wanted to see how they told the story, and the writers didn't do a good job with it.
