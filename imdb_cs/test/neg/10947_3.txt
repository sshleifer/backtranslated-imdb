The film was half before I could figure out what was happening. It's a dog breakfast about a movie about four family Thanksgiving dinners. Clich√©s and stereotypes are rolling. When it's been ten hours later - well, it's been ten hours - you're confused about what it was all about. I don't want to see a movie about a table at the table. There's enough in my own family. The turkeys looked pretty good. The rest gave me digestive problems.
