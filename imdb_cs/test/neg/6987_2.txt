This film must be a worse film I've ever seen. I watched for only half an hour and just turned it off. Cars in this movie look like two geo meters front ends smashed together. This movie isn't even good for laughter. The only time I laughed was when Dante was still humorously saying, "No one can beat Dante, Muhwu hwau." I said to the holy god and shut down. Bad, bad movie. 2/10
