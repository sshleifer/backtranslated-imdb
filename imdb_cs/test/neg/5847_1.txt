Demi and Woody are married, but they are poor. They meet Robert Redford and he is really rich. He takes the fantasy to Demi, and since he is a gambling player he makes a couple of "indecent suggestion:" one million dollars per night with a little woman. <br /> <br /> At this point you need to watch no more movies because you can put together details in your sleep. Of course, Demi will accept the offer. If it's not there, no first half of the movie. Of course, this will affect Demi and Woody's marriage. If not, no other half of the film. And of course everything will be fine when credits go. If not, there is no lucky ending for the cashier. The absolute best thing you can say about DANGEROUS PROPOSAL is that Demi Moore looks good in black clothes. As for the rest ... The script is incompetent, direction amateur, performances negligible. I think Redford, Moore and Harrelson are blushing and changing the subject every time a movie is mentioned. Do them - and more importantly - kindness. If someone doesn't offer you a million ... Miss It! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
