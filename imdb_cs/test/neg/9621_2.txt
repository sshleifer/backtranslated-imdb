"MirrorMask" was terribly disappointing for me. I was expecting a lot from Jim Henson's production and I found a favorable rating to compare it to "Labyrinth" and "Alice in Wonderland". Unfortunately, the film ended up in one of those "style over fabric" pile of movies. While most children dream of escaping from home to circus, Helen is a child who has grown into a circus (child labor, someone?) who wants to escape to join Real Life. Helena wishes her mother to die, a bad move for a spoiled brat with a princess complex in a children's fantasy movie. Another thing you know about, Helen's mother will fail and for some reason she is suddenly taken to another world. Meanwhile, I felt like I was being taken to the Contemporary Art Museum with a pair of hazy sepia-colored glasses. The introduction of CGI-formed creatures and backgrounds was initially interesting and I liked the giant giants. But after a few minutes it was a bit tedious and I felt my mind roam ... <br /> <br /> No MTV-style narration and clips and soundtrack (the Sphinx reminded me of Basement Jaxx's) Where is your head "), I didn't feel involved in the protagonist's fate, and I was also frustrated because we were waiting for the movie to lead us wherever it goes, hopefully going to the" Exit "of the theater ...
