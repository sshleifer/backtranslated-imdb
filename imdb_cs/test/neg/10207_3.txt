I remember when they were very interested in it when it came out. Every week they showed TV clips on WWF and everyone was excited. It debuted the opening weekend at number two for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Then he did nosedive. Critics hated the film. I don't remember seeing one good review. Everyone agreed that it was bad and sometimes grotesque. I didn't know it meant then, but now because the movie makes links to gay bars, women get slapped hard and almost raped and disgustingly looking a bar toilet with overflowing urinals lol. When I was younger, I didn't care. It was Hulkamania, brother !!! Now I consider it pretty bad, but it's still fun to watch once in a while when paired with Bodyslam (who has a better storyline). First, Hulka Hogan's acting skills just aren't great. he is one dimensional as the character he plays in the match ring. And in fact, Rip and Hulk are not far apart. Kurt Fuller is a good actor. It's better in comedy and nervous dramatic characters. He's just not believable as Brell. There is not much character development in this movie, and those who suffer are the characters of Randy, Rip's brother and Charlie's coach (In a match with his unheard of coach escourting a wrestler on the ring lol). Tiny Lister plays Zeus the way he should play, so there's no problem. Joan Severence is passable and for all those softcore hounds, she has a lingerie scene lol. By the end, you'll figure out what a point is? <br /> <br /> For this one (as with other matches movies or movies that have wrestlers as the main star), turn your brain off. You will enjoy it more if you do so.
