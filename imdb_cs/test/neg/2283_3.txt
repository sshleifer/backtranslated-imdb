I bought a tape of this movie based on recommendations from other IMDb users and I must say that I was very disappointed. I am a college professor and I have shown this film to my class; unanimously voted that it was a horrible film. I think if you like the old Dark Shadows series, then you will enjoy it. (I like Dark Shadows when I was a kid in the '70s, but now I think it's just awful). The first half hour has at least the honor of loyalty to Wilde's novel. After that, the story goes wild, at least in comparison with the MGM version of 1945 (which won two Oscars). Nigel Davenport as Lord Henry is truly the only thing that can be seen throughout production. Many other games are bad, the music is melodramatic, and the film's appearance is terrible. In fact, it is not a film at all - it was apparently filmed on video and it is characterized by claustrophobic BBC. The opening scenes are especially ill-lit, women's costumes are terrible (men look fine), and many characters - including Dorian - seem to have 1970s rather than Victorian hairstyles. The film is about to include a lot of Wilde's dialogue, but Dorian's voice narrative contains a lot of garbage that is in direct contradiction to Wilde's character. I'm a big fan of Oscar Wilde and I'm afraid he had to flip over in his grave when this monstrosity was created. The only improvement over the 1945 version is that the homosexual subtext is definitely more apparent without being heavily controlled. I haven't seen one of the newer versions, but if anyone is interested in telling the story well, I would recommend this MGM black and white model.
