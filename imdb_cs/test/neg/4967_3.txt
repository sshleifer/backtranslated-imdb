It seems that all the boys are Mandy Lane sexually excited. It seems that all the girls are jealous of Mandy Lane. But nothing seems to happen and the viewer asks why? Mandy is beautiful and magnet for every boy she meets, but we never know Mandy or any character in the movie. Mandy accepts an invitation from his student friends to go to a secluded ranch. Three boys and three girls drink and cure. In the movie, teenagers drink booze like his water, and take drugs to experience a psychedelic trip. And there is absolutely no sex. Meanwhile, teenagers disappear one by one. But the others are drunk and high. No one, including those watching the movie, cares or is all about it. No one, including the audience, seems to be damned. Emmet, a classmate, is the instigator of the event. There's a security guard, Garth (ugly and playfully playing Anson Mount) who watches and protects the ranch. In the middle of the movie, a killer is revealed, the tension suddenly released as air released from the balloon. The events are completely predictable, and the film will disappear completely. Mandy meets her match, but we don't know why - and there's no sex at the end of the movie. Does hypnotize Mandy boys, or just bear all the boys and girls to death? This totally confused viewer can only conclude that Mandy wants to get rid of the female and male competitions - by killing manipulative girls and ugly boys. The director (Jonathan Levine) seems to think so, but not the viewer. The cameraman (Darren Genet), who is capable, provides some amazing shots, but in fact he seems to be focusing on Garth, which is quite a shame. Not all guys love Mandy, do they? If you want to get bored enough to find out how this movie ends, my advice is to sleep in the middle of the movie until you see Mandy's pilgrim and Garth's crotch crotch. But don't wait for something to happen. Yeah, you guessed it. Mandy remains a virgin and there is still no sex. I included this movie in 3 out of 10, but not because of Mandy. Why? Because all the girls love Garth and all the voyeuristic eyes seem to be in a compromise position on Garth. But unfortunately, girls and boys, this film never seems to be a disappointment and incomplete sexual fantasy. Mandy goes to a secluded ranch and nothing happens. The audience is led to the ranch's horror - and can't help but why?
