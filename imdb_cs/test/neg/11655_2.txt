I am not surprised that this film was well played at the Hamptons Film Festival. It's a shallow movie that would appeal to shallow people. Two actors pretend to be a relationship actor fighting and looking for a lost dog. The film is supposed to investigate the dynamics of the relationship, but the relationship is too small to deserve such a survey. This pair has one dimension: they fight, irritate, then they love and fight even more. The brief moment of tenderness does not mention any possible reason why these two would be involved with one another because of their poisonous and unstable relationship. Beautifully shot, excellent score, but without any merit in the script or characters, it's short.
