This movie is about people living in the trailer park. later in the film, it is clear that these people are out-of-work comics, especially old men. Well, more or less sitting around the whole movie and talking about f *** ing. But there is never any action, only the people talk. at the beginning I thought it was some great perverted blow, but after a while it got bored. How many versions do you think you say f *** ing, d ** k & c ** t? it certainly can be funny - maybe half an hour, not 80 minutes. But it was fun to watch those people trying to act. I'm sure they often read the text on a sheet while playing. but it doesn't break the movie, it's so cool. Because these individuals seem so poor, f *** ed-up, crestfallen *** oles, that style fits perfectly. their wooden, helpless reading of texts is a pretty good atmosphere, I fell in love with the characters a bit. *** SPOILER AHEAD *** Later in the movie some comedy-shows (rhymes about f *** ing) made only themselves as an audience and featured applause. then the evacuation board gets to decide to defend the trailer park and enter their roofs - armed with weapons. then they shot. fin. sounds like action, but it's not. just take a few home cameras. *** SPOILER END *** <br /> <br /> but the film is completely follow-up in its style and I'm sure that's what the filmmaker wanted. it is a portrait of those f ** k-ups groggy-style home cameras with characters that cannot act but seem to be interesting personalities so they are nice to watch. But the lyrics about - you know what - all the time you get bored after a while. A pretty young director who also appears to be an interesting person when playing some teenage stuff in popular movies / TV series but now got into more horror-movies that is more his cup of tea I think. and this, his first direction-efforts will be distributed by three now. I know nothing about the release, this one I got as "advanced screener" from this year's cannes, which says "for smuggling purposes only".
