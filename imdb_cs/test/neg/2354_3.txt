As I post this comment, IMDb currently rates Alfred Hitchcock subpar Saboteur 7.3 / 10. Personally, I rated it less than half. Honestly, I can't tell you how this bad movie could come from what is probably the most enduring good director I know. I saw about 10 other Hitch films from the 30s-60s. Flight. Vertigo is my favorite hand so far, while Saboteur is the worst. It's hard to believe that 7 years earlier Hitch used the same formula in The 39 Steps far more competently. My recommendation would be to see it instead and avoid it as a plague. It's the only Hitchcock movie I turned off before the end and I don't want to go back and see the rest. If you have to watch, then rent or borrow. Don't make the mistake I made and buy a DVD in good faith with Notorious, Rebecca, Vertigo, Rear Window, etc. Even the master sometimes gets tangled up, I think. he was a little harder on this movie than I was supposed to be. It's definitely not anywhere near Ed Wood or Manos, or something like that, but I have three reasons why I have to be so low: <br /> <br /> 1) The name "Hitchcock" brings some quality expectations. This film brings some of them, but they are so obscured by the damn close insensitive rendering. <br /> <br /> 2) I want to compensate a little for all the 8+ ratings that this film is getting. Hitchcock is like John Coltrane's directors. True fans will find reasons to care for a piece of art, but a high rating on IMDb gives more casual enthusiasts like me the impression that this film is much better than it really is. 3) I spent $ 18 on it. Maybe if it cost me $ 5 or even $ 10, I'd probably be a bit less bitter. ;)
