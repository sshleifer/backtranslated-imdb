Copying Cats Copied This Movie From A 1974 Hindu Movie titled "Call Girl"! "Call Girl" had the same story. The way the protagonists fall in love then recovers and culminates in both of these films! "Call Girl" is better than water, at least in terms of telling the story. It wasn't as painfully slow as water! Water, on the other hand, does not progress at all. The goal is to make the audience sympathize with Kalyani forever! Are Indian filmmakers better than just being big copiers these days? They call it "inspired". In their language it is: "get inspired (without any quote that is!)"! :)
