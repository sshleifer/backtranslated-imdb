What a terrible movie! It represents the perfect state of degeneration of French society, where the most fundamental respect for healthy values ​​and traditions has completely disappeared. The story is absurd, the film is not at all funny and the characters are completely shallow and uninteresting. At least direction and cinematography are very poor and uninspired. Catherine Deneuve is just as bad an actress as ever, even when she was directed by Bunuel in Belle De Jour. The rest of the usually good cast (Vincent Lindon, Line Renaud, Jean Yanne) seems to be totally lost in the ocean of vulgarity, falsehood and restlessness. I can't help paralleling the beautiful "Le Divorce" of James Ivory, with his thoughtful portrayal of French and American mores, his outstanding cinematography and stellar cast. After seeing "Le Divorce", you can feel some kind of empathy with the French, regardless of their weakness. "Belle-Maman" leaves you with angry disdain for its morally bankrupt and helpless protagonists.
