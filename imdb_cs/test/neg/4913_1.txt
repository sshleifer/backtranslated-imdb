Aksar is a horrible movie. The script, the story, the acting are just ridiculous. Dino Morea plays a man who pays Emraan Hashmi to seduce his wives. Yes, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. Both Morea and Hashmi offer incredibly and unexpectedly bad behavior. Udita Goswami plays an aggressive, capricious and angry woman. He is good looking, but he has no talent. The film has one hit song called "Jhalak Diklaja" which is composed and sung by Himesh Reshammiya. I could never understand the hype around this song because I never found it good, even though it's catchy. The film is supposed to be a thriller, but instead it looks like a comic book with a terrible direction and writing. Avoid this lion at all costs.
