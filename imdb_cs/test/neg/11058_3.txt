In yet another misleading marketing scenario, this movie is included in a 10-movie DVD set called "Women Who Kicked Butt", but even in its original packaging, Shannon Tweed seems to be promising an action role. Actually, during most of the movie Tweed plays a typical sneaky and prissy female character who must be rescued by the male leadership, even if she is trained in the jungle warfare still has to be dragged around him! There is one female rebel who is stronger in character, but she is mostly held in the edges of the film. Male leadership is Reb Brown, and he has some (unintentionally, I think) funny moments (like when he gets an electric current). Action scenes are poorly directed and misbehaved: some of the stuntmen needed some lessons on how to "convincingly die and die". I suppose if you are in the right mood, you can find some things in "Shooting Range" to make you laugh (in one place we can hear Tweed speaking, but her lips don't move!), But mainly I was bored.
