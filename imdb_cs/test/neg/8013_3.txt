Good!! The film has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. It's a Hallmark TV movie. It's from Thomas Hardy's novel. She has Catherine Zeta Jones in it. She is by far the only one in a film that behaves better than in my classroom theater school. Oh yes, Clive Owen's in it. I'm not a British, so it means almost as much as Thomas Hardy's novel. Besides, he was in "The Bourne Identity" and I liked it. It's just that it'll wrap everything up. It really was. I become repetitive, but I like CZJ, so I went to the end. The computer tells me I don't have 10 lines and counts them. I've always counted 11, but maybe I don't like my style, but that's also my opinion on the movie.
