I went to a bookstore in Brentwood, Tennessee. I'm not going to say a name because I'm a loyal customer. I was pleased with every item I bought there before. The display in front of the store was Bell Witch Haunting. (I can mention that this is the only store I saw for sale.) I heard about the story somewhere and remembered that it was actually going to happen. I was very excited and I couldn't wait to look at it. I had great expectations. I couldn't believe what I saw when I looked at it. It didn't look like a real movie. It looked like a home video. I was under the impression that it was a horror movie. I think the movie was about how you know the scary witches. This is no horror. You will not jump from your seat and watch this movie. I gave the movie all the chances in the world to make it as good as possible. I swear I did. It was never better. There were several scenes of this little boy getting shit and pee thrown at him. I didn't find it fun at all. I saw the whole movie with no confidence that the store will actually sell it to me. I think it's bad what this economy has. I have to say cast and crew. Do not expose this film as material to get more movie roles. Do not do it. I mean honestly. I praise you for your attempt. For the people who bought it. I say it. Don't sell a copy to someone. They could be very upset. Have a nice day for everyone.
