Convinced of 7.0 points in IMDb, which is pretty good, I decided to watch this movie. However, I found this movie silent boring (about 2 hours) and full of clich√©s, little girl getting more celebrities after childhood trauma etc. Tamer KAradagli is a quiet joke in this movie, dialogs moves etc., You'll have to see it's a bit of a hard cop that you see on American movies may have copied too much. I would describe this film as an ordinary American thriller with a little Turkish touch, but unfortunately I am again convinced that comedies and dramas are the only genres worth watching in a Turkish cinema. cliche
