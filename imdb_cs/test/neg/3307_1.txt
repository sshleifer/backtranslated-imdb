OK, so she doesn't have a caller ID. When you're being watched, you get it! And no cell phone? When you are being watched, you will get ONE if you are one of the few full-time parents who are the head of a household who no longer owns her. This mom gets a big department in the parental department. So her mom is in the hospital and she decides that a shopping trip will help her. Just a stupid movie. I'm glad I have Tivo and FF button on the remote.And what's with the 10 line minimum, I just don't have so much to say about such a bad movie. I think I can ask why he keeps opening packages that he has no idea who they come from. The son did not add much to the film. The officers were also big zero. Now find the closest Verizon to get the damn cell phone. @@
