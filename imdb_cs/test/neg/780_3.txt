Oddly enough, I have little to say about "The Box", so it'll be pretty brief. I have never read Richard Matheson's novel "Button, Button" from which the film is based, but given what I have seen in this "adaptation", such a legendary authorial work could not have been a semblance. "The Box" is about a family that discovers a strange mess on the doorstep that has a button on it. Frank Langella appears and explains how they will be given a million dollars if they press the button - the only 'catch' is that he automatically kills someone, somewhere ... ?? SPOILER ?? Shifting it? THE END OF SPOILERS? The whole concept was interesting in itself, but in some way they managed to extend the film to some convoluted Stargate knock-off that would release it until a pretty decent ending with a pretty deep message. Even though I try to be as fair as possible, I still have to say that it wasn't my cup of tea and it bored me so much. I think it's from the same director as "Donnie Darko" I remember when I saw him years ago. "The Box" would work well as a short film, but since it was so lifeless adapted in this way, I can't approach it ...
