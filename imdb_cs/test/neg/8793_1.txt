I just realized why the colors and sets in "Sakuran" are so flashy and gaudy and just painful to watch them. The story is about a first-class prostitute known as a Japanese oiran. Their kimono was always brighter and brighter than any other kimono, so the oiran excelled. However, director Mika Ninagawa had to make sure that the director excelled even more than the main character or even the story. What Anna Tsuchiya did in the movie gave me just horror. You can't call it acting. It was nothing but to eat with her flip-out, high-school-girl fan base. Hi Anna, good luck on getting older. Yeah, right, oiran as rude and vulgar, prone to violence, biker. Didn't we see that you saw this character in a more appropriate movie? The story was painfully boring and predictable. What is the story of "Sakuran"? An unpleasant bitch still remains true to her self, which is just that: an unpleasant bitch. They discover that they inexplicably attract men and that they have an inexplicable ability to manipulate people and become a successful high-class prostitute, even when they talk and act as a female biker group. This so-called seductive ability is talked about, but we never see it in action, probably as a result of the inability of the main, mock, fake biker chick, I mean "actress". The main character of the film is a rich and powerful man who is angry with her because he keeps him waiting while serving a much less humble customer. It's not oiran-like, is it? How could such a woman become an oiran? Oh, because the previous oiran was killed and the house needed a bitch that could cost a lot. Who would pay the high price for a bitch so cheap? Rumors around. How could there be no consequences for what she did to a powerful man? Because the screenwriters are small. They just created a lot of crap. Then a richer and more powerful guy will fall on her (why?) And she will throw him for a man with no money, who is generally cool and distant to her, but respects who he really is (which doesn't make sense. How can anyone respect someone so worthless?). Speaking of crap, it's like a director squatting and taking a huge psychedelic color listing. about Aesthetics, Culture and the Edo Society of the Period. What about things like sabi, mono without consciousness, wabi, subtlety, elegance, firm hierarchical society? Everything a director has to say about him comes as a nonsense, nouveau-riche parvena. The amazing thing is that so many other Japanese who have watched this movie have been squatting around the director and have picked up the steaming spoons of this blazing colorful stink of crap and shouted how delicious it was. Argentine Thong Music Violin and Bandoneon as Background for Edo Period When Japan Was Completely Isolated from the International World (Except for 3.7 acres of Dejima)? Why not just Anna, a bad-ass-biker oiran, answer her cell phone, and the rich and powerful daimyo leaves in a hissing bout into her red Ferrari? The music we had to listen to was annoying and anachronistic (as well as art). Near the end I liked that there were only two or three tiny flowers on the shrine tree. But sooner, when she said she would leave the quarters when she blossomed, we all knew exactly what would happen. How boring, so clearly telegraph the end. But what is the meaning of the old tree blooming? The rich and powerful guy had blossomed in the cherry blossoms in the spring like the Yoshino Mountains. Wasn't it at all? No, of course not. I already know about children. The guys who treat them nicely are kicking the balls. Maybe they lack whores to make people idealize them when they themselves know the truth about who they are: just cheap and worthless. Due to the director's obsession with the goldfish, the second to last scene was to be a goldfish bowl on the porch accidentally capsized. Two fish plunge into a stream that takes them away to escape past the entertainment district walls, and how the goldfish are stuck in their bowl and cannot survive outside (as well as the population's relationship to pleasure). Otherwise, the talk about the fate of a goldfish has no meaning. In the final scene, the cherries were full of bloom, but the brevity of the flowers was one special thing about cherry flowers. I couldn't help thinking that soon enough dark would destroy all the subtle pink colors and heat from the scene. The sky would quickly come out of shadows, into the ever-deepening darkness and the night would fall. Winter would be cold. And dark. It really wasn't a happy ending, was it? Romantic Love (in Edo?) She could survive in the face of terrible poverty and be ostracized as long as the cherries bloomed. Maybe a few days if it rained sooner. But the uncontrolled romantic love we see here? It's existence in this period is incomprehensible. Anna Tsuchiya oiran shoes? She couldn't do it. Literally. Look at the scene of her "promenade" where she seems to have the right shoes, but she has to hold on to some guy's shoulder to avoid falling on her ass. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give this movie two stars for artistic direction, but then I realized what it all was: sick dominance by the director. The colors and sets are exactly as the director shouts, "I'm the most important! I! It's all about me !!!!"
