This is really the worst movie I've ever seen. For a moment I used to watch crappy movies, including "Battlefield Earth", "Delta Force Commando" and "Starship". All these movies are movie gems compared to Ironheart. <br /> <br /> There are not many points in this summary of this piece. I think it's more useful to summarize my response to the movie, which is as follows: I get angry and want to tear the tape from the VCR and burn it after about 80 minutes of play. <br /> <br /> I rate this movie 0, but IMDb won't allow one movie speed to be less than 1. I give it 0 when I knew I was saying that every movie that has a score above 0 is infinitely many times better than this - it's really so bad.
