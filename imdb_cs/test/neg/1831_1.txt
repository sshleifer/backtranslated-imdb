Anatomy is not very unique in the horror genre, in fact it is not scary at all. It reminds me of his cousins, the horror slashes. It's just a copy of some other horror slasher and as a German movie it's just too American with nothing to add. Actually Anatomy is too predictable and boring, its conspiracy is not intact and consistent. He has silly scenes that don't even fit into the horror genre. Fun sex scenes with pop music and topless women in underwear. Why must they have everything in a single movie? They should instead buy a cheap German adult movie. <br /> <br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just boring.
