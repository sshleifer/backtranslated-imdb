Mindy (Rachel Miner), the best student in the classroom, studies the differences between religion and cult at college and convinces her classmates Cassandra (Taryn Manning), Bailey (Glenn Dunk), Alexa (Joel Michaely) and Morgana (Victoria Venegas) to explore Kwan Yin believers massacre by their leader Owen Quinlin (Robert Berson) twenty years ago in California. Quinlin found an ancient amulet in southern China that would give him immense power after sacrificing human souls, but one woman defends himself and is destroyed. However, after Morgan's death, who apparently committed suicide, the students find that Quinlin has returned to chase his souls with his amulet. The 'Cult' story is not completely wrong. The script, directing, acting, lines, camera, CGI and editions are horrible, I was totally bored and tempted to use the FF button on DVD, but I resisted and squandered 90 minutes of my life and watched it My last voice is two. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "About Amuleto Secreto" ("Secret Magic")
