The film quickly reaches the main scene with persecution with ever-increasing destruction. The first really bad thing is the one who kidnapped Steven Seagal that he was defeated by Seagal's assault, but that would probably end up with the whole premise of the film. It seems that they have decided to do all kinds of changes in the movie plot, so just plan to get the action, and don't wait for a coherent plot. Turn any sense of logic you can have to reduce your chances of getting headaches. It gives me some hope that Steven Seagal is trying to get back to the type of characters he has portrayed in his more popular movies.
