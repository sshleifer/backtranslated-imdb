I was ready for the bad movie and the bad movie is, so I shouldn't complain. Twentysomething Tom (gay poster boy Robert Stadlober) has so many questions that he doesn't know if he'll come or go. I wouldn't want to stay, but for pretty girls: Serious Mavie (Anna Brüggemann); no-nonsense Angie (Emma Daubas); Sarah Baumann as a movie star in the movie. And then there's Tom's soul mate, Margarete's wild eyes (Jan Pallaski). It reminds me of Béatrice Dalle and Ginu Gershon. If you have to remember, they are gentle memories. It looks good even in the ridiculous outfits and I think of ridiculous, even Berlin, standards. I wonder if I liked this movie when I was in the characters' age. My guess is, no. Watch out for the Indian idols Oli Schulz and Max Schröder from "Der Hund Marie", who act as street musicians, without the pain.
