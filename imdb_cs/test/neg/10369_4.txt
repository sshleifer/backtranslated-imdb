A tough reverse step for the puppets in this mainly boring and boring trip. Guy Rolfe, as fantastic as Andre Toulon in part three barely this time, and Richard Band's fantastic tune appears with puppets just a few minutes into the movie. For the beginning of the film, we are introduced to the Bodega Bay Inn (Gordon Currie) and some of his youth friends (many of the actors are Canadian and all are very good at unfortunately unpretentious roles - Teresa Hill is quite delicious). Totems, minions of Egyptian god Sutk want the secrets of life animation and puppets (when on the surface) deal with previously invisible cunning to try to destroy ugly and very computer games looking for totems. Totems only complicate the series and turn their attention away from things that made the series so unique before - they don't share the strange beauty of puppets and so they really don't fit into it. Tunnelers drill, classic and probably the bloodiest this movie goes. The fifth film was shot in parallel with this, so expect similar sections of average and Toulon performance that seemed to be shot in another era (or even a galaxy). Guy Rolfe deserves better and the series fans certainly do. Grrrrrrr.
