Brave One is about New York's Erica Bain (Jodie Foster). Her life is a dream living in a city where she grew up and loves. He has his great fiance David (Naveen Andrews), whom he plans to marry. But one night, when Erica and David go for a walk with their dog, they are attacked and attacked by a group of degenerates, leaving David dead. Erica is recovering, but her heart is broken and later traumatized and can hardly cope with real life. She buys a gun from a guy on the streets for protection. But one day he buys in a shop and comes a man and shoots an official dead. It is then that Erica shoots and kills this man, and she becomes a vigilante. Killing anyone who is trying to threaten or hurt others. At the same time, Detective Mercer (Terrence Howard) is following this elusive unknown killer, becoming friends with Erika in the process. Erica begins to regain her common sense by killing these violent people, but she's not sure if what she does is morally correct. And how she and Mercer approach her, and she does not realize that the unknown murderer is next to him. This type of violent, morally damaged character portrays brilliantly. Terrence Howard is also great in this movie. They both have excellent chemistry and strengthen the film to a certain level. Brave One looks visually intact and provides great camera work, but not all work great. Scenes where Erica is totally traumatized and afraid to go outside the world. The camera moved back and forth on the sides almost in a dream and actually caught the moment in substance. While almost every time Erica killed someone, everything just had to go and show her facial expressions in fine detail. Slo-mo was properly used when Erica committed her first murder. But why do this effect almost every time she committed murder? Working with the camera creates a great atmosphere in most of the movie, but there are several scenes that are simply simple. Brave One is about how these murders affect Eric. Her fianc√© is killed by a group of criminals, and suddenly her love for New York turned upside down. She realizes there is a dark side of the beloved city, and she says it on her radio show. But I don't get it completely. Erica acts as if she never realized that violence can happen in the city at night, and that's pretty stupid. If she had lived there all her life, she must be either blind or very forgotten. Erica also seems to be hunting for inhuman, murderous people. They really do not even have to go looking for them, they just come to her as if they begged to be shot for their misbehavior. Brave One first deals with morality and proper use of violence and then suddenly celebrates it. The end is very negative and completely immoral and inhuman. It also negates the purpose of Terrence Howard's character, which the film spends so much time trying to evenly develop, and at one time his morale takes U-turns. The morality in the Creator breaks down very much, and at the end, the whole simple shards are broken. So violence is okay? Is it good to commit murder as long as it is for revenge? I quite refuse to believe it. Do you know why? Because I have a conscience that this film is definitely missing. It is not right to take the life of another person, no matter how bad they are, or how many you hate. Erica Bain sets out to stop these evil crowds, but in the end she is no better than the horrible people she kills. Jodie Foster and Terrence Howard give this film a lot of power. Brave One contains a strong message, but this message is both immoral and bad. This movie can look pretty, good and intelligent. At the end, however, it becomes quite rotten. I give The Brave One and 1.5 out of 4. The report is very out of line and morally wrong, and it really can't be saved by good conduct.
