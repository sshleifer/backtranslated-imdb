Another gray, terrible battle from the Corman family. The first space capsule in space has hit Earth (with some of the worst special effects at all) and the pilot seems dead. But appearances may be misleading. It is actually more vivid than the rest of the cast, including a haughty misogynist old doctor (who would really, really boring), a greasy guy who seems to be in the corner of the hair oil market. even doing a lot of impression, a female scientist who never seems to be hurt or angry at the old man's sponsor, and a photographer with Farah Fawcett's haircut (pre-Farah, of course) and about as much liveliness as a dead duck. <br /> <br /> What are the names of these people? I think it was Steve. It seems that everyone in the cast, including women, was named Steve. It turns out that the dead pilot Steve is not just alive, but by incubating extraterrestrial aliens (or sea horses, or shrimp, or anything) inside his hull. The momma beast who has implanted these little animals looks like a giant bald parrot with claws. Once again, I am impressed by the laughter of the monsters created by the House of Cormans. The Venus Carrot of the It It Conquered World is still officially the worst, the most ridiculous monster I've ever seen on screen, but Cormans always manages to deliver badly-looking, monster-looking monsters. <br /> <They also managed to add to their other trademarks; ie boring, confusing plot, long gray shots (thanks to God Corman he made most of his movies in black and white because his color stuff still looks gray) Two or three places max, silly and lame props and special effects, and lots of dirty dialogues. There are only two deaths in the movie (if you don't count roasted parrots, the beast will be at the end of the movie). Certainly the earth rang, I'm sure when an alien tears the old doctor's head and (apparently) eats it. Now he can speak English and have doctor's memories. It can also move a pregnant astronaut around like Pinnochio. The monster's apparent intent is to rebuild his race using human beings as food and giant wombs. At the end, he is a little confusing (well, much confusing than usual) in which a creature tries to explain why he does it, but makes no sense at all. Something about how humanity is going to follow in its steps and destroy itself with something that it will soon create. It never really said what it was. It could be anything from toasters to digital watches he knows. Her childhood tool stabs, rather than letting strangers shrimp out of his body, and the greasy guy (and the other) burns the alien's parrot to death with a Molotov cocktail. Ahh, the smell of roasting chickens .. a stranger. The end of the story in which other characters leave and leave their dead comrade, who lies on the ground to rot. Oh, hell, why don't you save the funeral costs? I'm sure that was what Corman was thinking when he tried to cut his horns and make his scenes as cheap as possible.
