In Bollywood it is not uncommon that worthless movies become a hit, good movie floping and good actors who don't do it. <br /> <br /> AKS is such a movie <br /> <br /> Himesh after a music director and singer tried acting hell, just because his songs became a hit that means he becomes an actor <br / > <br /> Producers were sure that the movie might work, the songs were also a hit, and of course Himesh's cheap publicity as usual <br /> <br /> The film tells such a bad story, such a bad direction, such a bad acting performance that makes you cringe <br /> <br /> Indian rickshaws in Germany, Stunts by Himesh and lots of stupidity Himesh's hat is intact, even if it's in a car that has grown over <br /> <br /> Direction is bad Music saving grace, though most songs sound the same <br /> <br /> Himesh tries hard, but unfortunately his emotional scenes are a joke, missing expressions, he is best suited for his music director and a few chants cuts sorry picture Hansika is terrible Malika is fine Sachin Khe dekar is fine, dars han jhariwala ham
