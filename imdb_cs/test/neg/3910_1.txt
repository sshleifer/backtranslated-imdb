To, one day my father took a film with an 'elegant' cover. I have a home with mom and we were like yay letting you watch this new movie we've never seen before! ... Okay, so it started ... interesting start, cool robots and disgusting gore (eek) on a strange planet (actually it was Pluto wasn't it?) ... Blablabla I could say the whole story, but I don't point out, WTF NEVER NEVER take a movie with a gaudy name, and I don't really think EVER is judging a book by its cover (erra tape ...), it looked like an interesting movie. What was the face of sci-fi movies, its DISGUSTING. I mean, it was so bad that I started laughing (I swear it was trying to be serious) I CANT DESCRIPTION OF STUPIDITY! It killed more than a million of my brain cells, which I can't even write down a critique of descent. IT IS THAT BAD! Argh and I wana prepare you for something "weird" * COUGH COUGH * mechanical p3n1 $ * COUGH COUGH * Sorry, I just have to say, it's so funny to think of it as a comedy or sci-fi movie parody. His classic batman laughs, but in a new cover, what the hell did this director think?
