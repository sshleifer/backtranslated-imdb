**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young <br /> <br /> The mountain village Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious woman in a laundry room. "Go to 18", she begins to attract male attention, and reacts by throwing stones. The arrival of the dam crew on the construction launches dreams of romance in Mrs. Hepburn. He quickly attracts the attention of promising engineer Robert Young (like John Stafford), who flirically hides his marital status. Ralph Bellamy (like George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for various reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn worships. After Hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child, neighbors suspect he's a witch. If it weren't so serious, "Spitfire" might be more fun; it is an atypical and wildly unsuitable vehicle for its star, which is thoroughly unconvincing. Mr. Bellamy will show you the best results. However, the best characterization is esayed by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson), who appeared in George Cukor's theatrical version, along with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry), "Grandpa Walton" in the 1970s, has a small role. Unexpected End Help.
