One of the Lil 'Pimp commentators (dbborroughs from Glen Cove) was right when he said the movie was really bad, but I would make an exception when commenting on the animation. The animation wasn't bad because of Macromedia Flash. It was a bad animation because it was wrong. Flash is just a tool. In the right hands, an artist can create animation as full and fluid as any Disney movie and in the wrong hands can look as bad as things on the internet where Lil 'Pimp was created and should stay there. . Studios like Cartoon Network, Nickelodeon, Disney and Warner Bros. create amazing animations with Flash (ie Puffy Ami Yumi, Foster's home for imaginary friends, Mucha Lucha, etc.). Br /> <br /> Lil 'Pimp was a poorly conceived piece of audacity that was made because Revolution Studios bought Media Tripp and Lil' Pimp was one of the features. Roth and the company thought they would make a quick buck to use turd like Lil 'Pimp and fake it by its producer Amy Pell. The reason for the abortion of animated film in the third trimester is that none of the Revolution Studios executives had pragmatic brains to sideline Mark Brooks and Peter Gilstrap (they really tried the best, but were in their heads), and hired real writers director and manufacturer at least partially. But one thing they did right, they hired some of the best storyboarders, designers and animators in LA, but as Lil 'Pimp demonstrates, it's possible to buy the best sports car on the floor, but if you're moron, you'll be wreck it for sure.
