It's a student movie and it's a piece of bullshit. I would use a much stronger language to describe it, but then the review would not be published, and the world would need to know - in addition to any reasonable doubt - this REALY SUCKS movie. There seems to be another ruler in measuring the famous director's work. Somehow it was a genius that we were too stupid to understand, because he had finally gotten him right now. I'm not buying it. The early film "Bad Taste" created by Peter Jackson's LOTR dreams and this "early work" from another famous director is really upset as well. These "early work" are representative of miserable everything, from budget to scripts to actors etc .. all this is at the bottom of a bucket bucket. Don't be fooled by the big name. <br /> <br /> If you like to watch a handful of burned-out boys in the 70s, pretend they can sometimes command a ship with the worst special effects you've ever seen - that's your movie. <br /> <br /> I can't f * 37449ing believe this thing has won the Golden Scroll Award for Best Special Effects. Is that a joke? Or joke awards? <br /> <br /> If you want to watch what this movie wants, it was renting a season or three Red Dwarf you smeghead.
