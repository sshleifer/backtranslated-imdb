I remember this film with utter emotions. . . torture. More than half of the film is advertising (no, really!). A mild apology for the story could be easily said in 25 minutes (and almost is!) The end result is a prefabricated love story of a predictable schlock. Debbie Boone hit. Yeah, that's how fast it was made ... a song that "inspired" it was still big on the leaderboards when the movie was released! Despite decades to see bad movies, this still impresses me for my extravagant, unkempt, long jump into the most challenging, absurd and indelible film. It really deserves to be on the IMDb 100 list of the worst of all time, and has never left the top 3 on my personal "worst" list. <br /> <br /> Enjoy for total masochistic excitement!
