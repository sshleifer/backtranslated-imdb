It could be the worst movie ever made. At least plan 9 From space was funny. I can't believe they spoke to actually put money to do it. Complete celluloid waste. Before I saw the bullshit, I had some respect for Kristophersson. I think someone needed a tax write-off. Please, in the name of everything you don't feel, stop the one who did it before they suck again! This film should avoid all people who are not on LSD or my crazy cousin who insists that we are part of Native American. If you're in the woods and talk to you, see a psychiatrist. There is no need to make a film about it.
