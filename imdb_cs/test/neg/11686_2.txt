I've never written a comment on IMDb before, but this movie was so bad that I had no choice but to warn you not to lose two hours of your life. As a passionate historian from World War II, I don't know where to start, how historically inaccurate this film was. Carabiners with Korean war bayonet eyes, missing K98k cleaning rods and balaclava, German uniforms that did not exist, the list could go on forever. Added that it's loaded with bugs, has literally no land or climax, and acts on par with your local college theater. Cheese Embodiment. PLEASE ... there are too many good World War II movies to waste time on this waste.
