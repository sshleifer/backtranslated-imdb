You Belong To Me was the final teamwork of Henry Fonda and Barbara Stanwyck as a film team and was a loan to the Fund for Columbia Pictures. Fonda signed a contract with 20th Century Fox for Tom Joad to participate in the Grapes of Wrath. But after it was usually his loan out movies that were good while he was cast in average things on fox. But the rule was violated here. Although the character he plays carries some superficial resemblance to Charles Pike of The Lady Eve, this film is nowhere near as funny. Factual feminists would seem horrified. Barbara Stanwyck didn't really like it at all. She enjoyed working with Henry Fonda well enough, but the movie was ridiculous. Like she should have. Fonda is another playboy millionaire who would now call a trustworthy fund that doesn't really have much to do with his life. He's a little dear lunkhead who meets Stanwyck on the piste and literally falls on her trying to show. It turns out she is a doctor and has a gale that floats. But Fonda turned out to be a jealous stripe, especially when it comes to Roger Clark, another millionaire patient Stanwyck. And they do not understand their professional duties. Stanwyck, like Bette Davis and Katharine Hepburn, has been and is a feminist icon. When Fonda says he should go out into the working world and live on a salary and see if he can do it, Fonda gets out and gets a job as a salesman in a department store. He is so proud of him that he will actually give up his medical practice and live with him on the salary of his salesman. <br /> <br /> Today's movie should be filmed. Stanwyck didn't have too much conviction in his speech, probably because she didn't believe it. I definitely couldn't. I don't think viewers believe it. But the two stars and the rest of the cast tried their best, but this was a special Thanksgiving.
