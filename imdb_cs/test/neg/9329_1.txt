This film was childish in his writing and laughter in his visual effects. The scenes where Father Merrin throws in bed and his views of a native native are signs of bad behavior and bad imagination. Nothing seems to fit. The story jumps from scene to scene. Basic writing leaves no imagination and leaves no room for tension. The doctor says at one point that she thinks the city will "explode soon" from all the mad events. In fact, there was nothing in the movie that would make this line relevant. From the horrible work the film did, I never knew there was tension in the village. If you are in kitschy movies go ahead and rent it, but if you want to see it done correctly check out Exorcist: The Beginning
