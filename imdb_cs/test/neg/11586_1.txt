I just caught it on Showtime ... ewwwwwww, not even having fun in the wrong movie. One of the lightest monsters I've ever seen. In addition, the television reporter in the film was annoying Jerri from last season's Survivor. The only funny thing was that the "secret base" was a house from Fantasy Island (and a million more movies and TV shows; the place is in the L.A.). I was expecting Mr. Roarke and Tattoo to come and greet visitors. If Tattoo got eaten by a snake, maybe I gave this movie 2 but well. Watching people standing there and screaming for five minutes while Komodo or the Cobra emerged above them, instead of running for it, was quite funny, especially since you could really say they were shouting at an empty place where computer animators later paint in a monster. But I almost got out of the chair when they brought either a cobra or a commodo - then normal size - into an indestructible solid steel container with some air holes drilled into it. Wouldn't the wire cage be sufficient? LOL! They probably can't afford to rent a real dresser and a cobra. I have to remember renting Showtime for their series and not their movies.
