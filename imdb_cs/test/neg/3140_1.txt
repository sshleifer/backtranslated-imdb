You know, I always like distracting or weird movies, especially when they get to the Hamburg festival of fantasy movies in Germany. but subconscious cruelty was probably the worst movie I saw this year. will this comment contain spoilers? <br /> <br /> not because I just didn't understand this movie. but what you can expect from a movie that was presented at the festival crowd "we (the boys of the festival) know that not all of you will watch this end" ... movies and also I love movies with a strong graphic language. but this? there are lots of bloody scenes in this, but why? What is the director trying to tell us? says we have lost all morality and all religious feelings? or does it say that incest always ends in disaster? who knows - I do not. <br /> <br /> if you want to watch a movie that keeps you busy - be careful. but don't expect you to think "wow, I got the message" - I didn't get it ...
