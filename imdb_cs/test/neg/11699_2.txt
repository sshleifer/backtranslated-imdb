Maybe it's because I read Peter Straub's amazing book before I saw the movie, but I was terribly disappointed with this movie. In my opinion, the filmmakers removed everything that made the story interesting and unique, and replaced it with more common elements in Hollywood style. It's also bad because this movie has an amazing cast, especially Fred Astaire, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Melvyn Douglas, John Houseman and then very unknown Alice Krige. They're just not giving much worth doing. In fact, I was all about having to go halfway, but a friend persuaded me to stay to the end because he was sure he had to get better. During the final credits, he apologized to me.
