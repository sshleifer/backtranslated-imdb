This film is so god-terrible that it was literally a chore to watch. I wanted to throw it out of my vcr and throw it across the room, but I was still thinking (stupidly) that it might eventually be funny and then everything was fine. "You lose, we win, yay!" This film should be required to be viewed by anyone who once enjoyed the idea that Jackie Mason was funny. Then defeat them with this film until the tape tears. And if you're even thinking about renting this turd (or worse, you have!), I have to ask you one thing: didn't you even look at the envelope? I think with this crap you can say with one look how bad it is! "Oy vey!" This film was sucked.
