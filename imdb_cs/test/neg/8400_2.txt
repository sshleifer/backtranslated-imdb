I really wanted to have this movie, especially after all I heard about it spinning around it. But unfortunately it didn't work for me. Paranoid Park suffers from the same illusion Lost in translation - If you use very little dialogue, be hard on slow motion close and focus on pieces of fabric in the environment, then your story magically appears deep and thoughtful. Much of the plot, if you can find a plot of this movie, is created. I wasn't impressed by the fact that "writing it all down" confessional is the way the protagonist deals with the accident - So what do we believe? He grew happily to the end and wrote a book about his experiences, so he was defended for this terrible incident? What is, I think, a film that evokes empathy for a young man who, instead of facing the impossible moral embarrassment, instead creates a portrait of a future sociopathic personality. He has no connection with anyone around him and has no real sense of what is right or wrong until the end of the film. He has no direction at home and feels nothing for his friends. What we have is a portrait of an impersonal, spirit that just weaves through life as it stretches on a skateboard. I don't feel at all with him and I sincerely wish he was caught. The whole film does not necessarily follow his feelings of guilt, but how he will avoid punishment and / or responsibility for wrong decisions. He not only gets rid of him, but finds a way to rationalize him gently. A rather frightening, negative message that so many of our young people are so detached from the truth and misrepresent that they simply form rules when they go together serve themselves for good or illness. I regard this as an offensive treaty about today's youth and the filmmaker's enchanting arrogance with every blunt step, excessive step and shifting eye dripping strongly. Your eyes are missing, whether it was an act of mercy or not, it is hard to say - it could be that he was so dead that he tied his skateboard when he goes to the guard's car, one of his skateboard wheels is stained blood.)
