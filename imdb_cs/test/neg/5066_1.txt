I admire the effort to reach out to the rest of the world with this tragic story. However, the movie is done so BADLY that most people know they couldn't sit over it. The film has been important to me since I lived in Estonia when these events took place, but it is written horribly and does not capture the attention of anyone who knows nothing. Choosing music with a movie doesn't go well, it seems as if someone just turned on the player in the background to put the actor in the mood. What does it work? The only people are Jürgen Prochnow and Donald Sutherland, although Prochnow appears to be uncomfortable in this role. As for the development of relations between Eric Westermark (Jürgen Prochnow) and Julia Reuter (Greta Scacchi), it's like watching a train wreck. There is absolutely no chemistry and it is painful to testify of their "sincere moments". That's not a good movie. There is a difference between trying to get the message out (it could be a document!) And try to make a good movie. This is a failure, and anyone who says he does me differently is wondering if he is trying to promote him. As a native of Estonia, I am offended by this miserable effort. This tragedy deserves more than just the domestic low-budget ghost of the film. That could have been a lot more!
