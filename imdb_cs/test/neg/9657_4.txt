I find it amazing that so many people (probably Poles) have voted for this film, which gives it such marks (mostly tens). Okay, the movie was fine, funny, but on the other hand it was nothing special. The only good thing about Kiler is dialogue, not exhausting for non-Poles. The screenplay is primitive, acting (except Jerzy Stuhra as Fish) - terrible. It's too much for nothing - thankfully it's not included in the top 250. P.S. The sequel "Kilerow 2-och" ("2 Kilers") is on its way and it's just the same story.
