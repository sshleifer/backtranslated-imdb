This is one of the dumbest ideas for the film. Prepare a classic movie shot. I hope no one will try this technique again. In 1998, Gus Van Sant, director of "Good Will Hunting", made it through the transformation of 1960's classic "Psycho" Hitchcock and failed miserably. What did Van Sant mean? This remake didn't even come close to the original. The few changes that have been made have not helped. If you want to see "Psycho", the choice is obvious. Show original. <br /> <br /> * (of 4)
