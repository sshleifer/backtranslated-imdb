I'm Mike Sedlak. I wrote a score for this movie. And proud of it. <br /> <br /> And I like all the comments. Some of them were not far enough away. The film premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973. The theater was full of friends and family. We all applauded. <br /> <br /> After five days, it was pulled from all the screens in the Bay Area. <br /> <br /> If someone is interested in hearing some scenes according to the scene details that could make the movie even more enjoyable, please let me know. We could start with a shot when Gideon Blake throws the plunger to the toilet curtain to distract one of the evil supporters guarding the radio transmitter aboard the House Building. Or how Gideon dispersed the bomb in its original version. <br /> <br /> It didn't help you. That still bombed. Bring it.
