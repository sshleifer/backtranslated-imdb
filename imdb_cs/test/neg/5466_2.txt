Sure, I like some indie movies. A lot, actually. I don't always understand them and that's okay. Not all of them should have been understood, especially by the main people like me. I am probably showing my ignorance, but I am still confused as to why this is called the Book of Revelation. I love the end of the world stories and the only thing I saw at the end of the world and this film was a torture that had to go through. I'm not talking about the topic; Maybe I was suppressed from all the other tortures / porn I saw. It was just an incredibly slow story, one hour 15 minutes of material stretching for nearly two hours. (Big spoilers are in front of each other) Hetero-man dancers kidnap, seduce and rape six ways from Sunday, or in this case 12 days, with three hooded women. After his release, after his rather upset dancer / girlfriend hardly flinches (other than dropping a glass) after pondering which she missed more: he or the cigarettes she originally sent him for after the kidnapping. Still in a state of sensible shock, he refuses to talk and continues to work without as much hugs as if nothing has happened and he takes the necessary shower. Problem. Just as he is bothering his flashes into his, uh, "attacks," he is just as excited. It is true that I was not bound and used as a toy, but I doubt that I would really be "in the mood." I forgot, and how is she trying to solve this crime? Sleep with as many women as he can try and recognize moles or tattoos of criminals. I see where they're going with it? to show rape gang from male POV. Regardless, twisted, you never feel for this guy. Only saving mercy was a good act of the LifetimeTV dancer / instructor. But even she couldn't save the film.
