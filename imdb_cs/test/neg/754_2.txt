Sometimes the changes in the novels when they are made from movies are not only necessary but also a good thing. However, in the case of Northanger Abbey, this is a very, very bad thing. Not only is the story itself torn into pieces, but the satire is almost completely missing in the film, and it's a mixture of romance and intrigue to even touch the biting commentary that Austen put into his work. It is not at all fun or satirical, and instead turns the character's fascination into a drama with his fantasy world. This also affects romance. It's meandering and aimless. Chemistry and interest are never established. The reasons why Tilney attracts Catherine are completely absent from the film, so viewers don't want to wonder what they see in it. if Austin's satire.
