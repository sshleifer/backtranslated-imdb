This movie is so spear-cat, cliché-ridden, clumsy, and aspired, I found it astounding that someone couldn't feel cheated by the experience of sitting through it. Here are a number of idiotic clichés, ridiculous psychologists and simply unrealizable narratives in this "hard" high school representation: a tough guy is really gay. A-student is unhappy because his father is pushing him and somehow causes him to commit incest. The teacher is for a student who straps his pants in the classroom. The girl who goes with the above-mentioned athlete is really in love with him and "just wants a family". Perhaps the only saving grace is the scenes of student counselors that are unclearly interesting, but most of the equipment in this film is so leaded that it begs faith. <br /> <br /> This film does not give me any insight into teenagers and I will not be surprised when bombs, especially with teenagers. People who like this movie seem to be parents who worry about their teenagers, and guys are barking at the wrong tree if they think this movie will help with "understanding" teen issues. What is the morality of this movie? "Hey guys, let's look at each other and hug each other" Give me BREAK. Anyone who thinks you can get to this kind of message in 14 years must think back. In the 1980s we watched Kentucky Fried, Xtro, Porky, Evil Dead, Terminator, and so on. 2:37 is up there with another Australian "independent" movie, "One Perfect Day", which was as bad as this absolutely cruel movie from the movie. Thank God for the taxpayers' money. <br /> <br /> AVOID !!!!
