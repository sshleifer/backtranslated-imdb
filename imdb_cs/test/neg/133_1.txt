These days, writers, directors and producers increasingly rely on "surprise." The old art of bringing the film to a close, taking all the information we learned through the film and bringing it to a pretty complete end, was lost. Now we have a movie that, no matter how complicated, detailed, or frivolous, can be packed within 5 minutes. It was all in his head. This explanation is the Director's safety net. If everything else fails, or if it wasn't so good, or if we run out of money to finish the movie, we can always say "it was all in his head" and end the movie. Viewers buy it because, none of us is a psychologist, and none of us are suffering from schizophrenia (not that we know about it), so we take the story and believe it. After all, the mind is a powerful thing. Some movies have downloaded it. But these movies are the reason why more and more of these crap ends. Every director / writer now thinks they can pull him out because well, Fight Club did it and made a lot of money. So we get movies like The Machinist, Secret Window, Identity and this movie (just to name a few).
