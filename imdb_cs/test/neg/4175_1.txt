This movie was really funny, though it wasn't supposed to be! Acting was stupid, as were the voices. Almost all it was was a guy walking around the corn maze for an hour and a half. They threw themselves into this stupid super natural thing that made her even more. It wasn't even a normal movie, this weird scary music played almost all the way through the film. What is it with corn mazes? Corn children were really scary, I thought, and I thought it was something like that, but it was just stupid. The main character was just walking aimlessly at these two little girls. And eventually he kills someone or something. Worth seeing if you're with your friends because it's really funny how bad it is, but if you're looking for a horror movie, don't waste your time
