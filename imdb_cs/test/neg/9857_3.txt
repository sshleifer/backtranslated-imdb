Kasparov vs. Undoubtedly, Deep Blue is a fascinating story, but I don't think you know that by watching this movie. I think he's too focused on the conspiracy theory IBM has been cheating on ... and what is this theory based on? The idea that the computer took a step in one place that "looked like a man". I'm not a chess grandmaster or a computer scientist. And while I don't doubt that the move looked human, it didn't seem to me that it was beyond the possibility that the most powerful chess computer ever created could move surprisingly ... or that such a machine could even beat a genius like Kasparov. The film gets too many miles out of this theory, not enough of the people involved ... which could make it a more interesting story. The direction also relies too heavily on the ideas of an absurdly whispered narrative and an idea of ​​an 18th century chess machine that looks like one of those animatronic gypsy fortunetellers you see at the carnival. The story was also slowed down by many empty shots of Kasparov, where the "crime scene" reappears. I have no doubt that Kasparov and the chess community have found that IBM's behavior is unpleasant, but I don't think it would be anything other than what you would find from another big corporation. At the end of the movie you have the feeling that Kasparov is a huge crybaby and Deep Blue programmers are victims or cheats. I think that if the filmmaker wanted the viewer to believe in the conspiracy theory (which he almost certainly did), he should submit much more evidence. In fact, good proof would be the first. The whole thing left me with a sour taste in my mouth.
