This is of course not "Piranha" by Joe Dante and produced by Roger Corman. It wasn't so obvious when I bought a DVD for just $ 2.95 as the DVD cover art matched it Corman produced a comedy / horror "Piranha", even a DVD menu (no features of course) matched the cover. Halfway through watching this strange movie, my girlfriend and I started thinking where PIRANHAS is? Once the film reached its peak, we realized that we had to watch a bad movie when we saw a trailer that had completely different shots, the blur on the back of the DVD didn't match the story we watched and the credits (actors, producer, director) were also completely different. Instead, we have some jungle melodrama about a girl and two boys looking for diamonds and ending with a cruel hunter. This tame, exploitative thriller is boring and meaningless and is only slightly entertaining for the old school, the value of the camp. Strange that a DVD can be made with the wrong film in tact, but I suppose it's an easy mistake to see that they're both class B movies of the same name made in the 1970s. I've read more posts on this movie, I noticed I'm not the only one with a bad movie on DVD. How could it be INTERNATIONAL? Is there any sort of DVD phenomenon where failed movies try to get recognition by being placed on bad DVDs? WHAT'S HAPPENING???
