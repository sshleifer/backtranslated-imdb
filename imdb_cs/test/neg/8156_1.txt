Rarely is the film so bad that it achieves the often-sought paradigm that it has so little redeeming value that it is worth watching. "Cyclone," I'm glad to report, is such a movie. I knew I was good at something when I found a videotape. I'm at least his fourth owner: "Used Movie Sale!" On the front and sticker for sale for one dollar. I picked it up in an economical store for fifty cents. <br /> Used Movie Sale! the sticker covers most of the front cover, which means that what I see is really strange mixed from the front of the superbike bike, the car draped on the fire, and Heather Thomas, who is wearing Flouncy Eighties Hair with her mouth open. an expression that says, "Ave 'aoth' pain." I saw it and I thought, "All rights." The case, honestly, was enough ("don't turn anyone around and no one to trust Teri has plunged into maze of danger and delusion ") but I was surprised to see him really, I always made time for really bad movies." Fight Club "can wait. <br /> <br /> Meet Teri Teri is a tremendously well-executed character as we can deduce from her introduction, in which she and her boyfriend are doing exercises that highlight her breasts and later legwarmers, then Teri leaves to join her friend for an evening that is terribly bad Before he knows, Teri is driven "straight into the network of deadly double crosses in CYCLONE." VHS box says it is. <br /> <br /> Left of the box summary - perhaps from some weak hope that the actual copy This movie would be sold - it's how horrible It could be just me, but I thought I could read my characters' thoughts with their eyes. "That's stupid," says Heather Thomas. "I know," thinks Bad Guy with too wide a mouth. The driving force (no pun) for the second half of this epic image is car chases. These were actually pretty good, although I am inclined to the fact that gasoline does not need coaching on how to explode. What really impressed me is that in all chases the streets were almost empty. It's like there are only twenty people in this huge city. <br /> <br /> I know what you think. Thinking, "Gee Wilikers! I have to see the movie!" Sadly, you can't find him. Oh no. "Cyclone" is a movie that will find you. Wait. Some day - maybe during lunch, maybe late in the evening, maybe "when Jeffery Combs ('Re-Animator') is a murdered murderer" - you hear the rustling of legwarmers and you know it's time.
