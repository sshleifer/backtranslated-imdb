Comedy works best when it comes to things that are true. But as such, there is a need for some effort to make the jokes everyone likes and even the grumpy spectators laugh. When I look at the Daily Show, I see the whole "it's funny because it's true" thing, but I don't, but see the effort and often times when I don't have fun or just trying to make a point (I noticed it mostly in interviews) . The daily show began as a parody of news, by definition arguing about how the media play their own messages by pretending to be clumsy and foolish reporters and anchormen journalists, and to deal with a lot of subjects from science to movies and sometimes politics, then Jon Stewart came ... and everything went to hell. The first years of Jon Stewart's reign were probably gold, though he was so amusing, but then 2004 was a place where you can see a huge chance at the show. The show's humor away stale, Colbert left, Steve Carell left, many of the show's best anchors left and now it is mostly about Jon Stewart and the show's away from a parody to a semi-reputable news show, essentially evening news but with some gags. here and there. For those who haven't seen the show and have trouble finding out what's looking at the cable, I'll give you a brief description of what the show is about (at least until 2009): -Bush, Cheney and all Republicans (if they also accept the shared Democrats' opinion) also) are stupid, evil, corrupt and hypocrites, everyone who stands at conservative beliefs is also evil, corrupt and hypocrite; people who doubt the man-made theory of global warming are evil and stupid; -vote democrat; There I saved you 25 minutes of my time, going to see something else. However, initially, I have said that the producers have kidnapped the show for their own personal political agenda, but when I actually saw the interviews, it's crystal clear what this show is about (what I mentioned above), but I'll get to it at the moment. Frist off, humor in The Daily Show According to Jon Stewart expects to find a random movie written by either Bush, Cheney or a random Republican humorous, because well, because. Jon sets a joke, sets it into a specific writer context, and expects a random quote to bring a punchline in some way. So if you can't handle the context, it's totally useless as bank humor. Also, the Daily Show expects you to laugh when you show a cut of one politician who speaks, and in another separate video that says another thing, once again putting into context the writers expect you to understand, so it's funny why ? Well, because Jon said it. Imagine The Daily Show uses this formula countless times every week and start to understand what was previously laughing, which is now only 25 minutes of silent views (yes, even in Lewis Black segments). Initially enough decent effort was put into these jokes, but now it's much less. The conversation has the strangest sense of distortion I've ever seen. Jon Stewart calls Bill O'Reilly on the tyrant, but what he does when he pisses off every single actor and democrat (John Kerry before, Obama today) who appears on the show and looks at respected Republicans and perfect conservative journalists like the weekly Standard Is Own Bill Kristol? He puts them in a people's tribunal as if they were accused of a crime, often any person at an exhibition that stands behind Bush is portrayed as erratic, as if that person was in contact with reality and assumed he was talking. for most of America it is a de facto conservative treatment if it does not share a similar opinion with the Democrats, if so, then it is an endless love festival. But it still doesn't matter, Jon's eyes are wrong before you enter the show and you're still bad. This is the kind of treatment you get if you are something remotely right. Now you have to wonder what might have something to do with humor. You wonder what happens when the Democrats win the White House ...
