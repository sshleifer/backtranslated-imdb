Once upon a time, video distributors like Sub Rosa and Brain Damage Films would release low-budget, horror movies on a selected gorehound market that ate them with pleasure. This is acceptable to me because you could see these movies from a mile away with their delicate boxes and cheese titles. Now we have the Lions Gate, which got into the mix, just decided it would be better to breastfeed in the poor sap by making a "professional" looking cover on it and charging the same price as one of their higher budget, professionally produced features. Don't let it suck! It is true that if you have seen Dark Harvest 1 or 2 before you already knew what to expect with 3, but there is room for movies like this, and it's not in the video business next to professionally created features. <br /> <I'm an independent cinema fan and I've been watching some low-budget productions that were still worth renting, but that was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. "Action" (if you can call it) was meaningless. It was fun when I laughed at the horrible line for one or two minutes, but in the end it was too much to do and become unbearable. The story is bad, dialogue is worse, acting somehow gets even worse. The only way to save grace would be one scene that can still be horrible, but it's an award-winning effect compared to spraying blood after a girl breaks or mannequin decapitation. It took me three trying to make it through the entire movie and I just did it because I paid good money to rent and felt like I should at least finish all the way through. Stay away - stay away, far from this.
