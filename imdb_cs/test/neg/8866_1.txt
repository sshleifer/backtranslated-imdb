I've never understood this kind of spoof movie. You get some serious / semi-reputable movie that everyone knows about and takes it seriously over immature fart-jokes and the like. We've seen it many times, many times, and it has never been fun. It's just an easy way to laugh at something you don't understand, in my opinion. This seems to be one of the more obscure and less liked genre, though I honestly don't see anything in it that is much worse than that of Spy Hard or Hot Shots. This film, as is clearly understood simply by the title, focuses on creating childlike entertainment Pulp Fiction. This is the main reason why I decided to watch it because I found that the film was too lenient to Tarantino's sick mind and overrated. I was hoping for one or two good jokes, making fun of the too violent and senseless type of movie that Pulp Fiction was in every aspect, in my (nothing but humble opinion). I was very disappointed. The storyline is largely a jerky movie of Tarantina, with several scenes spoofing others, often better movies, in the same childish and humorless. Stimulation is bad, and you will often sit there, you will be able to estimate the outcome of each scene, predict every joke, often think of a better place in a place bored from your mind. Behavior is bad. Characters are clich√©s and stereotypes, and are intentionally paper-thin in order to make fun of the characters they are based on ... the problem is, it doesn't work. It just makes a movie that's harder to sit on. Humor is youthful and lame. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that they managed to find some actors who looked like people who should have looked. The film is a terrible waste of real real actors. Maybe a little fun for fans of typical spoof movies of the same kind. I recommend it only to people who really hated Pulp Fiction or Zucker parody fans. Everyone else: Avoid. 1/10
