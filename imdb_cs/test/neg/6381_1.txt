For some reason, I didn't like it at all, and I felt embarrassed as it was since I bought it and watched it with my family. We all hated him with passion. It's a nice children's movie, maybe the year it came out. Think about it: an outdated movie of children? What is the point? Children usually do not want to watch such old movies, and I do not see what this movie should ever be for adults. Some kids' movies (such as Mary Poppins or Wizard of Oz) can be enjoyed now, but Time Bandits is totally outdated. For your information, and I think applicable in this case, I also didn't like Dr Strangelove or Spinal Tap at all. So, if you disagree with me in similarly outdated movies, you may like Time Bandits. There is such a horrible case of overclocking as I recall from 'bad guys'. Think of two stupid "bad pirates" in the Pirates of C movies, except Time Bandits, which aren't even remotely fun. Anyway, I warned you, that's all I can do. Many people who liked this film had to like it many years ago. If you haven't seen it before, then don't bother watching it now.
