Stealing is a crime, and these guys, Kenny Yakkel and Corbin Bernsen, seem to get away with it. I haven't seen this movie, but not only that I know it sucks, but the fact that it steals the story of another movie, or 2 movies for that, is such a bullshit (and if the IMDb would do much more than bullshit) that I am filled with anger and feel like I should be thrown out of the window and just quit it all. It is a bit more, but stealing is worse. <br /> <br /> Have you ever seen Pontypool? It was this amazing little zombie movie made in 2008, this radio guest goes to work, and then this zombie attack happens. We only see what's going on inside the radio station, and the only guess we have on what's going on outside is occasional calls from their eyes in the sky Ken Loney (perhaps the funniest moment in the movie in my mind) and BBC calls to update situation. Of all the reviews I read and the conversation I had with my friend (who saw this movie and Pontypool), this movie was just like in the story, with minor improvements here and there. Throw away originality and creativity from the window. As for zombies or infected, what you want to call. They are exactly the same thing, just because they are infected, they do not change the fact that they walk thoughtlessly and have never ending extinguishment for the body. They're zombies. ZOMBIES !! <br /> <br /> ZOMBIES !!! Okay one to many, but back to this crappy movie. Zombies of what I have heard are very similar to those of 28 days later, another better film, with their insane rage and even more insane anger of flesh. This is where Zombie movies define, the story doesn't matter to the zombie movie (as long as you don't get an idea of ​​another movie). Sure, a zombie movie can be enriched with a story like Pontypo, but the zombies must be original in their own way. 28 days later, the mad raging Zombie began. Pontypool I can't even explain the boys without destroying the movie. Evil Dead, I think all I have to do is re-write the name because it's Evil Dead. Romero is a master and he has gone through all the different types of zombies, from the painted faces of the zombies in Dawn of the Dead to the raging zombies in the Diary of the Dead, and each has its own unique style. So, after talking about other great zombie movies, I think it's time I explained why I hate this movie without seeing it. This film right below steals the original story of the Pontypool contour, which I think is called plagiarism and is illegal in this country and many people get fired from school for doing it very much, but in Hollywood it is allowed, and apparently approved . This is not the only film that takes the outline of another film, and just tries to say it differently. The 1990s is like the worst period for movies at all, it certainly had some gems, but what decades did not, and it's because all the movies were the same. My favorite, criminal movie with a twist so big that you'll never guess it to the very end. Forcing you to feed one suspect to make it impossible that he is none other than him, then, boom, he was this guy all the time, you just had to look at the scenes where he wasn't there, and then when he wanted to . mysteriously appears from the blue, say "hey guys, what am I missing?" ACH! DO NOT SEE THAT THEY ARE DID YA! As a final statement, I will leave a cliché. This is one movie you'll definitely want to miss.
