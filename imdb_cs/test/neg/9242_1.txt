I watched this movie and all I can say is ... I'm not a film student, nor am I a dilettant intellect trying to find a deeper meaning in everything I don't understand. However, if I did this with this movie, my thoughts would be ... <br /> <br /> Yeah! He's on drugs and I can imagine now ... he tripped one night and sat down with his friends who laughed and said things like, hey ... Wouldn't it be funny if the sisters could really fly? Just like what if a man dropped out of an airplane and fell for a moment, bounced to the ground and got up and left? * Collets * or if buckwheat gave the Pope a bath? Oh my God, I'm cracking just thinking about it! Dude! We have to make a movie about it! And then he tells his friend how he laughs ... Oh and wouldn't it be fun if people loved it and they called me a genius? So for me, this is what happens when someone does one too many drugs and writes a script and produces a movie. Should I have done LSD to understand what this guy was thinking, so I could laugh too? Because I have to tell you, I wasn't allowed. I was yawning and checking the time. I think everyone who tries hard to find a deeper meaning is hysterical. I've never heard of this director until I read the reviews I did because I was upset that I lost the last 2 hours, or how long it was that it was 12 hours of my life. Anyway ... I never came back ... I read that this guy was a drug addict and wanted to die for art? what the hell? So my opinion is something like that. This guy is not there, he is addicted to drugs and his film is evidence of such ... So please stop trying to find a deeper meaning for him. If one really wants to understand everything in this movie, let go of some LSD and sit back and relax, then it can actually make sense. It reminded me of the time I watched Gus Van Sant's last days, another movie I was watching. I can't help but wonder what the movie would be if the same people checked who checked it. It looks like if the director of the movie is totally out of rocker, or it's a French movie with sex and subtitles, or if it's a cartoon, he gets great reviews, hands down, something else is boring and it's done. BLAH, bring it boring!
