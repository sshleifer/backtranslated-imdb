Thoughtful, but to varying extent, a trivial collection of mostly meaningless "stories". But let's start from the beginning. Kaurismaki: If anyone was wondering what Finnish love / romance was, perhaps that boring little peculiarity was an indication. Muted feelings, non-emotions, apathetic faces and a very depressing prospect of moving from Finland to Siberia! I think the continuation of this story will be "For our honeymoon we will move from Siberia to Greenland". Obviously, Aki had no idea what to write for this little movie, so she just invented something half-entered a non-"story" centered around the band she likes (or maybe his friends) because we look at them and listen to their music more than two main characters. Erice: I never heard of this guy first? and now I know why. Nice black and white photography and almost nothing else - if you don't get bored stupidly, this can be considered an advantage. But you would be surprised at how many film critics and film students love boredom in movies, so I highly recommend Erice's 10-minute snooze-fest to the two groups of humanoids. Herzog: Not a movie, but probably a piece of his tribal documentaries in South America. This is not a short film, but a message, but since the first two items were boring, Herzog's piece is almost refreshing and has some interesting moments, and if nothing else resembles that in this thoughtful concept of "time" nothing else. br /> <br /> Jarmusch: As you could expect, this once-interesting filmmaker (with a peanut brain, a talented idiotic savant) serves as another miracle of insignificance. He became lazy and couldn't bother writing something interesting, whether for his own movies or a collection like TMO. The only clear side in watching a stupid actress in vegetarianism spend 10 minutes in a trailer is that she is playing beautiful Chloe Sevigny. Otherwise, skip this nonsense. Oh, and btw: I don't believe a young actress is listening to classical music; was Jarmusch trying to be unreal by Chloe listening to that kind of music? Is Lindsey Lohan listening to opera? Maybe Drew Barrymore is a jazz fan? Who am I to say they are not?! Jim Jarmusch is a fool. Oh, right ... I've already mentioned that ... <br /> <br /> Wenders: Here's a real shock from the whole movie: Wenders can actually do something good !!!!! Everything else I saw from this overrated charlatan was so far boring and unnecessary. But this short story is done in atypical style and is the best part of the movie. This leaves one who wants to see more, even if the story has a resolution. Spike Lee: Oh, dear Lord? What can I say here? Lee makes someone seemingly talented in comparison. Just like Herzog doesn't choose a story, but will he submit a report? and left-wing political propaganda reports! CNN, but in black and white, and unilateral, of course. "My Wuz Robbed", the retarded title of this little sleep inductor, is naturally about how poor, trusting and endlessly idealistic Democrats WUZ ROBBED from Bush and his team EVIL EVIL THIEVES. This is by far the dumbest and dullest record in this movie, and I had to use the fast forward button to avoid getting caught. Indeed, Spike Lee is a product of positive action. God knows how many really talented (black) directors have never had a chance to make movies because this opulent and talented little runt still gets the opportunity to create them. And it gets bad EVERY TIME! Now it has some talent, right? Kaige: The Chinese story has a solid premise. It's okay, nothing more. All in all, there are many and much better movies on which to spend your time, but if your time isn't as valuable (as is the case with my own) you can check this little movie. "Ten minutes certainly can be eternity in the hands of anti-cinema masters. Time is rare. - Fedor Miklowitz, 1588
