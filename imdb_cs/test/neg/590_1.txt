2001 is one of those films where, if you don't like it, you're told you don't "take it" and you need to look at deeper meaning and symbolism. You are told that you have a clearly slow attention span, and you want to see sex, explosions and leave you a fence on a plate. <br /> <br /> Let's split the movie? Three minutes of darkness, with something in the background that sounds like a dying hippo. Then we get the initial credits. A minute of fascinating shots of Savannah. Then a bunch of monkeys find a black rock and start killing things with bones. Cut to the first of many 20-minute shots of ships doing things while the "Blue Danube" plays in the background. A bunch of senseless dialogue and a group of monthly scientists will find another monolith. A spacecraft that is too long for the crew - three dormant people, two people named Dave and Frank, who have a little more personality than stiffness in hibernation. And then there's the HAL, the "perfect" supercomputer that drives the ship. It steals predictably and begins to break the first law of robotics. Now it's something that has potential. An evil, cool, reckless super-mind that controls the environment and can predict your every move. And what is he doing? He lets one boy float into space and shuts down the hibernation machine, leaving three sleeping boys dying, leaving Dave floating in the pod. He just uses the air chamber, puts his suit and turns the HAL off - painfully slowly. Then there is probably some psychedelic "evolution" on Jupiter. Here's a movie with cut outs: Monkeys see a monolith, kill things. Scientists find the moon monolith. HAL kills people. HAL dies; Dave gets a pre-recorded message and develops on Jupiter. I'm not it 'I didn't get it.' It bores me with tears long stretches absolutely nothing. Sure, it's realistic, but I'll find out I have no reason to worry about it. Regardless of the message, no movie can be good without being funny. Frankly, every character could be replaced by Keanu Reeves and nothing would change.
