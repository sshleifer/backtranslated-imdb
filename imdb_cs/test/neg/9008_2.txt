I had a funny chance to see it at Mystery Science Theater 3000 four years ago. I have to admit that it wasn't as bad as some other sci-fi / horror movies of that time. The plot spun around an astronaut who returned to the ground with an alien embryo inside him. Now the plot is pretty weird, well, if you can even say it conspiracy. (I see the space program running from one building and the old pickup truck is dead funny!) I admit that it was horrible according to today's standards (and 20 years ago) ... but I watch 43 years ago and is enchanted by this filmem. It's not even near the badness of the Neptune Men's Invasion, Manos: Hands of Destiny or War of the Future. <br /> <br />
