This is probably the most unprecedented movie I've ever seen. I watched it because I had a soft place for Leon (everything else Besson did was, in my opinion, just terrible except for the Wasabi script) and Jean Reno. It's a proof of how bad the movie is, that Reno, one of the most charismatic and easiest of the friendly actors (sure to be right here), cannot watch this movie or the moments it is on the screen. Br /> <br /> It's all very film schools: black and white, no dialogue, people do things for no apparent reason, people are chasing each other while the camera shakes them. And predictably, none of them are funny. It's not "French Mad Max" as some people have said (actually I think it means "Mad Max 2") - it's a superficial comparison based solely on the fact that both films have post-apocalyptic environment, and it's just the kind of comment you'd expect from someone who doesn't know what he's talking about. Mad Max 2 was pulsating, Mad Max 2 was exciting, Mad Max 2 was worth your time - Le Dernier Combat is none of this. <br /> <br /> I know it should be fine to be something like art black-and-white French movies and just as cool to say you've seen something that others didn't (or do you she was sitting without feeling sleepy, which is why I wouldn't believe anyone who claims to be Le Dernier Combat because I don't see anything valuable in it; he asks so much and doesn't give anything back. After about five minutes I found myself in the air and never did anything to regain my full attention. Anyone who can sit through it unnoticed is not human, or at most psychotic. (Probably just trying to look cool).
