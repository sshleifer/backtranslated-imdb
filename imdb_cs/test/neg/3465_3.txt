How many times do I have to write boring and not funny words on this page until I get ten lines. George is about an original actor like Alfalfa of Little Rascal. Although it is probably mild to Alfalfa. How many times I have crept into these overpayments of miserable actors before I learn that there is only one law in the film industry. Take the money and make a movie - even if it's crap. He spends millions of making this movie, but can't take a few moments to watch the end result. And Renee GoAwayZigger should stop using the illegal drugs she is on and seek medical attention for face problems like sports. At least I hope his medication is because it is quite unattractive when talking out of mouth. This movie was neither funny nor dramatic, and these hacks should stop doing that bullshit. George and Renee, you should be ashamed and stop quitting committing greedy.
