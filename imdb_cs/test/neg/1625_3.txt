Miles O'keefe plays as Ator, a hero who resembles a hipster character who resembles a dancer Chippendale. Conan-wannabe has to fight the evil Par-Cher guy and protect the Earth from the Geometric Core, a primitive atomic bomb. Pay attention to visible sunglasses and tire tracks. Mystery Science Theater 3000 made fun of it under the name CAVE DWELLERS.
