A deformed, old female scientist kills fellow scientists to steal formulas for rejuvenating cells and reverse the aging process. She takes it and turns it into a beautiful, evil Satanic (Magda Konopka) who goes around seducing and killing rich entrepreneurs. She dresses very fashionably in fashionable clothing in the late 1960s and manipulates those around her. much like late Marisa Mell from DIABOLIK. Koincidence ?? However, despite all this, it is amateur and careless without the James Bond pop-art device that DIABOLIK had had. Even the filming locations in Madrid and Geneva in Geneva will not be equal. The soundtrack is Manuel Parada & Roberto Pregadio and it's not bad at all, consisting of a lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar used as an ornament. Ideal for one of the European Loungecore CDs released in the 1990s. The Retromedia DVD also uses a non-standard grainy color print that is in the wrong shape, with an explanation at the beginning that was explained by the age of the movie. Bull! Either they didn't bother to look for a better source, or they couldn't find it. There are only a few photos from Magda and that's it. Sloppy & Poor All Around, this gets 3 out of 10.
