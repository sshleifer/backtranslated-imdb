Mr. Kennedy should stop making bad movie scripts. What did he think? This is a movie that should not pass "hey, I have an idea, let's do a sequel" stage of creation. If it were a ZERO rating, I'd give it, but I think I'll settle for a generous 1. It seems that if you need to make some money, movie managers will kick an old hit and run it with a set of writers and see what's coming up. (Hey, I said "hit and run!" Kinda describes how I felt when this movie ended!) As this piece of garbage has ever seen the light of day is over. It is filled with unpleasant humor, strange animation and jokes that keep you away from the state of confusion. If you have been dragged into this movie, and someone is paying for you .... fine .... but it will still be more painful than a brick in the lead. However, if you plan to pay your own money, look for a better alternative.
