It was supposed to be a whimsical, courageous film that kept in mind as an interpretation of a relationship where the dominant personality only survived because the personality dominated, who saw no hope of change. Acting was intense and clever, the dialogue worked, but the film was unpleasantly ineffective: too many shots at a distance, suggesting that it was more of a focus than a wider picture. Bad flow. The first 5 minutes could have been completely omitted. <br /> <br /> I suspect that with a different layout this movie might be persuasive. It is flat in its present form. , formless and extremely disappointing.
