TV commercials for this film showed warlocks hitting a truck head-on, then getting broken into pieces and reforming on the other side of the car. I thought the special effects are good, but the general style of the movie is poor. This is the TV series "Charmed" with three boys instead of three girls. The big surprise for the three juveniles who are about to become adults is that they are an unknown fourth member of the clan who is to get them and consolidate all my power. In addition to lorry driving, these kids can fly up the sides of the houses, climb out of the windows, throw themselves into a pile of rubbish, and hit the veins in their necks. However, if they use their powers too often, they will become prematurely old and weak. The father of one of the boys is proof, because he's sitting in the attic, which looks like a mummy, but only 45 years old. Three good warriors are every dirty rich of his own right, totally spoiled, uncomfortable and uncomfortable. In every public school, these children would be defeated every day. Their looks and facial ticks would not cut any mustard with the hooded boys. Unfortunately for all the good guys, these Charmed boys were sent to Hogwart Reform School for warlocks that couldn't get into Harry Potter class. So what was the movie about? Three teenagers perform together with their friends. One other teenager who envies his power and money and becomes a lost relative. After several scenes where Charmed boys show off their strength and have sex with their friends; The movie gets into the unknown Warlock teen revenge plot. There's a predictable thing going on. A bad warlock will ambush different friends of other warlocks and eventually attack them. The last confrontation is happening and that's about it. Special effects are not bad, but nothing special. If you want to see fireballs, spiders and blue veins, then it's a good movie to watch.
