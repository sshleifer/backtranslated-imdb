Hitchcock's original classic had a huge benefit not only from performance, but also from Anthony Perkins's perspective. He projected a kind of pure innocence: a young youthful personality. He was not an actor who had shown baddies before; nor was he physically fit for what the public could imagine as a psychopath, especially in the 1950s, when this extremely cool aspect of mental illness (split personality psychosis) was relatively unexplored in the film. Which is exactly why his cast as Norman Bates was a slice of true Hitchcock genius. Viewers were surprised when they said it slightly. That's why this re-make doesn't work, not a bit, despite trying to be an exact copy. While Anthony Perkins looked like someone you would never consider a serial killer, Vince Vaughn is easily imagined as one. He lacks the fragile look of Perkins and his acting chops are clearly inferior, at least in this role (frankly - there ever was an actor who could convey nervousness as truly as Anthony Perkins?). While it was unnecessary to re-make a start with, the miscasting of the story is the most important figure sucking this movie down completely. As a side note, I feel that Hollywood is inclined to re-do great movies because "young" people refuse to watch anything that is not color-filmed, not only stinks to the high sky of corporate greed, but is exceptionally disrespectful to the original part. As for viewers who can't watch black and white - it's their loss. Hopefully they mature sometime in the future and no longer require shiny colors to keep their attention. When they do, they find that sometimes black and white works much better. With the background dimmed, the story and performance are much more front and center. And in many cases, the mood or atmosphere created by black and white cinematography is not attainable.
