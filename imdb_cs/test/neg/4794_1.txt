This movie is as bad as it is. If you like the logic (or its lack) of a National Treasure and bad behavior anyway, then it can be a movie for you. Otherwise spend time in the sun and your money for beer. Actually, it looks like a badly created promo or demo image to support people involved (ie actors, special effects, etc.). They accidentally produce really bad revelations of their lack of talent. <br /> <br /> In this case, the film company should be ordered to return the money to customers who are not satisfied with the product. <br /> <br /> It's really bad.
