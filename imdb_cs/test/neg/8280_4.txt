Pretty lame and horrible slasher about someone killing college track members after their star runner dies during a meeting. I don't think anyone would ever come close to being as serious as Chris - even at the Olympics. It is typically a divine CG performance, and if you are a fan of man / legend, you should run out now and grab a copy. But we follow slashes for murders (you know it's true), not performances, and Graduation Day can't deliver on most numbers (there's one really good kill). True horror comes only when the band performs "Felony". I've never heard of them? Watch the graduation day and find out why.
