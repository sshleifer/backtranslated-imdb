One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that came into this television movie, it would reflect something that has the taste and behavior of a higher-class couple - Wallis Simpson and the Prince of Wales - instead of being a fearless historical romance . This is not even helped by the fact that JANE SEYMOUR and ANTHONY ANDREWS give stiff, rather unpleasant observations of performances in which events move too slowly to keep their attention. It is hard to see why the star of the OLIVIA DE HAVILLANDOVA would like to play the supporting role of Aunt Bessie because the role is so colorless that she is almost out of sight. At this stage of her career, Olivia appeared in so many "noble" roles that required a shelf presence, but nothing more. A trivial film that has not been forgotten in all the films made on the television era.
