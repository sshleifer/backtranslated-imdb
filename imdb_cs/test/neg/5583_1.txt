This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The highlight of the film is a comparison of the smell of natural gas and the dirty vagina. Negotiations are pathetic. I know that acting is hard work and so, so it should be left to the real actor. Watching these people is like watching Michael J. Fox doing brain surgery. At best, it's uncertain. One of the other comments would convince you that the film is stored by talent talent Dan Gordon as Chris. Only Dan himself or perhaps his mother could believe it was a good deal. Special effects in this movie were terrible. The worst special effects were to blast the gas in the lighthouse. It looked as if someone was shining with orange light from the bottom of the refrigerator-made model. Sure, there was some computer animation up there, but it didn't help. I think the special effects of this movie were created and rendered using one Amiga computer from the late 1980s.
