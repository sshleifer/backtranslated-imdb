I really couldn't get into this movie. The thing is that an old woman has tortured someone for so long that she is deformed. He dies, and he stays in the basement to starve. The moons must pass and the family will move in. The daughter is blind because of her father's accident. Well, this basement guy, who should be dead for all rights, is still around. She eats a cat and is now superhuman. Now she wants to eat people and have sex. And when his father dies, he gets blamed. I don't always like movies where someone else is blamed for murder because there are always the typical lines "I didn't do it", "I never could have done such a thing", blah blah blah. And the story of the family could be a lifelong film story.
