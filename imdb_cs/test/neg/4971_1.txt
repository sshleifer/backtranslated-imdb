In 1993, Sega released a dull, bland video game of one of the greatest films of all time. They quickly realized their mistake of havinghed another version of the game, claiming it would be bigger, tougher and better. <br /> <br /> Not one. Both were slow, boring games. <br /> <br /> You can choose to be dr. Alan Grant or ... Raptor. They both have problems. Why should Dr. Grant kill all the military guys they do in the game? And why the predator kills other predators? Oddly. Apparently not learning from his first mistake Sega really dropped the ball to its original version and the so-called Rampage Edition. One of the slowest, slowest and dumbest platforms I've ever played.
