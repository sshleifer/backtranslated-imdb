What a shame. John Travolta and Scarlett Johansen deserve better than this. Beginning in the beginning, JT was severely miscast in the lead here. The role called for someone who could convince like a broken anti-hero, someone who could look scary and defeated. Billy Bob Thornton would be on the bill, or even Al Pacino, but JT is just too lively and it seems to have too much fun. Also, surely someone who went through the mill to the point that the JT character had any physical effects? The character presented to the audience seemed to start as a tight end for the Oakland Raiders. Scarlett was a little better. Where was the pain and conflict of what was supposed to be a worrying development? And as for the "conspiracy" ... well, none of this makes any sense. The characters jump from one frame to another seemingly without cause - and certainly without explanation. The pace of the film also leaves something to be desired, and that is the pace. This is a very slow movie, not that I have something against slow movies if it is heading somewhere. The tempo rises to the very end when it moves from a slow dune to a frantic race that wraps as much of the weary clich√©. That's what it is all about - the only thing missing is something about a small dog. 3 out of 10 for this one purely for Gabriel Macht's performance - was the only member of the cast who was a) well cast and b) able to convince himself of his role. All in all, a terrible disappointment and a real loss a few hours.
