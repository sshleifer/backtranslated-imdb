It's a time machine. It runs in "real time" for 96 minutes, but it was like 96 years. The first 20 minutes were totally useless. Massive amount of "dead" time in all time. What happened? When will something happen? Who cares? It seems the film was made on a tight budget, I note the following for your uplift: Morlochs: Nothing like saving a little money by reusing the Lord of the Rings sets and costumes, part I, hey? "The Haunted Dude" Who's in Control of the Morloches ... The worst thing these guys could think of was someone wearing one of Gene Simmons: (from Kiss) old costumes ??? Well-known fact: madmen of the future have perfectly manicured nails. <br /> <br /> Save money, save time. Pass this.
