Let me first say that I didn't expect a lot, and I watched it when the night was opening. I believe it should be if there were more than 20 people in the theater. It's so hard. acting was, at best, robotic and nothing was explained in the last 30 minutes of the film. I think it was their way of conspiracy conspiracy; Keep everyone in the dark on important information to understand the direction of the film and then explain things and hope it looks like a conspiracy plot. <br /> <br /> Unknown to the end of the movie: -What is the dark effect? CG was fine, but I want to understand! - Why would they want elevation? especially when mass murder is an ultimatum. -Why is it too bad? your normal after, right? -Who broke through? <br /> <br /> About 50% of the minutes are just men on the screen, there were shots of them in the wife's whiskers, sleeveless t's and then the intestinal scenic pool scene of all the teenage men in skimpiest low speedos driving knowing they were made . I swear you could see the beginning of one boy ... well, it was close to the soft core. And of course there was a shower scene and mixing it was from DUDES. The blunt cracks were abundant, the sausages running. But there was only one scene in which there was nothing to see and walk around the most beautiful bathroom around twelve minutes. Then there was a girl who spoke PJ. Another thing I couldn't overcome was the amount of Caleb's ride in his SUPER COOL Ford Mustang GT. it was a Ford commercial for about 1/4 of the film. <br /> <br /> You can't see it. Or go see a friend who likes to make fun of bad movies. then it would be worth it. but don't expect anything breathtaking.
