I noticed that many of the films that were screened at "Mystery Science Theater" received tons of low ratings on IMDb. However, a few movies featured on movies were not so bad and it is not fair to rate the film that was given "MST" treatment - with the hosts making humorous comments during the film. Now WILL NOT say "The Girl in Lover's Lane" is a great movie, but it's not bad enough to deserve its current IMDb 2.1 score. The film begins with a meeting between Bix and Danny. Bix is ​​a drifter veteran and Danny a younger guy who seems to have no particular reason to wander the country. Once Bix is ​​thrown into a small town, Bix has to rescue Danny again and again because Danny is quite naive - a nice way to say he has a tomato intellect. On the way, something happens to confident Bix - he finds a nice young lady and finds himself attracted to the cheat sheet. Jack Elam plays in a strange hiding place a super-haunted sicko that travels through the city to scare everybody's bullshit - but strangely, the police don't seem to notice too much or do anything with anyone. . Eventually, however, when Elam puts the moves on the girl Bix falls, things get to full boil. <br /> <br /> Overall, although not a great movie, there were many interesting elements in it. This movie - just deserve a score higher than 2.1. The biggest negatives are the simplistic conclusions to the mystery that occurs near the end, as well as the overall stupidity of Danny too often. Considering the tiny budget, it's just a small movie.
