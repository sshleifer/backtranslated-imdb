This stinking is in a mystifyingly frequent substitution on one channel, and I reappeared in horror again and again. The script is like something that would come with friends over a few too many drinks, and the production values ​​match admirably. It's supposed to be a children's movie, but it contains a grotesque (and poorly explained) kidnapping scene; Star Dog has a lack of stellar quality that only other actors have; and generally has the appearance of filming in someone's backyard (the top football game has no more than three dozen extras that unfortunately cheers in the background). <br /> <br /> Even all budget packages -out the sequence of voice when the story, on relief, stops. High-raters here have to be either manufacturers - or most football accessories!
