Much of the commentary on this album revolves around the debate about the validity of any comparison with R DOGS on the DVD cover. Forget it all ... This movie-- home movie is terrible. How can someone with a credibility claim to be 10/10 ??? There is no land, none. I couldn't believe I had spent the rent (more on that later) and had been deceiving myself to believe that this (based on box art and some kind of film festival) had the potential. The only thing I really remember was that one of the unpleasant main characters was supposedly offended by a bullet in the head ... and ended up surviving the blow and doing it for the final credits alive. Wow. And looky dere, Killers has a sequel. Double wow. A True Story - I was actually in denial of wasting my money and life force on this rental that I held a videotape of what had to be six months. I thought it never really happened. The video at the top of the TV was an illusion - a mental symbol of my own disgust. After someone pointed out that he was really real and that I needed to get grip, I decided I didn't want him there. I thought, "How many more have I denied suffering to sit through viewing this masterpiece by accumulating Killers to myself?" I had to do the right thing and put her back to the hell he came from. So, as I imagine most of the populated IMDb would do in a similar situation, I took some great courage and went to a video store ... at 2:00. After I made sure that no one is around, I got out of my car (still running of course), slid the movie into the drop box slot, and booked the hell out of there never to return. I think I was expecting some goons from Hollywood Video Company to come looking for me (the account has to be pushed up to something like $ 1,238.67 by then), so I moved out of the area. Coincidentally, like the storyline of Killers, nothing happened.
