Well, Anne's too old. Wentworth looks younger than she and he shouldn't. Louisa is too young and too cheerful Oh sister Mary is too nice. She's supposed to be average, not pretty. When this actress complains about how Mary should be, I think she's too nice to be a complainant. Lady Russell is too old. That's crazy. If you read the novel, it's Anna's older mature girlfriend, maybe as old as Annes's mother, who was about 18-20 years older than Anne- about 50 NOT 70! It's crazy, it won't fit. How come Anne is so damn happy at the beginning? He smiles when he says, "The worst is over, I saw him that the worst went through" yeah right. OK, if anyone saw a 1995 version of Roger Michell than the ones you can't compare. It is on site. This one's gone. Read the novel and you'll know what I mean.
