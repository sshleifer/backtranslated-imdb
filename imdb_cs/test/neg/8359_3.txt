There must be a lot of background information left out of the movie. In fact, in the film, the girl, Lizzy, did not even look depressed. She seemed to be a girl who got out of control when she finally got to college, mainly from drugs and drinking alcohol. It seemed to be her problem, not mental illness. Sure, she had emotional problems because her dad had left and had barely seen him as a child, and her mom looked a little outside. But the way she treated Noah and Ruby was just fine and I don't think it was caused by depression. She was very needed, so Rafe left, but it was because of her dad. But I think the main reason this movie never reached a theater performance is that it won't be enough with the fence. and the story is not written well. FINAL VERDICT: In truth, I recommend it only if you are interested in seeing Ricci's first naked scene. Otherwise it's not very interesting.
