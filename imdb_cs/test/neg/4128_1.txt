First I watched a movie at SHOWTIME called Survival Island. He says it was a 2006 movie with Billy Zane and because I love him and couldn't sleep, I thought I'd check it out. It looked interesting. He watched it and decided to look at the IMDb that was this new face Juan Pablo Di Pace and OMG I couldn't believe this movie was renamed THREE and will be a new movie ??? He plays again in 1 hour and 30 minutes on Showtime Channel again and this date is May 28 and EDT or Florida time. You can view your showtime records by name and see it. I wont get into the details so you can see the movie, but in one place there is a lady in a white bikini that goes into the water that does it all away, you see her naked body .... when she returns from the water you see her bottom. Funny, there's a lot of other mess. I can't believe I decided to find this movie ... Go figure! I wonder if people renamed it to sell it to a movie studio to release it, but it's already playing at Showtime, ha ha. Good laugh. I give it 1-1 / 2 stars. C-, D + film.
