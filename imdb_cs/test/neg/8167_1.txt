It's hard to make a bad movie with "underdog eventually succeeds" a sports theme, but this movie succeeds admirably. My mind likes how absurd and boring this film is. I think the director couldn't decide whether he was a runner or a trainer. In the end it's not about any. Finally, who cares? No character has a likeable personality. There is nothing in the movie that interests you. Not even "bad guy" is really bad. (I think she's in two scenes, and she seems to be on a barbituate.) I think she'll ask her once and politely to leave the coach and train with him. Later she asks her to move with him. and it is done. Conflict! Tension! What will he do? !! <br /> <br /> -What is the runtime view? Did the director see a real marathon? The form of Christine is so bad that it is absurd as well as the form of supposed "champion" with which she competes (character without lines. - Maybe they could hire, you know, the real RUNNER?) <br /> <br /> - A the speed with which the run is running is beyond understanding. Running or going fast? It's actually laughter. I can literally walk back faster than they did in a big race. Maybe it was too hard to move cameras at real speed? Another absurdity: (spoiler, I think) At one point in a big race, two women in the lead inexplicably fall, on the same level. time. What they fell is a mystery. Maybe both of them just ran out and fell? - And then they get up, but they don't start running for about 30 seconds. Yeah, very realistic. This nonsensical event does not add any tension because other runners are not close, and besides, you are blunted to the state of catatonia at this point. I was especially interested in how all four of her male teammates, all trained athletes, drop out of a big race for charlie-horses, or pulled out tendons, or something so unlikely. But who cares? This film has almost no tension, no resolution, nothing. A female runner with absolutely no personality is discovered by an old, boring trainer with some past failure that barely hinted at them. They train a lot. She is not happy. They train more. Big race wins. Woopie. <br /> <br /> My description is actually more interesting than a real movie. I saved you 90 minutes. Avoid it, such as plague.
