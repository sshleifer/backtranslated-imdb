Based on the novel of the same name, Elmore Leonard, does Killshot suffer from a lack of focus, direction and creativity? all the elements that the original story probably had, and the negative test projections forced heavy adjustments (including a complete cut of the character), resulting in a film that feels almost nothing like Leonardo's story. Too many characters fill the story with a too simplistic and straightforward (not a typical feature of the author's work), and focus is constantly changing between the two men who are hard to punish and the troubled pair that does not show our sympathy. While the story itself provides rare twists and turns, unfortunately, until the end of the film, its attraction remains a mystery. The washed-up hit-arm Armand "The Blackbird" Degas (Mickey Rourke) follows a strict code during its missions that inadvertently tarnish its final task. Now on the run from his former employer, he accidentally joins forces with an unfair criminal dissatisfied with Richie Nix (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to get some quick money by blackmailing a wealthy property. When couple Carmen and Wayne Colson (Diane Lane and Thomas Jane) are struggling to steal conspiracy conspiracies, they are forced to hide when crazy killers stop at nothing to silence two witnesses. Killshot proves that it is based on the novel Elmore Leonard is not a reason for immediate success or even a promising adaptation. The characters, situations, and even the resolutions in the film are tired and unoriginal, suggesting something more at random. Isn't it that there is no potential, especially when Rourke's black-grained, calm and collected assassin plays a hit during the opening scene? Purpose and principles are only continuously abandoned because they leave every minute. The style and the way each character is introduced is most interesting; visually, the roles of Bird and even Wayne are appropriately complemented, giving immediate interest and depth to those who usually end up in a creative dead end. Pairing Cold and Black Bird Counting with Irrational and Explosive Richie is a tempting combination (compared to Fargo would be extravagantly too kind), except that each character is slowly losing track of the features that initially interest them . As Richie begins to pick up more experienced murder habits, Bird releases his grip on his own murder methods. No matter what he sees in his current lighthearted fling with Donna (Rosario Dawson), it is hard to imagine his last panic confrontation with Carmen provoking his true nature and subsequent carelessness that drastically affects his outcome. Probably or not, is Killshot an unfortunate fall? and little entertainment can be collected from these characters who continually lose their originality by continually contradicting the habits that once made them fascinating.
