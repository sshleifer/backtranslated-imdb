Being a science fiction fan since my early childhood (long since then) I've always hated an unlikely plot. It is a pity that most science fiction writers for children do not show this kind of respect to their audience. I always thought they thought that: "Children are stupid to realize it, so we don't have to try." Writer "Science Fiction (2002)" is no exception. The story is about a boy who is encouraged by his new friends to spy on their parents because they think parents are aliens. The idea sounded like an interesting idea, because it bored me. It seemed to me that the filmmakers had exactly this idea and tried to stretch it over ninety minutes by putting it in a dark, stylish and carefully slow atmosphere. The only thing that kept me on my chair was the question of "how do they get out of this improbable waste"? And then - bang - they didn't even try it. So if you are looking for good fun for both children and parents, please visit "Klatret√∏sen (2002)" instead.
