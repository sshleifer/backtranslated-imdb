Being a fan of Marlene Dietrich's movies, I was very concerned when I saw this "document". I was also sucked in by reading a rave review after a rave review by national critics. That should bounce me off. The movie is just boring and probably extremely overrated. You don't even see Dietrich. She is heard in the background, discussing her movies and this video. He does almost nothing but complains about everything. What a move! <br /> <br /> The director, Maximilian Schell, is constantly complaining and begging her to be on camera ..... to no avail. He simply refuses to cooperate. After a while, this kind of thing becomes really tiring. Why would Schell continue this project with this approach? He was supposed to just say good-bye to "push" him. <br /> <br /> No matter what you read, don't waste your time.
