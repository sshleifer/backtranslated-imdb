The only reason this show didn't get 0 is because it's not available. This show went from informative news to sensational clapperboard. I tried to support this show in its decline because I like stories about human interest and Primetime had some very good ones. Unfortunately, on April 21, my opinion about this show and the unethical news companies involved in it have changed forever. Actually, ABC has seen a brutal case of child abuse and then refused to show it until the limitation period has come and parents could not be arrested on charges they were facing. Worse was how ABC swept the incident under the carpet; instead of taking the lead and striving for genuine expert help, these disturbed individuals had several pop psychologists who had sent strict AUDIENCE warnings about how these poor angels shouldn't judge too hard. I was really sick. I hope this review will stop one person in the future to monitor this investigative waste. If so, I'll be happy. These days, all you can expect from Diane Sawyer and the good people from Primetime Live are the butt-kissing sessions with an A-list of celebrities and crimes covered and praised by the stars. Don't waste an hour of your life; You'll be better off watching an old sitcom on Nick in Nite.
