This movie is occasionally a wild 80s sex comedy, others a sweet romantic one ... Then it has moments of serious drama and then sprays in sci-fi dashes ... It's so uneven that almost ridiculous. But I hardly think of him as one of the worst movies I've ever seen, except of course, that they hurled Peter O'Toole. There's nothing to do with it at all. Bad dialogue, bad work to do, bad everything ... And yet it's fantastic ... There's not one good thing about it and yet it does it if it's just a pure spell. The fact that he was so able to achieve so little with so little light focuses on how much everyone else in the movie has failed, so it seems to be even worse than I suppose that if he was some other actor in the role of O'Toole, I would have forgotten this movie as stupid and never thought of it, but on the great performance of Peter O'Toole despite all I will ensure that I will remember this film for a long time. time to come ... If only as a movie that might be good, if someone were involved, it was almost half as Peter O'Toole.
