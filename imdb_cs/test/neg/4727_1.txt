How I laughed during the first few scenes. This stupid little movie eleven years old, carrying a gun, stealing cars, robbing stores, thief houses, blackmailing money from other children, burning houses, shooting rats, buying drugs, distributing drugs to his mother and his friends, then killing a guy. What a great comedy! But it wasn't a comedy. It was intended as a social drama. How can it be? The events in this film are absurd and ridiculous. Characters are all stereotypes right after a four-year-old, immature imagination. Dialogue is ridiculous; people speak like moroni. It's a very stupid movie. <br /> <br /> The first scenes are really very funny for all the wrong reasons. However, the unintentional cheerfulness of the idiotic premise expires after a short while, and after that laughter rarely comes; in the meantime, the viewer cannot believe what he sees and is stunned and bored by what follows (if he has at least half his brain cell). Short film, but it feels like eternity. In fact, the film is a seriously intended attempt to show the world a young degenerate man, while imitating films that are superior to "Fun". There is only such air phoniness about everything; children, adults, everyone lacks credibility in both their actions and dialogue. The guy in the lead is going through the movie as if he'd seen all of Jimmy Cagney's movies at least a hundred times. And typically, a child is not portrayed as a reservoir of evil, but instead as a misunderstood little artistic talent. Of course. Every young hooligan is misunderstood - the company is bad. Poor child. The film is embarrassing; A collection of outdated, occasional cheerful clich√©s together to make a film that lacks intelligence and meaning. The film's intellectual level is zero.
