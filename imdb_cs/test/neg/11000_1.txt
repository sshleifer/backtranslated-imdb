This is one of the dumbest and worthless movies ever. She really doesn't qualify for film status. It's very cheap (apparently shot on videotape), terribly acted and just plain rotten. I couldn't believe how cheap and awkward the piece of crap was. It looked like a home video! I think I believe a man I know a couple of houses down had to kick a camcorder and make it crap in 2 or 3 hours. It's so bad. Did I notice the name from where it came from? Azyl ?? and I never rent anything with this name on it again !!! When you rent a quick navigation, make sure it is from this company. But one thing is true - if you like scary acts, amateur movies, then you may like this loser. It's totally boring and awful !!! You were warned !!!
