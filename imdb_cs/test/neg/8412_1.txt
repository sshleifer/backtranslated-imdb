I usually try to find good in movies, even the bad ones. Unfortunately, this movie is one where I have failed miserably and the fact that there is hardly one positive review on this record shows many IMDb reviewers share my pain. I usually don't follow the sequel, but I had to see it because I love "Rosemary's Baby" so much. That was a mistake. It simply reaffirms my belief that most of the sequels are miserable - though fortunately very few of them are as bad as this. In fact, it's not really a continuation in my mind, it's a satire about how bad a sequel can be. The film is highly recommended because it is not reflected at any time.
