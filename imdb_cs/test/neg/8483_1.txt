Loki, the Norwegian god of mischief, creates a mask that gives the wearer caricatures. At the command of his father, Odin, he spends the rest of the film searching for a mask so that he cannot cause another grief to mankind. Meanwhile, the mask owner conceives a child who inherits the mask's powers. Etc. If it sounds like a pretty thin line, it is. Add to this the fact that the film is processed unnoticed from start to finish, and the result is very, very bad. You can find worse movies, but you will have to actively search for them. The son of the mask is mostly presented at the intellectual level of a preschooler, but in the light of the scene, such as mask-child urinating abundantly in six different directions, including to his father, this assumption seems unlikely. I asked my son, who thought he could be the target audience for the film, and he answered "convicted criminals", apparently forgetting that the Constitution forbids cruel and unusual punishment. bad movie is not a sin, or hell would be overflowing. What makes it a sin is that $ 72 million was spent on this piece of waste. To put it in perspective, the day after we watched the Son of Mask, my son and I watched "Good Night and Good Luck," a film that collected six Academy Award nominations (including Best Shot) and was $ 7 . million. That is right. Only one tenth of the money spent on the Son of Mask. It is then a sin - to flush good money into the drain when it could be better used in the production of traceable films, or feeding hungry children, or almost any other purpose in this regard. Producers should really be ashamed.
