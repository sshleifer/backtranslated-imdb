This film was nothing like a book. <br /> <br /> Everything was mixed or changed. Most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book. This movie should never be shown. It was a great disappointment to me when I enjoyed the book so much and then I watched it destroy the whole thing. I would never recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Nora Roberts or JD Robb. Honestly, this movie is not worth watching as it really is from the book.
