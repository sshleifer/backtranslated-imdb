It's true, no one expects anything to expect. But even the low standard is a horrible movie. Basically an anthology movie, this fourth part in the saga Hellraiser is trying to be the original story and on top of the whole series on the same level. time. An ambitious idea. However, none of the actors have enough time to show up to do anything with their characters and director Yokheru left the film, rather than give up the studio. The result is a smoking pile of mediocrity that even fanboys have trouble defending. If you're not a fan of "Alan Smithee", avoid this.
