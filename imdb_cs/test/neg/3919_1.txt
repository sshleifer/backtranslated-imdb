Square pigs as a way to effectively use cargo space is the only and clever moment in "Space Truckers". Believe it or not, Dennis Hopper did worse, see "The American Way", but this movie is up there on a "crap" scale. I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that "Space Truckers" won't hurt anyone. Too caricature-like too seriously, almost complete lack of humor, and poor character development, virtually ensures disappointment. Beer and popcorn crowd can tolerate one look, but everyone else has been warned to avoid "Space Truckers" for all of the above reasons. - MERK
