This film is an inexorable, unbeatable explosive melodrama and is one of the worst action movies ever made, and in an incredible way. The tempo is always feverish and all the action and actors are captivated by the overall hysteria. It's almost unnoticeable, and the stain - nay, blot - on the career of all involved. A wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines yourself, resulting in a movie where you just go "Come!" "all the time. Settings and events cannot be taken remotely. I can only rate this outrage of 1 in 10. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good asteroid movie, see Deep Impact, which is intense, responsive and entangled. All that Armageddon is not.
