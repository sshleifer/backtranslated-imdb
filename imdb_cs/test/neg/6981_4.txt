This movie wasted 2 hours of my time and just wanted to shout me: "LAME". Nicholas Stoller write the film "Yes Man" but direct "it" maybe should stick to writing. <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed because I've heard all the great reviews. I was expecting something like this. They say it's from the creator of "Knocked up"? why can't I see the similarity? but this seemed like a shallow, exaggerated theme to the movie. I'm so disappointed. Actually, it's not bad if you consider it your average movie, but the character of "a group of guys" just gets nervous. Maybe I didn't pay enough attention to the movie, but yeah, they have some funny lines and a scene, but I don't feel originality. And the end makes the film a little better. At least the end isn't some boring clich√© one.
