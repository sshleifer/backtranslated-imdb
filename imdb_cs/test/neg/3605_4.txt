It might sound strange, but before the first week I only saw the first movie (The New Imperator, the Emperor's New Track, yaddayadda) and only for one episode of the TV show. I simply love Kuzco's character, but Kronk isn't so bad. Finally, I decided to watch the second movie, so I saw it. He hoped it would be as good as the first one, but ... I'm sorry to say that, but the more humor the American got, the more I yawned. I agreed with Kuzco when he started crying when he saw all the kitschy shots. I had only expectations that were a little worse a little higher than they should have been. Kronk is a nice character who is both good-natured and stupid, but Pacha and Kuzco were dragging it at the end of the movie. (I'll ignore Rudy ... if possible). Anyway, great movie, not my style and as they say, you always have to be true to your groove.
