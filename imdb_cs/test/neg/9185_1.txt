John Candy was a very comical actor. His death was a tragedy and we miss him a lot, but WAGONS EAST, in which he plays a rogue who agrees to take a group of pioneers from the Wild West, is even sadder. I don't understand why it was even released. The story is absurd and weak and there are no jokes. It makes me even more sad that the last Candy movie would be his worst movie. So let's forget about all this and don't forget it in his better films, such as SUMMER RENTAL, PLANS, TRAINS, CARS and UNCLE BUCK. <br /> <br /> 0 of 5
