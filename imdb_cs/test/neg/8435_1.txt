This movie starts as if it was a comedy. It almost seems that the actors read the starting cards, especially in the airport sequence. William Smith plays the role of "Caribe", a hunter who is quite twisted and upset. Smith always seems to play villains, such as "The Ultimate Warrior" (1975), and "The Frisco Kid" (1979), to name a few, though in this movie the rogue role seems ridiculous. This is one of those films where unnecessary things happen only to fill the time on the screen, such as the Girl's Chase at the beginning, and the long silly races of motorcycles. I give this movie 1/10. I'd like to see this movie at "Mystery Science Theater" that would be fun.
