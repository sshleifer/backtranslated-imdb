I don't know what this Hasidic movement was about? I saw this movie a year ago. Am I an Orthodox woman living in Orthodox Hasidic? community And I can tell you that I was offended by this movie! It's so far from reality, it's scary! The director could hire at least one Hasidic Rabbi to briefly consult a "Realistic" ultrortortodox movie! For example, Meir's Davening! Or Jewish wedding, or Mikveh rites (ritual bath). <br /> <br /> The film is loaded with technical inaccuracies. It's a spiritual party. Orthodox are depicted next to the Taliban. The woman is helpless while the men are the ultimate rulers! Please, no one can force a Jewish girl to Chuppy against her will! We, Orthodox, also live by law (Halacha), which clearly states the responsibility of man to his wife. No beatings and no rape, too! And no man (nor rabbi) is allowed on a woman in Mikveh. \ TAnd Balanit doesn't put his hand on the woman's head while she is doing a ritual bath, the idea is to dip the whole body at once! The director was clearly trying to bash Ultra Orthodox! But could he do it at least in a nice and educated way? Love Story? Cute! But not trusted. Dialogs are long and boring. The end sucked totally. For all those drama I was at least hoping for a nice ending, for all that session I felt I deserved! Obviously, somebody tried to make nice consciousness a soothing film for less attentive Jews, or perhaps for non-Jewsâ€¦ (look at those fundamentalists, they are so bad and mean ...) and succeed! Long thing short: She hoped for a nice Europien (Kane level) movie, instead of a tradition that is unrealistic, misguided by junk. Today we live in a time of free will like never before. Everyone has the right to choose. Malka chose a rock singer. Many people from the unobserved environment are choosing Orthodox Judaism these days. Because in this insane world, religion can be a nice gateway!
