Doesn't it look a little intimate? Wait, that's right .. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been made in the TV series. What is the point of repeating yourself, can you ask? Is it for the benefit of Americans who have not seen the program? Did the screenwriters get inspiration? Or perhaps everyone on the scene suffered a sudden amnesia attack and forgot that they had already covered this land? Either way, for someone who was sitting in the first three series, it was really boring. I had to turn it off during the 'tablets that turn your green green' part .. Yes, it's very funny, but give us something original for good sake! Actually, if the best new thing you can come up with is Leonard Rossiter's take on Saturday night fever, you can forget it. The guy to replace late Richard Beckinsale is a lookalike okay, but not half the actor. Personally, I would exorcise this role as a sign of respect for it. Or better yet, not bothering to make a movie at all, and just letting the merry television shows speak for itself. But no, they couldn't do it ... not as long as there was money. Really. 4/10
