LORD PROTECTOR is a fare for children but for which children? Apparently shot for TV or STV, this amateur rehash KRULL has several stock characters - a magician, a killer, a warrior, a scientist - on the trail of something or another to defeat the Dark Forces to be dissolved on their planet. Poorly written, acted and staged in available California locations such as city parks and ranch, the LORD PROTECTOR has nothing to recommend, nor a time loss. Jay Underwood is the only "naming" actor, and most people, especially the intended audience of five years old, are not likely to remember him from such an ancient Disney tariff as NOT QUITE HUMAN. An unidentified actor playing a magician in a badly fitting silver wig at least plays with a tongue firmly on his face while those around him behave as if they were in KING LEAR's evening theater production. I was hoping at least for a decent event or special effects sequence. Unfortunately, the action sequences are pathetically staged, and the few special effects are those old-fashioned painted over cartoon gags we saw in the fifties and sixties of fantasy movies like Bert Gordon's The MAGIC SWORD. The creators planned a sequel that had never mercifully come. Often, such cheap Hollywood back-lot productions use a combination of legit and porn actors. I stayed during the seemingly endless running time of the movie and tried to find out which one was in this movie. I didn't have much luck.
