This movie is really low budget production, but I'm not going to say anything more about it than it was already covered. I gave this movie a low rating for the story itself, but I met the director the night I saw the movie and he gave me another reason not to like the movie. He asked me how I enjoyed it and told him it wasn't easy. The main objection was the lack of foundation for the relationship between the two main characters, I never believed they were close. I also told him that the scene in which the main characters were presented as children who became friends was too late in the movie. <br /> <br /> He told me that flashback scenes were not in the original scenario. That they were added because he felt like I was doing it, that the two main characters didn't seem to be close. He continued to explain that these scenes were not filmed to his satisfaction because they were money. I agree that they didn't do much for the film. Another fact about the movie I wasn't aware of is the actor who led the script based on his personal experience. This is usually a bad step because some writers do not take into account the viewer's emotional response. The story is so close to home that the writer has too many assumptions when it comes to the audience's reaction to his own tragedy. And the story is tragic. However, it didn't work for me as I never cared for any of the characters, least of all the leadership. What was presented was two evil people who made money, no matter who was hurt. When Mrs. Young's character decides to give up evil ways, she seems to be doing it because she's ineffective, not because she knows she's wrong. If the film has a message, then I think only the writer knows about it.
