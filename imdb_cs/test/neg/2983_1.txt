This was undoubtedly the WORST movie I have ever seen, but once I started it was like a really bad car wreck on the side of the road - you can't help it, just look. My eyes !!! The game was terrible, production was terrible, filming was terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible. I was glad the priest was chopped, I'd like to do it myself because of my respect. I mean tenth power. I'd like to cheer up if Chris just turned in front of them. And what about the crazy wig from hell on the head? I sincerely hope that no one will get paid, I think that if we were to be paid here, we should pay to never try another film project, everyone involved, never, ever. That was just a huge piece of waste I was embarrassed to say that I had to keep tracking to the very end. Don't look at it, it's about an hour and a half of your life that you will never return, and then you will have to spend time registering on this website to post a comment like now that you need to do. to do as a catharsis in order to survive aftershocks having viewed this film (and I use the term "film" freely here).
