How to begin? I saw The Italian Job for the first time a few years ago and I couldn't remember when I visited a rental shop why I felt bad about it. Now I'm doing it. <br /> <br /> After voting for this movie, I saw statistics. This film obviously appeals to fewer than 18 girls. No wonder. They didn't have enough to pay Charlize to flash and I think some girls magazine rated Mark Wahlbergs abs "AWESOME". In addition to being completely predictable, the actors are mainly B-stars forever, and even the good ones are terribly exploited, the film is filled with obvious product placement and imagine it: it can even be repeated without continuing ! The first 15 minutes is the best part of the movie and it's all downhill from there, and once they've found out, they decided to finally use the best hour at the end of repeating the detail of their golden robbery. All in all, a lot of noise about nothing. I think Charlize Theron is good and Ed Norton could be more than he was before. Unlike Donald Sutherland, who appeared at the beginning, I would say that this film should have a "pass if you are over 18" all around it.
