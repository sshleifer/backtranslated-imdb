Terrible, terrible, terrible times hundreds didn't start describing how flipping is "Biggest Loser". Imagine it: take two fat couples with nothing to say, humiliate them, and let them work to lose weight, all on the TV screen. Am I the only one who thinks it's not something IQ people want to watch in a 3-digit space? Everything stretches forever, with pieces of lard about how losing weight will mean so much to them and their lives. Does anyone care? Does he think we care? Does it matter if we care? Probably not. I think I'm going to crush the video and sell it to some big TV company. If it goes for TV, then it can be my workout!
