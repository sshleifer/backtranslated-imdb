I didn't hear about Soap Girl, but I saw a five star rating poster from the Film Threat Outside Theater, so I thought how bad it could be? I soon found out. My God, this movie was terrible. The most wooden gaming I've ever seen outside porn movie. Absolutely agonizing dialogue. I just can't understand how it was done and why someone agreed to be part of it. And it's totally incomprehensible to me that it was actually shown in the theater and the money was charged to see it. How did it happen????? And most importantly, what happened from a movie that is something else?!?!?!?!
