This 1988 film was recently featured on a cable channel. We wanted to see another movie that was supposed to start, but because the mix, Rent-a-Cop appeared in that time slot. We never saw him when he was commercially released, but we had a chance. Bad decision. One wonders what owned people behind the picture to go with "Rent-a-Cop" or how they sold the studio for distribution. This movie seems to have failed in time. This film adds nothing new to the genre. It is completely predictable, once the basic assumption is shown, we know how it will end. Burt Reynolds plays a wooden church. This actor can do better, but who knows what's going on behind the scene, or perhaps the direction that Jerry London gave him, has the opposite effect. Mr. Reynolds has one expression throughout the film. He doesn't register any emotions at all. Lisa Minnelli, as a hooker who witnessed an original defeat at a Chicago hotel, makes no sense. The romance between her Dell and the Church seems false from the beginning. She and Mr. Reynolds play one-dimensional characters. Don't waste your time with this turkey.
