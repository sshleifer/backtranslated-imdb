My guess is that the producers of this low-budget space / horror movie wanted a serious film, but the director had his heart on parody. So ... that's what we get. Set in a deserted spacecraft for 1000 years in the future, he glanced through figures and props from the 1990s. Set is an industrial complex, maybe an oil tanker. They are used by AS IS, so the controls consist of shelves of old TV sets. One of the places is probably lunch staff and sports old television and video recorder, as well as a water cooler with a plastic carboy. Tiny Lister and Coolio get the best lines and argue over the story. The dialogue is full of terms that are still very dated today ("A-OK, Daddy-O"), but then maybe the 30th century is very retro? When the captain declares that the cargo is a cargo of coffins from the "Transylvanian Station", you know that's all that's well. It's a little Alien, part of JasonX, shameless rip-off of all the best science fiction and horror titles. At one point Casper VanDien even tells his pilot to "do so" with a straight face. This movie would be better if they just let everyone run with satire, but they would still try to make the story serious. By the way, not a bad killer of boredom unless you're too picky. FX are as good as sets are bad.
