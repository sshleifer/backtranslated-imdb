Why isn't it good when the first one shuddered? Try to try to replace Rodney Dangerfield with Jackie Mason! Please! This is like replacing Beatles Wierd Al. Randy Quaid is the only one to save this movie from scratch. <br /> <br /> Don't let it stop you from watching the first movie that was excellent.
