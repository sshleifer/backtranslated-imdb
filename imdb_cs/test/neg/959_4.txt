Interesting land, but painfully boring. The script is missing ... lacks acting. For me, this film compares "Made for TV" movies. I was lucky to have survived the movie without falling asleep in popcorn. I watched this movie with my family. It's pretty safe to watch with your kids. (Only 1 Sex Scene Semifinal) If you want to see a young Mega Ryan ... check out this movie. Very 80-h. You will enjoy this movie if you like the combination of depressed people for Christmas, booze, super glue and tar. Or maybe you're like me ... and I have a higher standard for playing in movies. However, I liked the way the movie started and ended! Mark.
