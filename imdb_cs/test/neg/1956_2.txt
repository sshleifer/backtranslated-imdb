Jack Frost 2 is out of question, I am actually surprised that people can do this kind of movies. As Sam and his wife take Tropican for a relaxing Christmas, Jack returns to kill himself for fun and revenge with inbreeding ... <br /> <br /> Don't take this movie at all, Most people say its laughing with their friends, but honestly its a waste of time. If the people who made this film can get a job by doing what they do, they can at least take the time and effort to write a better story, especially cheese-like names.
