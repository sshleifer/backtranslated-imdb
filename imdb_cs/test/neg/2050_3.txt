An exciting horror movie that looks like a soap opera has disappeared about drugs that send you into a world of fantasy where strange creatures lurk. The film has some good pictures, but its special mix of what is real and what is nowhere. Worse are the vague statements in the voice of one of the characters. It seems to announce a more serious, meaningful film, but I don't think they even got into a serious or meaningful territory to start trying to sell the meaning that comes silly. There's not much to say, people are talking, taking drugs, having visions ... they're talking even more. It's not as bad as absurd and boring. The blunt is the sin and the reason you want to avoid it.
