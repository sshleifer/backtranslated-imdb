Italian rip off Mandingo and The Drum are poorly dubbed Italian life on a plantation yarn. Many people who do not seem to belong to the American South wear poorly decorated costumes and travel to places that look like the American South. The story has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman, the jealousy that follows, and the subsequent tragedy. The film promises hot sex and a lot of twisted violence, but nothing that comes from it all happens. It is probably racially insensitive because I am artistically bankrupt. The ultimate twist is at best ridiculous. The main turkey.
