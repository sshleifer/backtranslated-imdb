If you've taken all the stock elements of the Shrek movie (grumpy ogre, annoying donkey, cute pussy, compulsory dance number, etc.), put them in a blender and densify for 20 minutes, you should mess this up. Painful to watch; Maybe I laughed once. The story and dialogue are rushed beyond understanding, with voice actors sounding like they called in their lines. The last revised rendition of the poem "The Christmas Story" seemed to be written by the commission in five minutes. And boy, little Eddie Murphy goes a long way. With his desperate attempt to be modern and modern, this show will be outdated and forgotten while the classics like "Grinch". it will remain timeless. A sad waste of effort by all involved, a real "jumping shark" for permitting Shrek.
