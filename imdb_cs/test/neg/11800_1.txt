I borrowed it by accident. I picked up the video and looked at my back and thought, "Shameless Blair Witch rip-off". Then, at the moment of negligence, I caught the 'Francisville Experiment' because I thought it was something else. My horror at coming home and realizing my mistake was much more frightening than anything this movie offered. Boring characters, bad gameplay and the feeling "we've seen Blair's witches project and we could do the same" have gone into action to the point where you will be forwarded quickly. I am not one who would make the filmmakers lazy or desperate, but after this yawning-fest I felt there was a need to warn everyone: don't waste your time, you have life.
