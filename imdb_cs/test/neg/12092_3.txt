First of all, what's really great about this movie: <br /> <br /> - Ryan Reynolds, great actor! There are very few actors I really like, and now he's one of them. He has an amazing ability to impersonate characters. <br /> <br /> - Soundtrack! Very good music played at the right time. - The idea of ​​nine lost in their own world, unable to leave. Yet, I only give it 3 out of 10 for some shortcomings: <br /> <br /> - Horrible second part. It seems the director was very eager to do something new, but despite the effort it was really boring. I couldn't stand up to her - that meant it was always uncomfortable. It represents everything that is wrong with an American woman. <br /> <br /> - Terrible explanation of numbers. The director was so busy developing the character that he completely lacked the meaning of a good story. brr ... horrible! This film had great potential. Shooting is pretty done, music is really good, but nothing more. You see it only if you're a fan of Ryan Reynolds, or you have a lot of time.
