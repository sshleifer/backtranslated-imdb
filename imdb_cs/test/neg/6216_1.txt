I don't remember, at least in the last ten years, a movie that I liked less than Mia's mom. From non-existent acting to furious singing, I crouched at least once a minute. I do not believe I could recall one brief segment that I tolerated. I know I'll never follow this catastrophe again. I can't believe that with such high expectations thanks to the talent - Colin Firth, Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, the movie could be such a flop. But to see the lack of acting skills shown, the seemingly drug-induced dance, and then the horrors of horror, to hear the singing of Pierce Brosnan (!), I can't see how this movie doesn't get into the hall of shame. Definitely, a film that should never have been made, and only in case you missed it for the first time, the one I will never follow again.
