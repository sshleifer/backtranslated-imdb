This film was like a meeting of people who were in other movies and decided to make a really bad movie. She had a dude from "Detroit Rock City", a girl from "The Cosby Show", the mud who kissed the chick and bought the sausage at "Sorority Boys" and there were more. OK, that doesn't make a bad movie in itself, it was just something I noticed. The whole thing with a hooker and a French girl who has the same name was stupid and the thing with 37 people who wrote these notes, and if you think they will mix ..... pretty shocking ....... you called it. And the wallet that was just stupid. It was so bad that I was watching the movie in two parts and still got to the 50 minutes mark. If you watch and expect "Van Wilder" or such a movie ..... No.
