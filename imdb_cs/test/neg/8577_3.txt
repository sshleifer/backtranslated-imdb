This is a stereotypical chart. A young fighter tries to enter the competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his combat school. This leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally finds a strange new master who would teach him to fight. The fighting is not high. They are too "simple" to make 1 + 1 simple for all adults. The fighter trains and enters the ring, but doesn't do what he trains and gets his ass. Coach shouts and does it without success. And after a few more ridiculous bits, he suddenly does what he tells him and hits his opponent once. This results in a turning point, even if our hero beats his life until then. Think about Rocky movies and you'll have a good reference to how much it beats. Fights are also shot badly. The final thing that screws this movie is is a silly romance. Cheesy music and unpleasant moments are not what I call entertainment. These guys really did some good fun, but the director wasn't up to the task. Or other crews in my opinion. Maybe they had a small budget, I don't know, but what matters is that this movie is bad and deserves a rating of 3 out of 10.
