This series has a classic story and makes it garbage. Somehow, Robin is mystified by elk-man in the forest and is involved in all kinds of druidism and direct satanic episodes. The story is more about how to avoid an evil sheriff than to help the poor. This is hardly noticeable. And on top of all the ridicules, they kill Robin at the end of Series 2 and replace him with another actor. Some people may like this show as a fantasy show, but it's not a Robin Hood show. If you want Robin to fight in the name of King Richard against Prince John and the Sheriff, and if you want Robin to feed the poor and oppressed, watch the classic series or the latest from the BBC.
