This P.of S. was highly recommended to me by two friends who have a great <br /> <br /> (like my) taste in the movies and have seen more than I know. I have no idea what they saw in this movie. Sadistic, cruel and repulsive is fine in a fun movie, but this is an effort for a windbag that is trying to pass as a highbrow lowbrow movie making.Or is a lowbrow highbrow? Ancient Generation Gap Clich√© "No Redemption of Social Value" comes to mind Bill Pullman tries, maybe a little hard, and with the exception of the boy, the rest of the acting seems self-confident and lame lame. Save yourself and watch "In Cold Blood" and "The Hitcher" double. <br /> <br /> As someone said, this would never have been done if Jennifer Lynch had not been overrated by David Lynch.
