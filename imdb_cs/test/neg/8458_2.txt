I once thought "it came from Hollywood" was the worst movie I've ever seen, showing horror, science fiction, crime and drama movies. Of course I haven't seen THIS beauty yet. What's wrong with "Terror in the aisles"? Four Things: <br /> <br /> 1) Most of the great moments in the history of shock cinema are believed to have started in the 1970s when directors such as John Carpenter and Brian De Palma came. And what bones are thrown into real classics (ie Black and White movies) like "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Wolf Man" are either displayed alongside Martin and Lewis or Abbott and Costello next door or not at all! br /> <br /> 2) The clips are usually so short and original that they give the viewer a real shock and do not make sense to those who do not know them (really, the moment when a shark jumps out of the water at Roy Scheider) in "Jaws", a lot of the gag effect is shown, while in the original context he had power. 3) We really needed Pleasance and Allen in an audience reminding us that "it's just a movie" or that most of the horror violence "is, unfortunately, against women"? So, is it an indictment against filmmakers for adding those scenes or movie visitors returning to theaters and constantly watching the same kind of feed? We're sorry, it's all wormworms that can open up for a more deserved film. 4) And most importantly, why is the film so SHORT? It's not like there's not enough of these kinds of movies to use. If they just opened their resources and used EVERY available movie, they could have a movie "That's fun!" That would be much more fun. Hell, even pull Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing (Cushing was alive, mind you) and even better, Vincent Price would be more than willing, I bet! What a joy it would get from the audience! But no ... all we have left is a grim little movie that pretends to pay tribute to these movies, but all it does is leave the viewer feeling cheated of less than 90 minutes with which they could go and watch the movie REAL. Don't get me wrong; it was good to see what clips showed up, but if they could do more with the goods! Two Stars. Another good idea left laying "in the aisles".
