I don't see how this waste got on the shelves in the movie store, it's not even a real movie! It was incredible, I and a group of friends decided to watch one night and it was just the stupidest thing any of us ever saw, I couldn't believe it! We watched for the first 15 minutes in full respect that somebody really thought about it and then got into the movie. Are they on crack? My guess is yes, in huge doses. I very much doubt that anyone would like this waste. Is it supposed to be science fiction or comedy or what? I don't think the idiots who took care of it just decided to make a film about anything and see how many cocks they could look at. Well, we'll put something on the film, so we'll take it to the movie store and see if they really put it on the shelf - no, no, no. This is not a movie. It's about watching wooden puppets that move and read from the book, it's so bad. I feel like I want to go to a movie store and complain and get my money back, no one should endure this bullshit. So I'm here to warn you - DO NOT ACCEPT THIS FILM, it's the stupidest thing you've never seen before!
