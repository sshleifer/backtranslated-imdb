With such a hopeful cast and director I heard great about, I was totally disappointed with this film. It started with the symptoms of a great epic gangster story and turned into a totally confused mess with many unanswered questions and some utterly ridiculous and meaningless scenes (and yes, I was watching the full version). I love Robert DeNir and as usual did great acting work, but in all my other gangster movies, no matter how many people she kills, I've always respected his character, but in this movie he was a drug addict. , the rapist without the care of anyone but himself. James Woods, another great actor, has written quite ridiculous scenes for him. I thought that the part where Robert DeNiro called him mad and jumped out came entirely from the left field and at the end the writers simply threw into this random commentary about his father's death in a nut house, and that's why James Woods didn't do as he fool. So much was developed in this movie. We also never find out who the beginning men are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out more about the character of Joe Pesci. The writers seem to have thrown together about five different stories and never told them anything. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were small children. The story went smoothly in this part of the film and the kids did great acting. Overall, I was totally disappointed with this film and I don't see anyone comparing it to Godfather 1 and 2, or even Goodfelly. I am sad that I missed four hours of my life and watched this movie
