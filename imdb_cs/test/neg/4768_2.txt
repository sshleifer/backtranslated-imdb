Recently I have watched several Wixel Pixel and Sub Rosa Extreme movies and found a lot about them. This SRE movie looked much milder than all the others I saw. Maybe it's because it's more about comedy / horror than about horror, and maybe it's also because humor didn't get along well with me. It's a little less than seventy minutes. credits start in the last ten minutes. There are some outtakes, goofs, and backstage stuff going on while you roll credits. SRE movies tend to be short and tend to feel stuffed despite it. This is no exception, with some scenes that tend to go too long. The story includes a poor child in Christmastown, California, who was picked up by all his classmates. He had one stolen shoe and couldn't replace it, he was dubbed "Oneshoe McGroo." Because of the obsession with pirates, his parents gave him a Christmas tree with a Christmas tree decorated on his face. Many classmates are killed and the few who come together decide what happens. do. They are recorded one by one by McGroo, who bypasses the sounds of sled bells. Characters are almost all broad stereotypes, such as a nerd named Dorkus, etc. A scene in which the eccentric couple has sex; the woman is bound and blindfolded, the man wears a big paper melon on his head. This reminded me of some of the stranger sex scenes from Rins Dream. <br /> <br /> Image quality is good and there are lots of accessories. But basically a pretty stupid movie. Well, I think you can never have too many Christmas horror movies. Yet there are many other necessary holidays.
