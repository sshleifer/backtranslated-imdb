Everyone I talked to said this movie would be good and weird, so I thought I'd lend it. In the middle of the film, I was thinking about what the hell was going on and what the meaning of this film was. This film is so bad from start to finish that even the sick parts of the movie didn't bother me. I mean what come with another Volcano 2 Return Lava. I think coming to this movie is so stupid that characters are so badly developed, and the eve of Robert Englund makes the film worse, I think it could also turn into Freddy Kruegur and Spook's people. I was actually rooting for the bad guy to win that was bad. I mean, dad's a cop who didn't really care that his daughter was going through one of the most beautiful moments of his life. I mean, if my daughter were treated like this, I'd do my best to keep the guy behind the prison. It also seems obvious that Dee Snyders's character will become bad again. This is one of the worst movies ever made right there with Volcano and 8mm. Do not delay your time, you will not enjoy it ....! <br /> <br /> Grade If there was no grade on this page, I'd choose it's a bad movie!
