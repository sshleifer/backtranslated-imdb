The first time I heard about Guest House Paridiso was in the er ... "WC" after just saw the Fight Club. A small, round black circle was placed in each urinal. When the circle came into contact with moisture (to make it gently), it caused a color image to create, with photos of two stars and a line with the words "You'll Laugh". When you finished washing your hands, the circle dried up and ran out again, waiting for the spring to be surprised at the next "victims". Well, maybe this line wasn't very sophisticated, but you have to admit it was innovative. In fact, I think I can honestly say that I've never seen anything like that before in my life, and these days more than a century of cinema and marketing it's a real feat. Too bad the movie that went with him failed to fulfill the promise. I hate Mr. Paridiso and I owe Rik Mayall (Richard Twat) and Adrian Edmondson (Eddie Elizabeth Ndingombaba) for many years of laughter through their appealing TV series, whether it be Young's invention (1982-1984) ), Living Room Games Bottom (1991-1995), or even a solo piece like Rik in the New Statesman (1988-1993). In fact, he would have made 45 minutes of tv special. Unfortunately, his 89 minute film. Certainly there is some merit that I have, and I have laughed all the time over the lengthy finale that ruined the Exorcists and the robbers of the lost ark. , you have to see it a little for yourself. Often, however, the pace is lead and the sterile atmosphere is everywhere. These two stars (Edmondson, who took his usual backseat, this time due to being adequately directed) will never get to the first stage, Mayall only sporadically shows mischief that brings us to a small screen. Writers' assumption that we are already familiar with characters leads to the audience not getting them. The slight hints of depth seen in the series (eg Richie's effeminate, unsuccessful social climb) are not present here and are instead left with parodies of parodies. The Fawlty Towers charge goes through the water, complete with a drunken cook and invisible, calling for waiter "Pasquele", who is unusually rhyming with Manuel. Some of these ideas, such a hotel next to a nuclear reactor with a children's swing hanging over a cliff, are very, very funny, but in the end the frenetic step is stolen, the two are constantly looking for a studio audience that is not there, and all the "dead laughs" areas of patch with random "Comedy" music that would be dated in Carry On Film two decades ago. Paridiso brand puerile, sadistic, perverse humor IS funny, and I'm sure it will laugh ... just not as often as it should.
