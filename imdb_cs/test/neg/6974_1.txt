"Glen or Glenda" was Edward D. Wood's first attempt to direct a feature film. To this end, he chose a near and dear theme for his heart ... transvestism, the "art" of a man who wants to dress in women's clothing. To his credit, Wood tried to deal with a subject that was largely taboo in 1953. Unfortunately, Wood had neither the budget nor the know-how to film. The story opens with the prologue of Bela Lugosi, who makes little sense and then moves to discover the dead transvestite Glen / Glenda (Daniel Davis aka Ed Wood). Inspector Warren (Lyle Talbot) with the help of Dr. Altona (Timothy Farrell) tries to understand why one wants to live like this (and die). Glen deals with Barbara (Dolores) Fuller) and is reluctant to tell her about his obsession. And that's all. We see endless shots of everything from traffic on the highway to soldiers landing on the beach, scattered by wood shots walking along the same street dressed either as Glen or Glenda, and looking longingly at the women's clothing in the business window. Poor old Bela, who was lucky and friendly to wood, is constantly appearing throughout the story. I'm not 100% sure, but I think Bel's scenes were added for his name after the movie's body was finished. To add to the confusion of Lugosi's narrative, Farrell as Dr. Alton also provides off screen. Lugosi still says, adore, adore ... old, old, as well as some babbling about snakes and snails and puppies' tails. The story also deals with a transvestite who has a successful sex change operation and tries to explain the difference between this person and the character (s). Sequence dreams are ridiculous. A good example is the sequence in which someone dressed as a devil appears. Wood also gives us a seemingly raped scene with actors (?) Fully dressed, but neglecting the imagination, risqu√© for 1953. <br /> <br /> This film along with other "classics" of Wood was so bad that they became public as cult classics over the years. For this reason, they have survived to this day.
