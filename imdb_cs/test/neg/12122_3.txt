Low Budget Secrets. A rumble rips out of the darkness, and the woman sees the woman from that direction. Young architect Jimmy McMillan (Chick Chandler) discovers a dead body that disappears. A woman in a hurry, Mary (June Clyde), is associated with the scene of death; but it is McMillan who has to try to solve this case in order to avoid serious suspicion. There are six shop owners near the crime scene. The whole atmosphere of Film-Noir; but not quite. This movie is filmed enough to be a decent low budget secret / drama and it's a nice little escape. Other players include: George Meeker, Michael Raffetto, Milton Wallace and Rebel Randall.
