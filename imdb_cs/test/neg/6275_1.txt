After watching the Spielberg version of the War of the Worlds in Theaters, I was addicted to the subject. I could go back to my favorite parts in the movie, to the people who got out, people panicked, fire, to blasts, it was so great ... A few weeks later I entered the store with video, and I see David Michael Latta a version of the Worlds War on the shelf. "Couldn't have come on DVD, so fast, right?" I told myself. I read the back of the locker and instead saw C. Thomas Howell. "Oh, I remember him from The Outsiders!" So I thought it might have been an attempt. I was wrong. As soon as I saw the opening credits, I watched it last forever, I knew something was wrong. Something disappointed me in this movie and it did. The whole film was tangled like a cheese sauce that had remained in the fridge for 10 years. From acting, special effects (silly looking tripods when people evaporate, turning into orange skeletons), and most of all, it wasn't even as interesting as the Spielberg version, in fact the plot was boring, and there were only 3 scenes of doom! What the crap? I ended up so boring that I had to go through the film forward until I found something interesting. And nothing really was. <br /> <br /> My advice: Don't touch this movie, stay 100 feet away. Spielberg's version comes out at the end of this month, buy it! Please, please, please! Stay away from this grass before all of us are poisoned!
