First of all, let me say that those of you who chose him "10" are just kidding and trying to get votes to a decent level ... something that this film doesn't deserve. (The only films that deserve 10 IMO are the classic ... Godfather, Shawshank, etc. See the most successful films of all time for a complete list.) I also noticed that many people gave it a positive voice for being so realistic what it is inside the cave. Although I would have to agree with them in the neighborhood, they just don't evaluate the film as a whole ... they're surrounded by the surroundings, but they don't have a complete overview. That would be as if I voted 10 for "From Justin to Kelly" because I think beach scenes remind me of what the Florida Keys is ... though it may be true, it doesn't deserve a movie 10 because the whole was rancid. I wish I could tell you that this film has been saved, as usual, when one thing stinks in a horror movie, something else rises or devises a weakness. (Ex. - Bad actors are overshadowed by a big conspiracy and / or great camera and scenery.) We started with the DVD and it all started quite normally. We started to make fun of who will be the first to die ... after a short ride and hiking they set up a camp for the night. At that moment I was writing down some of the things that made me tune the rest of the movie. Two main problems I had: Bad effects and an even worse story. The first thing we all noticed was that the campfires were not real ... you could clearly see the "cgi" or the false flames everyone was sitting on. For a horror movie that would have such a glaring effect, it should tell me what I was for the next hour. A few minutes later I was shown how badly written the movie was. I don't remember exactly how they arrived, but basically we find that the "Nerd token" writes a cave exploration book, etc. Another person in the group wants to tell the story of the experience, but hesitates not to want this story in his book. The author convinces and convinces the other that he will not give the story into his book and that he can trust him. (Direct quote: "If I tell you the story, you will definitely want it in your book.") At this point I was fully expecting a nice 5 minute story that was accompanied by flashbacks and cordial talk. What I got was a short, badly said (and acted) statement. I say a statement because what was over was about 10 seconds and 5 sentences. I don't remember exact quotations, but basically she says, "We were in a cave, the cave flooded, the girl died when our friend watched her drown." You may think that I was exaggerating and I was really critical, but it is not far from direct quote, line for line, from the movie scene. Over the next 50 minutes, the film takes place in a cave, and although lighting is what I would imagine in a cave, I could really do it without really having a fuzzy / fuzzy look at the movie, And camera shaking is just what I didn't do to go for. (I have a really good vision and after watching the main parts of the movie, I felt like I was legally blind.) I was emotionally separated from this movie, so the parts that were supposed to be scary were not. Maybe I would be able to overlook the very slow and poorly behaved start of this movie, at least I would be afraid, but I don't remember anyone even twitching in some "action" scenes in a dark room. The last scene was probably the one I'd never forget, and that's not a good thing. Basically, two women are trapped in a nude room. "Monster" comes to attack / kill women ... he is stopped when he sees the image of a little boy. We go back to where we find that the "monster" was injured as a little boy and spent his whole life in a cave. Cut back to the present, and he takes his "mask" (a large skeleton with what appears to be a deer skin shirt). He looks at the picture, and both women seem to have found the weakness / softness of the cave man. At that moment he stabs and kills one girl, then continues to rape the other woman, rather graphically. After about 30 seconds, when the camera rocked and shook as he raped her, threw credits, the film ended. Honestly, if I had to do it all the time and wasted my money on renting this movie, I could save and watch the first scene and the last scene of the movie for an hour, and I kept the same thoughts on which I have now. Those of you who compare it to Blair Witch are the way if one of you reads how the director and writer ran, shooting Blair would realize how revolutionary it was ... handing over each member casting day / night shooting scenarios without other members knowing what other actor was doing is a genius. If the IMDb left me, it would be a negative score ... I don't understand how someone in their right mind can recommend this movie.
