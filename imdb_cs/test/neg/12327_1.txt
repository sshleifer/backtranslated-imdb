Audrey, I know you really remember your husband's memories of Ted, but PLEASE, do his justice and keep his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his life for a very good reason. We ask you to stop paying for his stories, pictures, fantasies and characters. They are still disemboweled by the powers that are from Hollywood and Broadway. Tomorrow's children will be trapped in these historical and grotesque interpretations that will forever pollute the loving warmth and innocence of his books. It's actually your property as you wish. I just want you to listen to the advice of others for a while. Save what's left of Dr. Seusse. Thank you.
