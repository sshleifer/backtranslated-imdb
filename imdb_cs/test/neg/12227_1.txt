We came to the theater late to see the Rendition, which was our intention, and 'Comebacks' was the only movie that hadn't started yet. I had a clue about how bad the film was after reading the short blur at the box office. The theater was empty when we arrived, and only two other people entered before the film began. . Think about all the football movies that have been made, and millions of dollars of schools and fans spend every year on football and realize how mature it is to be parodied or lapatoned. If you add Texas to the mix, you should come up with a sports version of 'Little Miss Sunshine', not with a great yawn. The first movie that came to mind when we left the theater was "Can't Stop Music" For comparison, it was "Can't Stop Music" without Bruce Jenner, Valerie Perrine or Village People. If the movie had one love note, he saw Matthew Lawrence grow up.
