This movie is a store on the success of the 1975 hits, and it's a cheap story of a plantation where Massa descends with slave women, and Missus descends with great black shame and also with the son of massa'a. In fact, there are so many things happening that I don't really know why someone bothered to dress up. So, if you want to see the white women who roll their naked bodies. To slaves, or just like a movie with breasts on display every five minutes, then this is for you. There is a funny / sad story here, but it comes up to the very end so that it does not interfere with all the hot sweaty sex going on the plantation.
