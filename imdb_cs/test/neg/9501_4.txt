Underwoods a goofy story about a young man (Arquette) who convinces his friends to kidnap Frank Sinatra Jr. (Nicholas). The film is ridiculous, the direction is strange, the dialogues are in place and mixed, the actors did not do justice, Arquette is uncomfortable, Ian Nicholas did not exist, Macy was decent, but just because hes a pretty good actor and apparently just trying to make he did not perform this project with utterly embarrassing performance, at least tolerable. This is a silly movie in my eyes, sometimes boring, not funny, just a movie that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. IMDb Rating: 5.5, my rating: 4/10
