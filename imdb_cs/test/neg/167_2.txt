In fact, this film is so poor in its desperate attempts to make it "feel good" and random, that it truly watched me. I can't imagine how the inner circle of the Norwegian festivities and press would feel like trying to pretend that he liked it at the premiere wrapped in stars. His great media reviews are an unpleasant example of how ridiculous is the small and inbred Norwegian media scene. If a foreign film of this quality got to the silver screen, it would get the rain of rotten tomatoes that it really deserves. The combination of literally amateur actors, home-style visual effects, annoying dialogue, painfully inactive working class humor attempts and a too cozy and senseless conspiracy make this film a top floor film. Keep away.
