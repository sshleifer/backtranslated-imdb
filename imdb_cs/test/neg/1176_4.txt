I watched this movie pretty bemused. I'm not sure if it's trying to be a horror gore fest in a Rob Zombie affair or exploring real events. <br /> <br /> He lacked the mark in both cases. It's not historically accurate because the characters are sliced ​​and changed for the story. Performance was neither convincing nor bad. <br /> <br /> For me, I would prefer a more psychological approach and this film could easily go this way without damaging the overall effect. .
