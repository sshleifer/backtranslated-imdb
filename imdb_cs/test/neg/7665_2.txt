"Airport 4" is essentially a sloping mess for Universal Studios to try to create a new twist - the Concorde supersonic airliner - in the "catastrophe in the sky" formula. unintentional humor that is best when George Kennedy pushes his hand out of the Concorde window at supersonic speed to fire a gun on a hot air rocket that follows the flight path of the aircraft, and the simple fact that these silly passengers continue to return the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air. Many stars in this one including Robert Wagner, Sylvia Kristel, Alain Delon, and Martha Raye as nervous travelers. In fact, it doesn't relate to other films at the airport.
