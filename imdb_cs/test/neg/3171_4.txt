I think Homegrown is a bit of a mistake for this film - more like Plantation Grown - but it doesn't have the same circle. My guide described it as a comedy, but the miserable wandering of these unfortunate buffons is not my idea of ​​laughing belly. More in farcical thriller / drama. The characters developed well enough - the all-star cast made it oh-so promising, just a pity that the plot was obviously absurd. Ted Danson gave a great portrait, as did Jamie Lee Curtis in his walk. Jon Bon Jovi has this amazing ability to measure THC content in the front seat of his car! I think if you picked up a few things in advance, you should be able to sit in this - not for shy paranoid types of weapons.
