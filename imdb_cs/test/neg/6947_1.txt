I can not believe that. This film was a waste of my life. The name is appropriate. Love didn't throw me out of me, this movie did it. I kept watching and watching and waiting and waiting and hoping for something that had happened. And nothing happened! Nothing!! Terrence Howard couldn't even save this lame work called film. It was dark, confused, and finally I didn't get who would kill a girlfriend. The tone and tempo of the film were to be built at the dramatic high end. This only served to confuse the audience, as the film just stretched and went. If you want pure torture, watch this movie.
