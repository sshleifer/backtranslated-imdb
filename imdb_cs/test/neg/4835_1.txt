What criticizes me the most after this film is a mention of "originality." This film does not contain one innovative element. If, according to 'originality', you refer to pathetic action scenes, overclocking, gluttony in violence, dull humor and a non-intellectual scenario. Then "originality" is something that a Swedish film can do without. How Röse and Karlsson can agree to act in this bad film apology is a mystery to me. And as Eva Röse can be seen at breakfast-TV after filming this movie, it just disappoints me. This movie doesn't contain a story, the script is illogical, tough and last but not at least bad. These two young directors put together a rather disgusting fantasy boy containing violence, comics, and trivialized psychological portraits. I wouldn't be surprised if there was a DD scene masturbating in the kitchen for a microwave dinner to describe the everyday life of these two overgrown film fools acting as directors. I wouldn't show this movie to my worst enemy.
