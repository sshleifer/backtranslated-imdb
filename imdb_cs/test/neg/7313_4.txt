The credits at the end read "ALL directed by Shigeru Izumiya". This is a good way to express it, because the filming material from several projects seems to have been thrown somehow, hardly trying to make it all a consistent work. I felt like one of those music videos that are being marketed as fiction films so that they can be sold on these video ads, only that we have tradable music and live performances are missing, except for one scene that can also be marketed as a weird music video in Japan. No matter what. That makes no sense. It is also not very special visually, even though it has its moments (for example, female creatures with a "lethal powder" that is strapped to the bed base and some morphing pieces) and certainly has an industrial feel for it. I would usually call these effects artsy, but what this film offers in this regard is more than anything else. Do you remember the cheap video effects from the music videos of the 1970s and 1980s that make them look dated, like the picture in the picture flying across the screen? In this, and for no apparent reason, there are many such effects. The most detailed seeming effort comes in the form of a picture collage. These pictures look like album covers. No matter what. <br /> <br /> I don't know what's going on with the headlines version I saw. Chinese (or any of these hieroglyphs) sometimes seem to show up when nothing is said and English often does not appear without Chinese. The English talk a lot about life without death (is it possible?) And a mindless body that provides what is close to the understandable conflict between the characters in this film. One guy (scientist dude) says life without meat is death while another guy (metamorphosing dude) who claims his mind is out of his body now that he got a "deadly powder" blown into his face and that he now knows the body's secrets and what not; metamorphosing dude is visibly p? Anything. Erm, the end - all written by perception of ambiguity
