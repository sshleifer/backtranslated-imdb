A calm young man returns west after being trained in hotel business in Boston; he quickly learns his friends in Spanish-colonized Old California to expect him to fill his late father's shoes instead - that of a romantic thief known for kissing his female victims after robbing them. The colorful but stupid production of the M-G-M has a lot of talents in front of and behind the camera, but it never starts. Maybe it was fun, the second string material for Abbott & Costello, but Frank Sinatra looks lost and embarrassed. The combination of hoarse comedy and musical punctuation is hampered by poor performance (Sinatra is photographed singing in one place in the mirror, but one does not focus on his performance so much that he sees a strange star appearing in this way!). Kathryn Grayson is the governor's daughter who falls on Frank and her high soprano drilling changes her singing scenes into self-parody. In addition to Robert Surtees' cinematography and a decent artistic direction, this "bandit" remains without kissing. * of ****
