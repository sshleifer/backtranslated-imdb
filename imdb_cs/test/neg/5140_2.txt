Like the previous poster, I'm from North Vermont and I liked this movie. However, not from "Red Zone Cuba" I saw such a confusing plot. The things people are introducing are meaningless. Two of the gang paddles across the border sent the other side across the car. Why? Then they meet two other people, and at night they embark on the shelter of an evil man in the luxurious Packard. - Wouldn't two people in the platform truck make sense? Then they parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch, four fall asleep! Waking up in the morning and pulling out whiskey, of course being seen and shot, loses some of their precious cargo in the process. Then the two smugglers put the whiskey on the ship and sailed across the border. Why? Someone whose big uncle really smuggled in this area told me the only thing needed was to drive a vehicle that might overtake the US Canadian Border Patrol, which at that time had a fraction of the funds it now has. And don't let me start in the last half hour, which made no sense at all. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that Kris Kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with years.
