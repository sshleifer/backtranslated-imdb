Barbershop 2: Back in Business wasn't as good as it was, but it was just as fun. The film itself lacked the little things that took place in the original, which made it much more enjoyable. Back in business, they seemed just another worthless sequel that brought money with a very thin chart. Cedric killed the movie with a frightening eloquent excuse for flashbacks, and it seemed like a bad way to make the audience more fit. Overall, Barbershop 2: Back in Business was a sequel that was not needed without the spell of the original, soul and spark.
