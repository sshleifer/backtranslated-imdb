Wave after a wave of headless nausea - this film wants and initially promises to be unpredictable and original, but in fact it is obvious, solipsistic and implicated in a clich√©-driven dialogue that ends the crecendo of horror and cheese. Throughout the film, we are reported to have characters who are in fact very boring, and just not quite working and who plunge into a terrifying scenario, such as men in armor of suits, driving jeeps through mansions, and popping existential commonplace accompanied by Coldplay. The film has occasional humorous episodes, often not more fun than a dog playing with his genitals, which happened twice (slapstick index, rudimentary movie humor in general), but to the end, the film falls into the 'infinite abyss' of complete detritus and director's egocentric ramblings that I was forced to blur my eyes. Watch this movie at your peril.
