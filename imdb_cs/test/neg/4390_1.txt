The box is why I originally picked up this movie and rented it on the back. But soon I found out that I was deceived. I thought this movie would be like Road Trip / Eurotrip / American Pie deal. But I was wrong. This movie is one of the dumbest I've seen in a long time. An unrated version worries you about watching, but it totally disappoints you. Acting was terrible and the sound effects were only gaudy. It seemed to be a very low budget, and the whole environment was set in the same building. Go out and get Eurotrip or Road Trip instead. I can't believe National Lampoon gave his name to that. DO NOT BUY IT, DO NOT RECEIVE IT. Don't waste 2 hours of your life on it.
