I think this is an "alternative reality" teen movie ... More precisely, the type of Ferris Bueller type as a cheat ring leader. Yeah, I know it's not meant compared to Ferris Bueller, at least not in "oranges on oranges" the way, but it will be no matter what. Bottom Line: It's a galaxy away from even being a smaller classic. It's observable, even if you don't expect it. This means that the main character has some spell, but the assumption is thin because writing is simply not smart. The movie just didn't bring enough laughter, twists or tensions to keep my interest. To be honest, I continued to watch ... Watching for something to click. No. So, as stylish as it is, I wouldn't recommend this movie. BTW, it seems strange to see Mary Tyler Moore as director. It's really bad, I hope the payout was incredibly big.
