Characterization in this film is one of the worst I've ever seen. The dialogue is deceptive and clich√© to the point of extreme distraction. None of the issues faced by characters are evolving at all - they are only surface details that aim to get a point across without actually having a credible dialogue to support that point. Also, displaying Chinese characters is a little desirable - it is difficult for me to believe that a Chinese father is learning flawless English from a book (or so it is indicated in one scene) to teach her daughter. Etc. Smile Train is a great organization and it's a good idea to make a movie that resembles this program on children's life, overall, I've found the movie is more frustrating than anything else.
