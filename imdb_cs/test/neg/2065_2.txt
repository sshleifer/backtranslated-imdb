I was extra on this movie, but I wish I wasn't because of his trash. The worst thing about this movie is music, but playing, script, editing, directing and story are also terrible. The main reason for its bad is that the budget is so low and the only way to make a good movie on a low budget is to have a good script. the scenario that was supposed to be torn before the film was made is not funny, once I wasn't allowed. What made me laugh is how the makers think the most important thing is to get a movie that takes care of its total waste. The film needed a million pounds more budget and a better writer. The only reason I didn't give one out of ten is because I apologized for the one who loses a few hundred thousand when you do it and you see that at the time make sure you're drunk. ha ha
