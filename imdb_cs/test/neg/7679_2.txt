The original airport (1970) was the classic of its kind, and the first two B-film track-ups (Airport 1975; Airport '77) was traceable entertainment at best, a fun camp at the worst; but this crass and clumsy final entry lacks some entertaining value and exposes shocking contempt for its audience. It is unbearable and not good for laughter. All three sequels of "Airport" were theatrical releases that created Universal's television wing, but this is under the modest standards of his day's television movie, lavender production, grotesque casting, visual ugliness, and tasteless, unreal "comedy". The project was unequivocally condemned by the "creative" effort of Universal Executive Director Jennings Lang, who personally produced and won "story" credit. Everyone starts somewhere, and writer Eric Roth (Forrest Gump) may have, as long as it is an element of self-burlesque, as well as previous films (especially the notorious 1975 airport), but in Roth's turgid, incoherent scenario and even in the Airplane comedy nothing worth spoofing! what it does The Concorde: Airport '79 especially offensive, is its offensive abuse by professionals. The worst victim is the excessively gifted Cicily Tyson (Sounder; Miss Jane Pittman's Autobiography), helplessly confined to rebuttals involving her escorting a frozen heart transplant on an unhappy flight. The special groin kick is reserved for the gorgeous George Kennedy who is a true player despite being buried in the cast. The official mascot of the "Airport" series and the only actor appearing in all four movies, Kennedy had more than earned a starring role, and his turn in Captain's chair would be the only possible reasons for this entry other than squeezing one last grandma. In this mechanical muckup, Kennedy provides the only warmth and true humor, briefly postponesing the brilliant machismo and revealing to himself a truly sweet and tender side and his kind and heroic character "Joe Patron". Unfortunately, we must never forget how fat and old and over-the-hill Kennedy are, and the excessive handsome boy Alain Delon tirelessly calls him "Porky Pig" as part of a friendship that is completely flat. Even Kennedy's Parisian romance, the only humane part of this aircraft wreck, proved to be a mere set for a hateful joke on Patroni, Kennedy, and the viewer.
