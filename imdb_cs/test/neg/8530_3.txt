Special previews are always good. No matter what movie is what you see, the theater will always be packed with people waiting for the movie, like free stuff, thought it would be something that could be done or just lost. Either way, no matter how good or bad the movie, the audience itself will make it enjoyable. Now that he says the movie is a PG-13 pseudo-horror movie (can you really dive into the horror when the MPAA is on your back to censor everything?) Do you know that there will be trembling, laughter and breath holding. With The Messengers, the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous blasts and warnings to the characters on the screen. As for the real movie, I am sorry for those who participated in it because it could have been much better if it were correct and allowed to stretch their legs for the frightened / faded-black / show consequences of these films. Finally, we see a boring, predatory story without surprises and a few moments of real tension. The story is common. After a traumatic event, the family moves from the big city to the country to try to rebuild the relationship. As soon as they settled, the house spirits went to a reformed child with a problem whose past made it even easier for their parents to distrust whatever they were told. Of course, the baby does not cry the wolf and those who are nearby find out when it is too late. I will attribute to Pang Brothers, (directors of the respected The Eye that I would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood intervention - supposedly reshoots on The Messengers were done by someone else, but the brothers kept the credit It's a shame what our studio systems do to foreigners, especially when it was the creative independence that made the films that bring them, not the interference between them, for having a truly adaptable style and keeping the tired plot of the plot fresh. Like why I don't like what lies beneath him, I couldn't stand the tense tension that goes so far as to be ridiculous.When our heroine and her brother stand in the hallway with a ghost behind them, the scene lasts about eight minutes, with only static, strangely composed shots, and the depth of field sharpness that ends in a culmination of nothing. Just 84 minutes I almost thought it would work better and shorter. <br /> <br /> In addition to a very effective introductory sequence featuring the fantastic Jodelle Ferland (a strangely playing boy) and a great atmospheric credit sequence, the only thing that saves the film in front of utter garbage, is acting. Except for Penelope Ann Miller, who first thought of me what happened to her and after several scenes made me understand why I had never asked this question in those years when she was absent and Dustin Milligan, completely untrustworthy. is very strong. Dyan McDermott has a good job of trying to keep his family together in all the hard times. She has many little moments of light comedy to counter her serious dramatic role. William B. Davis (everyone's favorite Cancerman) is used effectively as an almost premonition character, unfortunately he has not used more. Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett. Stewart plays the emotions very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and Panic Room on her resume. As for Corbett, if he hadn't torn his role, the whole movie would have completely broken up. I wish he had more work to do, as I enjoyed it from underestimating the "Visitor" series? I still have to look at his first role in "Northern Exposure". able to catch up. It's a shame it will probably be best known for the overrated My Big Fat Greek wedding. If anything, The Messengers gave me a nice introduction to the work of Pang Brothers' and again reinforced their desire to look at their Chinese horror catalog. There was mood and performance; It was just a simple and empty story that needed too much padding to make a feature film. If they ducked into characters other than Stewart, it could be more effective and have more to show than ten-minute scenes. If our protagonist is the only one to be attacked, there is no tension about how far the creatures will hurt. The moments of danger did not have any gravity for them, and until the end they were really just filling. I am thrilled, however, for a free comic handed out after a special screening, hopefully the medium will allow a quicker story to be immersed before trying to surprise.
