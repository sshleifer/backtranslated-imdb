Pros: Mary Boland is always beautiful on the edge (I never cared about her extinct bark, especially in "The Women" and "Pride and Prejudice"). TOILET. The brief role of Fields is fun, although the famous billiard table scene will welcome its welcome a little because it seems to take ten minutes. Madcap antics movie, a typical period, are great. Also, a nod to the beautifully grounded hotel lover, Alison Skipworth; I'd like to see her more (reminds me of Maria Dressler, another person who deserves a high praise). Minions: Gracie Allen. An irritable, indecent presence whose anger failed until Adam Sandler came on. This almost falsetto nasal saturation with an unknown origin has aged in her first scene. This is the first Burns-Allen movie I've ever seen, and while I (as a big classic comedy buff) try to experience at least one movie with every major comedy star, it's definitely one team I won't call again. Her timing and interpretation of the material is completely gone. Poor average talent. Point: Comedy OK, but gags are few and far away. And in just an hour you can expect it to be a Class A Hollywood comedy. Recommended only for Boland and Fields fans who want to see all their work.
