Good ideas are bubbling under the Showtime surface. Actually, it's more like two or three ideas that are constantly fighting for screentime. This movie doesn't just have a cake and eat it; he has a whole bakery. Detective Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) has an interrupted drug interrupted by media and a rough, cop-slash-actor Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). When Preston's partner is shot, he angrily shoots the camera from the annoying journalist and tiff lands him in a new reality show produced by Chase Renzi (Rene Russo). In the first of the many bugs and weirdness in the movie that the injured partner has never heard of again, or is about to make the rest of the movie. De Niro's best gag is his speech to the class of little kids to open up a picture of how television cops don't act like real cops. The fun thing is how the film progresses, its character and Murphy are becoming more and more like clich√©s they are supposed to encounter. In a smarter movie, De Niro diatribe could play as an ironic commentary; Here, it just shows how really a lame movie is. While the spoof of the reality show of the police show could be fun, the team of writers and director Tom Dey (A few years ago showed a much better chance at the Shanghai Noon; seeing the movie instead) seems to be on an uncertain basis and instead of slamming the TV Industry, they really leave them out of light (the harshest thing they seem to be able to say about network execs is that they want to play ping pong at work). Russo has a glimmer of devilish delight in her eyes, but her dialogue and actions rarely match the enthusiasm of the actress. <br /> <br /> With a small amount of screen to keep my attention, my mind has begun to wander, and it is dangerous in the movie with this many holes. For example; if Showtime is so popular, why doesn't anyone seem to recognize De Niro and Murphy when they're at work? If you are wondering if their smuggling investigation and all about being on TV is broadcast by Vargas, why the hell didn't they tell him they were on their way? Then again, since he's a villain, maybe I shouldn't be surprised; this is the same joker who is very angry with a coworker for using his new supergun without consent, threatening the deal and then sending him how? Using about ten superguns to balance his entire house, of course! It's like blowing fire with a bigger fire. Occasionally Showtime laughs, but just isn't enough for almost two hours of the movie. Worse still, really clever gags suggest that this movie might have been something if they just put in a few scenario designs. Murphy mugs and interviews as fast as it can with minimal results, and De Niro looks flat bored over most of it. After a totally unnecessary fistfight between cops and gangsters (This remarkably leads to no injuries and no arrests) Russ's character screams "That's great television!" Maybe it's a great TV, but it's far from a great movie.
