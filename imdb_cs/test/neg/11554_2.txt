When I lived in the Michigan Peninsula in the mid-1990s (30 miles from Escanaba), I wanted to see this movie. It starts promisingly enough, with some superficial understanding of the U.P. life. Apparently, however, Jeff Daniels was not satisfied with the low-access approach that was appropriate for the place and people. Instead, he introduces extremely brutal humor and some wildly inappropriate mystical / supernatural elements. Although there is a good movie about this virtually unknown region in the US, it's NOT.
