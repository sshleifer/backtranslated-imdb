This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. And believe me, I've seen a lot of movies. The Incredible Twirl of Film Makes - From Extremely Bad Movie "Alien Lifeforms Populate the Earth" with a Bad Wrath of Acting, to a Film Trying to Spread Archchristian "Judgment Day is at hand, seek Jesus or should burn forever in the fiery debts of hell "The message - left me stunned after torture for 85 minutes." Even religious Christians must be ashamed or furious as they watch their beliefs broadcast. I didn't know what to do with myself as I watched the horrible act that I couldn't do a 7-year-old, just disgusting, I'm not Christian or religious, but if I were, I'd be afraid of hell. Rich Christiano showed that he was something much, much worse.
