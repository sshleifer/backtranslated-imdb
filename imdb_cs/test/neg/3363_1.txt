Jack Frost 2. The worst "horror" I've ever seen. Why? 1) Prerequisite is WELL outside ridiculous 2) Damn thing has no legs to move! 3) Escape After Full Immersion in Anti-Freeze (First Movie) 4) Get It ... He travels all the way across the ocean SALT WATER to TROPICAL to avenge the sheriff who made him in the first movie. 5) "Killer Snowballs". I still have to be drunk enough to see "Ginger Dead Man", just like his writing, Jack Frost 2 holds the distinction for the dumbest "horror" movie ever. Even overcoming the predecessor's immutability (if you can believe it!).
