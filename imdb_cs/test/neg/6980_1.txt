I gave this movie a chance just because it had very good reviews. After I saw the trailer, I thought - what an incredible movie full of clich√©s. But I decided to do it because the trailers often do not draw the film very well. What is a waste of time ... The movie is the worst of the trailer and after two hours of watching I couldn't remember one line that made me laugh. The funniest part of the movie was the parody of CSI, but it's also quite passive. I could not relate to any character or hope that they would be together because I thought it was completely stupid. The plot is extremely predictable and inconclusive. An unintelligent comedy for people who are still in high school or feel so mentally.
