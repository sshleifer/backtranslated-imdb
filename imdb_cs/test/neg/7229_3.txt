As if the world still did not have enough cheap imitations of jaws, writer Boaz Davidson decided to continue his rope-but-reasonably-pleasant creature-feature Octopus complete the rip-off of Spielberg's classic, except that they are worried about a policeman who doesn't believe no one, and the mayor is more concerned about his 4th of July than about the lives of people. Even in the hands of a highly qualified director, this derived waste is unlikely to be anything other than a hokey B-movie garbage, but with Yossi Wein (yes Yossi Wein!) calling shots behind the camera, man with a fraction of Mr.Spielberg's talent (I estimate about 1 / 10000th), Octopus 2 is guaranteed to be every bit as bad as one can imagine! Predictable and Extremely Clich√© of the Conspiracy Not Worth to Be Described in Detail (Replace Jaws' Amity Island with New York, and Bruce the Shark with a Giant Squid Eraser and Get a Gist) Though Several Points About Movie ar Certainly worth mentioning simply because they are so funny: all the octopus attacks include actors trying to create incredibly fake-looking giant tentacles that are real, which is fortunately a sight; The capital of Bulgaria, Sofia, stands unconvincingly in New York and the overuse of stock footage is even less convincing; Best of all, the silly succession of dreams that sees a rubber octopus attacking our hero at the top of the Statue of Liberty is not just a foolish stupid thing, it also contains some really horrible special effects. Davidson's script doesn't do well I don't know when to quit: there are a few points in this movie that could (and probably should) end, but the action goes on and on, with an octopus that survives a few blasts and cause the tunnel to collapse (capture the love interest of the film and lots of kids) before finally throwing the hero into play. Sometimes very stupid, always terribly technically, but never actually scary, this STV smelly can find fans among those who actively seek out film waste. However, most normal people would be advised to do well.
