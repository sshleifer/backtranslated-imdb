There are many so-called anti-war / anti-govt. Political films that start as mea culpa and end with "our poor boys get to hell, so the world sympathizes with them, it's not their fault" - a kind of thing. I was half afraid that it would be another in this style, even if it were a different subject / aspect of the same subject. I almost didn't go and saw it; I have hardly written this review in this regard. What have we got here? Egyptian gets on a secret off-shore center of torture, on American orders, but it's another Egyptian who's supposed to do torture, not an American: "see, we Americans have clean hands," and the Egyptians are bad so let them hurt their own. Oh, and that good must have been American with conscience: there are many Americans in fact, but here the concept was wrongly placed. Yes, we all know it's called Extraordinary Edition and it started in Clinton's time and is now used for reasons beyond control. Otherwise, it was very embarrassed and nervous when they actually condemned the US for being a torture party; as if the creators were afraid to go all the way out of fear of being slang like non-patriotic or anything else (look at the bulletin board! Anyone who apologizes gets a sharp heavy artillery). Torture is a terrible thing, whether guilty or not; In the 18th century, Prussian King FrederickII, he abolished it for convicted murderers - although I have to say that a life sentence for a child is much smaller than what I want to see. Well, what about torture? In fact, this film did not lead to his horror and despair. When you are under torture (now major cities come to stress, I'm not screaming), YOU VOTE ANY, THERE ARE ANY TRUTH THAT ARE NOT THAT ARE INDIVIDUAL IN A VINE HOP THAT YOU ARE PEDDLING, TO TO STOP. They DO NOT USE, NEVER LEARN AND STORE THAT they ARE KNOW THAT THEY NEED TO NEED THAT ARE 'DID'NT. Another thing that the film didn't do to the extent that the CLASS is EXTRAORDINARY, NECESSARY HUMILIATING, AND NECESSARY STAYS WITH YOUR YOUR ENVIRONMENT. It somehow changes people inside. How do I know all this? Don't ask. Re-edit: Two Things: The Arabic used in the movie was not an Egyptian dialect. It's worse than setting a movie in New Zealand with locals like characters and everyone has American accents. Also, the scary little preacher who incited his unconscious audience to violence told them things unknown to this religion that were to be led out. Nor was it ever explained that every nincompoop could become mullah / imam; it does not need any special qualifications, and that is the hiatus that needs to be cleared: many of them are acceptable because of their fundamentalist views and the great ally of the US, Saudi Arabia, finances so many of them. Thank you for this space.
