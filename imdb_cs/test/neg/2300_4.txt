The murder of Red Comyn at Grayfriars Abbey was far from one of the most horrible things ever made in the Scottish War for independence, and the fights (and killing) in churches were not unusual at all. Not that much later Robert Bruces' wife, daughter, two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed. And comparing it to the Berwick massacre in which the English beat at least 8,000 non-fighters (some, yes, in churches) is ridiculous. It's a slightly antidote to absolutely RIDICULOUS, a dreamy representation of Robert Bruce in Braveheart. Whatever Bruce was, it wasn't scary. Too bad they didn't do it better because somebody should make a really good movie of war that is so amazing that it sounds like something someone has invented from a complete defeat in the Battle of Methven to the secret return from hiding for a long guerrilla war to Bannockburn. But it is not. Poorly made and largely misspelled and acted. Very bad!
