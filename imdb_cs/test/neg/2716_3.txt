Tacky, but a mildly entertaining soft-core comedy from the early 1990s, features Xena (Sarah Bellemo), Luna (Tamara Landry) and Sola (Nicole Posey), as three teenagers in space. Xena's parents went on vacation for a few days. After her friends persistently persuaded, Xena agrees to take her father's boat on the road. The final result? They end up depleting gas in space, and crash on the planet Beta 45, AKA land. Meanwhile, teenagers Dave (Michael Todd Davis) and Jerry (Ken Steadman) came to California to stay with Dave's uncle Bud (Joe Estevez) on the beach, who lives right on the beach. Three of them ended up with our three space girls who left the crash without scratching. Uncle Bud has to be fired from his soon-to-be-sentenced beach pad thanks to Sally (Linnea Quigley) who lives right on the hill and used to be in a relationship with Bud. She is also a bikini tycoon, and is trying to win a bikini design contest for the tune, $ 30,000 .... exactly what Bud would need to fix her property so the girls decide to try to win the prize for him. And that's about it, people. Knowing that their paper-thin story was barely enough to keep a feature film, the filmmakers exposed us to a scene after a scene of endless beach parties that represented tons of extras that creaked half-naked bodies in the graceful sun. And don't forget sex. There's quite a lot. Before I go on, I have to put this film into context. It was released in 1993, long before the coming of such soft key brands such as Surrender Cinema and Seduction Cinema. Compared to these newer, sharper, more explicit movies, the 90's soft core films seem somewhat mild. When Beach Babes From Beyond was first released in 1993 from Full Moon offshoot Torchlight Entertainment, it was announced as the debut release of a label that specializes in mature viewer films. Needless to say, times have changed. This particular film genre is gone from several steamy but short sex scenes and fleeting flashes of female full frontal nudity to widespread sexual scenes that sometimes threaten to break into the hardcore area. Looking at Beach Babes From Beyond again after reading it on his 93 'edition, it is safe to say that if this same film were to be made today, there would be much more emphasis on sex scenes and less time spent on and dialogue. As for the sex scenes themselves, they tend to run cold. Our three space girls don't waste any time to cope with boys in the evening. So every couple gets a soft core scene, complete with annoying slow-motion cameras and too dark lighting. They're really not that bad, and are surprisingly graphics in several places, especially the scene between Xena and Jerry, which takes place at the back of the trailer. But one sex scene that really leaves a lasting impression and makes you surprised by the overall intensity is quite early in the movie. Sally attends a topless photo shot with three of her models posing by the pool. All the actresses in this scene are wonderful, but Nikki Fritz excels at the two of them for her huge presence. Remember that this point of her career has not yet reached the enormous popularity that follows soon. Her nude poolside leads to an unforgettable fantasy sequence where she shows her soap body in the tub and then again when she leaves the bath. Walking towards the bed towards an almost naked pumped guy in waiting, we get the full length of the complete naked scene with her almost heart-shaped back end and perfectly sculpted back. It's good that Nikki's back is so muscular that he's going to get pretty good training. Nikki spends the next few minutes totally naked with a hunky guy in different positions in a scene that is totally different than three more lovers of the scene. No dark lighting or annoying slow motion here ... just two actors in one huge bed sans leaves and covers that seem to be barely at all at all. Nikki's ecstatic body language just proves that few other actresses enjoy the shooting of sex scenes just as she does. It's really the only time Beach Babes From Beyond really delivers goods. But even without this spectacular scene, I only recommended this movie for the fact that it is quite vigilant and never boring, thanks to the incredibly vigorous and attractive cast that many of them would appear in the various straight to video features of the rest. decade.
