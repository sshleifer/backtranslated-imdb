An American boy goes to Paris after his mother commits suicide, becomes an artist, and then appears and returns to the States to do things to his former friends. I have to think that people who rate this movie so high are all X-Files fans, even though there are no aliens or serial killers. Don't be fooled, this movie blows bits. The story is disjointed, with little or no explanation of what people are doing or why. When you get an explanation, it doesn't fit into the story that went before it. What he's doing is you. It is simply not interesting for all the acting talents in the film. I spent the whole time thinking about where sex addicts would want to kill someone. Maybe he did it behind the scenes; They should have shot it instead. What is happening is the story of a confident artist who fears minor incidents in his life and wants to fix them in some way - even though he didn't seem to start. There are no particularly interesting or shocking revelations, despite the mention of the great secret in the first few minutes. He's just a man who thinks his life is as interesting to you as he is to him. It is not. I saw in little detail that Duchovny claims to have written a screenplay in a week, that is absolutely credible. The guy can act, no doubt, but writing and directing are clearly beyond his talent. Why Hollywood maintains these self-discovery stories behind me. I show up in the shower every morning, but I don't bother making a movie about it. The mine would probably be better than this one; at least there would be some nudity.
