If possible, I would give this LESS more than 1 rating. The entire film should be left on the floor. What a pathetic loss of time, money and effort! Let's take a look ... build the nicest cast you can find (which is of course in direct proportion to the amount of talent they lack) ... throw the thinnest conspiracy you can kick ... and viola! A nasty piece of waste that the director and / or producer should be ashamed to give his name. How much WORSE can a horror genre get? And don't use "low budget" as an excuse ... I've seen many great low budget movies .... in fact some of the best horror classics of all time were low budget. If you don't have the talent and ingenuity to make a GOOD horror movie, then don't ever do it for God !!!
