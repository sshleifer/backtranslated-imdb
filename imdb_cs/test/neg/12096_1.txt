This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen more than 300 movies in my life. Disturbing actors, the only bright spot, seem to be judging the anatomical prowess of female masters. After watching this movie, it is recommended that the viewer does not work with heavy machines or arrives for at least 24 hours. A bottle of Valium is also recommended, so you don't feel so bad about 100 wasted minutes of your life. The plot is nothing original, dialogue is unbearable, and even weapons seem to be partial. Do yourself a favor and go to your local blockbuster and burn copies that have about this horrible movie.
