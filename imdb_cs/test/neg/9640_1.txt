I find it terribly ironic that Hollywood's "left wing" continues to secure its bets and make these horrible lukewarm films that do not even condemn or accept the terror war. he committed a pacifist, and you hope for a total condemnation of war like BORN ON THE FOUR JULY or ALL SILENT ON THE WESTERN PART, this film will really feel like a rip. None of these soldiers actually question this war, nor any war, nor the idea of ​​war. They just apologize for having to make another tour. On the other hand, if you are a patriotic American who wants to see a story of courage and honor, this film will really feel like a rip off. None of these soldiers loves America, or even loves service. The way they tie and mourn them makes them come across more than suburban teenagers than the blue collar hard guys. It's not WEW SOLDIERS and it's not SANDS OF IWO JIMA. It's not even mindless action, and war scenes are less RAMBO and more Buffy. So Ryan Philippe can't completely carry this kind of movie. Although it is destructively sexy, in a rough business, a man's room, in a bisexual way, it's hard to imagine it as a slow Texas boy who wants to stand up and count. It's not Sgt. Croft in Mailer NAKED AND DEAD. It's more like Joel in the OTHER VOTES of Truman Capot, OTHER ROOMS. He can't sell you the idea of ​​being in battle and making his bit, OR that he wants his wife and wants her right now. She swings on the battlefield and in the dorms, looking as if she is bending over and taking a good stiff attack from behind.
