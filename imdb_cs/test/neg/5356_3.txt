Normally I applaud a movie that tries to do something different or original in the genre. Obviously, this film is a parody of ninja movies. And I really did what I could to enjoy the movie. But I just couldn't. Jokes are not funny enough! (I saw my share of Japanese movies. And most of the time I like and understand the humor used in these movies. "The Red Shadow" is just stupid!) that everything is fun. Check out the parody characters like "Hot Shots" or "Scary Movie". Everything they do on the screen is done with a straight face and never gets out of character! And because of this, some scenes become fun and cheerful. In "red shadow", actors never do. The shadow ninja should be very skillful and deadly. Unfortunately, actors don't do their best to convince us of their talents. They don't do things with a straight face. Jokes would work better if they did! Poor choreography of action scenes also damaged the viewing experience. I like humor in martial arts movies if the action is good. The "red shadow" in this department simply fails. So what's left is looking forward. Well, the music (techno) was uplifting. It had to be as if the action had never been exciting. And there are also short dramatic scenes that are good but simple. Using humor, lack of story and depth makes me think that this film is for children. But I wonder if the children really wanted this movie. Waste of time!
