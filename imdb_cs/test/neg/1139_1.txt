Absolutely the worst experience I've ever experienced. I think my eyes were bleeding. I watched after this in the evening. I don't even consider it a movie. Movies are supposed to be useful and fun. It fails. I couldn't get through the whole movie, so because the end could be the biggest phenomenon in the history of the movie, it gets 1 for that little chance. Otherwise, it would be a flat 0. <br /> <br /> I don't see National Lampoon, or let alone some organization, sponsor this cruelty. Renting this DVD is currently one of the worst mistakes of my life. Just watch it if you want to make more movies to watch. Regardless, it's the worst movie I've ever seen.
