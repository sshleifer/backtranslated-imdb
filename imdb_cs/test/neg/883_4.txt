If you read a book before you see a movie, you may be disappointed like I was. The book was great, and I was sure that when I saw a movie preview that the movie would also be great, I felt like I was watching a movie where the director and the cast didn't even read what they had. The film is short and in fact it never feels like these people were really in love and they were the only friends. Although the film did not go in the same direction as the book, at least they could feel the romance between the two characters more intense. I think both Diane Lane and Richard Gere were perfect for these two characters and have good chemistry, but they just didn't develop a long enough story for us to see how long they wanted. The book was a true love story and I think this movie could be a lot better.
