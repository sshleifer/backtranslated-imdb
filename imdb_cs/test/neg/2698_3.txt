In fact, I was watching a whole range of reviews and looking for those that gave this movie less than 5 stars. There were few and far away. Which is absolutely confusing! Yes, I know it's Disney's movie and it's not director Christopher Nolan, but good sir. This is a pointless direct trade business. They were supposed to do it and animate the bloody thing. Worse, IMDb won't let me finish my scream because my review has to be longer! <br /> <br /> The "Awesome" footage in the game is LITERALLY taken from the Tiger Woods PGA Tour Golf on the PlayStation. weak setting and big finale is boring. Besides, it was really the biggest movie I've ever seen in my whole life. <br /> <br /> Good, authentic costumes, sets and sports equipment. I said it.
