Was it a cast and a drug crew before they started shooting? There was a hole in the plot ... so big ... nothing could fill it. Since the first scene, when the star is late for dinner, was there any doubt where he was and what he just did? The tension was from there. It will take another 85 minutes for the mystery to be resolved. I have to admit that the biggest conspiracy hole kept me awake for hours, wondering how the stupid screenwriter, director, Chrisian Slater, Molly Parker and Stephen Rea could at least explain how our killer, who wasn't a lawyer or a policeman, could go into a locked cell in jail, kill your second victim, and tie it off the loop to make it look like suicide ??? I wondered if I fell asleep from total boredom and disappeared as it happened. If anyone can explain this to me, do it ... and then, why, for God's sake, did he kill the third victim? Nothing made sense ... and yet someone thought this film was worthy of official selection at the film festival. Maybe it was a comedy and I couldn't laugh.
