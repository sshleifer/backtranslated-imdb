Perhaps it is unfair to dislike the film for what it is not, rather than what it is, but I was approaching this hoping that eventually the filmmaker would make a film about small urban rural gay men and women. He focuses mainly on the outrageous bigotry (big news!) Of the locals (and those in remote areas) and the truly terrible torture / murder of a young homosexual. So much time devoted to stupid people who argue about AIDS, sin, hell and perverse. So much time devoted to ghoulish preacher ranting about the bible and gays get what they deserve. I wanted to see more people who came to the "little town gay bar", not the ones who opposed it. Besides, the young man who was murdered isn't even out of town. The whole movie works as a warning rather than a celebration, and it's very suspicious.
