I still can't believe Louis Gossett Jr agreed to appear in this movie. Everything about this movement is artificial, forced and invented. The air sequences are flat. Enemy figures look like puppets. That's just a bad excuse for the movie. At least Top Gun had air sequences that looked good (as well as external shots). But the Queen's song is great. Instead, rent Midway.
