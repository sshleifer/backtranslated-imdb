Recently I passed 8 ?? by going and seeing this movie in the cinema. It was a waste of time and the only feeling that we would get out of the theater was slightly sick of all the disgusting social pornography. It could be interesting if it was a pretty absurd twist, but it wasn't so it was just terrible with maybe one or two scenes that could be taken and for very nice short movies. Another thing I've been thinking about is the way the director uses all the Finnish stereotypes as characters. It is absolutely extraordinary how you, as director Finish, can make a film with the worst stereotypes of your own nationality. It was sad to sit and hear the listener sitting and laughing about things that they thought were typical of Finish, but generally just making fun of people.
