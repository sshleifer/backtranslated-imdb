A comedy that spoofs inspiring sports movies, The Comebacks tells the story of a coach out of luck, Lambeau Fields, who takes a haunted bunch of college misfits and directs them to a football championship. In this process, this lifelong loser finds out that he is the winner after he has bought himself, saved his relationship with his family and friends, and found that there really is no "I" in the "team"! I decided to watch an unrated version of this movie. It was thirty minutes longer, and although it may be better than a theatrical release, I hear people hated this movie. After all, thirty minutes of extra shots can add a lot of stuff to the movie. Well, I was definitely wrong. It was as bad as the recent "Meet the Spartans", but it was thirty minutes more torture! Seriously, who's doing almost two hours of spoof movie? Spoof movie is short, because if it goes longer, it would be exaggerated! Honestly, I like stupid comedies. Damn, I liked "Date Movie", "White Chicks", "Epic Movie" and "Little Man"! I think that when it comes to spoof movies, it's either a hit or a miss and it certainly missed it. On the lighter side, from the many jokes in this movie, I say about six or seven I laughed, even some who laughed out loud. But it doesn't say much. After these jokes, there were more scenes of torture and discontent. I don't see how people say it's not a horrible spoof movie. In fact, there are so many product locations like Meet the Spartans, there are so many dance sequences and unreal jokes. I will say the next thing I like about this movie are the songs. They are very good songs. Overall, see if you like spoof movies. Skip if you like funny movies.
