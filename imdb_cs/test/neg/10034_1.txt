I saw this movie with my girlfriend. It was a total disaster. You can really see that it was cheap. Wrong scenario and very bad behavior. I read several versions of a book from different authors and also listened to one version of an audio book. We couldn't take the film seriously because of the missing elements it should contain. The sighting experience was like Blair Witch visiting Green Acres. Then there were parts that were vulgar. They show that this little boy uses a bed pan and actually shows his contents. The witch throws his content on the boy and the whole family laughs. I thought it was ugly and very strange. I really can't understand why anyone would think it would be fun. This shows another scene where Dr. Mize comes and Betsy Bell is peeing in a dress on the steps of her house in front of her mother and brothers. Instead of being led by her mother, she's a brother. How sick? A little boy on the first scene of many scenes dealing with how your body is dealing with waste, asking for toilet paper and going into the house and making these scary faces happy with sound effects. I think they should have left it all. Make-up on Reverend James Johnston as an older man does not really mean that you are older. You seemed to be immersed in fish dough. The blood on Joshua Gardner, when he falls from the ladder, is even worse. John Bell's death scene seems to have gotten out of flour and tried to do something to make him look like a seriously ill man. For me it is a very unpleasant comedy with problems in the bathroom and inexperienced people participated in the fall of this image. These people would do better to film commercials for local TV stations for bathroom products. They chose a good subject and were unable to make it the right way. I rate this movie Capital F minus.
