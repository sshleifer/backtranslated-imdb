Some people may remember Mrs. Russell from movies such as "The Black Widow", which had some appeal and critical response. Boy, she really needed a loan check when she signed up for this dog to do. Yes, there will be those who like gratuitous violence and nudity. But one has to sit down and wonder what actually happened to anyone spending money and time to do it first. I just saw this movie on one of "HBO" and I can't believe they took it. In 1996, Mrs. Russel did not have the physical appeal she had made earlier in her career. Come on! With her play Ma Barker ??? Her sons seem to be her brothers. It's also creepy that you think that incestuous relationships will happen (thank God, they're not, I hope it's not a spoiler). With Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano added to the cast, this is a B-movie 'straight to video' all the way. The scenes between Purvis and Ma Barker, either personally or over the phone, are the basis of terrible, terrible action. Wait, I also forgot the horrible, horrible writing. Chalk this up to experience. Bad experience.
