Angels and Demons: 3 out of 10: Something bad has apparently happened to Ron Howard. I don't know what exactly, but something's wrong. Howard has always been a decent director of workers. While he will never be mistaken for artistic savant both Cinderella Man and Apollo 13 were excellent movies, Parenting was pretty good, and even angels and prequel / sequel Da Vinci Code was a fun romp. Moreover, none of his films were downright horrible. (I noticed I didn't see either the How the Grinch Stole Christmas or his latest film Heidi Montag says plastic.) Howard managed to keep this quality in such a way that they design genres like A Beautiful Mind. (Far and Beyond), fantasy with revenge (Ransom) and comedy about prostitution and mermaids (Night Shift, Splash). Angels and Demons are in the center of the film's wrong direction and filming. Scenes are too dark, camera angles are bad, actors block more shots, and the matter is often focused. This makes the narration of a confused story even more confusing. Dan Brown picked up a lot, but I found the Da Vinci code of a fun, readable romp (so I'm sorry). The film version of Da Vinci's code has kept the same place where they are preparing for the next atmosphere of the book and adding an attractive cast and attractive location. But angels and demons are taking place in claustrophobic space In the Vatican, and since Howard was not allowed to shoot in many real locations, we will end up with a lot of CGI run. The whole movie is like Rick Steves doing a special Vatican and instead of actually visiting the Holy City and showing his camera, Rick had to use Lego bricks and a second-hand book with all his breasts erased. While Da Vinci's code has what I think is an interesting central secret (to sue me again), the story of Demons and Angels consists of the Illuminati's actions (now angry eyes) to destroy the Vatican. Their idea was to take positions in schools for the deaf around the world and repeatedly rape every student in the ass. Oops my bad; Apparently, the Vatican needs no help. Their aim is, in any case, to penetrate the European great hadron accelerator, kill the chief priest and steal three vials of antidermal agent. This raises more than a few questions. Can Hadron Collider create anti-matter? Can you capture once created anti-matter? Why does the EU choose it? (Maybe she's afraid of a divine attack?). Why does the Vatican priest meet at the head of the anti-Semitic assembly? Now that they get anti-matter, will they use their incredible destructive power to take over the world? I am not kidding; Unfortunately, the Illuminati has not yet understood that the level of Pinky and brain is still perfect. Instead, the current Pope has died and it is a time that is secret. Top cardinals who have taken part in the final four-round tournament are kidnapped and the Illuminati kill them one by one. They are good sports however leaving footprints at each murder as some Latin themed Riddler. Oh and the last kidnapped cardinal has an anti-issue and if he is not found in time Rick Steves will have to go straight to Venice the next year to see decent frescoes. If there was some Latin motive Batman save the day ??? Well, the story is really horrible and it's wrong, but maybe it's one of those movies that have been saved by great performances. Real character study? (Okay, you know where it goes). Tom Hanks gives incredibly wooden performance and simply looks awful (he is also old to play the character for about twenty years.) His love interest Israeli actress Ayelet Zurer has zero chemistry with either Hanks or on screen. Ewan Macgregor plays the Pope's personal assistant / caban as an Irish man who seems to be about to break into the music number at any moment, provided no one steals his Lucky Charms. On the plus side, Stellan Skarsg√•rd is returning to the head of Vatican security and knowing that no deaf children have been raped during the making of this film, at least in one of the areas that overtake him before Vatican critics.
