The show is at least partially Faked (so it is not reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe at least someone without a face blurry is a mock episode. Evidence in an episode where he pretends to be stabbed The ship's crew is already there before he gets there, can be seen as his ship is approaching. Actors playing "ambulance officers" did not remove their shirt or exhibit In any case, they were injured to work on it, which in fact would never have happened. They also parked the ambulance in the parking lot and did not go to the emergency entrance (which makes no sense unless it is not fake and would not be allowed to go there)
