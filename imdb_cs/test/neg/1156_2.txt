I am a big fan of horror movies and I know a lot about serial killings. The director of this film, of course, refused to examine the film he created because half the film was fictitious. More than that, the character of Ed Gein was displayed in the wrong light. I haven't borrowed a movie to look after a deputy and his girlfriend Eric. I rented it and watched Ed Gein and his legendary story. This movie was terrible, the only reason I gave him 2 out of 10 is that gore wasn't too bad. Acting = terrible actors = sub par Movie = loss of time. Great buzz all around, but I'm used to giving up the search for a good horror movie.
