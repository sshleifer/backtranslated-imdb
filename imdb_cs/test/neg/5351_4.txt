I did not read John Grisham's "Time to Kill" and maybe it would help to understand the film better. But maybe not. I heard it's still the most faithful adaptation of Grisham so far, and if that's true, I can see why so many publishers rejected the novel when Grisham introduced him as his first work. "Time to Kill" is one of those movies that are seriously confused and wants to do too many things at once, wanting to be a thrilling crowd pleasing thriller and a movie dedicated to exploring certain social and moral issues. , these two types of movies don't go together in Hollywood, which is why "Dead Man Walking" had to be made independently. The story includes a young lawyer named Jake (Matthew McConaughy) to defend himself from a black named Carl (Samuel) L. Jackson) from the murder of two hills who brutally raped their young daughter, a day before the perpetrators' court, Carl hid in a courtroom closet, and when the rapists were brought across the building, he set off and shot both of them. a student of law (Sandra Bullock), who proves that her role in this film was totally useless, and put it in the film for marketing purposes only. Meanwhile, one of the violent brothers (Kiefer Sutherland) was angry that the black man had killed his brother and decided to take revenge. All this leads to shooting in front of the courthouse, kidnapping, brutal beatings and racial riots. I admit that I was very interested in the film, except the courtroom scenes. What I later argued was dealing with the ethical issues of the film and its use of the plot patterns. The main question the film is constantly repeating is whether the black man gets a fair trial from the white jury. Of course they can, but that does not mean that one has to be liberated to be fair. However, this film does not seem to think so. In addition, there are several gaping holes in the plot used for conveniences. For example, there is an unknown character called Mickey Mouse who is a Clan member, and, for unknown reasons, helps defense team members escape the grave dangers of other Clan members. After Bullock is kidnapped by Sutherland and a company left in the wild, this stranger comes and saves her - and NEVER find out who he is and why he helps people to be terrorized. And when it comes to the reign of Sutherland's character, it is amazing how clueless the police and the character of Bullock are that they stop him in the whole movie. There's a scene where Sutherland becomes a sniper from a building across the street from the courthouse and tries to shoot Jake when he comes out, instead shooting one of the guards. Now you think there are dozens of police officers, it would be easy to surround and capture a sniper. No such luck. From what we saw, no one seemed to care that the sniper was still in the open. Even after Bullock was rescued by Mickey Mouse, she never mentioned who he was, or even mentioned her hijacker. Why was that? Simple. The Sutherland character was needed throughout the film to provide constant tension, though logically it should be out of the picture. Apart from Bullock's character, there is another ungrateful character. He's Jake's assistant, played by Oliver Platt. It seems to be one of the reasons why his character should be in the film - several people need to be added to the audience. In my opinion, single-row foils show great weakness when using "serious" movies. It shows that filmmakers are not convinced that the story itself and the dialogue are enough to keep the audience's attention, so use them to make the audience laugh and reassure everyone that they are watching a fun movie. But pretty little movie problems. What about the movie message here? It is clear that Carl is indeed guilty of murder. We saw him schedule the hours to murder the men who raped his daughter. Lawyers argue that it was a temporary madness, etc. That made him kill. In despair, Jake asks the jury to close her eyes and detail the rape as part of her final argument. After describing everything that happened, he adds to the last line ... "The girl is white". Then we will see the jury members with tears in their eyes. <br /> <br /> In the next scene, a girl yells out, "She's free! She's free!". Wait a minute! Do juries come out of their decisions on their emotions or facts? Most of all, why there were no scenes to show the jury to decide and what they really thought after their emotions disappeared. I'll tell you why. They could not show intent because NO JURY could not free a man from such a crime, no matter how much the final arguments of defense touched their hearts. What is the message? That someone is entitled to kill when it comes to revenge for a previous offense that has been made to them? This film was supposed to have the courage to say that murder is not right in this situation, because in fact, there would be no liberation. However, as dollars were at stake, filmmakers were more interested in how to save viewers' feelings than in presenting a responsible message. If people start killing themselves as a form of revenge, the creators of this film should be responsible. This is a socially irresponsible movie!
