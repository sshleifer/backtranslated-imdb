This one was really terrible. I watched with fascinated horror and still asked, "Why did they do that?" This means that all the scenarios from "The Day after Tomorrow", "The Perfect Storm" and "Twister" have been taken over by a three-hour miniseries directed by director Dick Lowry with every catastrophic film. a clich√© that is known to man, not an ounce of real tension. Many of the cast were unknown Canadians and the filming location was made in Canada, Winnepeg doubling for Chicago, so no doubt the tax breaks had something to do with it. Although some ambitious special effects have been attempted, the execution is so bad that a decent spectacle is not achieved. Actors can be competent games; the script is so bad that no one has a chance to show it, except perhaps Randy Quaid, like Tommy's tornado, who went straight over the top and was pretty funny. Believe it or not, the producers have since made another one of these Canadian disaster turkeys called "Category 7?" the end of the world "which was very tastefully shown on CBS in the US a few weeks after Hurricane Katrina. How could Ed Murrow and Walter Cronkite do this? In prime time? PT Barnum "No one has ever broken the underestimation of public taste" has proven itself again.
