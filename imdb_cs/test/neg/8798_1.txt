OK, before we get into it, let's go ahead and get a warning of the way: this movie is the basic "movie" definition SLEAZE! There are movies that can definitely out-shock or out-disgust this film, which have more artistic validity than can be said for this turd movie. So what makes it so slippery? Let's take a look at "Wet Wilderness" ...... <br /> <br /> This "rugged", practically made in 1974, has no real "conspiracy" to talk about other than displaying it what would happen if a family went into the wilderness to rest and spend a day while in a fat guy in a ski mask controlling a machete looking for kicks ..... a kind that would end up with everyone being forced to have sex with each other while being systematically murdered by a mask. Therefore, those who are sensitive to incest topics are encouraged to look elsewhere. Then really either add a level of surrealism, or just show complete distrust of the art of filmmaking, the "daughter" of the group runs away after being forced to have sex with her brother and finds a random black dude (!) Tied to a tree branch ("... the tough sum - bitch left me here for 3 days ... ") with virtually no explanation !! Is he saved ... or is he? Of course not!! They are caught before they can escape, where our killer forces them to have sex as well, while forcing the mother to join, ending with a dead black dude (ax courtesy over the chest) when all is told and done. Then our killer forces his daughter and mother to give him oral sex when one of the women grabs a machete ....... and the movie suddenly ends !!! Just like that! No warning, no bound free ends ..... it's just the end. Now there can be a proper ending of this movie (I don't know honestly), but I only saw the extremely raw version of Alpha Blue Archives. It seems that their version is either cut out completely or it is. If it was intentional, then in Film-making 101, I'm sure there is some sort of rule to end the movie, but it shouldn't be like that! Fans of "Psycho" should enjoy hearing sound music because it's all in the movie! I would be willing to bet that no rights were licensed or anything. Also, although it is a "violent" movie, there is not much, so the gorehounds will not find anything real here. None of the violence is graphically represented ... just the results (one of the victims gets a sting of a machete directly above the vagina). Also, sex is some of the UGLIEST sex I've ever seen! The interesting thing about this movie is that it is too ugly a movie that works like erotic pornography, or can turn to anyone other than those who tend to resemble things that are poor, ugly and ugly, but not so violent, that those who seek true acquaintance are not enough. for something really brutal like "Canalibal Holocaust" or other flicks. The only "notorious" thing about this smoking pile is that violence has been added to the adult movie, a relatively new concept at that time, especially when you think of porn chic, the whole rage and grindhouse that filled 42nd Street played such things most tired group porno mavens. This was not and is not "mainstream" porn at all. If you were in a film school and there was a list of movies that could be a shining example of this lesson! This movie swill demonstrates what happens when cerebral assault filmmakers are given a "budget" (in this case probably about $ 142 ..... cuz it looks!) And ignore all "don'ts" and turn them into "do "" Yes, this movie is so bad! "One more thing: those who are insulted by racial epic are also encouraged to watch something else. obviously racist, but there is no political correctness in the early 1970s, I'm not sure that such a movie could be created today. <br /> <br /> To be honest, it won't "shock" anyone or titillate anyone but those who get ugly, actually bored, sex is so ugly and secular, it's hard to look with any sense of eroticism, so if you have a chance, thank God for the forward button! "Behavior" if you want to call it is in the best case amateur (I think it's for PORNO! If you have to see it, download it as you want it when you buy it. Some things are just so worthless ..... and "Wet Wildernes" is. The only thing that is more unpleasant than watching this movie would be to watch this movie that sits in the theater and watch others in attendance and watch it and suddenly feel dangerous. Probably not the largest collection of thinkers and intellectuals in society. But if you're on some silly but SLEAZY porn garbage, give it a crack. It's 54 minutes and still feels much longer !! Crackheads by LOVE this! Then again, maybe something is wrong with me when I was looking for it first ... LOL! Caveat emptor, sleaze-lovers !!
