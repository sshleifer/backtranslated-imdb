I just came across this movie and checked the IMDb for more information: Score 6.7, well ... not so bad. Genre: scifi ... dobrý mám rád scifi. So I got a movie and I was looking forward to seeing it on Sunday night. But not. As a summary, this is no movie at all. It is a religious ad that includes: Overtaking about Jesus, God, Devil, End of the World, etc. The film begins with the epic kidnapping story: Night, car stops, bright light and so on ... Well, it was a movie. The last of this ...... ... frankly, I don't know what to call it ... was a dialogue about the end of the world and the final judgment. Quite the same thing that these television preachers tell you, but they are "good". Honestly, if you don't want to see a scifi movie or something with a UFO, stay away. from this "thing". She has nothing to do with them. If you want to hear some cuckoo opinion what the Bible has to say and what you should do. Then go ahead and watch this "thing," but I still prefer to go to church on Sunday. This is a complete bull. (and evangelical Christian propaganda, as other users have said = Well ... I should have other red comments before I got the movie. <br /> <br /> (27% of voters said this "thing" was 10. Please go somewhere else to do your propaganda)
