Well, let's be realistic about it. No one goes to a movie produced by WWE Films (whose owner has invited God to match), directed by former pornography director (the man has given the world a trilogy between faces), to play a wrestler named Kane and expects a bit of art on a gold plate. If you do, you'll probably need to find something other than watching movies that take up your time. So what exactly do we expect from a movie like this? Here I was looking forward to: <br /> <br /> 1) Bad behavior. 2) Quite non-existent, clich√© story. 3) Kane went through a scrunched, sour face that shows that his nostrils just found a potato salad that had been badly placed a month ago. 4) Tons and tons of gore. Well, if you're hungry for some "so bad it's funny" fun then it could satisfy your appetite because it brings to all numbers. Obviously, movies like this are best seen for free, but if you decide to sacrifice money at the box office then enjoy some fun and make it a game. The creators are so nice to introduce us to each of those annoying delinquents by flashing their names and legal offenses. This will make it easier for you to write down what you want to kill and in what order You and your friends see what predictions are the most accurate. I also suggest that you and your friends write every moment of stupidity and carelessness you can find. Tally is at the end and see who comes with the most. I think my total sum was 107; can you beat it? I personally want to know how after 35 years and a fire this abandoned hotel still has electricity, running water and a work lift? I know, I know filmmakers assume that if you pay To see it, then of course you're not thinking about what you're spending money on, and that's why you're probably not thinking about what stupid it is, but doesn't mean we can't show it and laugh I also like how the city wants to turn this huge hotel (which would be condemned and recommended for demolition by any rational inspector) to a homeless shelter and thinks the best way to get it cleaned is put eight punks pair of pugs and brooms. Uh-huh. <br /> <br /> I think you know what to expect, but I feel the need to give you some warnings. First, if you hate the crowd interaction regardless of the movie then you might want to stay away. People in the audience behaved as if they were on a real wrestling show. Shouts "Kill him, Kane!" and "I hope you die first!" and "Chokeslam!" theater echo, showing what I hope is NOT the best America has to offer. I usually do not feel such interactions with the audience, but for such cheese I thought the comment added to the fun value. But I can see how others might be angry. Second, and this should not be a reason to explain, the film does not avoid gore. If you're watching the big ugly dude rip eyeballs straight out of their drawers don't shout "fun nights in movies!" For ya then you know well and well to keep your dough saved. I must say that I was a little surprised by the extreme lack of dialogue on Kano's part. I didn't expect him to go to an acting clinic, but I was hoping he would have some cute phrase like "Say goodnight" (his character's surname is "Goodnight") just before he killed the victim. Instead, he spoke four words throughout the film - "Nooooooo!" and "I see it." But hey, he added them flawlessly! If I was in the wrong movie in the movie, then it would be like "BETTS Place!" or "All bets are gone!" That would be the rule, and you know it. We need a new genre term for bad horror movies like See No Evil that make so much unintentional laughter that you almost have to mark them as comic. Feel free to send me your suggestions. For now, we'll just call 'em HOR-larious'!
