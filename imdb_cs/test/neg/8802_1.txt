This movie is bad, so bad that my mother, who barely stands for "tension" Disney Snow White, is giggling over the entire movie. My first warning should be that it was at $ 5.50 bin at Wal-mart. But in fact I found some good movies in the bin. The second warning was that when the cashier rang the DVD, it was actually $ 3.88. Again, I was never the one who ignored the cheap. This movie is definitely not meant for people who are looking for something good, and it certainly isn't for anyone who has an occasional bad movie. If you need background noise while doing something like playing cards with some friends, then do it, but if you're looking for something to truly watch or bother. It was really disappointing because there were a lot of good actors. I felt like watching a chocolate version of Willard.
