Well wait, let me get this street, there are actually some morons in this place who count that it's one of the better, if not the best Halloween sequels. I even read someone who said it was as good as the original. Pah, what's nonsense not trusting them I've watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at least a good horror movie and this shower stall is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen in my life. Honestly, if I were John Carpenter, I would have sued the one who wrote it, or went into place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels generally are almost all garbage, two were stupid, three were stupid, four are fine, five are well five, H20 fine, resurrection painful. Yet in many respects I consider it the worst of the very bad parts of the sequel. Why? Okay, let me get on some rant that is not that much of a review, but a mindless rant about why Michael Myers' Halloween 6 The Cure is one of the most abysmal movies I've seen in a very long time. OK, where should I start, yes yes plot oh boy plot. Basically, it's a conspiracy that contains cults, Thor's stamps, and other crap. It's just stupid that it really is, the film tries to be fake and intelligent yet, its accumulated in such a terrible way. Why does Michael Myers have a reason to kill people? A simple explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives, but not we have to have men in black and mysterious cults and a sign of Thor and the utter crap. God is so bad that I wanted to cry that he really did, the writers tried to add to the character of Myers, but in fact they did the opposite. In addition to wearing a mask and suit on the boiler, which, by the way, is a completely different color, Myers just isn't the same guy from the original or even two, damn maybe four. That's another thing why Myers became a parody of Jason Voorhes? I thought it should be the other way around, but Myers is so similar to Jason, all he does is endlessly kill people in cruel ways. In the original he conquered his sacrifices and as a result the whole thing was more exciting. In that he just walks around hacking people to death. I mean, in half an hour, we were dealing with the amount of killing in the original, it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seem to have a really big head, I think its huge and hes put on load weight. What else is stupid, oh yeah Tommy Jarvis's return is pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this movie are, of course, crap dr. I can't stand a small child, I wish he got it, he's really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family is a terrible group of actors. Mother's waste, brother's bad, and I mean, that was his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for the sake of the gods he was actually more evil than Myers <By the way his death is one of the most abysmal I've ever seen, I think Friday the 13th wouldn't come up with anything so completely laughing. What else is garbage Yeah yeah Tomvis Jarvis, I don't know the name of this guy, but he really can't act, he's trying his best to be serious and do it all but I just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he would actually die if everyone died, it would be pretty good. It's dr. Loomis, terribly old and dying Donald Pleasence. Despite being on his last feet, it is still a pleasure to excel in a short time. It's such a pity that such a cornerstone of this series had to say goodbye to the garbage like that. What else is waste, yeah, where does the radio DJ get it. First, how did Michael get into the van when he was in his house five minutes ago? Secondly, it was just an unnecessary killing that can boost the number of bodies, but it's just another peace of nonsense that adds to the drive that's the movie. It is actually the death that has all said that it was unnecessary much like this movie.
