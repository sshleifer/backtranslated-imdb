Hm. A rich good looking boy gets into trouble, a poor girl falls in love with him, a jealous ex-boyfriend causes tension .. yadda yadda. Actually, I laughed loudly in many parts of this movie because the next scene was so predictable and simple stupidity. As one scene moved on to the next one, I often found myself in the way we got there, as I missed a few chapters in the book. The script was pretty pitiful and didn't have me or my wife caring for any of the characters except the jilted friend. Now, if a former friend got an ax, and tore off a girl and a rich child, then .... then we would have a movie, and all the stupid dialogues and jumps on the land could be acceptable. But since this film tries to touch and completely miss a boat (and ends up resorting to the Roman equivalent of divine intervention to try to tear a tear) ... it just falls very flat. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie. Mount your nails, you'll have more fun.
