Let's start by saying I love horror movies. Big budget, low budget, big name actors, no-name actors doesn't matter. And when it comes to judging movies, I'm very forgiving. But this film is pretty bad. Actors show little or no emotion when delivering their lines, and acting is worse than many of the worse movies I've seen. When the actors are killed, you could care less. There is very little gore (I have no idea what the movie other reviewers watched when they say it's good gore in this because it's not there) and special effects are at best non-standard. They steal so many of the better horror movies (Jeepers Creepers, Friday the 13th, Leprachaun) and it still doesn't help. Fortunately, I saw it on Showtime, and I didn't actually have to pay extra money to see it, or waste on the spot in my Netflix queue. There are so many better horror movies out there and I recommend seeing those instead of a big breakdown.
