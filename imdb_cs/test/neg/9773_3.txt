The title of this movie and the clips I saw made me believe that this movie will have excitement and interesting moments. I was disappointed. The desert sands were interesting, but this movie was climbing along the snails. It started right with the underground cave and something that appeared, but then tried to get us involved in the lives of some very unlikely human beings. When they found dead bodies or should I say skeletons with some body on them, they started looking for why? Sometimes it was somewhat different when something in the desert followed. Some sort of black slime or something that would start eating people's flesh. As the meat began to collapse, a sack of bones began to crawl over the remaining people. The reason for this black slime, as we found out, was bad, ants? Incredibly! Then the end does not make sense. I think the motto of this film will be when you have itching and see an ant, it will quickly kill it before your ant friends feel your body.
