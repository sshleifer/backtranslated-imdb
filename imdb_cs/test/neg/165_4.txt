After seeing it, I came to the conclusion that it is most likely a flick of chickens; then I found out that Keir's mother had written the script, so it pretty much confirmed it. However, the rapid movement of the young can have some attraction for a man; This does not and does not really seem to appeal to it well, either for women (looking at the dismal cash registers). One item that I think both genders agree is stupidity on the scene, in a movie where there is an analogy between childbirth pain and limb pain amputated without anesthesia. Although men do not undergo pain in childbirth, we understand that it is a painful process; yet it is natural pain, while amputation is definitely not! Women understand it even better. I think a woman has tried to make a feminist statement that is in bad taste. In fact, many things in this movie are in a very bad taste. Although movies today are known for having a bad taste this one really "excels" in that department. It could have been a good movie that shows Dylan Thomas's fight during World War II; and how strong was the sentiment against the men who somehow managed to avoid serving in the army. Keira's mother writing on the screen is trying to show how this sentiment has been used against Dylan, but she really messes up this. Instead, we get a chick about how two young mothers get together; somehow. Way. Maybe. Somehow. It is worth noting that the soldier (wife of Dylan's wife) is sent back home after serving in combat; but it is not clear if the war is over !! Many things about this movie are similarly unclear; and although I have said that I will do so, it seems to be the main motive of this mess.
