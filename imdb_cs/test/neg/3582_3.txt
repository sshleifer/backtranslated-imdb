I recorded the North American premiere at the Chicago International Film Festival. I was disappointed. I wasn't the only one in the audience. The film takes a long time to get into conflict, and then refuses to solve the problem and decides instead to tell us a story. "To be continued". Is it a spoiler to reveal that the movie doesn't end? I consider it a warning. That's just half the movie - and not a good half.
