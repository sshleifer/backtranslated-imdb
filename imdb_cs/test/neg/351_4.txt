I saw this movie as part of Billy Graham. The church I attended was part of the community reach that represented God and Christianity to our community (Hartford, Ct. USA). I was one of the advisors who helped the participants (who were invited to come and do whatever they wanted a religious vocation ... and follow up on the film. And I personally found that it was a medium to strengthen my faith in I also found it very useful for those I advised, and especially I like the work of Kim Darby in this movie and the parents (Wintons?) Were a bit exaggerated in their way .... no one tells their child if he thinks that he or she can be the parent of an illegitimate child like Wintons "oh, no, no, no thaaat." It's not exactly what they said, but the likeable viewer I saw laughed at what they were saying and also with his son, "No, MOm, not me." Don Berghuis
