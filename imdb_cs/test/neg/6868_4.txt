I didn't like it movie.to me, it wasn't much sense.it was hard to figure out what was really happening.i also didn't think it was scary.i made but i think it was stupid, even absurd but not in a good way. Radha Mitchell is the main character in the movie that came out in 2003. She was also coincidentally in 2006 "Silent Hill," which I hated. "It's not so bad, but I think it's definitely below average. There's nothing special about it. The scenario is just too confused and there are things in the movie that may not be my opinion." I think Radha Mitchell is probably a good actress if she has more work with her voice for "Visitors" is 4/10
