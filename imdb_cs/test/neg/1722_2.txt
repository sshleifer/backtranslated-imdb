"Tycus" is almost as bad as a science fiction movie can go. I can hardly find anything good to say about this movie. Spaces are absolutely wrong. The comet is supposed to hit the moon and cause catastrophic damage to Earth, but no one believes that the scientist who predicts it. The entire underground city and the launch site for nuclear armed missiles are being built in the California mountains without anyone noticing. When the comet approaches Earth, the news gets on TV and newspapers barely a day before the event. And so on, and so on ... <br /> <br /> There is no emotion on the screen either. Is he a genius who discovers a comet and builds the underground city of humanity's savior or beast? It seems that the director or Dennis Hooper, who plays the role, did not decide when the film was finished, and it actually does not distinguish it, because acting and directing is so confusing that you end up thinking about what this film is trying to say. Special effects are so cheap that not only can they not be convincing in the era of computer effects, but they could not be convincing even in the 1950s, four decades before the film was made. <br /> <br /> And total time loss.
