I was one big Olsen fan. I got this movie when I was six and I was watching it almost nonstop while I was nine. Then she lay on the shelf where dust was collected yesterday. I stayed without a word. Mary-Kate and Ashley play Allie and Mel, two 12-year-olds who are sent to spend a spring break in Paris with their grandfather's ambassador. On the way they meet, as expected, two cute French boys, who show them a funnier side to Paris. I think two guys were fine, fake French accents aside. The story is predictable and humor is shallow and arched. Mary-Kate and Ashley play two shallow girls with too much makeup on their faces. Don't watch this movie unless you're in Olsen pairs or family movies.
