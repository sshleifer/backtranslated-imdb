When I watched this movie, it was afternoon after I got back from work. I love horror movies and we've seen some really cheese, but this will take a cake. The storyline presented to the viewer at the beginning of the film seems to be a little interesting, but as the film progresses, the script turns out to be a bad turn with a terrible clich√© and a bad presentation, which makes the film totally boring and boring. I don't want to criticize the script and the plot because I believe it's not the worst part. I have to say that acting wasn't terrible for beginners and I was impressed by Taylor Lock, which is one of his first films. The worst part of the film was special effects. They enjoyed a low budget and really destroyed the audience's entertainment, even though they were remotely interested in the conspiracy. I recommend watching this movie to understand the power of the bad script and plot. Only then can you really appreciate good writers and directors.
