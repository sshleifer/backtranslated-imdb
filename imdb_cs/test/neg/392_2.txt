Now I loved "Lethal Weapon" and "Kiss Kiss Bang Bang," but I can't believe Shane Black wrote this pile ... or that David Morse and John C. McGinley are in it. I screened it at the film festival. Terrible. Everyone laughed. It's preaching and hard hands ... not to mention stupid. It's also surprising how little L.A looks like Cambodia. The whole idea of ​​traveling time after a post-traumatic stress disorder is somewhat stupid. Imagine being born on the fourth of July mixed with "The Butterfly Effect 2" (I used it as a sequel as an example of how to really show how bad this movie is) but directed by Michael Bay's second director. So bad. Two stars are purely based on production value.
