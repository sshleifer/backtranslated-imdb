The film version of 'Rising Damp' was released two years after the TV series ended. Like many fans, I joined the film when it opened. I left bitterly disappointed. Eric Chappell couldn't spend much time writing the script; most of it is rehashed ideas from old episodes. At the time of the film's release, the "Rising Damp" series was repeated regularly on I.T.V. so the public was asked to pay to see what they had already seen. At least the films "On The Buses" boasted original scenarios. Second, Richard Beckinsale died the year before, so he removed the character "Alan" as a sign of respect that replaced the art student. John ', played by Christopher Strauli of the fame "Just when I laughed". It just wasn't the same thing. As another poster, he pointed out that Rigsby's guesthouse looked like the one used in the series, was bigger and overall cleaner. Director Joe McGrath was one of the directors who worked on the original movie "Casino Royale", a film of surreal surreality. "Rising Damp" also has a share in the "Walter Mitty" fantasy sequences, such as "Saturday Night Fever". Personally, I found them terribly in place. The case of "overflowing pudding". On the plus side, Leonard Rossiter is as spectacular as ever as "Rigsby", as Frances De La Tour as "Ruth" and Don Warrington as "Philip. It's just a shame that the film is not worthy of their talent. When Rossiter died in 1984, it turned out to be I.T.V. as a tribute, with its ultimate scene - showing Rigsby laying a prostate at the foot of a staircase - removed in the interest of good taste.
