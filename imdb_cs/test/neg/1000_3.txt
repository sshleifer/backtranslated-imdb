First of all, I would like to say that I am a fan of all the actors who appear in this film, and when I rented it, I wanted it to be nice to me. I think the main reason I was so disappointed was that the outer box promised me a thrilling thriller. In my eyes, the thrilling thriller for British movies is like something from Ruth Rendell's novel, something that has a lot of dark twists and turns and leaves the viewer with an end that is unlikely to be forgotten soon. This movie started with a hopeful remark that it's such a movie. We have our main character who suspects he doesn't like being involved in a hit and run that killed one of his servants' husband. , he won't appear until he confesses to him that he is part of a crime. The elements of the thriller with good tension were in place, at this point, but from there I felt that the film went in a different direction and became a kind of mild soap opera about who wants to be with whom and what is the love of a real relationship. I liked the film if the outer cabinet talked about a twisted lover's triangle and was not labeled as a thrilling thriller. Rather, it seemed to be the story of a soap opera, and the beginning seemed a slight distraction. the actual content of the film. I felt like this movie could do a lot better than it did. I felt it led the viewer to a big event that never happened. I have to give him a lower rating than I wish, and say it didn't meet my expectations.
