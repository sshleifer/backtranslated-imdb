The basic idea behind the ENCHANTED APRIL story is excellent - two very unhappy wives meet and decide to borrow an Italian villa for one month. Two more foreigners will be paid to pay for the costs. Interesting is the relationship both before and during this holiday - especially how it shows how this beautiful environment really changes their outlook on life. Unfortunately, this good idea is totally spoiled by the two key performances in the cast file that are so bad that they destroy the movie. Ann Harding plays the most important role in the film in a way that makes her ridiculous. Her "doe-eyed" expression and blank looks really interest you if it's not a zombie movie or she's just meant to be an idiot! And to make matters worse, Reginald Owen plays a character so unpleasant and bombastic that I was very close to turning off the movie - it was horrible and incredible. I noticed that at least one reviewer gave this film 10 - which is very, very hard to understand. Of course, the film has a great atmosphere and a good plot, but these two brilliantly silly performances cannot be overlooked because they undermine the rest of the picture. I'm sorry but this movie was painful for re-make!
