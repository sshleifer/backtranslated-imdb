Before I start, I have to inform you that I love horror movies with passion. I LOVE THEM! I've seen thousands and rarely comes that I don't like. I am very forgiving the horror genre. One of the greatest lines in the film's history is in the movie "Ed Wood" where Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is spreading and yelling at overly critical producers after they comment on "Plan 9 "'s cheap sets and continuity problems," You Don " You've never heard of "mistrust of unbelief?" "Well, I'm trying to bring this" suspension of unbelief "philosophy to every horror I see and usually it works. Unfortunately, it didn't work for me at the Cheerleader Massacre show. Strike One: <br /> <br /> The first thing you'll notice about this "movie" is that it is filmed on video and has this crumbling style of handheld digital television. Working with the camera and quality are so bad that it makes daily soaps breath taking compared. In fact, it makes Troma and Full Moon video messages look good. And that's bad. Strike Two: Jim Wynorski. This "filmmaker" seems to break out of the Corman chip, but nothing can be further from the truth. Roger Corman shot quickly, furiously, and under budget, but could deliver an original film. Although Wynorski provides a cheap film, he cheats his viewers (and perhaps other artists) as he steals all the pieces of James Horner's "Humanoids from Deep" and "Battle of the Stars" musical score and inappropriately drops them into the Cheerleader Massacre. On the back of box art and during initial credits, the music score is falsely attributed to Dan Savi (extra in Wynor's "Deathstalker II"). You will also notice that Cheerleader Massacre jumps from video to film and back when Wynorski picks up the entire scene from both "Slumber Party Massacre" and "Humanoids From the Deep". Wynorski took advantage of this deception fourteen years earlier in his terrible version of "Not from this Earth." Strike Three (You're Out) While <br /> <br /> While Cheerleader Massacre does have some nudity, (40-year-old kids playing teenagers and the roughest set of fake breasts I've ever seen in a horror movie) film, ugh), murders are relatively bloodless. What the hell is that about? The film is called, Cheerleader Massacre, but a handful of off-screen homicides, in my opinion, do not add to the massacre. It's not even add to a bad mosquito bite. "The Movie's" story is fair enough - invisible killer stems vanload from cheerleaders (old girls playing teens) until the van runs out of gas and "girls" are forced to stick to a detached two-storey mountain home. I'm not going to ruin your end, but this is one of those "movies" where a man who is obviously a killer is probably not a murderer. Massacre's cheerleader would be great if she was filmed on a film directed by Joseph Zito and had the special effects of Tom Savini. Instead, it is an effect-less, shot-on-video travesty by Jim Wynorski. Ouch. Please do not buy this rental agreement. If we continue to support these clowns, the more these talented video garbage will produce. Go out and rent "The Prowler", "The Last House on Dead End Street", "Delirium" or "The Burning". You'll be glad you did it.
