Among the many awards for this production was one individual whose comments asked if they were the only ones (who were not enchanted) - that is, they give this movie 3 stars. However, commentary continued to show the overall sympathy of the story, and other production of the same. Well, this person is not "the only one" who didn't like this production (including me!), But there I split into society and with him. If you gave me a head and asked me to choose between your shooting or watching this movie again, I'd watch it for sure - but I'd probably spend 10 seconds on it. I'd rather be trapped in solitude, or I have to watch the paint dry on the wall. Furthermore, I wouldn't want to see this story again, anytime, anywhere, or in any alternative presentation. Sometimes you feel like a "pair of George Gobel comedian brown shoes when the rest of the world is a tuxedo", and this is one of those for me. I liked Angela Lansbury in my favorite movie, "Long Hot Summer," and although he's not a big fan of the show, she was looking forward to "Murder, She Wrote". But HERE - not only did I not worry about the story or other aspects, but I found that Angela screams, swings, sings, and everything else about her extraordinary performance, perhaps the most prominent presence in any movie (or presentation in other media) I am ever experienced. It was like an endless sequel to Audrey Hepburn's equally "over-the-top" Cockney chortling at Rex Harrison - in earlier parts of "My Fair Lady." But it was a conspiracy incident, presented for light, comedy, and (merciful) brief. Apart from that, it was a brief one, and it seemed to be about 10 hours (Einstein's lay explanation of "relativity" at work). But I laughed in the "Seinfeld" episode where Elaine sucks because she tells them how much she doesn't like "English Patient". My friends looked at me the same way when I interrupted their waxing over their film. Instead, give me nails loudly across the chalkboard at any time.
