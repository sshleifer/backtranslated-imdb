This movie is sad. According to my colleagues, IMDb (* SPOILER *) RAPTOR uses footage from Carnotaur movies. Well, since I haven't seen Carnotaur's movies, I can't say. But I noticed some bad adjustments and worse behavior. This movie is one big smoking pile with ***. It makes no sense. Here's the thing that is called PLOT: The Mad Scientist recreates predators. Raptors kill people. Sheriff examines. * SPOILER * (although I don't know what it is that I've spoiled) The Sheriff hunts for crazy doctor plans. Army boys are sent and predators begin to kill soldiers. Raptors. Yeah, right. I could make a clay figure that looks more real. FX is the cheapest in the movie. There's a lot of gore. Cheap gore. It's not even real. I agree with another person who has rated this film that the only thing this film has is the fact that it ends. The film has about two seconds of originality. And this only comes when the sheriff talks to a tax agent about his electricity bill. This idea was used in about 100,000 other films with 100,000 different names. Overall, I will give RAPTOR 1/5 just because it is over.
