Many people stand in front of the house n some women cry ... Men standing in narrow groups and talking in a quiet tone ... a few guys come and discuss how sexy a daughter could look today .. The House Died ... The dead man's wife is worried about preparing food for so many people, her boyfriend sits next to her giving an idea to make things easy preparing a simple roti sabji ... One dead man's son talking to someone over cellphone, daughter is busy with her makeup ... her mother proposes to wear her a salwar stone, but her daughter is more interested in looking good when so many people visit their house and therefore prefers jeans and a shirt over the salwar kamez ... another son asks his mom to finish all kriyas and also indicated that she should not be expected to come soon from the office ... Then the camera slowly focuses on the dead person ... white cloth covering She's slightly moved for the wind, revealing her face ... His Anupam Kher ... suddenly rings and gets out of bed ... Is it his dream or flash? U won't get the answer until the end of the movie ... Well, this is wat comedy is for director Dibakar Banerjee !!!!! Later, you will find that this scene has nothing to do with the real movie, so it is obvious that the dream was still described before. Is it a movie comedy? It's supposed to belong to this category ... But it's not really! there is nothing in the movie that could be remotely linked to comedy !!! More than the director says, no one gets justice from the police !!! so everyone has to cheat !!!! or forget justice !!!! The music from Bapi-Tutul & Dhruv Dhalla is fine ... Nothing much about other sectors to say ... The bad scenario destroys everything ... nor does the performance of Anupam Kher fail to at least make paisa vasool ...
