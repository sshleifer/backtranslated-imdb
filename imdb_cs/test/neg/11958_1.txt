Next sequel! Why are they doing it on Earth? This must always be the weakest "franchise", but it is still funded and freaked out. SCARECROW GONE WILD - which I just watched so that I could officially throw out the whole series - bring back the bad straw, which again, butchers, some kids from college ... That's basically it. Acting sucks (as usual), deadly scenes are out of pathetic, and don't be fooled by the title, this thing doesn't have as much nudity as you think. A couple of nice topless girls but nothing too pants tightening. Let me conclude my continuous insult (or review) on this movie by saying: when I come across SCARECROW IN SPACE or FREDDY VS SCARECROW on the video store shelves, I will be in complete amazement ...
