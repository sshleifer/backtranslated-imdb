Where should I start? The box should be enough to dissuade me from this attempt, but I soon learned not to evaluate the book (or movie) by its cover, so I ignored the disgusting graphic quality of the box and rented it anyway. But common sense should tell you that if they can't make one static image properly, then how restless will they be moving later? Yeah. They were pretty awful. Actors in this movie seem to be totally unaware that they're being filmed because any expression seemed to be fine, regardless of the situation in which the characters were or what they were reacting to. However, a good story can compensate for low-budget outages. Good dialogues can sometimes lead to poorly funded attempts. Unfortunately, it wasn't one of those times, because the story was as weak and non-existent as the other elements of a good movie. They are not simply words as bad. <br /> <br /> Maybe you can get an idea from my rating of -2.3 / 10 from ... <br /> <br /> Fiend :.
