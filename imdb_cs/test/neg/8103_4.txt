"Black Dragons" is the second feature film of WWII. It's not as bad as you would believe. Secret meeting organized by respected Dr. William Saunders (George Pembroke) is interrupted by the mysterious unknown name Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi). Shortly thereafter, the participants of the meeting begin to murder and their bodies are on the steps of the Japanese Embassy in Washington. Colombia is suspicious. Federal agent Dick Martin (Clayton Moore) is assigned to the case and meets Saunders niece Alice Saunders (Joan Barclay), who is trying to help him. The reasons for Colombian actions are not explained until the last winch. Until the end of the story, the story is hard to understand. Lugosi, who was reduced at this time to appear in the chain of low-budget express trains, is actually pretty good. He is not allowed to cross, just as he has done and director William Nigh has to go for it. Lugosi's character slips into the shadows and reminds him of his Dracula even until his striking eyes are in complete narrow shots. Clayton Moore, at least one dimensional actor, would become a Lone Ranger on TV. few years. Joan Barclay makes a good heroine. Although now a little old, "Black Dragons" is not a bad way to spend an hour.
