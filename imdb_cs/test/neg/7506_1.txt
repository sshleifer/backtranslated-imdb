I live and work in Lexington, Kentucky, in the city where the Zombie Planet was filmed. I've heard about the film forever, from various people who claimed to be a critical part of production. Then I heard nothing for a few years. Imagine my surprise when I found it all sitting alone in a local video store. So, when I am the one I am, I decided to give these local filmmakers a shot. Bad idea. The Zombie Planet is too long, boring, poorly performing, miserable - and that's just a good thing. I tried the hardest to enjoy, which included removing my brain and setting it on the table so it didn't get in the way of a terrible story. Unfortunately, nothing worked. Planet Zombie is so bad that it is pathetic. And the idea of ​​planning a sequel leads me to believe that the director and his followers have not heard any of the criticisms I'm sure they've heard. Go on, guys. Please. In fact, abandon filmmaking completely. Or take part in several lessons about stimulation, narration, and, well, the basic direction. Otherwise, for the love of God, hang up.
