The Masserre Cheerleaders was to be the fourth installment of the Slumber Party massacre series; if that's what they were doing (which is considered by one actress from the original returns in a small role), they have failed miserably and by far the worst performance of the "quadrilogie". Cheerleader The massacre seamlessly combines bad acting, terrible plot, stupid killer, boring and boring deaths, boring scenery and nasty camera work to become one of the worst movies ever made. Did I mention how bad it was? Don't get me wrong: this cheese and retarded excuse for horror film is nowhere near as bad as Napoleon Dynamite, but it's a terrible movie. Cheerleader Massacre is the exact polar opposite of the original party massacre. Stay away by all means! This movie is utter waste!
