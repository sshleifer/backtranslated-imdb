Some of the secondary actors are really trying. And the camera shots in the desert are pretty beautiful. Otherwise, this film is terrible. William Shatner's character, Harvey, is an amateur screenwriter. It is also a psychopath, a man who literally escapes from a psychiatric hospital. Is the purpose of this film for amateur screenwriters to be psychopaths? Harvey will do anything to read his script and turn it into a movie, even if it means taking a film crew hostage. To amateur screenwriters ... grove? Maybe they do it. <br /> <br /> The movie setting is too long. We get into the story until the second half. The first half of the arrow and the flute among the various characters. "Shoot or Be Shot" is offered as a comedy, but I found it not funny. The dialog does not contain any subtext. None of the characters are believable as real people. These are all the pieces that perform "action" in a way that resembles cartoon characters. The film is basically cartoon for adults: stupid, missing, funny. I understand why some actors are in this movie. They need money or exposure. But what do Shatner and Harry Hamlin insiders do here? Maybe Shatner wants more comedy roles. Is it the best she can do? Is Hamlin desperate for money? He used to be a respected actor. What happened? Although the story is believed to be satire, it is rather an excuse for amateur screenwriters. Maybe it wasn't the intention. But this is certainly a way to interpret the film. As such, the script was very, very poorly written.
