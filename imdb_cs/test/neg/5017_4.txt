Bobcat Goldthwait should be commended for trying to do something different with this surprisingly cordial film, a warning story about the pitfalls that are honest at everything. Melinda Hamilton performs as Amy, a girl who had oral sex with a dog in the past. He fights the story of his fiancÃ© John. The truth, of course, is at the back, it's a hairy ugly head. The film deals with the fallout of the escapade. The film is well-acted by everyone, except perhaps Jack Plotnicka as Dougie, who never really felt he coughed well with the picture. It seems that a film that is strong enough is missing several times. Every person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and hardly relate to all our tad. Bobcat should be praised for doing something different, as I said before, but the difference is not always right, and this fades so slightly that Goldthwaits owns his directorial debut, a criminally misunderstood "Shakes the Clown" br /> My class: C-
