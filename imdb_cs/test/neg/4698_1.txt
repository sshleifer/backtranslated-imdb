I liked Half-Life. I'm still a fan. It was scary, intelligent and challenging. I'm not going to tell you it's one of the best FPS. Maybe I'm too hard a Half-Life fan, but the so-called Half-Life 2 isn't Half-Life 2. <br /> <br /> I have a question: is this the next chapter of Half-Life? Maybe it's the creators -Volve- mind, but I don't. Where are the intelligent enemies? Where is the frightening atmosphere? Nowhere. I believe they wanted to do a slightly different Half-Life (instead of another research station story), but they did nothing but do something to do with Half-Life, like Quake. Fate. The whole game is so unsightly and unreal that it's almost worthless. Although physics is really great and there are a few good levels to play, the idea of ​​making a revolutionary physically controlled game has failed. When you get a Gravity-weapon that can move objects, you can expect to use rights as a weapon-it would turn the schematic FPS game upside down. The truth is, you can't use Gravity-gun as a real weapon. Why? Because the best you can do is throw boxes and barrels that don't hurt too much. If you want the object to protect you from it, it can fall from about 3 shots. If you want to throw an exploding barrel on your enemy, it may explode in your own "hand". The gravity gun doesn't work like a weapon. The best use is to solve some physical puzzles. I ask Valve: Why? The truth is, you have to use your boring, schematic FPS weapons to finish (except for the last level) Weapons aren't that original Half-life classic. If the gravity weapon were always at the last level - a real weapon - I'd admire what Valve did. But not this. This is disappointing. <br /> <br /> So if you want Half-Life, then you're looking for the wrong place. You might like it, but I repeat: it's all but not Half-Life, and not even a true continuation of it. This is the greatest disappointment of all time. Valve has shown that they can also do terrible games. They did it.
