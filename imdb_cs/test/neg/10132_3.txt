Natalie Wood portrays Courtney Patterson, a police-afflicted songwriter who tries to avoid being victimized by her involvement in her first love affair, with her attorney Marcus Simon, who played warmth with Wood's real husband Robert Wagner. The film is heavily cut, but most of the remaining scenes show a very weak hand from the director, which allows Wagner to consistently use the somnambulate, put Wood on the hard and zero power, which also offers soprano quality. The scenario is somewhat unclear, but the persistent nature of Wagner's dramatic scarcity is unfortunately in place because he is given a free hand to impose his desperate look on Wood, which must be discouraging for the actress. The course of their relationship is misrepresented, and, along with jerky editing, leads the viewer to be less than reassured of what transpiration is, motivation is completely ignored in writing. Although cinematography is largely indistinguishable, it shines in one short scene when the wood is placed on the terrace and remains in the middle of the door while the camera's eye is constantly breaking away and showing its helplessness and fragility. A more controlled direction would allow performers, even lame Wagner, to change their behavior in accordance with an engaging relationship; As it was released, there is, for the most part, a huge lack of commitment.
