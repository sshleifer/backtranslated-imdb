Several years back, this film was scheduled to be broadcast on TCM UK as part of Tod Browning's retrospective? but what they actually showed was a remake of 1937! my brother watched it (and in retrospect followed the original largely scene scene, even on stage)? although no classical, he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than an incredibly creaking older version? This is the first collaboration between Browning and Bela Lugosi, have I had great hopes for it? but these were suppressed when it became evident after the first war of wearing conversation that the film's main concern was to ease the still-new sound technique, and consequently the result is stagey and extremely static. Even the thriller's plot isn't so exciting. even less tasty is the seemingly British-Indian environment (with accents of characters who have influenced the characters and performances of the higher classes, not to mention the excessive use of oblique idiosyncratic idioms such as "I say", "rather" and "look here now"? risible more than anything else!! In addition, there are several unintended howls: Margaret Wycherly (as a false medium) declares police inspector Lugosi (if anything, his undeniable presence on the screen is already evident) to he gave her time to 'work' who is the culprit of a double murder indeed (the evidence points to her own daughter, Leila Hyams!) hears the tap and is deceived when she thinks that the spiritual world really made contact with her, but then Lugosi enters the room and tells her, in her unmistakable accent, "I knocked twice? I!" The cut is also very sloppy: during one high angle of the main set, does Mike see that he has quickly reached out of camera range? and worse, there are a few cases where a person goes off-screen, seemingly into the next shot, into another part of the set, but every shot takes place on other actors for an absurdly long time, so it seems to take forever for this person to walk a few steps ! THIRTEENTH CHAIR denotes the third non-burrowing Browning Talkie I watched? even though MIRACLES FOR SALE (1939) deals with murder and occultism and could therefore still be associated with the genre. Much has been said about the director's apparent relaxation with the advent of sound: however, even though they may be wrong, the 4 straight horror movies he made during the 1930s are infinitely better than others? which I always found stylish and bizarre enough to indicate that Browning wasn't as much at sea at the time as it was designed?
