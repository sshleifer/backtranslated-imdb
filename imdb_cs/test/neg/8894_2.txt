Any fan of Russian cinematography will have great difficulty believing that sub-par appearances called by Mashkov and Bodr Jr., and perhaps will be utterly bewildered by the angry and confusing scenario of Bodr's Sr, which is associated with atypically weak direction. Most characters go through the film as if they have no idea who they are or what they do. It is also sad to see that Jennifer Jason Leigh's acting skills are not advanced because the RIDGEMONT HIGH FAST TIMES and her screen exposure are mercifully limited. This is a horrible mafia film; so much that it makes GODFATHER III look like a winner in the genre. To see the key Russians at their best, check out Bodrov Sr's work on PRISONER OF THE MOUNTAINS (which also includes Jr.), Mashkov's turn in VOR (THE THIEF) and the new criminal Bodrov Jr in BRAT.
