This movie is not as good as I thought it would be. There is no story, no characters and some dialogue would be nice. Gore effects are good and it gets pretty bloody at times, but nothing over the top. It starts with an autopsy on a man and when it's over the scene with a girl starts. Music is a classic score and throws the movie very well. They should have made a 90-minute version in which they could have some time to develop characters, so we can apologize to a person on the autopsy table. And more information on mortgages would make this movie more frightening than it is. Don't expect a haunted movie, but a nice special effects reel.
