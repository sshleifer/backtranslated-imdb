Oh Sex Lives of the Potato Men, What Did a Demon Make You? This is the movie you watch, you grin a bit during the run, and then when you tell others who saw it, you just can't help when you talk. But it's not that Sex Lives of Potato Men is actually a funny movie and the one that inspires you to smile when you talk or think about it is just that the movie is so bizarre; he is so offensive and not shy in his attempt to get through humble laughter in terms of sex and sex life in general that you just can't help but let your mouth break into a smile. Keep in mind that what follows is the sinking of the head; then shake your head and lift your forefinger and thumb on both eyebrows when you gently rub them to remember your time to watch this waste. But that's the movie, it's waste; It's very bold and shameless waste, but garbage no matter what. The one who came up with this idea put it on the paper and then spread it across the industry to make it must be either very brave or very desperate. It is strange to have a movie that is definitely "about" something, but that under no circumstances has a decisive narrative. This implies that most European cinematography is artistic, and its stories are ambiguous and open, and topics have priority over most other things. In the sex lives of potato men, the same situation and technically the same joke is repeated over and over again, and that is the idea that consists of: "sex is a very, very fun thing". These ideas may be more suitable for American film, so it's no wonder that after a while watching this movie, things start to feel a little off. The movie begins and ends in the same way, creating a circular path; A circular path that went nowhere and nothing was achieved. Three guys sitting around a table talking and not. Their boss joins them and the conversation is limited to all the gross and disgusting stories, situations or scenarios that everyone can think of. The peculiarity is that whenever one man says something ugly, other grimaces, but he has the same dirty story that in turn creates a contradiction in what these men will find across the border and what doesn't. The men are Dave (Vegas) and Ferris (Crook), two people joined Tolly (Coleman) whenever he considers the film to fit into a third face to break some other nasty sex jokes or break some strange stories. They are employed by Jeremy (Gattis), a man who has deeper problems and problems, but problems with which the film deals with exploitation for humor rather than study. So what is the situation in the Sex Lives of Potato Men? Three to four men are in crisis and we take on the role of an unfortunate fly on the wall for the duration of the film, as we see how shameful these people get within a week. If the humor that turns around Dave and Ferris is disgusting and repulsive, then Jeremy's things are just scary. It all starts innocent, and it seems to be the woman he likes and the one who likes him in return, but when the essence that Jeremy is just a stalker slips in, the jaws break up. The character of Jeremy is used and stretched in a way that makes non-repetitive love and persecution generally "funny". Jeremy sits in his apartment listening to classical music and writing letters of abuse Ruth (Davis), echoing some psychotic persona more associated with Hannibal Lecter writing his letter to Clarice in 2001's Hannibal. However, any sympathy that we might have for him at this point in time is totally false when it later reveals the true origin of their relationship. Suddenly, as spectators, we felt cheated when we felt it spin earlier and for whatever reason he did what he did in the first place, it just seems cowardly and ugly. To say what it was, it destroys what only a few surprises lurk in the movie. Quite sad, as in one of Jeremy's letters, he writes about something-or-another to summon him to have "No Artistic Vision?" "just one big mess". I hate it when the words that say characters reflect the movie they're in. Sex Lives of Potato Men do not follow someone's psyche or special interest in a fetish or why they feel the need to go around with as much sex as possible. it only uses them as a queue for nonsensical jokes and situations. Rather than taking group sex and exploring what drives a person to look it down, it makes a daft joke out of it (tickets with numbers on!?); Instead of getting into the mind of a Sadomasochism fan, the movie has someone hang out from the basement ceiling and warn everyone of 'incoming salt and vinegar' as he culminates. Ferris covers his face in disgust, and the camera fades to the next scene without getting too upset. It's a relief the film didn't get abroad. This is one part of British culture, a truly British mentality that I pray will be confined to our shores and ignored.
