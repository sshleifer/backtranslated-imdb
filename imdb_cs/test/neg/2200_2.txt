This is basically just a stupid pursuit story, almost identical to zillions of other persecution stories in terms of acting, tension, conspiracy, dialogue, characterization (or lack thereof), and stimulation. One area in which 'Net' differs from traditional chase movies is in its subject material: Computers. Unfortunately, the screenwriters did not understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a Cray! <br /> <br /> Computer novices should not watch this movie because they make them paranoids about computers. No matter what Hollywood is trying to tell us, it's not so easy to erase someone's identity by hacking. There is still too much paperwork in the world and even more in 1995. <br /> <br /> Computer professionals should not watch this movie. I think a magical virus that can melt your entire computer when you press "Escape"? Please. And the whole virus, including the cool multimedia effects of dissolving the screen (what is it all?), Will fit on one 1.44mb floppy disk? Oh yeah.
