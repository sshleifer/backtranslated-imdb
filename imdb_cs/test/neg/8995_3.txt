In most parts, it is a deadly boring business, Naach is about this dancer / choreographer (Antara Mali), who considers himself some kind of writer, in addition to the small commercial compromises that people around her, including her actor (Abhishek Bachchan), are building on . . A nice idea, just that proves that she has the most howlariously bad images of costumes and dance movements, things rotten enough to make even the forces behind those ultra-cheap South Indian potboilers dangle in difficult embarrassment. The story follows a predictable pattern that induces yawning ... the dancer and beau meet and have an affair (yes, sex included) ... beau gets success but refuses to help her. .. beau throws a stance and goes out on himself ... the dancer meets the most unlikely director who wants to "do what he wants" ... the bag's incongruous efforts even more disparate popularity ... beau attempts to reach out are rejected until the climax where it breaks about how it cannot live without it ... D-uh end. Actually, I didn't expect this movie to be very good. So why did I follow it? Because I have a fetish Antar Mali. She is an IMO actress with enough talent to reach great heights, provided she has the opportunity. Unfortunately, her role in the film looks much better on paper than in the actual, irony for the film, which is about to be uncompromising. In order to give her credit, she puts an effort into the game that shines through several scenes that ask her as an actress. I just wanted the movie to be better. Abhishek Bachchan is also throwing in a few good strikes, the last scene saving a bit of a bend that reminds you of your father. Recommended only when you can sit in humongous beasts to return a few grains of good moments courtesy of the lead actors.
