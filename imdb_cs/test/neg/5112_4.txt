Welles said he was in decline all his career. Here was an interesting story. Unfortunately, Welles seemed totally incapable of saying that. Instead, he tried to tell a lot of different stories, about Elmyr, about Clifford Irving, about his pompous view of critics and experts, oh, yeah, and try to jump into his current girl's career by giving her unnecessary screen time.
