Let me give you some advice if you watch this movie, just to see a lot of unlikable characters who are defeated in a dozen different ways, then you will enjoy this movie because they all die horrible deaths, beyond gore. there is not much else. Where should I start: - The characters do not touch the audience because there are no back stories for any of them because I did not feel connected with any of them. in fact, I didn't like any of them, and I was so sick of them that by the end of the movie I was rooting for misshapen mold to kill them all (which by the way did) <br /> <br /> -to play; I mean, I didn't get it, take an Asian guide, for example, he spoke perfect English, and after their little cruise ship sank, somehow he got out of the blue accent. br /> <br /> - one of the worst ends for horror: (if you can call it that) after a monster / human mutant thing kills almost all, it is killed by the last two remaining idiots or they thought so! The monster / human thing is ultimately killed when beauty and geek stick the pole over the heart / nick (it was hard to say) and probably died right in front of them (within reach of hands) but later came back and kills them (wtf) I mean, why he just didn't kill it when he was next to them. Arghhhh! I think it was just slow, it was as if the writer didn't know where the story was going. (or was a few minutes shorter than 80 minutes, so he added a few more retarded twists to the movie, so people can get 80min of crap instead of 75min. <br /> <br /> what I didn't get was why they simply killing the damn thing while it was unconscious, instead just leaving it as idiots and leaving The only reason I gave it was 4 because it was the only thing I watched this movie to the end, to kill them all.
