"Disappointed" is the best word I could think of for this movie, especially with regard to the glowing reviews they receive from some other users. One thing that a movie really spoils is that it is shamelessly partial (in both senses of the word). Not only does it represent a very selective description of the games (it focuses on the American athletic team), but it also contains several inaccuracies, most of which are used to overcome the difficulties faced by the American team. Even more worrying is that all omissions and mistakes (?) seem to be a celebration of American sport to exclude other athletes (with some famous exceptions). For example, the viewer is convinced that the US has won most of the game medals when they have actually won only one in four gold medals and one in a total of six. Similarly, many athletes are portrayed as cartoons of their respective compatriots (so we have arrogant Brita, and wine-swilling French). This attitude has very little service for the Olympic ideals to celebrate the film. Finally, I believe that this film would appeal to the audience in the US looking for rapid support for national self-esteem. Those looking for a detailed and historically correct description of the games are advised to look elsewhere.
