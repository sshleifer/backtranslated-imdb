Along with his turn in super-sleazy 'classic' TOOLBOX MURDERS (1978), it is considered the ultimate bad Cameron Mitchell horror effort. It's a bit too slow for my cravings, it has zero sympathetic characters in it, and not much action until the very end, but Mitchell is dedicated to central psycho performance as revenge-minded whack-work Vincent Rinard is fun. Not a good Anthony Perkins, but certainly fun. As a spoof of shallow conceit, which is Hollywood, it's just that; it is just as horror as it is. And while it's just a simple vintage exploitation picture, it's okay. I am a big fan of unnecessary gratuitous dance sequences, so I was also grateful for the appearance of Gazzarri dancers who simply reign. Five of them make a crazy hair-thrashin ', floor-slidin', hip-shaking 'go-go dance routine on' Don't Cry, Look at the Rainbow 'T-Bones. Watching these girls bounces around with huge smiles on their cheeks in their upstairs bikini, and the grouping of parachute pants is the reason why I give it a slightly higher rating than usual. Former film make-up man Vincent Rinard ("Best of Lon Chaney!") goes after people at Paragon Studios. Flashback shows how Max Black (Berry Kroeger), a jealous and drunk studio manager, threw wine into Vinnie's face as he was about to light a smoke. He is buried in flames and immersed in the pool, but not before one side of the face appears and loses his eyeball (not to mention his common sense). Currently employed by the "world-famous" Movieland Wax Museum in California's Buena Park, Vincent uses a special serum (described as a mixture of true serum, nerve medicine, and special "vitamins and minerals" ...) victims. They disappear and dense detectives on the case (headed by Scott Brady) act puzzled as new 'sculptures' are shown in the museum. Vince talks to herself ("I'm a very nice man!"), Smokes chains, murmurs, hisses and describes how "excited" by the sound of a female scream. He also has to deal with plenty of back stabs and self-absorbed witches, most of whom deserve what comes to them. There is also Nick (Hollis Morrison), a drinking, awkward guide to the museum, which sees a 'sculpture' wink, but does not go to the cops. Except for Max (a real Grade-A jerk ... who won't die!) And stupid cops, the other two main roles are women, and both are pretty cruel. Marie Morgan (Anne Helm) is not a typical innocent heroine; this hiker was engaged to not less than five different characters in this movie (!), including Vince, Max and Two Waxworks / Missing Male Stars (I think she never had time to go for one missing little girl). For some reason, she begged and begged in her irritated child for Vince to give her a "replica" of the head he suggested to the latest missing actor (and betrothal number 5) Tony Deen (Phillip Baird). He doesn't know that Vince has already pushed the syringe into the back of his neck, but I love it when Mitchell dryly agrees with her demands "so that you can completely retreat to reality." He also wants to "pose" for him, which means he is finally captured in a box. Unfortunately, the box has a hole where her head holds, so we have to continue hearing the high-pitched whips. Another "woman" is Theresa (Victoria Carroll), one of the above-mentioned go-go girls. First of all, he is thoroughly rhythmically inadequate by being on stage in a lime green bikini. Theresa is tolerable before she speaks, but when you realize that her grating presence connects Lorraine Bracco's abrasiveness to Landers 'sisters' airhead mentality, you want Vincent to inject her into the serum as soon as possible. Unfortunately, we are first exposed to the scene of her making endless requests for studio honcho and running in the museum trying to avoid Mitchell. She and the other characters are totally unsympathetic, but they act as a way of guessing in the Hollywood system, I think. And I'm probably giving this movie more credit than it really deserves. Pros are few and far between, but include (other than Mitchell and Dance Routine), colorful, slightly stylized lighting and a bizarre ending that seems to suggest that Rinard will be severely punished for his crimes by spending the rest of his life in t his own personal hell ... Married to Mary! ... Yikes, now it's scary. Also in the cast are director John "Bud" Cardos (also production director) as police sergeant, James Forrest as film director, Virgil Frye as statue, Rini Martin and Kent Osborne as bartender. Many people who worked on it (including executive producer and writer Rex Carlton) also worked on Al Adamson's BLOOD DRACULA's CASTLE and other atrocities. <br /> <br /> My score: 4 out of 10
