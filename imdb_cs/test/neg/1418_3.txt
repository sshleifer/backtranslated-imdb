The presumption of this film, a comedy talk show hosted by a presidential candidate as an independent, just to shake things up, is funny, fun, brilliant and even a little inspirational. (Thinking about the Western Wing debate when Tom Dobbs leaves his stage, he thought that Steven Colbert announced his candidacy, good times) Therefore, the first 15-20 minutes of this film are very entertaining, especially the debate. When he finally gets to choose, it's a shame that it's because of a computer malfunction, you want him to win the fair (though it's unrealistic). But after this movie he goes all the way down. I thought we'd get a great movie like 'Dave' (1993) in which we'd see how it would be if a comedian actually broke up. Instead, the film turns from a comedy to a thriller, a romantic comedy and a drama, and does nothing good. Computer glitch becomes the main storyline that really sucks. The boy is disappointing. I give it 3 stars only provided and since I actually managed to watch this movie from start to finish without stopping it, which is usually a good thing with me.
