First, it's NOT an adaptation of Stephen King's book, short stories, short stories, or anything else. From the EW website and their review of the show when it first aired, "... it never writes to its viewers and never betrays contempt for its subjects. Its first original work for television, the golden years of Stephen King" (CBS, July 16) , 9-11 hours) is no exception. The series is likely to be (as others have already mentioned) an ongoing series, which is why we've never seen the end of the cliff they left us on. But the audience, who was wondering how it all ended, was never quite clear. <br /> <br /> When the series came out on videotape, it offered itself as "never seen before! "It should have said," the end he never saw! "<br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** <br /> <br /> The end was the only major part that was changed for video ( even though parts of the whole were omitted, and that was the end of what destroyed the story, for example, instead of our two intrepid FBI agents who realized they were now labeled as bad and on the run from evil Jude Anderson The Shop originally aired), Jude just goes to them ... And they shoot him Bang, dead, and no real emotions to talk in the scene Ditto on that piece with Harlan and his wife poof. they simply get out of the car with a cock. <br /> <br /> *** End spoiler *** <br /> <br /> It was a sad ending to a fairly well done mini-series, and makes the video totally worth it Purchase or even rent. Sincerely, save money and your time.
