"Priscilla, the Queen of the Desert" is always torn as a masterpiece of Australian cinema. I found it quite disappointing. Major actors are great - Terence Stamp is aging well, Guy Pearce should do more comedy instead of dour roles he chooses, and I was a fan of Hugo Weaving because I saw him play Oberon eons. Cinematography is great, but if you've ever been to the Australian outback, would you know that the air is so bright and so brilliant that it could be filmed on Box Brownie's equivalent, and it would still look spectacular. So what is my problem? Well, three things. First, there is no likeable female character in the film. Our sympathy deserves a woman who has to make a living by filming ping pong balls from her privates in a pub. Tick's wife has no better treatment. Second, the scene where they sing "I Will Survive" to a group of natives is offensive. Trying to draw any parallels between the struggles of the queens and trannies and the almost complete destruction of the indigenous culture, which I suppose the scene is supposed to do, shows the level of historical understanding that is worth to become Hilton Paris. Finally, the biggest flaw in the movie is that it's just not funny enough. Did Stephan Elliott actually talk to some drag queens while writing the movie? Anyone who knows he has a queen queen (or three or four) knows that most of them have a horribly similar rapier and are not afraid to use them. Now I can understand that a lot of a queen pulling a joke probably would have rejected the film, but Elliott was supposed to be able to gather enough "fit for kids" material to complete his film. So, overall, wasting a good idea and a great cast.
