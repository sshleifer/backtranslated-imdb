This is a very bad movie! The plot is weak, acting is bad and science is worse. <br /> <br /> Special effects are unconvincing. Dramatic scenes are a joke. Every step of the way you can see how you get a mile away. The end is disappointing and there is no tension. The best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. The only reason not to give it a lower voice is because it's a TV movie and I think the budget was low to start with. <Br/> <br /> I believe the young Luke Parry's female will see this movie even though he did a better job. Again, it's terrible. Very very horrible. If you have a choice, look at something else.
