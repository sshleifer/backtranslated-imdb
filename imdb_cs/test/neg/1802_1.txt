The 1994 production of The Heart of Darkness was by no means able to live up to an excellent book. The film contained useless scenes that confused the viewer rather than helping them understand what was happening. The director clearly did not experience it, and if so, he did not show it. In addition, scenes from the book were dropped or changed, scenes that were quite important. The film let me feel a little bored and it was a waste of my time. The characters acted as if they had no idea what was going on, and the actors did not portray the emotions Marlow and the others had revealed in the book. Overall, the film was terrible and totally lacking the tension that was otherwise necessary to be remotely interesting.
