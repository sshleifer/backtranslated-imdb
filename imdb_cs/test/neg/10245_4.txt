I've seen worse movies. That's bad, but at least he's not trying to be good, so he deserves a short applause. It will remain firmly in the realm of low-budget B-film sci-fi genre. <br /> <br /> It's a rubbish movie, but in a nice way and it's definitely worth buying if it's in the store in your store. local supermarket. Amazingly charming rather than just awful. The highlight for me is when a galaxian lover wants to save her. When she turned, "Bunnyfluff!" who draws on his passenger sniggers. Sit down, get drunk, enjoy!
