Prior to home video days, Stan Laurel's pre-Hardy comedy 'Kill or Heal' was known - to the extent that it was known at all - just because several sequences were included in Robert Youngson's compilation movie 'Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20 Years' . Youngson knew what he was doing: the best gags in 'Kill or Cure' were brought into his compilation, while the rest of this slightly humorous comedy remained on Youngson's cutting floor. Laurel Portraits Business Traveler, Predatory Patent Cure Screaming Professor IO Dine's Knox-All: The name is the funniest joke in this movie that isn't very good. I should point out that this film dates back to 1923, which is a sign of prohibition. During the ban, many Americans bought patent medicine if it had (ahem!) 'Medicinal' properties, so - if Knox-All contains alcohol - Stan's work in this film is less desperate than that which he and Ollie famously Big Business "selling Christmas trees in summer. Too bad for this movie, it's not nearly as fun as 'Big Business'. We see Stan (but we don't hear him in this silent movie) who brings a spirited sales interview with a man who seems to be paying attention ... until we know he's outside the deaf institution, and this man is deaf. A haughty woman emerged from the gates: Stan was quickly trying to get her attention by twisting her fingers at her. Of course she is not deaf, and she immediately breaks him with an umbrella. I have found this sequential offensive, not because it is a deaf person (deaf is not a joke), but because it overcomes the very broad misconceptions among people who hear that they can communicate with the deaf by arguing at random fingers. and performing Charades without actually learning the highly complex sign language grammar. More amusingly, the spinster in this movie has a pet canary named Rudolph (as in Valentino), and there is a gag involving trick photography to enable a man to hide behind an object that is narrower than his body. I've seen this device in several cartoons and live action movies, but I think "Kill or Cure" is the oldest movie I've ever seen. Stan Laurel, an inadequate actor, has a bit of physical business worthy of Chaplin or Keaton, in which he expresses his emotions - and a change in his behavior - while walking from the camera with his back to us. But Laurel never became a first-rate comedian until he joined Oliver Hardy to create the greatest comedy team ever. 'Kill or Cure' barely 3 of 10.
