I wonder what the Victoria Film Festival organizers owned to include this movie in their program. I think they had to agree with the others who checked the movie. On the other hand, I consider it the worst movie I've ever seen. It starts with a bad hole-filled scenario and a dialogue that's so unlikely. Thoughts are introduced, then fell without development. Acting left me totally cold and disinterested. Set decoration was suitable for time, but decorator is a nightmare. The only way the characters could love this house is that their previous homes were terrible. The attic looked like things were thrown on the scene without trying to create the look of a real attic that had been filled with junk over the years. The photo was leaded and lacked diversity. Save your money for something worth it.
