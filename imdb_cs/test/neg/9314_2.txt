What can be said about this independent effort beyond being made by television cameras, and whether it was by conceit or budget constraints, does not mean that watching this variation on Romero was easier. She kept reminding me that I was looking at someone's school project, at best the worst cheap. The writer / director Georg Koszulinski (also appearing in the film) does some interesting things with traces, but it says more about his style of editing than his directorial style, which consists of detailed footage of tv faces face to face with TV cameras, which made me think I was watching a publicly accessible television instead of a real, honest movie. The story copies and inserts pieces and pieces from various sources, including Romero DEAD's trilogy, THE THE ROAD WARRIOR, and the BLAIR WITCH project. <br /> <br /> What results have hours and nothing for zombies to watch and eat people. (Okay, "people" in this case are clones, but it doesn't change anything. It's the same menu.) The year is 2031, and the first part of people who have been cloned nineteen. years ago, they began to fail, especially in the food sector. Of course, when clones are bad, the first thing they want is the human body (or the cloned human body in this case). It's not safe to be inside, it's not safe to be outside. It's just a matter of time before the ghoul meat that eats the meat absorbs our heroes. Have you seen it before? I don't mind people ripping with Romero if it did well, but there's no new territory covered in this movie. NIGHT OF LIVING DEAD meets the BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, shot by television cameras. The strange disappointment is that the DVD case looks like it was being shot, at least with an 8mm film. That wouldn't be a problem with me if the story wasn't as cheap. The film offers a bleak vision of the future in which technology has evolved to the extent that human cloning is possible. Do we have to continue cloning our favorite movies?
