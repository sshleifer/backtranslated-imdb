This is undoubtedly the most ill-considered film in history. The invention of Carrot Top gags is one of the worst attempts to joke in recorded history. I'm not familiar with his other work, but if it's half as bad as this, I'll cry. I give this film 1 out of 30 billion stars and God can love with the soul of those responsible.
