This review is for UK DVD three-disc box set. Disc One is called Caught in Law and includes Model Behavior, Chasing Jamie and Fast and Curious. Disc Two is called Fantasy Bedroom and contains Blue Plate Special, Falling in Lust Again and Love Potion No. 10. The final disc is called Anything Goes and includes Chatroom, She's Boss and Legally Yours. Why the other four episodes are not included is a mystery because there is definitely enough room for more material on the discs. Each episode opens with a Chloe reader (Lauren Hayes) letter from a satisfied customer. Then we'll see how the story unfolds, how the guests return to the hotel. Blue Plate Special is an exception because this story comes from a waitress. Writers should receive recognition for coming up with a variety of stories. For example, the behavior model is about two models rivaling the attention of the photographic crew; Falling at Lust Again, he is about a man and a woman who said goodbye and revived their love once again at the hotel; She's the boss, it's about he's a male secretary / dog who proves he's more a man than his boss, realizing he's a pleasure for her. All episodes lead up to a lot of nudity and sex. It should come as no surprise that all the characters in this hotel are beautiful women and handsome hunks. Even geeky secretaries change when they take off their glasses and keep their hair. Sexual action is rich, but for me it seems too frantic and fake. Working with the camera could also be done with a bit of moderation, spending too much time up close and moving to capture everything, and as usual we get vocal music during sexual action. Finally, the final credits mention the Palm Canopy Hotel, Singer Island, Florida, although Florida has no Singer Island. The scenery certainly looks more like Florida than Utah or Las Vegas that some people have mentioned. This is a pretty good effort and it is a pity that the second series is still waiting for the British DVD release. 4 stars.
