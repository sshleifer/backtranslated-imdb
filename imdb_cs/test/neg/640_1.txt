This is a really horrible movie. Lou Diamond Phillips simply calls it. The use of miniature train models is ridiculous. It looks like the plot is on the run (there is an alien on board; oh, and there is an eco-terrorist on board; oh, and the conductor is dead and the train is out of control; oh, the train goes to another train one hour ahead oh, and the train is wearing nuclear waste ...). I mean, come on! Extraterrestrial monsters are not scary (though there are many), and acting is pointless. Look at the guy who plays "another president" - do you really think he could be president? For good, he spent his acting career playing bad guys!
