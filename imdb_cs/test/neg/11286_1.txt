Cobb. That was sucked. I didn't know anything about the man I hadn't heard before. The show was at the top. The scene in which Cobb and Al ride the snow-covered road in search of women in Reno must be one of the worst conceived scenes in recent memory. It's just plain STUPID and unsustainable. Flashback sequences were terrible. And again they used the same OVER AND OVER and EXACT sequences. If I saw the same shot of Cobb fighting someone at the base once more, I'd be physically ill. Watching this movie we can learn NIC what it was in Cobb's era. Nothing we know about his relationship with his players, nothing about his days as a manager, nothing about his relationship with his family members, except they don't like him. I thought that when I sat down to watch this movie, I'd learn a LOT about the baseball time Cobb was playing. All I could see was repeating how Cobb hated everything and everyone and how they hated him. Boy, what a great movie (intended sarcasm). Cobb is portrayed as a permanent liar in the film, so which of his stories should be accurate? Who knows? Who cares? No one will be bullshit after viewing this piece. If you decide to rent this movie, make sure the VCR button is working because you will be tempted to reuse it. Hopefully someone will ever do a GOOD movie about Ty Cobb. I liked this movie just like the people in it who liked Cobb, which means - I HATED IT. Now I know why I found it in the RENT ONE GET ONE FREE section. I think I'll ask fifty cents from the clerk because I can't go back to the time I wasted this waste. Well, what I might have thought of a film that Robert Wuhl would have presented.
