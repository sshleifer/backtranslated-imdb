Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renne Zelwigger. They're all terrible. Especially a star, Jude Law. He is the director of the same guy who made an English patient and is based on the best-selling novel of a man who risks returning to his lover, but unlike the beautiful English pateint, this film sucks. It's really bad. The worst dialogue ever. "But we only knew each other for a moment" "But they were thousands of moments like diamonds in a bag" <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "In some cultures, I have to say that I married 3 times and you are married "lovey-dovey-" I am getting married to you, getting married to you, getting married for you, getting married for you ... "<br /> <br /> over it all. the whole movie was horrible, terrible .... Ughh no words, I'm sick. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (this is for really loud bullet sounds, the sound crew did a good job)
