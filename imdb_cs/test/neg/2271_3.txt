Usually when the BBC releases a TV series one is used to a certain satisfaction guarantee. Usually, the TV series is great, although the story is boring, you can believe acting will be worth it. When I came across Persuasion, here in the local library, I was looking forward to a pleasant evening because I read the whole story. think about it. Furthermore, I was relieved that I had learned that the production date of this TV series was from 1971, because until then I thought the BBC had lost it. It's really bad, and it should be used in acting schools as a horror movie. The BBC or other product of this century other than the young Musgroves sisters, who apparently were with their fist steps in acting, and do notably well under the direction otherwise given.
