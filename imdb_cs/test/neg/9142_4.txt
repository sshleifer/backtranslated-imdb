What a disappointment! I enjoyed Jon Cleary's books on Scobie Malone, but there is little resemblance between him and Malone's movie. He is an urban detective in books who is devoted to his wife and does not engage in fistuffs. For the film, the figure was spiced up, inland copper, using fists, and she wasn't willing to jump into bed with a beautiful girl, though I don't know what she and the other sexual interest of the film see in it; Taylor was 39 at that time and his face was puffy. His character's stamina is remarkable; flying from Australia, apparently going directly to the Commissioner's house (somewhat unwise trying to arrest him during a black tie), rescuing him from the assassination (entering a process fight), going to a casino with one girl, leaving with another and taking her to beds. So much for jet lag! On his way back to the Commissioner's house (with good knowledge of London's back streets), he is beaten by criminals, but he is still the first to have breakfast! It is also noteworthy that the Commissioner's limousine has miraculously repaired windshields and headlamps within minutes of attempted assassination, and that one character has a moving belief in accurate timekeeping of an hour-activated bomb. The best thing is to scorn Joseph Butler for enemy Malone. And at least the film avoids London travelogue, although some scenes take place during the week at Wimbledon.
