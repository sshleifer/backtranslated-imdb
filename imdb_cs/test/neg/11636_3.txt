This movie has not made it for me, a passionate SNL fan for the past 14 years. Jamie Gertz's picture was fine, but there was something about the film itself. The facts presented in the film are completely distorted. But Merv Griffin made it, so it would explain a lot. He had never been to SNL, nor had anything to do with it. The points in her life when she was on SNL are backwards. When we first saw her at SNL, they went to study with Lorne Michaels, the logo on the wall is about 1988-1989, not 1975. And let's talk about cast - who are these people? I've never heard of one of them. Really dissatisfied. This film shows why television movies, TV movies are just the thing.
