<br /> <br /> Spoilers <br /> <br /> I'll be so kind in this movie (some people, including directors, may be upset when reviewers talk) ... <br /> <br /> There is a nice car accident and the opening credits look good and ... that's it; everything else bites the big one. All acting is scary, the screenplay is embarrassing, special effects look like they were made by school kids on cheap computers. All in all, this film has serious tendencies to bowling shoes. As a horror movie, it's not very scary, and if it were to be a "horror movie" of a thinking person, it did at some level, I thought the end of the movie was far away. This may actually be an ironic look at bad horror movies and I miss a point, but somehow I doubt it. It is a complete car phone movie store and I could not recommend it to anyone and it is painful to tell me how eagerly I was waiting for the resurrection of British horror. <br /> <br /> If you disagree with this assessment, it's okay, it's just my own opinion and I'm sure someone will love it (for example, the director's mom).
