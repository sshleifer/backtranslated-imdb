So it's not a big fan of Bolla's work, but then there's not much. I enjoyed his film Postal (maybe the only one). Apparently Boll had bought the rights to use Far Cry long before the game was even finished. People who enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research laboratories located on a tropical island should be warned it's not Far Cry ... That's something Mr. Boll and his legion planned . Schmucks .. Feeling loneley on stage Mr. Boll invites three of his compatriots to play. These players follow the names Til Schweiger, Udo Kier and Ralf Moeller. Three names that actually made them in the biz movie. So the story looks like this, Jack Carver played Til Schweiger (yes, Carver is a German who is the one who kills bratwurst riding guys !!) However, I find that Tils, who is in this movie, is pretty bad. true to Carver's agenda, but the woodcarver we saw only in the first person, so we don't know how he looked when he dug ** .. <br /> <br /> The story in this movie is out of place. We see the evil mad scientist Dr. Krieger, played by Udo Kier, who produces genetically mutated soldiers or GMS. He does his secret research on the island, which for some reason reminds me of "SPOILER" Vancouver. That's not the right palm. Instead, we have nice rich lumberjacks. We didn't even go FAR before I started CRY (mehehe) I can't continue .. If you want to stay loyal to Bolls shenanigans, go and see the movie you won't be disappointed with. most of it will suck. There are some things worth mentioning that would mean that Boll did a good job on some areas of the movie, such as some nice boat and combat scenes. Until the entire cromed / albino scene GMS enters the scene and just makes me laugh. gets a very annoying sidekick who wants you to shoot the first three minutes on the screen.
