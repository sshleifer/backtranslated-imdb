Loosely based on the novels of Earl Derra Biggers, 20th Century Fox's Charlie Chan series proved to be a favorite audience - but when Japan invaded the Pearl Harbor studio feared the audience would turn against its Asian hero. This was an incorrect estimate: actor Sidney Toler took a role to "Poor Row" Monogram Studio, where he continued to portray the character in eleven more movies made between 1944 and his death in 1947. 20th Century Fox regarded the films Chan for cheap "B" movies, but the studio was still a lot of them: the charts were often silly, but the pace was sharp, the dialogue funny and casts (which included eg Bela Lugosi) and Ray Milland) always an expert. The result was a kindly spell that passed the time test. Monogram was another thing: Chan movies were "B" movies simple and simple. Little care was given to scripts or cast and the resulting films were flat, average at best, virtually unnoticeable at worst. <br /> <br /> With adequate casting and several interesting fence devices, SHANGHAI COBRA is one of the best Monogram films - but it is hard to achieve consistent mediocrity. In this particularly entry, Chan (Sidney Toler) is called to investigate a murderer who kills with what appears to be a cobra-like bite; at the same time, he decided to make sure that the government's radium supply, hidden in the bank vault, of all places remained safe. Are these two seemingly unrelated conspiracy lines connected? Well ... he could be! Sidney Toler is always happy as Chan, but most of his Monogram performances seemed to be "called" - and that's just like COBRA, as it is with any Monogram Chan movie. As usual, Mantan Mooreland is a truly entertaining performer. Changing times have led us to look at Moreland's comedy brand as humiliating for Africans-Americans, but he was a professional actor and comedian, and in the context of what was possible for a black actor in the 1940s, his work has great charm and innocence. Fans of the 20th century Fox will likely find Monogram's Chan as a major disappointment, and newcomers who like monogram films are likely to consider them as the third prize after they meet the Fox movies. Like other Monogram Chan films, SHANGHAI COBRA is best left to dedicated collectors. Four stars, and that's generous. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
