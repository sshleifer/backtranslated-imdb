Where the hell am I supposed to start? Give a brief summary of the story? No. You've heard it or don't want it. Either way, it sucks. Just like a movie. I happen to be a horror movie enthusiast and I must say it's one of the dumbest and most clumsy movies I've ever had when I saw it. <br /> <br /> The script is really stupid. The story starts too fast with absolutely no tension or building in the least. All these torture scenes would be much more effective if we gave the smallest pieces to the characters. From the first scene in the movie, when teen girls meet Capt, how the hell are we supposed to sympathize with them? At first they seem stupid when they go to a party with a guy they don't even know, and secondly, we don't even know their goddamn names! Why should I care if they live or die? Not to mention that they actually have the courage to feel compassionate with Capt once he is "reformed"? PLEASE! I was cheering when he only got his desert! He deserved it! Damn, he deserved worse! We are also forced to sit in a nonsensical wrong order that is pulled directly out of the "Silence of the Lambs" (and here it is! Of course, they give them a false address!, Don't you think he would wait and puncture Johnson upstairs? RETARDED!) Then there is a dialogue. All Captain Howdy says is either ridiculous or just stupid. "The dead are so dead when they're dead"? What's that bullshit? Dee Snider says at one point that "knowledge is power." If this is true, this film has absolutely no power. Then there are holes for rendering. Yes, I know this is a horror movie (good, horror), but damn it! You could drive semi-finals into these holes! First, it must be DUMBEST cops that I've always seen! AT ALL!! I mean, dear God, these guys are morons! Call for backup, idiots! Secondly, how the hell did the hell get out of Captain Howdy's nose? Apparently this piercing expert says that "this is the biggest thing I've ever seen", but if it's so damn big, how the hell could it get out so easy? Captain, how did he just leave it at the scene because he wanted to catch it? It certainly didn't look like he did it. They would also never release Captain Howdy, and I know it's for a damn fact. He'd be in jail for the rest of his life, and he wouldn't get it. Much less let him return to the old house, where he killed / tortured everyone. NOT RESPONSIBLE AND OPTIONAL. And now acting. Dear God, these people suck. Linda Cardellini is the only good thing in this movie. She's ready and amazing. Too bad he barely gets a good chance to act in this piece of crap. Amy Smart appears for about 10 minutes and then goes out of existence. Even the usually entertaining Robert Englund is underused and inefficient here. Dee Snider plays a crazy guy with no talent. I never felt threatened, scared or intimidated. I'd rather see Dee Snider in the role of Alexis Arquette in "The Chucky Bride". It would be much more fun to see this talent-less hack get it that cute psycho doll. Dee Snider just gets mad. She can't act (one of the least frightening villains I've ever seen), can't write (wrote this damn movie in her sleep?), And she's obviously more stupid than Jessica Simpson! This film is just a demonstration for Dee Snider of how to show off all the strange bullshit that knows about self-harm and modern primitives and blah blah blah. Either it was done earlier or it just wasn't needed. I was bored in the whole damn thing. Playing actors, music sucks, script sucks, stimulation sucks, special FX suck, overhead sucks ... basically, this movie sucks. This film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller / horror movie and fails. He cannot scare, shock or disturb in any form, manner or form. This is probably one of the least effective and totally unoriginal films I've ever seen in my whole life. A piece of film waste trapped on celluloid. <br /> <br /> "Strangeland" gets 0 out of 10. Avoid all costs. It's not pleasant in the least.
