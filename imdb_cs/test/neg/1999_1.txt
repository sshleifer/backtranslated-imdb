This was on SciFi last weekend and I had to check it out. After all, it was science fiction, with vampires and Erika Eleniak. What could go wrong with this B-movie? <br /> <br /> A lot. To Begin: It cannot even be classified as a "B-movie" because it would be like the same league as Roger Corman ... and this movie does not even meet its expectations. Most of the money they spent on contact lenses for vampires. Second: Casting was terrible. Yes, casting Udo Kier as Captain Demeter was a clever move ... but the director could not clearly remember Kier's lines. Casting Eleniak, in a vampire movie, is also a smart move because it means a lot of horny guys are going to buy / rent / record this movie to watch her get seduced by a vampire. But the director, writer and producer screwed it up. It is true that they got some money from poor, unhappy souls who like watching vampire movies with hot women in them ... but no one will remember this film in another two or three years. Third: Little things that just emphasize laziness in this movie. For example, Van Helsing calls the crucifix, and when Mina is embedded in the coffin, the viewer can clearly see that her "chest" is nothing but pillows. Oh And One More Thing: Why did they go to Dracula like George Hamiltion instead of what seemed pretty frightening? Does George Hamilton have a great future for our future? Why didn't everyone who saw Dracula laugh at him to marry him? <br /> <br /> Loss of time. Even with TiVo remote control in hand.
