Ted Nicolaou has done a lot of great horror and fantasy movies. I'm looking for all his movies. I couldn't find this for 3 years until I unexpectedly found it on youtube. To tell you the truth, I wanted to see more ghosts and fewer interviews. It seems that in 1999-2001 Ted had a crisis, maybe in money. Its features of this time look more like a real low budget thrash from garbage movies. But I'm not saying he's a bad director this time. Everything happens. The end has nice horrible details and tension, but the whole movie was a long boring dialogue. <br /> <br /> only for real Ted fans. <br /> <br /> www.myspace.com/neizvestnostlab
