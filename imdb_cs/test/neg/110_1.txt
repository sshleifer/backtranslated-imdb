I just finished watching this movie and I'm disappointed when I said I enjoyed it a bit. It's so slow and uninteresting. The Harry Potter boy plays a shy teenager with a brute mother, and then one day the crude mother tells the boy to find a job to accommodate an old guy who obviously doesn't have a place to live, started living with his family and therefore the baby goes to work for the old lady. And the old lady who lives alone teaches him about girls, driving a car and life! I couldn't get as an 18-year-old spends time with a terrible lady in the 1980s. I am sorry when my comments on this movie annoy people who could enjoy it, that I was wrong, because I am not a Brit and I cannot understand the social and their family structure and way of life. Mostly, the film is made for a British audience.
