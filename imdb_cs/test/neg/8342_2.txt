With regard to the subject, I thought this film would be at least pleasant if it stopped for a masterpiece. I was wrong. I was still waiting for something to happen and it ended - I thought the final was what happened before it became exciting. The only reason I gave it 2 instead of 1 is because the boys deserve some recognition.
