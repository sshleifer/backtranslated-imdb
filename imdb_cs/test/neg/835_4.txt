ANY PLAYBACK (2 outta 5 stars) A routine "spaghetti western" starring the guy who played "Kookie" on the "77 Sunset Strip". The storyline is some convoluted nonsense about some stolen gold coins and various armed men of dubious motivation to try to watch it. This is one of those "light" westerns ... which means a lot of strenuous attempts at "comedy" ... and some really cruel music during most action sequences (you can say it's not the work of Ennio Morricone). George Hilton plays a bounty hunter called "Stranger" ... but he doesn't leave much impression ... he just doesn't have the style of Clint Eastwood or Franco Nero who can do a lot of sparsely written character. The end is a complete tribute / parody to the end of "Good, Bad and Ugly" ... although it is hardly fun to be considered a "parody". The highlight of the film is the first 5 minutes ... played by Clint Eastwood actors, Lee Van Cleef and someone else (should it be Eli Wallach? Franco Nero? It's not clear ...) who are confronted by Stranger. It's a fun joke for fans of Sergio Leon fans and spaghetti western fans ... but I don't think anyone else would see it.
