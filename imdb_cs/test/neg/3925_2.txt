This film is poorly written, hard-to-follow, and features poor performances and dialogue from lead Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. The assumption, believable, but weak (a secret narcotic drug subject to the underworld), deserved better than this Lili Fini Zanuck flop. Competent casting (Sam Elliott, William Sadler, others) wasn't enough to save the film. In addition, this film contains the absolute worst scene of "love" in the cinema. Moreover, the soundtrack is overrated; specifically rebellious, sappy-free-substance "tears in heaven" otherwise legendary Eric Clapton. <br /> <br /> "Rush" is completely unenjoyable from start to finish. 10/10/10
