Cheerfully incompetent - like "She was wearing a yellow ribbon" remodeled by five-year-olds. Forward Spoilers: In spite of its title and high bodycount, the "Slaughter Trail" is in fact the musical Injun Battle instead of the dance numbers. If you've ever wondered what Ed Wood did with the B-movie budget, this movie should answer your question. Some decisions could only be bad in retrospect, such as the Cinecolor short-lived process, resulting in a change in color in the same image. However, there was certainly some unexcused skimping on the main scene of the film, a fortress that seems to be partly Norman Castle. Terry Gilkyson, who later wrote "The Bare Necessities" for Disney's. The jungle book "adds scores full of original ditties that would be great for a cartoon but that fit western action like fuzzy slippers stuck in a caliper. One song tells how" horse hooves and their tunes sound like a sergeant of ungulates "... during Another song literally tells a story shot, representing characters describing their moods and gestures - as they happen on the screen - and even ceasing to advertise Cinecolor (!) <br /> <br /> The script sends wild Navajos to the war road to revenge killing two of their bands out of the box.At the end of the movie, what looks like a hundred Navajo and riders bite dust (thanks to repetitive records of the same characters dying again and again), but the boss is happy to see that the badguys trio was As the singer readily informs those of us who have not paid attention, the Navajoos are leaving and their battle has stopped The captain of the cavalry, surrounded by the bodies of his fallen comrades, cheerfully ripples his appreciation. NavajoÅ¡i are consistently shot from their horses in pairs - never just one. Virtually every red man on the leg dies by throwing his hands in the air and snooping. The film also employs the most cautious stuntmen in Hollywood who crouch before blowing up a one-storey roof (and still fail to land) or turn to look after them when they slip, "dead," on a rocky slope. Br /> <br /> The star is Brian Donlevy, who certainly deserves an Oscar for blushing. After the endless final battle scene - "climax" is barely a word - it scans the list of dozens of its killed soldiers and shrugs: "It could have been LOT worse." Trooper Andy Devine gets to sing and Gig Young is laughing at Andy the rumors ... that lead a character who was held by masked Gigas bandits outside: "I know they laugh anywhere!" And to keep nobody from forgetting what could be the ugly work of Howard Hughes, let's remember that as RKO's chief Hughes was the first in the black star of the original star Howard Da Silva when HUAC condemned. It would take Hughes another six years to finish that once-celebrated studio to the country, but that didn't help things when he insisted on reshooting Da Silva's every scene for this movie, replacing Donlevy. It was almost a decade before Da Silva could work in Hollywood again. But all things considered to get him out of the Slaughter Trail, he should send Hughes a thank you.
