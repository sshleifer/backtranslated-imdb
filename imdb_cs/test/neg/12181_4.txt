At first I am a huge fan of Bronson, since the late 1970s. I watched every movie he shot on the big screen from "Love and Bullet", which was ironically the beginning of his end as a big name, a Hollywood blockbuster. I was hoping things would change. around him he made a really good movie in the 80s, but it never happened. And I don't know what he thought when he signed a contract with the cheap Cannon studio and hack by director J. Lee Thompson for most of his films. "Assasination" gave me some hope when I saw Peter Hunt directed Thompson instead, but these hopes were quickly interrupted. First, the film looks incredibly cheap, as it was done in about 3 miles, minus Bronson's inflated salary (I heard it lasted for 5 miles per frame, which is probably more than the rest of the budget for all his Cannon movies). The White House scenes were filmed at VA bases in West LA - we were busy when they shot. Nice work to recreate a white house, but nobody thought the palm trees would get out of the way? Guess no. Second, the support cast is really bad. Ireland was dying of cancer and despite the fact that it is not bad, but terrible Asian women playing Bronson's sidekick were a typical Cannon talent at the time - non-existent. I would really wonder how she got to this role. I can't imagine a worse actress for that part, plus she's 40 years younger than Bronson! The story is not so bad and it's something bigger and better-budgeted studios did later (Eastwood's "in the line of fire" and Costner's "Bodyguard" movie), but the way it's here is really sad. I wonder if they couldn't afford to do more than one or two doses per shot. None of this is believable in the least. If the men in the secret service were really acting like spy cops in this movie, we should leave the presidents every few months ... and after a few months ...
