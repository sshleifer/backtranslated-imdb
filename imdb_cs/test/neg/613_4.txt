I became a big fan of carpenters and I really didn't enjoy this movie. I feel he was too focused on her anorexia and didn't let go of her true personality. I was not enthusiastic about Cynthia Gibb; especially when she knew Karen's anorexia had decided, it was suicide, which was not. Though her family was not big about hugs and kisses, I thought the film portrayed Agnes (their mother) as terrible. I found a few scenes that should be offensive in a way that is seen in a mirror that seems to distort it and make it harder; I thought the metaphor (so-called speaking) was quite effective. When a family plays a pool and discusses her divorce and she falls apart and Richard is shocked when she calms her and feels that her fragile body was also quite moving (which is probably a bad word). Overall, I feel they needed to make her a more lively, unpredictable side - her true personality. Even as the focus of the film, there really wasn't a point that caused one to understand what would lead her to anorexia (though of course no one can really know), and almost seemed to be unfounded. The film was more poor-with-anorexia than Karen Carpenter's story, in my opinion. I suppose the name of her husband / profession has changed and all because they couldn't get his consent to actually include it (there were some bad terms), but the whole aspect was inaccurate with the changes. I can't remember this commentary about a film that would bring her desire for family and children, who had a great victory in her life and explains her romance and quick marriage beliefs with her husband. It ends up as a low-budget made-for-TV movie that just isn't too high quality and can be disappointing if you're a hardcore fan who hopes to see Karen's disease. I feel that such a legend deserves / deserves a better film as a tribute to an amazing man and a wonderful voice.
