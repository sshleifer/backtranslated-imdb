The Net is a movie I never saw after the release, I remember doing it on average reviews, and since then I've noticed a snippet here and there when it was on TV. I see it now, fourteen years after it's the original release, I'm a little overwhelmed as time flies. Being in the mid-twenties, it was my childhood to feel ancient. I felt like I should do some exercise before my body started to stack fat at all the wrong places. Reduce fat and sugar. Too much coffee and cigarettes. Anyway, it was the best part of this movie experience for me. I'd say the first 30 minutes of this movie really let me take a retro paradise. Look at the big cans they call computers. Look, they're chatting in chat rooms! I remember those tanks! They look ... stupid. And hey, it even stars Sandra Bullock. First Billed! You'd look at it. As a film, The Net is just an unimaginable, simple and absolutely routine thriller of cats and mice. None of this was archaic, they did as much as they do now. Bullock plays an undisturbed computer nerd who has the task of repairing software for people who don't have the "whole computer thing". As it happens, she encounters some fine information and after her vacation trip ends up with her almost getting killed by a sexy lie that turns out to be a killer (played by Jeremy Northam, and she should be suspected by being in American movie and the guy smokes and has a British accent!) gets his "smoothed out identity". Her house is empty, for sale, and after checking out, she has now a new identity. Convicting a prostitute and a cheater, not less. Now you can say it's unlikely. How could they do it to her? Even in 1995 it is impossible! That's right, but in '95 many people didn't even know what the Internet was. I can see how it is possible to accept a hole. But what is more disastrous are irregularities that have nothing to do with technology. The film apparently owes much to Hitchcock's movies (it is one of those thrillers that have a merry-carousel at night) but Hitchcock has always made sure that his films were credible. The characters did not act as confused maniacs when trying to prove their innocence, and the conspiracy did not move into a structure where one obstacle inevitably leads to another. The characters also tried a bit before they reached the entire rouge chase. Does Bullock's character really have any friends? Couldn't any old high school teacher confirm his identity? Or like ... her nearest pizza? Okay, he's ordering pizza from the internet. Does not matter. You looked the movie very fast. There seems to be hope in a former friend. Do you really think that? You should always count on at least one surprise. Net offers no. <br /> <br /> The Internet poses a lot of danger, this movie seems to predict. However, if the film was made today, imagine what the villains would have to go through to ensure that their identity was erased. Not only do they have to do all those boring literal things, she would still have her Facebook membership, at least as 100 friends or so, and picture tags, not to mention that she could be on YouTube or Linked-In, and what about. her video blog with as many as 150 daily hits, or webcams in her house and recorded video of her in other people's mobile phones, webcams, web downloads ... her membership in IMDb?
