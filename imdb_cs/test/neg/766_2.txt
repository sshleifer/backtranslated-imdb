Tom and Jerry transport goods across the plane to Africa. But because they are white men, they are afraid they won't be safe, so they put on a blackface to come in. Once worn, they adopt a black dialect and fully inhabit their new characters. They crash into the ocean and use the aircraft wing as a raft. Sharks, swordfish and whales are more likely to suffer from the advances of supernatural octopus and more serious threats before they reach the ground. Once on the ground, they are frightened by fantastic creatures and duck into the cave. Inside it is even worse when they encounter live skeletons in a black area. And after leaving the cave things are even worse than when they are discovered by cannibals. "Being Silly" is a particularly sloppy effort by Van Beuren Studios. One example: A lion, unknown to Tom and Jerry, enters the cave before they do it. But the animators had to forget it, because the lion would never appear again. Another example is the end, which is not the end: it is just an arbitrary stop. <br /> <br /> According to the YouTube poster, this cartoon was originally meant to represent the voices and cartoons of the popular Negro comedy team. Aubrey Lyles died of tuberculosis before the recording was finished and co-authors John Foster and George Rufle were forced to rework the animation into "Tom & Jerry". â€œ<br /> <br. Rough animation and poorly executed gags make the film defeated from start to finish.
