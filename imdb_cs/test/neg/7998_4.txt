This is a very famous Ninja movie, but it's not a nice movie. If you want to see some ninjas and some characters, want to know about Ninjas, check out this movie. This movie is only for ninja fans and who wants to do nostalgia. <br /> <br /> The first 20 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the movie are the best. You can see Ninja characters and fight in this scene. Among them is below average, almost as bad as film. Negotiation is wrong. Sho (Black Ninja) is the best actor of this film. Frank Nero is a good actor and charismatic, but he can't fight well. The script is also not good. It's so simple. Franko Nero is approaching his best friend in the army and war. He also protects him from the mafia, but he has sex (going to bed) with his wife and his friend knows it but don't say Nero negative. Is it possible in life? What a friendship! Finally, the film began with the genre; Ninja Movies. Also there is ninja master Sho Kasugi, but some combat scenes are not realistic and not fast even with shoo. This film is below average, even if it's a classic.
