I was told about this movie from a friend who saw him late at night during the week. He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went to the auction site and bought a movie. That's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It gives you laughter when it really doesn't. A terrible act and a terrifying story. Plus doesn't look like Michael Jackson ?! <br /> <br /> I still recommend buying this movie as one of the most fun things you'll ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this movie. <br /> <br /> Robots can't bluff ... PSYCHE! <br /> <br /> I have to say that special effects are really amazing ... PSYCHE! The DVD was probably still out when this movie came out, but if I had my way it would be right on VHS release yes people think it's wrong!
