OTHERS is an alleged "horror" film shot in the 1970s. They must not be confused with the similarly called OTHERS who played Nicole Kidman. The story is as follows: a woman with strange supernatural abilities teaches her grandson twins something called "game." One of these twins - Niles - is supposed to be "good". The idea sounds interesting as an abstract concept and the film has been adapted from the novel, I can only hope that the novel was interesting because the film was incredibly boring from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The realization of this film is very similar to a television movie of the kind that the UK residents could see on Channel 5. In fact, this movie seems to be a afternoon afternoon movie for this TV channel. And it would be a U-rated movie of the kind Disney to produce. But even the youngest of the children are more likely to be bored before they fear OTHERS. it is not About Power. <br /> <br /> Mr. Mulligan relies heavily on characters to manage the story. I haven't seen any of his other movies, but KILLING MOCKINGBIRD is a highly acclaimed criminal movie on this site. Unfortunately in the OTHERS, the characters are given too little to do so, and the modest scenario ensures that the film never releases as expected. Almost every scene takes place in the daytime! Think about it - a scene shot in open country in rural America during the day with a camera focusing on a large area. Sounds terrifying or atmospheric? Trust me, it's not. It comes as something more like LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE than horror. And yes, both of the above TV series and other movies were shot in California. There is a noticeable absence of danger or malice which makes the whole exercise rather nonsensical. The end was clearly meant to be very disturbing and perhaps influenced that other film from this time period. I will not reveal which movie but I will give 2 feet - the young boy was the main character and the movie is known. And I will add that this concept was used more effectively in the second film. Acting is actually pretty good and it's the only reason I have awarded 2 stars. The actors playing the twins, along with the actress who plays the grandmother, all tried with the poor material given to them. Diana Muldaur is totally unnecessary in an ungrateful role as a twin mother. Do not be fooled by its high billing on the cast list. She gets very little time on the screen and her presence just appears as a cash-in trick on her longtime television career to help attract television viewers. Attention I paid attention to the back of the DVD case (version 2 in the UK). The comparison was made with EXORCIST, which I considered to be an absolute insult to the film. No comparison. EXORCIST had everything that this film should contain, but not - tension, tension, humor on the tongue, very disturbing content, great acting, excellent characterization, and engaging the viewer. Ironically, EXORCIST was made only a year later, but in terms of style and design it seemed like a decade before the Dutch drama known as OTHERS. OTHERS comes as a work that would seem tame in the 1950s, let alone in the 1970s! MASSACRE, LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, SALEM LOT named just a few of them. For this reason, OTHERS prove even more disappointing. <br /> <br /> If someone finds out that the OTHER synopsis is interesting, they might want to read the book or do a little more information about what the book was about. I'd like to advise everyone to skip the movie.
