I'm a big fan of Thomas Harris, I've read all his novels at least 5 times and Hannibal is the book I really love most. That is why the film was my greatest disappointment and I really do not understand why some people give it nine or even ten. Either their requirements are very low or they have not read the book or both. Even though I didn't read the book, I would still consider the film an absolute average and I would give it Five. The horrible, mysterious atmosphere of the novel does not appear in the film once, when I first saw it in the cinema, I even fell asleep. Why was Margot Verger, a very important figure, completely omitted? Why did Barney turn out to be a stupid ignorant whose only ambition is to make money? And most of all, why was Starling's psychological process that caused the drugs Lecter applied to her down? Not to mention that the end was also omitted and totally changed? Well, the reasons why Jodie Foster refused to play Starling again are well known, and I accepted it, though, like many others, I am very disappointed because I have identified Starling with her. For stories like the Red Dragon, the Silence of the Lambs, or Hannibal, which has such psychological depth, it is very important to identify with the character when they are adapted to the screen, but as the Germans say it is "snow yesterday". Ridley Scott has made some incredibly good movies, but he doesn't live with this movie by his name. Jonathan Demme had just the right sense of conspiracy, the characters and their relationships in the silence of the lambs, too, should have done Hannibal. My only comfort is that I saw the movie only twice, it's been a long time ago and thank God for that reason I can't see the scenes from the movie when I read the novel. I'm so sorry, but I really don't recommend it to anyone.
