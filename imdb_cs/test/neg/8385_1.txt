This movie was so bad If any of them who played in the film read this including the director, HATE YOU! LOL, the blond woman who was running screaming through the woods. At least CRY RATHER THAN PICTURE AND KEEP DODGY HEAVY BREATHING !! and oh dear god, if he was a director who split the cameras into this, then he returned to normal work. No one wants to look at any frightened chin of a woman in the whole it. .. When I got home, I thought he rented a pron movie by acting and camera style.
