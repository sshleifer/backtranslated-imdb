Donald Pleasance and Peter Cushing teamed up in one horror movie; It always sounds like an amazing plan. Two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation, who used to play together in amazing genre sets like "The Flesh and Fiends" and "From Beyond the Grave", pairing in a satanic thematic film in the mid-1970s. How can it go wrong? Well, unfortunately it can. To my deepest regret "The Land of the Minotaurs" can hardly be called average, despite the cast, the exotic environment, the appealing title and the potentially large sounding premise. In a secluded small area in Greece, especially near the archaeological site, many tourists disappear because Baron Peter Cushing and his obedient followers are still alive with the Minotaur statue. Cushing, who never seemed more boring and not interested in any role he had played before, owns a vast medieval castle, and apparently in Greek it means that you also have additional archaeological ruins and an underground cave network. This is of course very useful if your hobby is kidnapping random campers and amateur archaeologists. When three of his young friends mysteriously disappear in the same area, Father Roch - a priest from several cities earlier - decides to investigate. "Earth Minotaur" is a boring and extremely slow dark effort that never makes any great attempts to create a satanic atmosphere and does not bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan details. The titular Minotaur, for example, is an interesting creation of Greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person, but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens the meaning. Instead, the film focuses on boring and too spoken sequences, and vocal inappropriate music has changed with experimental sounds. The only reason to even think about this big disappointment of the film is Donald Pleasance. His portrayal of a gross, overbearing and old-fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is always powerful and reliable.
