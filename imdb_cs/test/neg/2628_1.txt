Milo is a complete rip off of 1992 slasher film Mikey if you actually check that both movies have the same slogan but if you want to watch an incredibly funny movie with absolutely no plot at all ...... is a movie for you. Playing is terrible and flashback scenes are overwhelmingly confusing. The story of this atrocity is simple Milo Jeeder is a child with serious family problems, his father is an abortion doctor who keeps the unborn feou in a container (NICE!) And was desperate for his own child. bring one of these miscarried children to life and he named him ............. MILO !!!!! In addition to all the bad games, horrible overhead, the annoying sound of Milo's voice and ear, the piercing sound of the bell on his bike, if you take everything that is wrong, but it's still a bad but funny movie attempt. 1 out of 10
