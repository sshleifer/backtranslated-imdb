Last week I watched the production of Macbeth at the Royal Shakespeare Company. It was 25 years, filmed without props except swords, without furniture except chairs. It was RIVETING. Acting was great - all the actors trained the British. By contrast, this exercise ... yawning yawn yawn. Al Pacino, like Shylock, was tragic, heavy, and couldn't completely lose the accent of New York, despite long ... pauses ... between ..... lines ... The whole thing was rude, Even "comic" scenes were barely worth a smile, letting a lonely belly laugh. That should be funny. They tried to make it tragic. It wasn't just boring. I give him four points for costumes, scenery and Jeremy Irons, who is good at playing a boring, depressing, deeply expressed guy (can he be something else?)
