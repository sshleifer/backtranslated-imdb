Well, it's terrible, and I think it's terribly easy to break down this movie. What to expect from title, synopsis and actors such as Carol Gilley, Ralph Baker Jr., Dorothy Davis, Bill Thurman and my personal favorite Roger Ready. Yes, B star John Agar is here as a sheriff to get rid of the Texas landscape of robotic ape from a NASA experiment that collapsed. The film has terrifying performances, terrible scenery, terrible special effects and terrible lighting. I really can't find much good to say otherwise than when bad movies go, you can do a lot worse when it comes to finding something terrible to sit on. She is incredibly short and has many moments of unintended humor. Missed suggestions, faux pas lighting, off-screen terror, incredibly untamed score and, of course, John Agar, trying to make his level as much as the core of a serious performance movie in the middle of this mud. The beginning is the hardest part to sit on, as it seems that it takes forever for these two teens to get their coming for a ride in the woods down the Texas back road where the big monkey will soon return its revenge in its own terrible way ... Yeah, correctly! Night Fear! Bah!
