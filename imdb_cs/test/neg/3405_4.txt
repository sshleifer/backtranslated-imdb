I am very on Waverly Hills and for the first time I watched Death Tunnel The Movie.Could not be much worse. Then I heard that the documentary was coming out and enthusiastically thought that because it was a documentary, it would be more serious and wouldn't have terrible special effects. the way the documentary should be. \ tWaverly Hills doesn't need help with the goofy effects of their fine just as it is. Tours are $ 20.00 per person and $ 100.00 for 8 hours overnight investigations per person minimum group 10 for night investigations. Tours must be set up in advance. Great place for Ghost Hunter!
