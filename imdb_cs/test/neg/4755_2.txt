Indeed, I really don't understand how the movie could get ratings greater than 4 here on IMDb. It's just a huge mess and I have to admit that I really liked AvP 1: Near to any story, all right, I can live with it, but at least they got to the point almost at once. AvP 2 no. After a stupid assumption has been put forward, there are more than half an hour of stupid and inappropriate clich√©s of teenagers, stupid as hellish dialogue and close to nothing else, except for a few Alien scenes that feel like an excuse for the first half of the movie and the predator scene that makes you wonder if those who make the film even watched any other Predator movie or didn't even care about it. After the crap finally gets to where the Predator starts attacking the alien, or at least pretends to do so. And the boy, it's a Predator stupid, blind and deaf. That's horrible. He was behind me as he managed to earn the things he had. He misses almost every shot, just noticing strangers when they're right on his face, or if it's absolutely necessary for the scenario to move where he must be. He is still surprised by the small teenage teenagers and deputies. What it should be? After the first hour of this outrage, I was more or less constantly shaking my head on every scene. Near to any scene in this movie goes through without incredibly stupid dialogues, stupid actions of the Predator or stupid lack of there or stupid actions from our "heroes". Then, it finally ended. To my surprise, not only my friends and I did not know whether to laugh or cry, but everyone I heard when I left the room was half-crying, half laughing at those 1 and a half hours they had lost unnecessarily. <br /> <br /> Don't look. Never.
