I don't want to sound here as I will confess it, but to call it another cult classic is another example that filmmakers who lower standards are for themselves. This film is an offense to everything we have sacred, not a good "artsy" insult. This film becomes the archetype of the PAINFUL dialogue, which brings even more pathetic actors.
