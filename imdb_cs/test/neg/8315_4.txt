Hi, All, Oh, Boy ... This one is a lulu. It has really bad background music whenever they can push it in. There are three bad guys who, in my opinion, are the stars of this. They beat people and cut people and crashed trucks and bulldozers into people. Common things. The woman who sends them to her mission is unable to move her mouth as she speaks. It's like watching a bad ventriloquist that's her own dummy. He walks as if balancing an egg on his head. The wardrobe is for men and has been a free style for 70 years for women to be a good sister. Evil novocain mouth woman wearing red. Silk frock maybe, or maybe just a poplin windbreaker that is too big. It allows us what happened earlier in the movie. The policemen are fine. Some bad, some good, all stupid except two. Two of them could work again in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> The film begins with an interesting and ending surprise. Medium. The guy in the restaurant, who gives the star a free hamburger, has a good job. He's like a 1940s actor. Big voice. This one is a bit too long. The lady with the balls in her mouth could only have a few lines and the rest could be called a parrot. It would be easier to understand the bird. Her sword scene could have been worked out by a trained woodpecker. Tom Willett
