Positive reviews on this site are set by filmmakers and their friends. This film is amateur in direction, acting, in fact in every aspect. If IMDb allows creators to dictate what's written about their movies, then it's a very sad thing. This movie has a market premise, but it's totally scary. The film is subjective, so everyone has their own opinion. But this movie is on the same level as Ed Wood's work, but without any magic. Thinking differently shows the bad taste of the highest order. This is not a personal thing. I don't know anyone associated with the film. I'm just a movie lover who feels that the reviews on this page are completely inaccurate, and so I felt the need to balance and give a more accurate view of the film. It's very poorly executed and the direction is below the film-making threshold by numbers. Playing is worse what ever made a movie. The best thing about this movie is the poster and DVD cover art. There's no time for that.
