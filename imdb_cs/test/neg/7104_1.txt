This movie doesn't know what it wants to be: is it making fun of action movies in general? Is it satirical? Is it supposed to be a black comedy? That's really one of the worst movies ever made. Lori Petty is uncomfortable. I said what everyone else thinks. It's bad enough that she's such a terrible actress (Route 666, Bates Motel), but she doesn't qualify as an average b-movie actress either. Her laughter voice, strange mannerisms and poor comic timing dot this movie from start to finish until you just don't want your head to vise and end the pain. Do yourself a favor and avoid the movie at all costs. You'll be glad you did it.
