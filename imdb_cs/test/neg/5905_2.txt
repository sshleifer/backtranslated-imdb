This film begins with the main character lying in a coma in the hospital ward, attended by two orders. The unconscious main character is heard in the voice, saying the orders are gay. Serious kisses. I watched it in the DVD version and I suspect it should be funny? it was called a DVD case comedy, after all, and so it goes on, if I saw it in the cinema, I would probably hear some of the audience roar with laughter because it is so funny? to be in a comedy, although it is fascinating to think about what is funny and what is not, this film unfortunately only provides arguments about what is not. Something funny, people like Ernst Lubitsch, Billy Wilder or Mel Brooks have done it, but you have to know mechanics, I suppose. Director and co-founder Dani Levy does not bother about these mechanics, thinking that some things are just funny, that two lines are homosexuals and they kiss, for example, a man in a coma. Don't get me wrong, some people can do that funny, Dani Levy can't, not for me anyway. The main problem I have with this movie is that I don't see a reason for how the main characters behave. I could not understand why two brothers, one Orthodox Jew from West Germany, one third carbon copy of Fast Eddie Felson from former East Germany, do not like each other strongly. They are both rather bland characters. Their children are boring, except that they are sexually attracted to each other (well, now she is a lesbian, but she raises a daughter she has with her cousin). But even these incestuous relationships? If something is embarrassed - just go through it as an excuse because the screenwriters couldn't come up with anything better. Acting is not bad, I actually came as quite a bit of Udo Semel, although I was reminded more by Chancellor Helmut Kohl (lighter version) than by the venerable Orthodox Jew. The direction itself is not really bad, but maybe Levy should stick to directing movies and leave the script to someone else. I heard he did a comedy about Hitler. Oi, Vai!
