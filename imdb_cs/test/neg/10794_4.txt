Camals Are Coming is rather an unsatisfactory 1934 British comedy. Certainly not. It's a couple going to Egypt to capture some wasteland smugglers. That would be much better if it were done as a drama instead of a comedy that forgets it a lot. It's pretty stupid. Depsite it, there are some good actions and location scenes. The cast is led by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as a love interest. One film is enough for this movie. Overall disappointment. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 stars out of 5.
