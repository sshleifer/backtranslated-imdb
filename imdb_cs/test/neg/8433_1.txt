I've seen a lot of movies in my time and this really stands out as the absolute worst movie ever made in the history of filmmaking anywhere in the world. It took me 3 attempts to watch this movie. The first time I fell asleep after 15 minutes of boredom, maybe because I was already tired as it was late at night. The second effort I managed to get over 35 minutes, but again I found myself asleep. I can go on and on, but I think you're getting it ...... nothing happens in this movie. Total loss of time and money. This movie really sucks. Watch it and you'll know what I'm talking about. If you can get 40 minutes into this movie without shaking your head and wondering what the hell is the point, then you're really a masochist. The only reason I gave this movie 1 out of 10 is that 0 was not provided as an option. I thought the world must be warned before you hire or worse ... buy this waste. LATER!
