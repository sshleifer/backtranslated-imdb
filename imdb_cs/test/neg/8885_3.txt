This film had very few good points, special effects and acting were very certain. But it was a movie made on a low budget, so you don't expect much from it, it has some laughter (I doubt it's intended :)). The scene where the old woman bends and touches the manure that was on the floor then puts it in the nose and goes to CHUPACABRA! in a very stupid hoarse voice was invaluable. All in all, if you have nothing else to look at and just want to laugh at a really crappy movie trying to raise money for the Blair Witch Project, then grab it for something other than bother.
