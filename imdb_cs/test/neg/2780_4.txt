Dark Harvest is a very low budget production made by a lot of amateurs ranks who manage to leave as a kind of semi-professional film. Unfortunately, bad effects, wooden gaming and a non-original story make it an average horror at best. In any case, Dark Harvest is not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it's just nothing special and it doesn't have anything that requires a second watch or a chance to continue. You know the director has doubts about his own horror movie when a) there is some nonsense nudity and b) the movie is so short that at the end of the credits he adds some rather boring outtakes that nobody really cares about because the movie wasn't that good! A slightly better film that I can't help feeling was the inspiration for Dark Harvest's eighties film 'Scarecrows', which is an OK movie but still quite average. Dark Harvest is not as bad as some other comments say it is, but I don't think you'll be too entertained. One thing I also have to comment on is the character of Angela, who has a really terrible English accent! What was the point? Maybe it will give a certain touch of class? Yeah, right! The English do not say "WAAHTAAH" when they want to say "water" and I don't care about which part of England they are! If you can't find a true English actress or a non-English actress who could admire a great English accent (not many of them), then DO NOT WORK! Sheesh! Final score: 4/10
