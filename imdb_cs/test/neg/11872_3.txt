The detonator takes place in Bucharest, where a former CIA government agent named Sonni Griffith (Wesley Snipes) traced an arms dealer named Dimitru (Matthew Leitch), but things went wrong and Dimitru discovered that Sonni was working for the US government. After the big blow of most of Dimitra's men was killed by Sonni, who is unhappy with the local Romanian police, Flint's chief man (Michael Brandon) decided to send Sonni back to the US while protecting Nadia Cominski (Silvia Colloca), who is also sent back to the US. But it turned out that Nadia wants Dimitra and his football club to own Joseph's chief (Tim Dutton), who needs her to finish the neural gas bomb deal they intend to release in Washington to kill millions of people ... <br /> < This American and Romanian co-production was directed by Po-Chih Leong and Detonator confirms that behind any shadow of doubt Wesely Snipes joined the club, which was eliminated from the action movie that is included in the generic group. action movies in Eastern European locations, yep Snipes joined such lights as Jean-Claude Van Damme, Steven Seagal, Dolph Lundgren, Rutger Hauer & Chuck Norris. I give Snipes a little credit because he stayed a little longer than the rest with the excellent Blade: Trinity (2004), which is still fresh in many viewers' minds (every movie he has made since then came directly to DVD). but it had to happen sooner or later, as many of the names I mentioned Snipes lived on the reputation of several great movies and when you look at his career, he was in the bad movies that are good. Like recent JCVD ​​& Seagal Detonator movies, it's pretty awful. Martin Wheeler's screenplay is as predictable, boring, and figures as anything out there. The detonator is a movie you expect on a dark cable TV channel that plays at 2am. The detonator is full of clichés, Snipes is forced into a situation where he has to protect a woman, and at first they don't like each other, but in the end they are in love, his closest friend at the CIA turns out to be a traitor, uncomfortable with the book's boss. he's a pretty decent man, Snipesu can run around shooting in Bucharest, killing and blowing people as if it doesn't matter and he's never going to be arrested, the action is boring and forgotten, a bad guy owns a football club so there is a lot of annoying football terminology & there are not even any funny one-liners. Up, Detonator looks cheap with a car chase, in which two cars never seem to get over 30 mph signs. OK action scenes are quite well staged, but there are only a few and far from each other and absolutely forgotten in the "bad snipers and missing, in return Snipes shoots the wrong guy and kills him". There is a half decent car accident and explosion, but very little else. It seems that one of the Detonators was shot at a Romanian football stadium, I think I'd rather watch the game for 90 minutes than this movie. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 15,000,000, the Detonator is, but not so much is actually happening. Set and filmed in Bucharest, Romania. Acting is not so great, Snipes just doesn't seem to be interested and feels like he's there for the money I don't blame him for. The detonator is another poor action film cliché in the lead role was the actor and ensemble in Eastern Europe. Why does Sony do these things? We do not recommend, there is a much better fare event out there.
