If you find hopelessly amateur acting, an uninteresting story, fake blood and all mindless shooting, then you can actually have a pretty good time to watch this low-rent, cheesy movie. You may also want to try a pretty good catfighting sequence that is being offered, even if it's not good enough for the rest of the movie to be worth sitting on. (**)
