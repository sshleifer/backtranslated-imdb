I seem to be in a minority, but I thought "Radio" was pretty awful. It seemed to contain almost all the clich√©s in these types of "heartfelt" films. The motivation for radio characters has never been explained. We were just supposed to accept that everyone liked the radio except a few bad apples. <br /> <br /> In the story you could see almost all those great moments from 100 meters away. When the film wanted you to go "Awww" or pull out your tissue, I rolled my eyes and wished I would watch "Rudy" instead. Casting was a few good performances. Too bad they didn't get a better film.
