Aussie Shakespeare for 18-24 set.with blood, blood and more blood.and a good dose of nudity. It will not be for each of them at a level for violent for some too cheap for most. done on a low budget trying and there best, but it only works sporadically. and this macbeth just seems to be missing, its just not convincing. Although there is some good deal on the part of the majority you will not get into the head, especially mecbeths. best performance came from gary sweet and weirdest mick molly. If your to Shakespeare then see, but if you like your mature cheese you will love it.it is not a bad movie, but it is not that good one. sam peckenpah would love it, that is if it was filmed like western. I waited a lot from the way I loved romper stomper. but it was an empty effort.
