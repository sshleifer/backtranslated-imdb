The game was flat (at least none of the actors sounded like it was in the morning), and the quality of the film and sound made me think of the 70th week of the week bomb. The only thing that told me that it wasn't really a 70's movie was a reference to DNA testing. But for me, being an Eastern Orthodox, the worst thing about this ... movie ..... was the total romance of religion. Romania is 88% Orthodox, but you never know that from this film, Father Soren is Irish. And I would know, even if I didn't see the actor playing in Michael Sullivan's Irish pub in Star Trek: Voyager "Fairhaven" episodes. The bishop wore Roman robes (and even the Orthodox bishops do not wear their robes for the record if they do not say liturgy, especially if they live in a monastery). The only non-Roman conveniences I saw were a tri-color cross on the church door, and I even had to squint it to see it. The first reviewer said manufacturers did their research. Well, if that's true, they spoiled the religious aspect of the film.
