First off, I'm a huge fan of crap movies. Grade B is always good for laughter. Unfortunately, this movie is just bad. I dressed like a Zombie for a party and my makeup looked better than those in this movie. Especially the great guy at the beginning, it looked as if he had drawn a crayon on his face. Acting is so bad that I don't have to comment on why. The effect is also extremely amateur, with obvious blood tubes shooting a straight stream of blood out of the back zombie head when they shoot. It also seems that many people commenting on this film are trying to increase their ratings. Nobody without a finger in the cake would rate this movie above 5/10. Frankly, it is shameful that people who have worked on this film are increasing their own ratings. <br /> <br /> I recommend everyone to avoid this movie, it's not a loss of 90 minutes of life. Absolutely terrible.
