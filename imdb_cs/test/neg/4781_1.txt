This movie was really terrible. It wasn't kind of scary or surprising. I went to see him with a bunch of friends and said, "The ruin ruined my night." <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie in theaters, renting, or even watching a movie on TV by accident. It's an absolute waste of an hour and a half. The story was almost non-existent, the characters were terribly underdeveloped and gave no story at all about what was happening, and then at the end they completely opened it, as if preparing to continue.
