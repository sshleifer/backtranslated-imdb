I have to agree with the critics on this, who all said, "Leave it alone." Why did they have to do this re-make 1960's "Psycho," I don't know. My guess is that they wanted to reach out to a new audience, and the modern actors were the answer because they were major changes. The dialogue was the same and the story was the same. On the one hand, I applaud them for not doing it with a lot of profanity and nudity, which made it a thin film. But if everything goes well, why would he bother if you didn't improve on Tony Perkins, Janet Leigh and the original cast? Honestly thinks Vince Vaughn will be as good or better than Perkins? Are you kidding me? Ann Heche, with her short husband's haircut, will be better than Leigh? I do not think so! Yes, the colors here were nice, but this is black and white photography that helped make the 1960 version so scary. It's perfect for a story, not a lot of green and pink! Again, I think the filmmakers were banking to an audience that had never seen the original. This was just a stupid project that never had to get out of the country.
