This is probably my favorite episode. I've been living in Cape Girardeau for some time. I can tell you that there is no ocean boat or shrimp, fresh crab or shells near Missouri. Cape Girardeau is the only inland cape on the Mississippi River. The license plates seemed to come from Mississippi, which might explain why there was so much racial tension. Missouri and Mississippi are two completely different states that do not touch each other. There are many roads in and out of the city and none of them are Route 6 or Route 666. This inaccuracy was very disturbing. Cassie also didn't seem to want to hang Dean if she was well educated. I didn't buy them as a couple and I didn't enjoy a long love scene. Yeah was more of Dean's style.
