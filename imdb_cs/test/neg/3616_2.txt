I really don't think it is necessary to write a review of a movie with a title as ridiculous as "Snake Island," but even in the abstract definition of the genre it hit a new minimum, so my anger must be known. . The only reason I bothered to watch this incredibly bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad, it was really late at night, I couldn't sleep, and in the past, really bad movies would drain energy and make me sleep. It became very fast very early on that this film was going to be terrible, but it condescendingly below these expectations. The film was directed and written by Wayne Crawford, who also stars in the film as a tourist guide on an African river that ends up having to split his team on a remote island called Snake Island until another ship will not come to pick up. They hang out, drunk, and then become the object of the onslaught of poisonous snakes who are on a mission to purify their island of human beings. <br /> <br /> If your jaw dropped to the last sentence of my second paragraph, don't bother reloading it, it's your first time. Frankly, I prefer my creation when creatures simply invade mindlessly stupid hunger people, not because they have a mission. They're not mutant snakes. They are not giants like what you see in "Anaconda". They are just ordinary, everyday African snakes like mambas and vipers - only they have brains to form armies, occupy causes, work together on human traps, understand our language and even dance! Did you manage to draw again? Well, it will continue to fall. Amount in the middle of this terrible B-movie, about the part where I have given up, the human figures drink around the campfire and then suddenly fall apart into some kind of orgy. And while dancing naked and such, snakes hunt them at once and stop. The combination of this scene and the scene in which we find that snakes, some of the stupidest creatures on the planet, have formed an alliance against human beings for some strange reason, have proved too much for my bad brain. And just when I couldn't get to the lower level with the creators, the snakes began to sing. <br /> <br /> People in the movie? Let's say that I had never drowned on creatures to kill everyone so quickly. I couldn't stand it anymore. I really don't think I have to go on; you get a picture. If there is something that makes "Snake Island" some other than its rivals, it is that it dares to try to be even more stupid and that is not a success. Why? Just why I continued to submit to these really bad movies, I think I never know. But "Snake Island" will hit a whole new level. It's a cheap, cheesy excuse for a movie that makes "Anaconda", a helpless film of snakes, looking brilliant and sophisticated and exciting as Steven Spielberg's "Jaws". You were warned.
