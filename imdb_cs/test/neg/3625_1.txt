I don't like this show very much. I mean, basically everyone in the school is perfect and rich, and I doubt the boarding school will look as good. And why suddenly allows girls to go to school? Isn't that kind of weird? Anyways, Jamie Lynn spears CANNOT to act. He always has the same facial expression that really troubles me. He is basically emotionless and all the boys like her. <br /> <br /> and shouldn't chase her for her love? it's not that hard! really! None of these shows is real life and she's not a "girl like me" because most ordinary girls don't go to boarding school, have no designer clothes, and don't live on the beach. fake fake false.
