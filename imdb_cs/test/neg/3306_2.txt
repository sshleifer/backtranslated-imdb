Warning: This may include SPOILERS !! First of all I watch a lot of Lifetime movies and realize they're just lifelong movies. Some are great (really), some are good and some are bad. Unfortunately, this film falls into the second category. It actually started with some potential .... one, divorced hard working mom (who gets out of work at 2:00 am) guy cuts off while driving home from work and let us say it doesn't take too well. Stalking starts immediately by hanging up phone calls and escalate to home where it is broken and completely destroyed. So she goes to her mother's night and the next morning her mother throws her car away. It seems that it's just a pain in the ass for our heroine who deals with her by going for lingerie and jewelry shopping! So the police put her and her son in the local motel to keep up and what my mom does? She goes to work and leaves the child alone at night in a strange motel and tells him to order PIZZA !!! I could not believe it! Then it's really stupid! And the end just made me angry because it was so ridiculous and typical. Too bad because it seemed to have options.
