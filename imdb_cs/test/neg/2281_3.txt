By-the-numbers, Oscar-hungry biopic about late, great singer Ray Charles. In * Ray * is one - exactly one - great scene. It occurs during the memory of the young Charles, after the boy became completely blind. He stepped into the house where he shared with his mother and went to the chair. She shouts at her mother; she, in accordance with her philosophy that one should "stand on her own feet", watches quietly and thoughtfully from the kitchen, waits to see if the boy can rely on his own resources. The boy proves that it is a challenge, using ears and memory, to place the kettle on the stove, near the fireplace, grass that blows in the wind outside the window, clogging the cricket over the board. floor. The film stops here; expands; breathes - though only 40 seconds. The scene is a much needed departure from the otherwise noisy Taylor Hackford movie. According to "noisy" I don't mean music that is of course excellent. I AM refer to the sound effects (big BOOMS! Prev Next flashback) and otherane dialog ("I'm talking to you as FRIEND, Ray," etc). On the visual side, Hackford is just as nonsensically brilliant: a sepia filter through camera lenses during flashes; whirling dervish 360s from camera crane etc. etc. All modern equipment. What a horrible movie style is shown in * Ray *! - a style that is too common in "important" films of the past decade (Scorsese * Aviator * is stylistically very similar to this movie). These tricks are used to confuse the clich√©-ridden scenario. Some of us will not be confused. Some of us are also not quite ready to accept Jamie Foxx's performance as anything but excellent mimicry. It is true that Foxx resembles Ray Charles: he walks like Charles, speaks like Charles and even twitches like Charles. Foxx's imitation during a live performance is technically perfect. I hate Mr. Foxx his Oscar; he deserved it. (This year it was quite a weak field.) But one asks if Foxx really supports Charles. The actor achieves one big moment when he insists on trying to try out what his friends are shooting: he registers, if only for a short while, disgusted with injustice, is blind and the life of darkness. The film seems to want to dramatize the struggle within Karla between the clear salvation of music and the forgotten heroin, with his blindness as a battle point between the two compulsions. But the damn movie just won't have time: it will bounce from triumph to triumph, never really stop for any look at men. One has to find the STRETCH dramatic tension; man must deliver drama FOR the movie. In other words, you have to imagine a better film than this one. In his haste to the famous conclusion * * Ray * introduces, then avoids, some great movie ideas: his first days on the film "Chitlin Circuit"; his bold musical innovation for the Atlantic label; the problem of his heroin addiction; the inevitable artistic compromises that are associated with enormous success; the importance of a person to fight civil rights (touching the film in the movie, about 3 minutes of projection time) and much more. The creators are too lazy to focus on one of these elements. Two and a half hours of observing a man overcoming one adversity of fate for another can make us feel good, but such a film is not necessarily a great work of art. This kind of approach certainly does not provide a deeper insight into the subject matter of the film - and should it not be a glance at the true purpose of this film? If I wanted a list of jobs from Ray Charles, I'd simply include him in Google. <br /> <br /> 3 stars out of 10 - plus 2 stars strictly for music.
