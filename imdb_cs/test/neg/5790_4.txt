I only learned from this film about the little meaning I had not known from CNN and The New York Times. (And I did not follow the Enron case obediently like some others.) The film did a very bad job of explaining what "business" was in which Enron was in fact that it could actually be up-up-up than She began to hide her debts. in entities created by Andy Fastow. It also significantly underplayed the role played by Arthur Andersen and Vinson and Elkins in practice validation that were then found to be illegal. Nor did it go as far as it might be in exploring what "investors" - all the prominent bankers - thought they were doing. With 24-hour wired networks, Discovery Channel and Channel History, documentaries have expanded. I've seen many in the past year that were better than this.
