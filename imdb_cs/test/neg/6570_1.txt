When I first saw him 9 years ago when I was nine, I thought it was a stink. I'm 18 and I still think it stinks. I mean geez no special effects or anything, it was boring and a little against climate. My cousin once watched, and George Takai (Sulu) was still talking about how much better it was, but they were constantly budgeting. It would be a big episode, but it was a horrible movie.
