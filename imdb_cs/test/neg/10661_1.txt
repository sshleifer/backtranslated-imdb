This movie has to be the worst movie of 2007, it was just really bad and I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's so bad, I don't think they're making really bad Hollywood movies? Hamish should stick to singing instead of acting because he just couldn't act at all, God was so bad, I think he was so bad in the movie that he made Mallika Sherawat as a better actress than him, as for her performance, she plays the same role in every movie, god it is just so boring to watch her, i think what men see in this woman? yeah she has the body of god but where's the talent ???? I haven't seen it yet and I don't think I will ever be in this measure. Although Hamish falls in love with Rio, now a 15-year-old girl can act, my god was the best actor in the movie and she's not looking at 15 at all, looks like 21, but her performance was brilliant in the movie. bless her she was really good, I hope to see more in the future. So Ria falls in love with Himasha, but her father wants to marry someone else, a typical Bollywood movie, but hiccups (can only happen in Bollywood movies) and they both get married. Well I would put th music 10/10 it was great to have a movie hit, the songs were really amazing and brilliant. Anyway, the only thing I can say is go and buy music and not watch a movie.
