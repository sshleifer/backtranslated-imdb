This film attempts to capitalize on the success of Richard Curtis's films, especially "Love Actually" - a series of disparate scenes that follow the love lives of different couples. <br /> <br /> It's a great idea badly done. The script tries to be a little clever and just doesn't resonate. Most acting is embedded, which is more a reflection of the director than the actors. The version I saw (on the plane) was called "Park Scenes", which is a better name because not all scenes were "sexual". I was so looking forward to this movie, but in the end it's disappointing. Don't bother.
