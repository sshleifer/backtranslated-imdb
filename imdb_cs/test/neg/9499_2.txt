I don't know where to start. Maybe the whole idea of ​​this movie was just a disaster that expected it to happen. There is nothing mildly funny about the kidnapping. I don't know what was more offensive - the theme or "performance" of David Arquette. It was like watching a bull that it was a penis cut off, though I thought he felt better after him. Filmmakers should find something different about Sinatra than kidnapping his son to show up (like I don't know his TALENT AS SINGER !!!!). His family wouldn't have to spend the horror. I thank God that it has just been shown on HBO and has not been released in theaters. Please do not look at it if you have your own respect.
