Let's face it, that's a pretty bad movie. However, when you go in ready to make fun of it you can survive the experience. Tom Conway (who spends most of the film wearing funky chapeau) uses a local witch doctor and mad science to create a "perfect" being. He is drunk and is in a dress bag. Ugly is kind. But it won't kill him because he uses a good girl as his subject. He needs bad bad girls. Marla English and Lance Fuller are two tiny crooks in search of an African gold.Acting lessons for Mrs. English should be at the top of the search list.She is a bad girl and allows everyone to know that performing worthy junior school play.Mike "Touch" Connors is a white guide to English & Fuller kon to lead the expedition. English and Conway finally meet and it's a hell-made match. Come to his voodoo creatures because she will do something (stress anything) to get what she wants. You will do anything to stop the agony of this movie at this time. <br /> <br /> What this movie interesting for me was Conway wearing that funky tribal hat / headband / flower piece! Still trying to figure out what kind of dead animal it was. Really bad cinema.
