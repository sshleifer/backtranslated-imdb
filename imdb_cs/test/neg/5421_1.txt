Oh no! I really destroyed Manhunt in space. I think this flopper deserves worse than Manhunt. It's not anywhere, and mushroom growth has been more exciting than this impudence. Poor Cleolanta. He's so misunderstood. Smug Rocky struts around and fortunately, there is no mention of Winky about his "gay nightlife". There's a lot more talking, really awful (watching) space marriage on the rocks and a lousy spatial effect. Then there's Bobby. You decide who's more annoying: Bobby or Winkster? Personally, I would have thrown them out of the air chamber into a black hole, not before I submit them to a killer body that eats foreign mutants. At least there's Vena. It's just a space girl!
