Years ago, "MA2412" tried to be a "regional hit" in Austria. One thing is for sure: I hope no one else will ever have to see this. Perhaps if you are familiar with the original sitcom, it might be interesting to watch what director Sicheritz made in his series. I think he missed his chances and wasted time and money. So far, many directors and writers have been unable to make a 90min movie concept (consider Alf, Inspector Gadget ...). You can see how hard it is by watching "MA 2412". The result of this experiment, in my opinion, tastes like a never-ending TV episode (and not a good one). You will not be able to deliver a conspiracy, humor is trying too hard and directing seems very restless - as it is for visual style. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it that way.
