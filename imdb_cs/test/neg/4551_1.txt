I'm proud to be a Dutchman, I'm really shocked by the fast moves. Why? why this cheap deal? Why this story that just sucks? why a dozen sequels? why about why? They add a lot of hot Dutch chicks in an attempt to save this movie from redemption and guess what? all the subconscious breezergirlies in Holland go and see it. I was forced to watch it at the party. all the girls go crazy when Daan Schuurmans entered the screen, all the boys took another beer and growled ... But the thing that really bothered me is the fact that this kind of movies is the only kind of film that Dutch filmmakers can produce. (except "Van God Los" and "Lek") This does not prove our superiority in other countries. 13 year old girls ... Johan Nijenhuis, I hope you will burn forever!
