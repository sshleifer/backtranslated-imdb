I found a movie in my local video store and was surprised to see it on DVD. I have heard of an explicit sexual scene, terrible violence and notorious debauchery. I sat and watched and started laughing! Set decorations and artistic direction were cheap and fake; nudity was sardonic and incredibly unsexy; the story was badly written and it was just a show of incredibly beautiful and talented actors who were hostage to quote the worst dialogue he ever wrote! The immense relationship between Caligola (Malcolm McDowell) and his beautiful sister Drusilla (Theresa Ann Savoy, a vulnerable beauty) can't be taken seriously ... it's neither shocking nor repulsive! Apparently Peter O'Toole and John Geilgud were held hostage during the making of this film, fortunately, they die in the first thirty minutes of the film. The movie was a joke and I was still amused when they used a quote from the Bible! Mark no less. If you're looking for a shock value, this movie will disappoint you. If you are looking for the cult value of the camp, you will be even more disappointed. I know I was. I have seen shocking and that's two hours of your life you'll never have.
