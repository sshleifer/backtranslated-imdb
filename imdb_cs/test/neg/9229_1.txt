Yeah, it's me! Sir, I'm sitting over stupid, so you don't have to. <br /> <br /> What do you think this is? Could it be a woman who calls a sex line and arrange a meeting with the young men in a remote area? Then her boyfriend puts on her clothes and cuts her throat with a razor before releasing her money? Wow, what's the guess! And when I tell you that the cop who is on the case is forced to contact the sexy DA assistant to stuff these infants, what conclusion do you get? Do you think sexy DA will secretly wear a fragile red dress to try to meet a drag queen, but then end up being kidnapped and a maverick officer must be rescued? (who has already handed his weapon and badge) ZING! You get 10 points! Honestly, this film bored me to tears. Why do people insist on this kind of waste? It is a waste of our time, their time, and yet they are continuing despite the fact that they ... are shooting a movie that no one knows about. If he has some redeeming features, there's the fact that he has some of the most beautiful ladies I've ever seen in the movie. I hope they spent what scant wages they earned on a lot of botox and colonial irrigation. They look great on a Vogue cover, or they sit on top of a car in a bikini. They should just leave acting to professionals (like Shannon Tweed). When I was talking about a future career, I came across the director the next day. Certainly prepare a delicious chicken burger meal. I must also say that the uniform really suits him. I asked him about the "Party Line" and his eyes went to the floor before he muttered something about the other chips. Well, guess it didn't work out completely. Never mind, they'll let him take the drive tomorrow! Hurray!! 1/10
