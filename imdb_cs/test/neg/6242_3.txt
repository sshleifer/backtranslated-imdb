Now I know why it is possible to buy this film for so cheap in video stores. I was curious because he still had three big stars that were among the "B" movies that the video couldn't even give away! The answer is, it's a movie that would attract a very limited audience: over 50 crowds with very liberal feelings. Who else who follows Robert Redford, Willem Dafoe and Helen Mirren basically gives the basic message that "cheating your wife is fine until you still love her." This is a nice "good news", especially at the end of this strange story of kidnapping. Who wrote this scenario ..... Bill Clinton? I say "strange" because the kidnapper is the most beautiful kidnapper (Dafoe) you've ever seen, to the end. Often he abolishes his hostage (Redford), which no kidnapper would risk, has occasional family talks, etc. It's all ridiculous! Well, the L.A Times says it's an "intelligent thriller". Ha ha. Well, that confirms what most people know about L.A. Times. For those of you who believe and have not seen it, it will not damage more gigantic holes in this story, especially at the end. The fact is, it's an insult to someone with intelligence. Anyway, you can't deceive all people because critics haven't found out yet. Here's another movie that they were offering and that was justifiably bombarded at the box office and video store.
