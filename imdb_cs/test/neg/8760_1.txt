Always enjoy Classic Horror movies, but this film was a great waste of time and if it wasn't for John Carradine to play a mad man who is able to control human beings through his experiments. This film was created during World War II and John Carradine was a German Nazi who tried to find a human weapon against the world. Bob Steele plays in many roles as a cowboy or gangster, and in this picture Bob seemed to be bored with death by his role in this movie and this is his first movie. Mantan Moreland (Jeff) performed an excellent performance with a great comedy that helped keep the audience's attention. I hate to criticize the 1943 film, but that's really a big disappointment. If you like John Carradine and the role he played as Count Dracula during many movies during the 1940s, you might just want to watch John do his best.
