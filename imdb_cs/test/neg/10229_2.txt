Also titled -> Magic Castle -> This one is a stretch. Why bother? Why create another rockbart and then add another story that has almost nothing to do with the game nor the Swan Lake. Just some rockbart girlfriend, stolen book of forbidden art, and original characters (no votes remain). It is detached to its poles this is a continuation of the filament. Another thing you know that a bird has memorized "forbidden art" and Princess Swan 4: a magical bird is born. Fortunately, even though the chapters are supposed to be closed and begin, but the bad ends the trilogy ends.
