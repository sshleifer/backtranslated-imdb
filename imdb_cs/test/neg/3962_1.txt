If you're like me and watching the original "Benji" phenomenon from a distance, you will finally see a movie 30 years later, you may be shocked to find out how horrible it is, and more mystified than ever about its popularity back in 1974. <br /> <br /> My judgment is not entirely objective, because I tend to have a positive attitude towards children's films and hence considerably limited it. On the other hand, I always hated this particular dog, a feature of the last few seasons of "Petticoat Junction". Never a spectacular show, early episodes without dogs were at least a nice show of beautiful actresses and the performance of the dog was shortened to their screen. Benji is a 86-minute mega-dose dog, following him on several daily circuits across the city of McKinney, Texas. If it sounds boring, you will be advised to give "Benji" a broad birth and never allow your remote control to fall into the hands of the "Benji" fan (if it still exists). Unlike "My Dog Skip", "Monkey Business" or "Because Winn-Dixie", human actors are extremely weak in cast. "Big Valley's" Peter Breck plays a strict standard father and seems to be embarrassed to appear in something like this chrome. <br /> <br /> If one of your children (of any age) seems to find "Benji" fun, you should consider reducing their medications. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
