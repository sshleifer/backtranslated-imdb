There were times when Joel Schumacher was quite high on my favorite director list. Back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when his name joined several great movies like "The Lost Boys", "Flatliners" and "Falling Down", he was indeed one of the most talented directors in Hollywood. Then came the stupid "Batman" sequel, unfortunately, and after it seemed that every potentially noble scenario had turned into a huge mess in Schumacher's hands. Both "8MM" and "Phone Booth" could have been much better movies and even the incredibly imbecile concept "The 23" should be made into a somewhat more impressive and entertaining movie. Literally from start to finish, "Number 23" desperately attempts to be a mysterious and mysterious thriller, and therefore uses all the terrible clich√©s of a great book of cinematography, including heavily narrated narratives, flashbacks, disordered structures, multi-personality characters. , numerous twists that grow increasingly absurd and ominously asylum. But nothing simply helps because of the basic stupidity of the basic formula and the clear commitment of cast and crew. Just as you are trying to connect with a leading character and be open to crazy theories, this still remains a two-digit movie and two-digit numbers are not scary. Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey in a rare non-comic role) is a bored animal hunter whose wife Agatha gives him a bizarre book about his birthday. The book tells of all kinds of devilish theories and strange coincidences associated with number 23. Walter almost immediately identifies with the protagonist of the book (a slimy detective investigating a grim suicide case) and begins to observe abundant examples of 23 mysteries of private life. I did some research on Google and Wikipedia, and it seems that this whole 23 numerical nonsense really exists and some people sincerely believe that most disasters and accidents are directly linked to this bad number. Well, is that just? crazy! But hey, I'm not here to judge people's beliefs and fears, no matter how demented, and I can share my humble opinion on a film that is based on out-and-out berserk enigma. "Number 23" is not tense, despite several grim sets and ugly makeup effects, and you never at one point think about the role of numbers in your own life. All cast members are performing under their normal abilities, but it was still a pleasure to see the beautiful Mrs. Virginia Madsen again. Definitely not recommended if you are looking for a solid and haunted evening of thriller entertainment, but persistent and not entirely without merit.
