This adorable dog (called different names during the movie) is seemingly loved by the whole city ... but he's alone. He's friends with two kids (Cindy and Paul played incredibly badly), but their father won't let them have a dog. Then Benji meets Tiffany - ANOTHER adorable dog. (Immediately) they fall in love and lead to the hysterical assembly of two of them, who melt in the grass, drink from the fountain ... in the slow motion no less! Benji also lives in the purest abandoned house I've ever seen. Then these two children are kidnapped by the most uncontrolled, weirdest kidnappers I've ever seen, and - you don't know - they hide brats in the exact house Benji lives in! WOW it was wrong! A huge hit (for some reason) in 1974 which led to many sequels (which I won't see). The movie is just horribly dealt with "humor", so rude and ill done that you just stared at the television in awe. The film also has a song that NONSTOP plays during the film - so much that you want to scream. It was inexplicably nominated for Best Oscar Song - it didn't win. Yeah - dogs are cute and much better than human actors - but I need more than cute dogs to be interested in me. but I saw it with my 5 year old nephew. He was bored in 20 minutes and basically stopped looking. I watched in the hope that it would be better - no. Really lousy - but very patient children or dog lovers might like it. <br /> <br /> Note for parents: It's rated G, but the dog is several times ominously kicked. You don't see it - you just hear it and the dog survives, but it could bother the real young kids.
