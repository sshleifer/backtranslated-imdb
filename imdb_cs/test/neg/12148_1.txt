Terrible production does not qualify as "film". It was of course shot on a videotape, and very badly at it! Sound is a constant sound (sounds like a bad microphone) that is so unpleasant that sometimes you can't understand what these characters are saying. Poorly dubbed music suddenly appears in the scene and the whole editing of this stuff is about zero! The storyline is resourceful and ridiculous. At the end of the 1920s, does a homosexual try to hide his loving lover from his parents? PLEASE! And the reaction my mother has when she finds a picture of her son kissing his boyfrioend is out of melodramatic and foolish. Talk about the stereotypical view of gay life! Acting is worse than a porn movie, and the direction is very bad! <br /> <br /> As far as "production" is concerned, there is no one! This title is simply a lame videotaped to try to call yourself a "movie." There is no heart and soul that would give it even the slightest praise. <br /> <br /> It's just a stupid waste of time, so avoid it at all costs! BAD ACTING! BAD WRITING! BAD DIRECTING, and the title of "producer" is vanity, because this basket probably has quantified them for the price of the videotape he was filming. This absurd waste has no business to get on the DVD because it is deceptive to the cunsomer. I can't stress how awful this "SUGARPLUM" crap is! <br /> <br />
