This film was a low point for both Jason Robard and Sam Peckinpah. The main plot points are taken directly from Sergio Leone's masterpiece "Once Time in the West" (released two years earlier and also featuring Robards): A man finds a watering hole is found in the desert, being the only water for many miles in He plans to build a 'station' around the hole and ensure that there is a love interest there, he falls in love with a prostitute. Add to this the indispensable preacher, bad music, silly quick action shots, even stronger T&A shots - and go there. No doubt why she failed at the box office. The real question is how far has it been?
