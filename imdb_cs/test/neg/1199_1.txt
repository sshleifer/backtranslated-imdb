OK, the idea is ridiculous. 1. Kids don't have their own aircraft 2. Kids don't race with dirtbikes 3. This made the Air Force look like total idiots 4. The baby's father wouldn't endanger his entire career to allow his boy to he rejoiced with him. Reserve Colonel <br /> <br /> Continuing, I'm sure it's worse than this tripe. The soundtrack is the only redemption of the quality of this celluloid waste. I'm sorry, but I don't understand why anyone in the world would write directly and produce such incredible junk stuff. The Iranian Air Force is fortunate to filter out a few parts for the aging F-14, and this child won't hurt 1, but 2 fully loaded and powered by the F-16? Give me a break.
