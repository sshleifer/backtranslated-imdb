I don't care what someone else is saying, this film is the worst piece of waste on film. What does John Landis think? I know it's based on a series of children's books. Even children hate this film. It's nonsensical and boring. Again, Tom Arnold proves that his only talent is a waste of production money. I think that the only reason Stupids didn't appear on the 100 worst films of all time is that only 20 people will admit they're looking at this waste. At least Hobgoblin's made it to MST3K.
