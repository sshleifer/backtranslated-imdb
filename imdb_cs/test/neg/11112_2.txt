Chupacabra Terror: 2/10: It was the Navy Seal team that kicked off the bad movie of kitsch to bad. Until then, there were a lot of bad movie luggage, but Seals? They wear cycling helmets painted in black. You know those who have air holes that make every adult wearing them look like a complete tool. Of course, the bass fishing boat they took to welcome a cruise ship could be another guideline (wouldn't it be over the ocean to the Tampa Bay)? and their tactics would not be in the game on the XBOX 3 speed game. Does director John Shepphird have photographs of John Rhys-Davies in a compromise position with Hobbit? Because I can't think of any other reason he would be in this movie. Other actors have a great apology. They are talented, uninteresting hacks that could not be hired for infomercial. The story is that two men are trying to smuggle the mythical Chupacabra on the deck of a cruise ship, which will be released. The kits consist of horrible cruise ships (including small-sized air shafts), killing a monster is the bottom of a barrel, not nudity, and a lot of really bad actors refuse to complete their deadly scenes. Special Harassment is a gigolo character from the 60s of Doris Day. The cast bleeds ketchup while Chupacabra bleeds the day with a green glow in the dark blood. (Why would a goat eat a Mexican mammal bleeding something other than red is beyond me.) <br /> <br /> Every B movie has a break point that makes it a fun time (Hey it's a lesbian shower scene, OMG that guy just ate is your own eyeballs) or not so much fun (they said only those forty who are overweight who wear overalls and cycling helmets Navy Seals?) Chupacabra falls in the not so fun side of B movie with astonishment.
