I came here to check Terror Hospital for an alternative title, so I know what not. Not only do I get the original title, but I came to find Terror Hospital is one of seven other aliases.This is a real clunker. As a rule, films like this can be forgiven for many reasons, mostly the unintended consequences of this function at every level of production, resulting in at least a mild form of entertainment, mostly amusement. It has none of it. Instead, the viewer witnesses an unnecessarily unnecessary and too comfortable situation when the situation is exposed, and pulls out the scenes of characters that move from room to room, and that's half the movie. Forget it to find out where someone (or who they are) is during dark or night scenes; you don't care about it anyway. There is also a random sequence of chase cars that seems quite boring compared to some of the old driving ed movies I've been blinded ... er, I think sat over and watched the way back in high school. Indeed, we are talking about mysticism, property and murderer in the open - it's not a bad recipe for a movie. Unfortunately, there is nothing to make it a "good" waste; When they join the above, bad behavior and no-so-special effects are just that - bad behavior and no-so-special effects. This is just waste, clean and simple. Leave it on a stand in a pawn shop or in a shop box. Is there a reason ...
