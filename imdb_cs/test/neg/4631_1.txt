Many people in the cinema enjoyed this movie, but just because I felt misanthropic. If the smug "intellectuals" chase on their irritating sex lives, the sounds of ok for you to watch it. I felt bored, but I'm glad I met such people. The film's premise was that, as with all societies or large civilizations, they are ultimately doomed to failure. According to the female historian, who is bored with this fact, America shows signs of her decline (Certainly it goes into more detail than I do). The next part of the film deals with the empty, exhausting and asinine behavior of her friends and colleagues and the various suffering caused by their libidinal behavior, with an indeterminate humor. Many people liked this movie where I watched it. I couldn't relate to it.
