"The Final Comedown" wants to say something about racism and domestic violence; unfortunately, the report is invalid by a nonsensical script, amateur productions and hard-armed controversies. You ask how cumbersome? To give you just one example, a black doctor comes out of his hiding place, unarmed, with his hands up in the air, ready to surrender to the police: one of the (white) cops says, "Don't shoot him, he's a doctor," to which another policeman answers: " So what? He's still **** r "and continues to shoot him with cold blood. The cops are portrayed as unconscious, racist murderers, though there are as many dead people among them as there are among the blacks who have rebelled. And this whole event in some way "sensitized" by white people to humiliating the blacks when something like this can actually have more hatred and violence on both sides, Pamela Jones, as Williams's girlfriend, briefly lights up her screen with her smile and body, especially in the tender sex scene , and will increase the rating of this movie from 1 to 2 out of 10.
