I've seen most of John Waters' movies. With the exception of some of his first unavailable ones, I have only seen all of them, so it's obvious that I'm a big fan and I'm sure I have a high tolerance for crude and oblivious films. . While on the way through the top and disgusting, I adored FEMALE TROUBLE and POLYESTER - two monumental tribute to bad taste and abundance, which are seriously funny movies. So I'm definitely not upset and can take most of what Waters has to offer. However, at PINK FLAMINGOS, the film created such a repulsive, so rude and so offensive that I couldn't even stand it. In his other films he did before he became more mainstream, they were funny. Yet humor is simply not as it seems that the intention is to shock viewers and not to enjoy them. I am glad that Waters' sense of humor has improved after making this film, because the divine consumer faeces of dogs (as in this film) are shocking, but not the least amusing. My advice is to skip this movie and just pretend it never happened and then watch its endlessly better films of the 1970s and 1980s.
