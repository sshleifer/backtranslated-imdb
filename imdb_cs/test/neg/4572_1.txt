I wouldn't like to be a big fan of genre inventive stupidity, so I don't have to be the best audience for this show. Though, being a critic I have a sense of what I personally like and dislike, that is later. Lack of humor is a big turning point when it comes to comedy, things can be catchy, cool and pens for about 4 minutes and then you get bored if its a badger animation a few years ago (?) That's the opposite , with stiff script and all overacted voice-overs its just stupid and very very boring to be subjected to. Unfortunately, because it had a big market ahead and a lot of potential. <br /> <br /> Loss of time.
