Look, I've practically lost all hope in Nickelodeon after watching their latest hit "The Naked Brothers Band Show" and "ICarly" is no exception! If you haven't noticed yet, ICarly is now the # 1 hit tween sitcom on TV right now! After hearing it, I decided to watch several episodes to find out what the hype is about! I have one word to describe this show in general ... "EFFORTLESS !!!" CAN'T BELIEVE THAT DAN SCHNEIDER ALSO ARE LOW AND HAVE THIS KRAPPY !!! THAT'S HORRIBLE!!! Let me give you details ... The cast of ICarly begins with a girl named Carly Shay, played by Miranda Cosgrove! Unfortunately, during the episodes, Carly doesn't really have that personality to talk about! I think it's the average girl in the show! (Because LOT people have an army veteran for fathers, a brother artist and a popular teen web show, recorded and made with thousands of dollars of equipment!) And most of all about Miranda, HER ACTIVITY IS PATHETIC !!! Sounds like a 3-year-old girl with Tourette's syndrome for half the time with sugar! We also have Sam Puckett (Good God, where do they get these names!), played by Jennette McCurdy! Sam's "CO-HOST" from Carly's web show! (Wait, if Sam will host Carly's show, shouldn't the show be called "ICarly and Sam?" I bet Sam feels like she is torn!) Sam has to be a tyrant in the cast! (Yeah, because every girl tyrant wears girly shirts and blonde hair pants that are a girl). She too, too, is Tomboy, too. I would like it a little funny, but it's her Cliché PUNS THAT ARE RUIN IT! "Give me a bucket of fried chicken" pun is exaggerated WAY TOO !!! WANT THIS GIRL SCRIPT !!!! and GET her COFFEE because it doesn't make me sick Jennette behaves fine but during half of the episodes she seems ready to fall asleep !!! We also have Freddie Benson, played by Nathan Kress. Freddie is a technical producer for Carly and Sam's show! There's not much to say about Freddie than the fact that he's a techno geek and has a crush on Carly that never goes out! HERE WE ARE AGAIN WITH THE TUBES !!! NEMÁ STOP! Nathan's behavior is also fine, but sometimes he seems excessive! IT IS NEEDED !!! Finally, and my favorite, we have Spencer Shay, played by Jerry Trainor! Let me make this clear; If it wasn't for you, THIS DIRT CLUSTER DISPLAY WAS MUD !!! Spencer is the one who keeps the show alive! Spencer is older brother of Carly! If you had a small 5 year old who was both high in caffeine and constipation, you should sum it up! Spencer also earns money from being an artist! (Hmmm ... I wonder ...) Do you think a professional artist will do promising sculptures ... yeah, I just love sarcasm! HIS ART IS PRETTY MNOHO UTTER CRAP !!!! What the name of the statue is "Merry SNIFFMUS !!" WHAT!!? ARE HEAVY CREATIVITY AS HILLARY CLINTON SPEECH ON DRUGS !!!! IT'S DEEP !!!! <br /> <br /> FENCE SETTING AND MORALI ARE SUCCESSFUL POOP CABLES !!!! These shows now tell kids that they are stealing, lying and being an asshole for your parents, is GOOD THINGS !!! IF THESE TYPES OF PERFECT BOXES THAT ARE THIRD IN THE CHILDREN OF THESE DAYS, WE NEED TO ACCESS TO ANY WAY OF ANYONE! THIS IS THE BIGGEST PICTURE OF THE BOX THAT HAS BEEN DESIGNED ON THE TV! BAR NONE !!! NICKELODEON, "I AM YOU WITH YOU !!!!" END OF THE STORY!!!! 1/10
