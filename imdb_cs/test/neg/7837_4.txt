The maximum risk is quite surprising for a person who has seen more than his films. Director Ringo Lam made an average action film that can be compared to most other medium-quality action movies, a special predicate for "Muscles from Brussels`movie". It has a pretty elegant style, an interesting atmosphere and, last but not least, the beautiful Natasha Henstridge. Even VanDamme will not let you cry with your actions, it will do a pretty good job. Of course you can't compare Maximum Risk with "Ronin", but after watching "Knock off" it's a hell of a good movie ... of course in special standards.
