Caddyshack II is nothing compared to the original Caddyshack. But there are legitimate reasons for this. (1) Rodney Dangerfield was supposed to be the ace of this movie, but he didn't like the script, he wanted to change it, his request was denied, so he didn't do the movie. (2) It was a low budget, Bill Murray grew into a superstar status. Ted Knight died in 1986, and Chevy Chase's "so-called ace" of the first movie (though it was Rodney's entire trip) couldn't be more than 5 minutes since it would cost too much to pay him. But you had Dan Aykroyd, Robert Stack, Randy Quaid and Jackie Mason, all the substitutes who didn't perform best.
