Aghhhhhh! What a disappointment. A perfectly good piece like Antonio Sabato Jr and nothing but embarrassing drivel coming out of his mouth. I broke the 95% dialogue! It would be better if the character became mute! As Antonio Antonio Sabato and Michael Pare have been able to speak these lines without losing control of some bodily function, he is behind me! If the character of Michael Pare was overtaken or only one sentence ended with the word 'Men', I think I'd throw the iron over the TV (I love multitask - mainly to get through the bad movies). It had to be a skinny year for both of them to sign up for this movie. Car wash for a living would probably look pretty good by now. And the bad guy ... ... if he was so bad, he just didn't shoot all those rich college kids instead of promising toilet breaks. Even the title was wrong. "Crash Landing" means that the aircraft actually crashes and does not take place without it causing a fire or being injured. Instead of landing safely the plane had crashed and burned just like a script. <br /> <br /> THIS FILM IS A STINKER!
