This movie is terrible, I'm SORRY. I bought it to get Star Worms, and in fact I expected it to be better after I was disappointed in Star Worms. Oh, just kidding, it turns out to be the worst movie I've ever seen. It is garbage, not that it is really some, and the main character is a big stupid box that is attacked by similar things. I can not tell it. Special effects are so bad that you don't even see warring dinosaurs, which by the way are not war, but just standing and kind of moving their mouths or what those things are. The film is a headache. It is very obvious that the director is trying to create a universe. Hahahahahahahaha ... Indeed, this film is simply ugly, even by Troma's standards. The only good thing I can say is that she has the Lloyd Kaufman intro when she deceives us again to watch something that is not suitable for consumption.
