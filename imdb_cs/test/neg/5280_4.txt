A silly horror movie of five 20 people (3 boys, 2 girls) going to this place in the middle of nowhere. What they don't know is Dr. Chopper and his assistants attack and kill anyone who goes to the forest. They use their body parts for some experiments ... or something. Also, five college girls and two lesbians are worthy to be killed and show some clippings. <br /> <br /> Quite desperate. The story is confusing and boring; gore is ridiculously false; Dr. Chopper and his assistants TERRIBLY beat TERRIBLY; Here is some terrible black humor and people just stand around while their friends are attacked or just standing there and letting them kill them. It was pretty offensive. There are several pluses. Turning the clock was good enough and the five young actors are really good! Chase Hoyt is great as Reese; Butch Hansen is fine as Jimmy; Ashley McCarthy is also good because Tamara and Robert Adamson have moments like Nicholas. Best of all, Chesley Crisp as Jessica - was excellent! Some of the dramatic scenes between the five were good and interesting. Unfortunately, the dialogue was not for them. I give it 4 for their performance - but nothing else is worth mentioning here. Hopefully these actors will get the roles they want.
