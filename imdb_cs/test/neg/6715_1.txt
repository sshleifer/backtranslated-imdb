Sigh ... what can I say? Why is a terrible scenario like this first approved? It's not bad to have a complicated plot, but it's not explained to the audience properly! <br /> <br /> In order for the wife to explain the plot through flashbacks is bad bad bad. Having such tight adjustments for battle scenes is also bad! Such fantastic editing only appears on trailers. It makes the whole look cheaper! And who are the Russians on top of the movie? Who is the tortured man? Is he with the CIA? This film deserves not to be released in the theater. But they don't deserve to be made first. It's a joke for Hollywood.
