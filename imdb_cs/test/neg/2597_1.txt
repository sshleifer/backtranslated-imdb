It's literally Three Stoogs again, no magic. This show is nothing but the worst slapstick. I'm surprised they actually have a writer. So-called jokes are totally random and "controversial" for no other point than trying to make a very (very) difficult controversy. And people think it's "nervous"? Get guidance: this show has absolutely no idea, time, effort, money or creativity / originality to produce. Any links are aimed at anyone between the ages of 6 and 16 who would occasionally look at People magazine. But I think that's just what all the guys want, like, and they need today.
