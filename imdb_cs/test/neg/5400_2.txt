The Delta Force Army, designed to find a dose of missing green berets, which is not known to be totally absent, will be in the struggle for survival against the masked skeleton of man, the supposed spirit of an ancient Indian warrior who was revived when the archaeologists disturbed his grave. The Skeleton Man rides a horse and has the ability to move to a kind of dimensional portal, and it does not seem to be affected by bullet and explosives. The Skeleton Man leaves no hoof hooves and can silently ride from behind and around his prey. A look at the film with a skeleton looks at its prey in a different color. In other words, it is not seemingly human, so how can Captain Leary (Michael Rooker, how frantic and intense is it always) and his gang of wannabe commandos stop this threat? For some reason, Skeleton Man kills an employee of a nearby chemical factory. What are the Skeleton Man motives for killing endless human beings? And why is a blind Indian living in the forest our commandos living spared if the Skeleton Man, as a human, defeated his entire tribe to prove himself? <br /> <br /> How stupid it sounds. Just incredible terrible. This is the kind of film that can relieve brain cells. Casper Van Dien gets a second credit bill just under Rooker, but is saddled with a ridiculously signed character who leaves the movie quite early. Rooker deserves better than this. If I was an actor, I wouldn't want this movie in my resume. The human skeleton is to reject the Templer Knight from de Ossorio's film. He has a spear that can just tap certain people down and explode the woman's head to impact. An arrow shot of a man's skeleton bow actually destroys a helicopter propeller. Almost 99% of the film, the bullets are shot at Skeleton's man and he can go in and out of this portal yet, at the end, at once, he becomes vulnerable to the attack. And horses also change when the skeleton of a person moves freely through the forest from this portal. The film is written and edited by clowns. The offensive scenes are poorly designed and the characters to be experienced professionals make really bad decisions in this movie. The mind is stunned with this film. Good for some laughs, and some gore scenes make this piece of pure crap traceable as garbage film.
