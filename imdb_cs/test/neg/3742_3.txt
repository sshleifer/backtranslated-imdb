This movie had some funny parts, but for the most part made me want to continue and change the DVD and watch "Malibu" instead of the one I had in my own collection. At the very least, I know there is something funny when I come and give me something to look forward to. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed with this very low budget movie. And I don't think the movie is his budget. Just lacked originality and was too predictable. I would not rent or even learn about this film, and I am usually a film repeater. The actors were forgotten. The story was half-thought, and it left me with an insatiable urge to get my laughter on. Finally, I watched Jamie Kennedy's White Boy Gone Gangst have a comedy of itching.
