I really didn't like this movie ~ !!!! it was boring and I didn't care. I'm a more action girl and it's NONE. I went and rented this movie because of another comment that remained .. but it was absolutely misleading! Don't get this movie if you don't like dessert and a lot of boredom. I really didn't like the movie. It wasn't my style, but it could be yours .. you should just watch previews or something, but it's my recommendation if you're a girl .. don't take this movie! This Scandinavian production draws on some of Koyaanisqatsi Godfrey Reggio's observation strategies, allowing us to reflect on the patterns and phenomena of human and natural existence from both intimate and vast points. It's just not for me!
