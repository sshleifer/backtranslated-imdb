(This may have a spoiler) <br /> <br /> When I first started watching this movie, I thought it was OK. The music was good and the bizarre succession of dreams I was willing to forgive, but the lack of appearance in the main character and all the other characters that interested me didn't interest me in watching the rest of this movie. (I know, totally useless.) The music at the beginning was lively and fit when I thought of a fake Gothic novel. Come on! Saxophone music for the early 19th century film? It doesn't fit perfectly. This movie was totally boring, and if you want to watch a period movie or Austen don't want to rent Northanger Abbey! I give him 30%. 30% = wrong mark!
