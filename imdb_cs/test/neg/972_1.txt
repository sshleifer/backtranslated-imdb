The time will come in the career of every big name when they get sloppy and accept projects that they wouldn't touch 1000 ft in their golden days. Remember "Taxi Driver"? That was a good movie. I can't believe De Niro of "Showtime" is the same actor. I'd rather watch "Time Chasers" twice than see this movie again. If someone offers you to see "Showtime" or give you free passes or anything, run as fast and as you can.
