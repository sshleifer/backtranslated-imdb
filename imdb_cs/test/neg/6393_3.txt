Yeah, I know girls are hot and beautiful scenery, but for someone who knows this place, it's fun. <br /> <br /> If you want some precision, it's not a movie you can rely on. It starts with a flight from SÃ£o Paulo to Rio on deck 747. This will never happen on a 400 km flight. Smaller planes like the 737 or A-320 travel between the two cities every half hour. Driving from home to home, if displayed on the map, would reveal a complex zigzag back and forth. Perhaps the producers were trying to imitate one of the most famous taxi routes when they faced tourists. Not that it was a local custom, because I was ripped off in very serious places like Switzerland. Girls, yes. Everything topless. This is something an outsider will never understand. Brazilian chicks will be pleased to exhibit 100% of their incredible bodies at schools in Samba, where they will walk and wear an almost non-existent bikini on the beach but never do. A handful of beaches across the country will allow this. All carefully isolated and out of town. Oh, interior decoration; amazing wallpaper ... maybe at Disneyworld ... Besides, it's very fun and yes, Demi Moore is absolutely amazing.
