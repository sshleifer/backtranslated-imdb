"Terror in the aisles" might look like the ultimate experience for horror fans, but it actually has very little. Is it true that it represents a decent and versatile (too versatile?) Selection of horror / thriller fragments that are considered classic, but ... what's the point? This documentary focuses primarily on the public who loves horror, so we've seen all these clips, right? The only thing that is really commendable about this project is editing. If you are in screaming queens, chasing murderous killers and such things, "Terror in the Aisles" has some neat compilations of the most famous sequences. All these different scenes hang along with a lame story with Donald Pleasance and Nancy Allen at the cinema. Between the two sequences, the viewer address and "explain" why we love horror so much. These manifestations are naturally soporic and rather obvious (in our nature they fear ... blah blah blah) and I do not understand why many people love this concept. It's worth seeing if you're a loyal fan of the horror movie, but it's definitely not a major viewing. On the contrary: if you still have to see a classic genre title, be careful not to bother your pieces and pieces of your future tracking. The main reason I didn't like it overall is that she blatantly ignores many less known but basic (foreign) titles that endlessly focus on "Halloween." This results in a cool inner joke when Donald Pleasance screams at his own character screen.
