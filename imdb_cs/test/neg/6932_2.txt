I can only guess that this film was an experiment that failed. Years ago, it would have been moving images accompanied by music. Later it would be added to the silence. Finally, it would be Technicolor, Cinemascope or Imax. This film had to be a misleading attempt to introduce a new element into the talking image. During all emotional scenes, the character stops halfway through the dialogue and their inner thoughts are narrated while looking into the distance or appealing to the camera. This interruption is only painful. Imagine these top actors trying to look busy when they talk. Painful. I have no idea who came up with this trick, but it was the only time I saw him use it - for good reason. In each scene, the actors were forced to throw their eyes, shake their hands, or exaggerate to a degree, actually wondering if it was really a comedy. The story is a hopeless soap opera that takes place over several generations. Disappointed with love, Norma Shearer is looking for a reason to live. She has a friend played by Ralph Morgan who worships her - but takes it for granted. She is attracted to the doctor, played by Clark Gable, but he is absorbing them and is not interested in her. They settle for the weakness they desperately need. She marries him just to find that his family is mad and she can never have a baby with him. Later, a doctor comes in, who selfishly discovers a bun in his oven to find out that he loves her. The child builds trust in her husband, who becomes successful, but realizes that it is really Clark he loves after all. Still confused? Forget the rest, just watch a couple of "As the World Turns" episodes and everything will be clear. <br /> <br /> If you ever have to watch this movie, hold on to the last scene. Actors Gyrations gave Harold LLoyd a stud. Don't miss it.
