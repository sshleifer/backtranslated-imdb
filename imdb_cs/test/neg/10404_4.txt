This poorly sweet and laborious 5-reel is definitely not one of Harold Lloyd's better films. Gags are sparse and mostly uninspired. The saccharine melodrama is abundant. The setting lasts forever, because the unconventional, but incredibly kind, land doctor Lloyd, does his rounds, brings a little sun to the lives of children, older people and puppies. It's like the 1922 version of Patch Adams. Ugh. 4/10.
