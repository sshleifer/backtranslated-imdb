In Chicago, four electricians led by Dean (Richard Grieco) come to the old building to disconnect the power. They accidentally activate the portal and come to another dimension where Chicago was destroyed by a spider queen and inhabited by mutants. The group meets with survivors led by Crane (David Nerman) and Elena (Kate Greenhouse) and finds the inventor of the Dr. Richard Morelli (Colin Fox), who has lived in this dimension for thirty years. They are joining forces and trying to rebuild the portal that would bring them back home. "Webs" is a traceable "Sliders" plagiarism, just worse. Most of the dialogues seem to be written by a person who has not completed primary school, so they are imbecile. The story is illogical, and Chicago seems to be the only city in the world. A scientist trying to start his sophisticated machine with broken wires as if stealing a car is very entertaining. Richard Garcia's face looks like a white version of Michael Jackson and is terrible. If the viewer turns off his brain, he may like this forgotten TV movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "On Teia do Terror" ("On the Web of Horror")
