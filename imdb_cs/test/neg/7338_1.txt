What a terrible movie. I can't believe I actually sat down and watched. Very, very, very, very, very, very very poor effort, without any redeeming properties. Hateeeeeeedddd ittttt! The so-called "racing" sequences are ridiculously horrible and the plot was so bad that I forgot it. Part of the film was shot at Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium, in 1988, during the Grand Prix itself. I was there and I'm glad I didn't appear in any of the movie's paddock scenes. It could have been a good ... pity.
