The original Australian Kath & Kim is great. Why do American manufacturers have to redo and destroy another classic show? Remember the original version of "The Office" with Ricky Gervais, it was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to redo it. The producers said British humor from "The Office" and Australian humor from "Kath & Kim" wouldn't translate the American audience ......... WHAT WHAT? So basically they say that Americans are too stupid and stupid to understand jokes, so they need to redo shows with excited baby gags so Americans can understand humor. The original Australian version of Kath & Kim is fantastic and very fun. Avoid American version like plague!
