After I started watching the re-run of old Columbo movies, I thought everyone would get the same voice from me (6). But apparently I'm starting to see the differences in the movies now. It has happened in some of the previous episodes that have shown it to be quite ingenious direction, and that shows in this, but in a negative sense. The film was so boring that I sometimes found myself at the tip of the newspaper instead of watching (it never happened during the Columbo movie!), and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to keep looking. Direction seems too demanding. Scenes with "oh-so-mature" neighbor-girl are bad. And lines and plots are generally weaker than the average episode. Then the scene where they debated whether to launch a trumpeter (who was falsely accused of murder) is pure horror, really stupid. However, "Overture" should get some applause. In this episode, he focuses a lot on how the killer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence, etc. I liked it. But unfortunately, no focus on how Columbo reveals all this. And "proof" that at the end of the victory Columbo is the strongest ever. <br /> <br /> Rating: lies between 4 and 5
