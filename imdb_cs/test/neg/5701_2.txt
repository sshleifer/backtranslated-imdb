This film has EVERY clich√© from any terrorist or aircraft crisis film. However, thanks to the good performances of Rowland, Loken and Smallwood (and possibly Enberg), this is not entirely imperceptible. But what is incredibly bad are computer animations that try to pass through as a live action scene. Boy, oh boy, CGI scenes in "The Last Starfighter", shot in 1984, are better than those (shot 17 years later). The feeling of cheepnis really sends frost over the spine. It is a pity that this could be a much better film with a bit more budget and taste.
