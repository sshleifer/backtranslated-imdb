Quote above just says everything for "Slipstream". After the first half hour, I should have saved this movie, but I decided to be fair and give it a chance. I'm not going to follow it again, so if someone who has that ability can come back to me with the number of clich√©s in the movie, it's definitely going to record. Some other great and talented actors have mixed with this clunker; Mark Hamill portrays a futuristic hunter and Bill Paxton is his quarry. Paxton's character kidnapped Hamill's prisoner, an android who took his name from the poet Byron (Bob Peck). Tasker (Hamill) shoots Owens (Paxton) with an arrow containing a tracking device, so he and his companion Belitski (Kitty Aldridge) can keep the cards on the pair. The real question, however, is why he did not escape only the Byron facility, thus eliminating the mediator. <br /> <br /> If you like the scene after a discontinuous scene with tedious characterization and artistic artifacts, then I assume you will find something interesting here. But you can't convince me that the film makes sense at any level. Futuristic Stone Age scenes create a way for a high society of snobbery, but the peak of bad taste is achieved when Paxton's character is depicted after a night of revolution with hickeys all over his torso. If someone thinks there's some hidden meaning, you're really stretching out. <br /> <br /> You wait patiently for the "The End" frame to come in, unfortunately, even denied. If beauty is in the eye of the viewer, then it is understanding; he didn't have this film. Yet it was one redeeming function because the final credits started their run - an amazing look at half a dozen hot air balloons. The film obviously kept them above water.
