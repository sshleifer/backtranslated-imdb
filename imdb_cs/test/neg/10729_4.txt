Dick and Jane Harper (Jim Carrey, Téa Leoni) end up on the unemployment line when Dick Corporation works for being caught in a corruption scandal, and after desperate and unsuccessful trying to find a job, the duo turns to crime to get them out of poverty. I've always been a Jim Carrey fan. It's been a while since he did a straight comedy. The last one was Bruce Almighty, who was pretty good. He proved that he can do serious dramas, but his real element is comedy. Fun with Dick and Jane proves he's still on. Even though the movie was funny, it was still a little disappointing. It wasn't as fun as I thought it would be. It's worth watching, though unlike most Carrey movies, it doesn't have a good repetitive value. Script is part of the problem. I was surprised that the script was weak because it was the same guy who made the 40-year-old Virgo. Some jokes just fall and at other times they seem too hard. If Jim Carrey wasn't there, the movie would be worse. Next to Jim Carrey is Téa Leoni. It's okay, actress, but she's just not very funny. She does not match Carrey well and seemed to be calling in her performance. They were supposed to go with someone else. The cast includes Alec Baldwin, Richard Jenkins and Aaron Michael Jenkins. He plays Billy Harper and in fact gives a decent performance. He wasn't as annoying as most kids' stars. Alec Baldwin was fine and Richard Jenkins was trying to be funny. To be honest, I'm a little biased here. The movie was quite average, but I liked it more than Jimmy Carrey's performance. Jim Carrey's fans should enjoy it, but that's about it. In the end, Fun with Dick and Jane is a fun way to spend 90 minutes, but it's not too memorable. Rating 6/10
