Some of Law and Order, CSI (Take Your City Choice), and Homicide: Street Life's Weakest Episodes is Superior to the Strongest Episode Bones. David Boreanaz got stuck in a miserable Angel mode, and Emily Deschanel portrays "Bones" too ... unrealistic. The actors as a whole have terrible scenes, either with forced action or with terrible lines. Murders are foreseen after a while because prejudices and clues are too obvious. > <br /> Music is fine, though sometimes it is unnecessary. All in all, Bones is hardly a show I would recommend watching on weekdays because it's a carbon copy of better shows. with unreal characters and still boring stories. <br /> <br /> Skip if you can.
