... when it is dubbed to another language. Let's face it: Neither Nielsen nor Schwarzenegger are really good actors when it comes to dialogue. And given that it is to be set, it is a free situation. Any type of voice is definitely an improvement (and in fact is - at least in the German version). But that's just a small point. Behavior is bad. Accelerated combat sequences are pathetic. Nielsen couldn't use his sword to break free from the wet paper bag. This becomes painfully evident compared to the fluent movement shown by the child (who had some martial arts trainings, no doubt) and the athletics shown by Sandahl Bergman. Schwarzenegger does his Conan thing - nothing new here. <br /> <br /> Some of the visuals are nice, I have to give it. The Dragon Skeleton Bridge looks great. But much more often than plaster is too obvious. Overall, the movie isn't worth seeing. Even "Conan the Destroyer" is better than this (though only marginally). I'd rather see Bergman as Red Sonja as it was originally supposed to be, but I doubt it could save this movie - well. <br /> <br /> 3/10
