Even though I watched this movie myself (fortunately), I still felt embarrassed about watching it. I was cheated to rent it on the front cover review, and the bloody / brave camera still on my back - which led me to believe it was a documentary. These actors are ridiculous throughout the film, not convincing at all. The story includes Italian Australian ()) Gang, just fighting with other gangs, and then running, fighting, repeating. They probably train extremely hard, which makes them better than other gangs. For some reason, I don't think they can really beat some of the others who are twice as big. I could be wrong ... no, I'm not right, this movie isn't fun at any level. Jail montage looked like it was a summer camp, just a place for kids, it was a pair of terrible actors, just hung and laughing and trying to look hard. This film is not worth your time, save money, or throw it in the garbage, just don't waste it on this movie.
