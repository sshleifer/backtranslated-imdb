I watched this movie in a cinema based on its potentially interesting theme, a good cast, a director who had previously done highly rated "Once Were Warriors" and my sympathy for noir-ish movies in LA in the movie. Forty and fifty. I would say that I am reasonably easy in this film category. I appreciate the classic of this genre, but I will sit and enjoy half the decency as far as derivation is concerned. However, I found that this film is absolutely unbearable. Despite the good situation in which the story is placed, it seems that no one will do or say anything interesting or entertaining for two hours, in addition to this fatal mess. Good actors are useless in endless scenes of dialogue, from banal to awkward. The story is motionless and unbearable, and none of the events it captures is well enough to do anything other than slavery to the audience. There is no drama, no atmosphere, no tension, absolutely no fun value, and I simply didn't care about what happened because I didn't believe in the movie. <br /> <br /> L.A. Confidential came out a year later, and regardless of whether one version of the story is truer to life, the latter film deserves all the plaudits for its perfection in every department. Mulholland Falls contrasts in each department, which is all the more tragic. If they ever show up on the plane, I'll leave.
