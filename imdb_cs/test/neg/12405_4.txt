Your ability to enjoy Asheta's time may depend on our expectations before we enter the theater. Even his strictest supporters seem to agree that viewers can be split to the middle when they appreciate this unique film. Unlike most HK action actors, battle scenes are curiously kept at a distance. When this happens, they are drawn in a jerky style in which it is difficult to know exactly what is happening on the screen. Dramatic scenes can be extravagantly beautiful, with Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, and roll-call top-level HK gaming talent chewing the scenery. As with previous Wong Kar-wai works, dialogue could be more accurate. In short, the Ashes of Time require forgiveness. Released at about the same time as Wong Kar-wai is a greatly successful Chungking Express, it's clear that the director isn't so confident about working with the elements of the martial arts movie. Anyone looking for tense action is likely to be disappointed. But those that attract the director's aesthetic will probably find a unique experience to say the least.
