Why can't TV movies be better to be free today and watch this movie on the UK satellite channel. What a terrible waste of my time. Poor sets, Poor and Oh god what a terrible flood. Blimey that a woman can even overtake the water stream too! I really want people to make TV movies with better effects, better or at least more credible conspiracy and much better acting. Killer Flood is upstairs with a bad deal. Several pieces of ham could not behave worse. <br /> <br /> 1 last thing I really agree with the dog commentary, but I believe it would go wrong in real life!
