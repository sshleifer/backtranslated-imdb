My boss at the time and showed us this at a Halloween party in our office. It's Chris Huntley who wrote and acted in it. He knows it's bad, we know it's bad, and we all agree that the monster looks too much like a vagina that is a coincidence. Maybe it was from a gynocological experiment that went wrong. <br /> <br /> It was a very low budget and the actors were all friends, so what you have here is the case of "hey, gang, let's show up". hurt and it was the first attempt, there is nothing wrong with it, it gave us a good laugh and it is a great movie to watch with friends and make fun.
