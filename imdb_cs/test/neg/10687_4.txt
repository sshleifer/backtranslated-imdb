If, like me, you are actively searching for the rarest and weirdest (and often most horrible) that world cinema offers, then you should not look beyond Hong Kong's supernatural horror output in the early 1980s. He often mixes bizarre black magic with kung fu and silly comedy, and is usually full of a lot of fearsome reptiles (snakes, worms, eels, centipedes, etc.). These films are as bizarre as possible. Succubare is definitely the case: featuring a mountain tribe whose women keep their men from wandering when they cast ugly spells on them (that, if they left, would cause them to fill with writhing creatures and die painful death). So martial arts and lots of real animal killing lives (most of which are committed by a geek who has absolutely no relation to the story), this movie is just strange. The prolonged scene in which the snakes and insect-looking trunks accidentally throw animals into the basket on their backs, is quite fascinating; the tribal feast, which sees the poor ox called on the head and then torn, is totally disgusting; and moments that show that worms are crawling in open wounds and are vomiting on the floor will have a momentary loss of appetite. However, it is a lively animal chew that really qualifies the Succubare for a legendary position among movie fans. It's totally ugly to watch and yet weirdly persuasive: a geek chomps on a snake, a fool of fat, a juicy toad (ugly!), And a hungry swallow of a mouse (bites his head and then shoves the rest afterwards). It's not a great movie (hell, it's not even an average movie), Succubare is only recommended to people who think they've seen it all. This one gets me 4 out of 10, which is probably more than she deserves, but I really respect him for being able to feel a little bad.
