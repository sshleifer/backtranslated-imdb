The first 20 minutes were a little fun, because I don't think I saw the movie so bad before {acting, script, effects (!), Etc…} The rest of the time of the run seemed to pull with every cliché in the dialogue for no effect. These people didn't seem to like horror movies or how to make them or any other film. There is no adult language, a little concise nudity, and no gore besides fake blood blurred through any open wounds, etc. This would be rated PG in the early 1980s and PG-13 nowadays. I'm not sure how R has it, or if it really did. I saw the edition of American International called Hospital Of Terror. I've seen 100 horror movies over the past 12 months and that's probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Here's an example of how bad it is: There's one scene where something green goes through the door. I'm not sure what it is to be, but what's on the screen are some baby green crayons scribblings {I'm not exaggerating} super-saved over a movie, semi-moving inside the door, then its something to do something for I assume the nurse Sherri will have her available. I couldn't believe they lacked pride to show this embarrassment.
