This movie really let me think ... but not about the plot, the direction, the characters, the baseline report, or the smart script. Far from it. I stayed wondering what went wrong in Sam Hill. It is clear that something was wrong from the start. I'm impressed by the positive comments on the film and the performance of Jodie Foster. It was clear from get-go that Foster was on the phone. One earlier comment even favorably mentioned her facial expressions. I had to watch another movie because Mrs. Foster (usually a personal favorite) seemed totally impartial. In one of his first scenes with Foster, Fred Ward looks like he is. he was distracting her lack of energy and he was trying to deliver his own lines with enthusiasm. By the time he was invited to participate in the allegedly desperate search for Runaway Foster, Ward also seemed embarrassed about the project. In my opinion, Dennis Hopper was always a one-dimensional performer, so I didn't expect much from him ... and added. Yes, this one let me think long after he finished. The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to join their project suggests that it was a real stink for everyone involved. But then you will learn that the director hides behind the pseudonym talking volumes. But why listen to me? I always think Foster looks ridiculous in clothes, yet he is sensational in lace lingerie.
