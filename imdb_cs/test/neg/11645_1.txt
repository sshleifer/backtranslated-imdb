My old high school teacher boasted of seeing every movie he did, so one day I and my friend decided to create a movie called "Pacific Inferno". We later argued whether Carl Weathers or Billy Dee Williams played the lead role. Our teacher found this argument interesting, so he came to us and informed us that Jim Brown played the lead role in "Pacific Inferno". We thought he was trapped in a lie, that is, until we went to the library and found that "Pacific Inferno" was actually a real movie. This incident made me rent a movie ... it's horrible. Our finished film had a better storyline than this piece. Weathers and Billy Dee would be much better in the photo.
