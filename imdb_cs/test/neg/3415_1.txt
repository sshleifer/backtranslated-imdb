This movie is not worth the time it takes to insert it into a VCR or DVD player! Michael Dudikoff and Lisa Howard are in love with two bounty hunters, yet they are total opposites. She is ambitious and organized while he is lying and totally scattered brain. <br /> <br /> In this movie, the bad guys chase Jersey Bellini (Dudikoff's character). This opens the door for the poor godfathers, the ridiculous battle scenes and Tony Curtis, who plays the brightest boss I've ever seen! The end must be the most ... incredible scene I've seen in the movie for some time. I believe the Terminator, even the Matrix, has a better chance of being true than this ending! This movie is free of cheapness. The script had to hit someone as absolutely absurd. However, green light was set for this piece of dung to be made and set on on unsuspecting public. I watched this movie with some other people who agreed we were cheated. No one in the group said anything good about the movie except that it was over.
