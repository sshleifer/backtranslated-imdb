I can't believe that someone gives this movie a good rating. In addition to terrible acting, thin (nonexistent?) Plot lines and slooooooooow pace, it would be a movie to watch if you really try to fall asleep. The brains of the writer and the director must have been fried eggs to sometimes invent something so nasty. On the basis of a plot of fences in the case of DVD, it sounded promising. But in the first ten minutes I knew it was a lost thing. If you want to see REALY creep take on the Area 51 idea, check out the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes". Dreamland soon disappears as all the pathetic films of his ilk do. OTHER!!!
