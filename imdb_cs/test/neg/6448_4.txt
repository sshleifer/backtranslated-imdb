Amanda Bynes is an extremely talented actress and I enjoyed all her roles in the past, especially in the fantastic movie "She's the man". For this reason, "Sydney White" was a huge disappointment for me. The real reason for my resistance to this film is the poor use of characters. In a good fun teen comedy, its absolutely okay to have a cast of all quite reality-based teenage characters. In "Sydney White" this idea is thrown out of the window. Amanda Bynes will make a great Sydney, but she really lacks a lot of it that usually makes her sparkle as an actress. I blame it from a scenario that makes her character too weak and restrained, and a hair / make-up department that gives her an overwhelming plastic look and annoying hairstyle. Seven "dork" that Sydney eventually befriended is much worse. They are so dorky that it is impossible to like them or even respect them as characters. They are basically repulsive feed. As well as the story of "Charming Prince", which is absolutely incredible as a character and is something as shabby as it can be. Perhaps the biggest star of the movie (with the possible exception of Amanda Bynes)) is Sara Paxton, who is actually very good as Rachel Witchburn. It's just a pity that the writers didn't make her a little grayer than black. The story is basically "Snow White". What he kills is that he is too blunt and obvious. The connection to "Snow White" is thrown at us so much that it is unpleasant and crowded. Prince Charming is unrealistically charming, the "witch" is too contemptuously funny, seven "dorks" are too dorky and Sydney is just pure of heart. Now that doesn't mean the movie is bad. Although Bynes is forced into the script, he still has his moments. Like Sara Paxton, who brings physical comedy to her scenes. Sydney's friend "Dinky" is also great fun as a character. It's a somewhat funny movie on those parts that are ultimately too cheesy and clich√© to recommend.
