OK, I wanted to see it because it had a few good reviews, but this movie was terrible ... Just terrible. The characters were 1 dimensional and nothing that actors could do could never breathe life. The story was terrifying ... The wind stopped being a plot device in the middle ... I forgot it. The visuals that were cool were stretched out of the sooooo ... 5 minutes of a guy crawling on the ground, 3 minutes of a girl who put on makeup. I don't know what this guy is trying to rip out ... it's like he doesn't have any graph, no dialogue and a movie needed to run so long, so I can't edit scenes at all ... This film makes me think American cinema can't do it at all. I want to completely give up watching movies ... Bad Bad Movie!
