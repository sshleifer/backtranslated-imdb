I love Juan Piquer-Simon! He is my favorite director of the bad film and has been unsuccessfully trying to earn on every successful current trend in horror and fantasy genres throughout his career. After the great hit, which was "Superman", JP made his own and cheerful "Supersonic Man", he picked up on a violent slasher-madness movie with the mad "bits" and he really exaggerated with "ET Return", unofficial and downright the ridiculous sequel to Spielberg's SF-blockbuster. "The Rift" is apparently inspired by a series of profitable underwater monster movies like "The Abyss" and "Deepstar Six". From start to finish you can have fun by noticing all the stolen ideas and shameless cracks of these (and other) classics. When a brand new and fantastic type of submarine disappears near a deep Dunkov crack, a second mission is sent with U-boat designer Wick Hayes on board to explore what really happened to Siren One. In the dark depths of the ocean, a rescue mission discovers an underwater cave where the government secretly experiments with mutant sea creatures. Monsters are quite aggressive, but there is also the danger of a government enemy among crew members ... "The Rift" is a forgotten movie, but still has something sophisticated? though very risky? monster models. Fans of blood and gore will not complain, not even because the animal attacks are quite menacing and ruthless. Acting is very wooden, although many of the cast names can definitely do better. It is recommended that you enjoy clich√©s and gory in "The Rift" because when you start thinking about the script, you will find it meaningless.
