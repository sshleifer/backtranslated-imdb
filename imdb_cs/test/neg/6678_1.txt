Usually I wouldn't waste my time exploring a movie like "Human Pork Chop" (a 2001 version that should not be confused with an earlier movie of the same title, which is probably better known in the West as "The Story of the Doubtful Movie"), but because of the review here they are quite vague, what is actually made up, I thought I should send something more detailed, so no one actually gets tempted (as I was) to buy it because of the mystic movie. <br /> <br /> **** MAJOR SPOILERS are included under **** <br /> <br /> "Human Pork Chop", I expected to be as a Chinese interpretation of popular Japanese films "Guinea Pig" Anyone who has watched this series can see where its creators come from, there is a strong sense of humor - you can't watch the absurd "On Never Dies" without laughter and "The Making of Guinea Pig" is a wonderful turn he does the whole thing on his head, proving that it has just been done, with some joy, quite good-natured gorehounds. All GP movies have punk rock, DIY, video shot aesthetics, occasional flashes of true art ("Mermaid in a Manhole"), angry political agenda, and a twisted zeal that keeps them in their own league. "Human Pork Chop" has none of the above. It is filmed on a 35mm film (with very good production values), it's 90 minutes of exhausting minutes and absolutely devoid of anything redeemed. The plot tells the memory of the suspects' police, the systematic torture, death, and possible burst of Grace, a heroin dependent streetwalker who is kidnapped and brutalized by his pimp and his followers when he steals money from him. Despite his fleeting efforts to make the game morality, the film has a separate, inhumane feel and one cannot help but dwell on those who stand behind him. Though half-painted by Grace as an innocent victim, the medium nature of his screenplay, and the constant and sinister dialogue of the protagonist, leads to a shocking, totally unwelcome "deserve!" view that makes the whole thing almost impossible to follow. Much more time is spent detailing the degradation of Grace, and when her prisoners are eventually considered guilty and imprisoned, it seems to be a hurried idea on behalf of writers who have long since stopped working less. What makes it astounding why anyone would like to watch such a movie is that even the kind of people who really get off to mindless sex and violence in movies would be seriously left out. Torture is just a continuous stream of kicks, slappings, verbal abuse, psychological abuse, and then increasingly bizarre manifestations of power on behalf of prisoners use Grace's addiction to heroin to make it their offer. And when I say that, don't get me wrong, by the way. Unlike "Guinea Pig" with its frequent nudity firing, which gives almost teenage feelings of false titulation to driving despite ultraviolence, "Human Pork Chop" doesn't have such sexual undertones. There is no real nudity in the film and the protagonists' violence (who appear at the beginning of the film as they sneak into a sack and slam into a brick wall - don't worry) is pure purity. is not a real, just a cheap special effect!). The only real bloodshed in the movie is to end when he breaks Grace's body and bones, all the very bad special FX (nowhere near "Guinea") Pig "level" and at this stage you'll probably feel too much lousy and sick to take care of what's going on. The film is depressing, bleak and uncompromising in a similar vein to Buddy Giovinazzo's "Fighting Shock" and I think it could be in comparison. Both films deal with the gradual physical decline of an individual who exists in a frightening environment without any social or morally imaginative characters, and both "cinematic" climaxes in a particularly visceral way with the inevitable, inevitable destruction of the individual. In justice, 'glamourises' is violence (since "Guinea Pig" could be easily accused of this), but you can't help but wonder where the place is for the movie, like this one. He fails many real points in his sincere presentation of such brutality and with a lead-rate, virtually non-existent plot line, and the aforementioned lack of any entertainment value, just don't understand what would encourage someone to watch something like that. I did it to the end, purely for the sake of just checking it out ... which I hope I have done now. <br /> <br /> Total score: 0 out of 10 bottom barrel.
