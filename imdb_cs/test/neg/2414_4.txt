A few nasty sex-comedic gags begin, but soon they reveal their true colors: they want to be a clone of "Death of Wish". I say "wants" because the script becomes so immensely laughing that it eventually looks like an absurd "Death wish" spoof! From a love scene in a room inexplicably filled with candles, to "heroes" who dress like commandos and wave their machine guns because they don't want to attract attention to themselves (!), To bad guys who drive around the city black van long after being recognized As their vehicle, this movie has too many ridiculous points to fit into the list. Another major problem is that you cannot recognize most characters; Of course, you know who Borgnine and Roundtree and even James Van Patten are, but all the other roles could be played by different actors in different scenes and you wouldn't know the difference.
