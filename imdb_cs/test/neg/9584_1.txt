This is a great movie, pretending to be a genre of surprising ending movies. And the genre that was much better before. The plot is limping along with the predictable end.

Yes, it is so bad that they are mistaken from misogynism to simple rough roughness, as is the case with the rough house. With so many real talents I am really surprised that the movie has ever gotten. This shows the total lack of imagination of office suits ...
