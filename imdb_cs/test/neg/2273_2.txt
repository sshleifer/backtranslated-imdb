Oh yes, I have to agree with others who describe it as scary. The action in this four-hour function is uniformly bad, so bad that it seems impossible to believe that any of the actors in this production could make a living as an actor. I'm still wondering who cast. Everyone supplies their lines without seeming to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. No other seems to have a real relationship, family or other. The direction is also scary and every action scene is ridiculous and unconvincing. Were the film editors sleeping? Costumes seem authentic for the Regency period, but fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially blue!) are unpleasant and I don't think they would be available in the early 19th century. century, except silk. Also hair: men have obvious 70s hairstyles and women have "big hair" - especially woman playing Anne Elliot. All female characters, young and old, are pretty nice, but this does not compensate for the lack of acting skills. The actress playing "Anne" looks like she's in her 40s while Anne Elliot is 27 years old. Where was the makeup and lighting crew if we found a woman who could play Anna? He spends most of his time thoughtfully looking at the horizon level, whether inside or outside. I was wondering what to do. Maybe you're sorry? Yes, this production is regrettable! The actress playing Louisa was really scary. Screaming, screaming, giggling and jumping like a sick twelve-year-old (my apology to all twelve years who read it), I waited impatiently for the moment she knocked herself. As this behavior assumes that it attracts an adult male, it is over. Most of them would retreat when she first opened her mouth to chuckle and scream. The actor playing Captain Wentworth portrays someone so bleak and colorless, why a woman may be borrowing for eight years. > <br /> Reconnecting the pair at the end is neither convincing nor explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; that's for sure. No, it must be more than that, and it is not explained in the film. <br /> <br /> I rate this production by two stars: one because it's Austens work, and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were beautiful. The only reason I could watch the whole production is that I was sick with the flu and got it out of the library. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the book, check out the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this movie even if you haven't read the book.
