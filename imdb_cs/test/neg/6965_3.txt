There's a part of me that wants to give this movie a high rating. Since it was created in 1953, it is a very daring film about transvestites, which solves this problem quite seriously and sympathetically (and offers the viewer a lot of information about the issue) and tries very hard to stereotype. The film clearly shows that transvestites are not homosexuals and that, in addition to wearing women's clothing, they lead a relatively normal life. It deals with pains that are not accepted in society - the plot revolves around a policeman (Lyle Talbot), who desperately tries to understand the problem because of the recent transvestite suicide. So you have to give everyone involved in this film credit the idea of ​​accepting a subject on such a controversial (in 1953) context. <br /> <br /> When I said it all, I'm sorry that this movie is absolutely awful. In an effort to portray Glen / Glenda (Edward D. Wood) pain, the film falls into silly (and occasionally surprisingly - again due to the era - sensual) fantasies that make the story very hard to follow. Behavior is at best wooden. None of the dialogues come across as real; the actors look and look like people who read speeches written by others. And - worst of all - it didn't make sense to have Bela Lugosi in this movie. This was another of the embarrassing roles that this poor guy started in the later stages of his career. "Pull the strings, pull the strings," poor Lugosi's character (called Ghost in credits, but in fact, when he appeared as another mad scientist) he still cried. And nothing that seemed to seem to have a great relationship with the rest of the film. For art merit, the film really deserves much more than 1/10. However, for the courage to get involved just give it, I'll give it 3/10.
