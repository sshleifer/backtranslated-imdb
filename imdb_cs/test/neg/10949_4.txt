Concept: view 4 families of different ethnicities in Fairfax County L.A. preparing for family meeting on Thanksgiving Day. I loved Soul Food and how to make an American blanket (I think it's a law that must be Alfre Woodard in all these movies), which likewise offered a pastiche of family traditions and was prepared for a delicacy. Instead, I felt cheated. They run around 40+ characters and all but two are clear cliches without any subtlety. Writers and directors should spend several years learning about life and learning how loving people of different generations are actually related. Instead, you have plenty of holes that come together on the Day of Turkey to act as annoying holes. Now, to some extent, it's about what's Thanksgiving. But not so bad. And why bother with Julianne Marguiles, then don't do anything to her. This was a chore and Mercedes Ruehl is a standout, but I give it 4/10.
