This movie is truly amazing, over the years I have been keen on Monster Japanese films and I am well aware that early examples of this genre can be poor. However, this reaches a new low, as it follows the adventures of Johnny Sokko (Mlad√Ω), a Young Boy who dominates a giant robot, and his fight against the evil Gargoyle Gang, who seems to have an endless supply of terrible giant monsters at.
