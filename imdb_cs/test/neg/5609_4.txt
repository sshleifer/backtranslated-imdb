Romantic comedy movies are definitely the most fertile genre for "below average" movies and a source of frustration for viewers. This one is a perfect example of this and got a place in my "ten worst movies". History is far from creativity and jokes are weak. I didn't find any reason for a single laugh throughout the movie! The characters are simple and perform actors and just good. History is developing slowly, tiring and predictable. The end is also predictable and sugar coated. This is a movie you watch on a Saturday afternoon in the rain when you can't watch anything better in my humble opinion.
