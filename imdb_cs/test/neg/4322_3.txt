SPOILER AHEAD! Mummy (Lon Chaney Jr.) is a freelancer in a new English university town looking for a college student (Ramsey Ames) who is the reincarnation of his beloved Princess Ananka. Blunt, slow (even in 65 minutes - moving slower than a mummy!), Indifferently behaved, but the end is worth waiting for. Mum gets a girl (!!!!!) and ages quickly as they both slowly sink in the swamp. This is (I believe) the only time in the monster movie Universal that the monster got the girl! That aside, that's the strike of an amateur night. Probably the worst of the mummy sequel - and it says something!
