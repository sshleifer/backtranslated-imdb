Bad Quentin Tarantino breaks away, at least I hope this is what they were doing, because at least then I could respect the director for admiring Tarantino. One scene "singing" scene with Rose McGowan is far from good and brilliant for this movie. So in addition to his Quinton inspiration and Rose McGowan and her one good scene, the film sucked in. Any of the most extensive dialogs I've ever heard, I'm willing to bet why McGowan doesn't talk much because it would be her miserable dialogue. He tries to be funny, he is never, trying to be dark and not, trying to be stylish and simple. Who dies money to do movies like that, I hope it was all directors, so no one else was losing money. If not for McGowan, the whole cast is terrible and when McGowan is your best hmmm, I have to wonder.
