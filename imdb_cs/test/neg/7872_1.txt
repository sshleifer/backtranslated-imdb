I rented this movie when my girlfriend was away, hoping to see some serious military / professional action. <br /> <br /> After 10 minutes watching this "movie" I was so scared and horrified and sick with the quality of everything in this movie I was ready to destroy the rented disc with flame. Luckily I didn't find him. I've seen many bad movies. But it is not even bad, it is total waste and it does not even deserve to be counted as a film on the IMDB. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry for the people who contributed to it. I hope he wins some Oscars: D.
