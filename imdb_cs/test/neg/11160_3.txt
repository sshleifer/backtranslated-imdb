Fans of Arnold will rejoice, fans of mindless action will be amazed, and Catholics will just go crazy. Ilogically written by Andrew W. Marlow and shocked by director Peter Hyams, * The End of Days * gets The Terminator out of his open hospital gown (Arnold Schwarzenegger's return to the big screen after his heart surgery) while blowing things into the Mysterious in ways and blasphemies of the biblical verse to give the Catholics something more that they could behave. It's the year 1999 and doom-sayers around the world live in anxiety their computers will fritz and lose their downloaded porn. Even as the technological stub of the Y2K mutton rogues in the streets of New York, a former cop changed alcoholic guards, Jericho Cane (Schwarzenegger, with the perfunctory "dead-wife-and-child" back-story for the Loose Cannon effect), must brave theological water to rescue 20-year-old virgin Christine (Robin Tunney) from being conscripted as ?? wait for it ??? The Satanic Bride. Dun dah daaaarrrh! Stupidity follows. There is an anti-Christ for every anti-hero. Gabriel Byrne is the Devil? and he's at a party like that in 1999, on a mission to impregnate Christine with Anti-Christ between 23:00 and 12 midnight, December 31, 1999? Ironically, in the hour that they all beat porn? thereby ending the days. The ability to read thoughts, conjure hallucinations, and employ unlimited magic, does not help Satan to speed up the impregnation process by appearing months ahead and courting Christine as a youthful model and then easily closing hinges in a short time; instead, he appears on December 28 as Keyser Soze Terminator and wonders why she doesn't welcome him with open thighs? (See above comment re: stupidity.) Here is a movie where nothing makes sense when it is spoken, let alone after considering its truth or mythology. The priest (Rod Steiger) tells Jericho that '666' is really '999' upside down with '1' in front of him. So wait - * Prince * is Anti-Christ? Satan Soze watches Jericho and Christine (J and C? Get it?) Around the city, by no means does anything that actually knocks their captivity. In one scene, Satan restores Jericho's wife and child to tempt him to reveal where he hid Christine. But if he sees so deep in Jericho's mind that he should rebuild his family with enough embarrassment to inspire nostalgia, why can't he see where Jericho hid Christine ten minutes ago? Satan can talk to a murderer without a tongue, but I can't take a semi-automatic weapon from that killer. And when Jericho shoots Satan at the point of empty range, Satan is so polite to open his shirt to expose the wounds closing, so Jericho won't be too worried about Satan's health - not sanitary with open wounds? The fact that instead of keeping himself alone with Jericho to approach Christine and rape her, Satan spends so much unnecessary energy on side projects (crucifixion of a guy without a tongue, blows up Jericho's partner (Kevin Pollak) and then rescues him and then blew it out again, ridiculously fighting Jericho when he could throw him out of the idea) that we should know if a more effective murderer / lover should get to the case? Antonio Banderas. What is Most Valuable to Me is the End of Arnold's Attempts at the Method: "Sad" means that he can dig up his eyes and wipe out anything in an alien accent; "depressed" means lifting a bottle of lips and not exterminating it in an alien accent; "mortally scared" means spreading eyes and wiping out anything in an alien accent. There is certainly a pattern if we can only decipher it. Finally, the devil is not sent by holy men for whom Catholics pray for deliverance from apocalypse like these, but from atheist Jericho. While the shy men of the impotent god exhort "faith" and tremble in their cells, they do nothing about the fact that Satan actually walks between them, and the Prince of Darkness is thwarted by a nullifidian with a large weapon and a foreign accent. Which clearly says something that Catholics blindly refuse to hear: that even if the devil were to exist, those who were indoctrinated to unconditional and irrational fear would not be able to conjure up the belief in his fall, let alone act towards him. Furthermore, they would not truly WANT defeat him, because only through its opposite polarity their existence of God becomes sustainable. For this, it is written in the book of Revelation: "and the Prince of Darkness descends upon the earth without any solid game plan and impregnation of the virgin on a date that will be of no significance until the Gregorian calendar of 1500 accepts the day numbering that will synchronize it with the equinoxes and syntax of Anno Domine, which will harass rational people for millennia, by which time, Christians have forgotten Christ's true date of birth and appropriated the pagan Saturnalia festival in his place and the prince will revolutionize tight purple trousers and ambiguous lesbian band members ?? I believe people are depleted of blood and crucified, and an alcoholic built as Mr. Universe; I believe that a giant supernatural monster cannot kill a guy armed with only a foreign accent; I can even believe that the devil needs to show some thirteenth century Celtic Druid ritual as an overture - but what I can't believe is a 20-year-old virgin in New York in 1999. Especially around Prince ...
