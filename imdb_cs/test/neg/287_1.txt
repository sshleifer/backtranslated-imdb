I thought it was a comedy !! What's fun! I can't believe Forsythe or Reynolds would actually appear in this piece of basket. And then there is a beautiful Erika Eleniak or whatever is called this piece of eye candy. about 50 !! The story of the story is ridiculous, acting absolutely horrible, and tired old clich√©s that are running through and over and over and over, the boy it took a lot of perseverance to sit over this dog .. The only thing that was worth it was Laugers !! And here's PLENTY! If you really want to kill, say an hour and a half, pick up the baby in the rental shop, but make sure you have a room full of dead people's brain so you can see it with you. I think that's what it was written for. It plays as though thinking about a real low rent, a drug-induced audience.
