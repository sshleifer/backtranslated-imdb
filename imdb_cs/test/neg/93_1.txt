I really enjoyed The Wrecking Crew (1999), which was the last of the three films in this series (the first being Urban Menace (1999), which I haven't seen before). I know it was a baaaaad, but three executives were doing a pretty decent job, considering all things. But that was really cruel. Ice-T was terrible and he's a producer! I can't say I've ever heard of Silkk The Shocker (who probably never learned to spell), but his performance was one of the worst I've ever seen in the movie. Miss Jones did it pretty well in her little role, though she later continued to make some harsh, racist "jokes" on her radio show after the SE Asian tsunami (plus other opportunities sadly). Way to go, girl ... <br /> <br /> No one else comes out with any credit. Oddly enough, TJ Storm and Ernie Hudson (who are both pretty bad) are much better at The Wrecking Crew, which was made, along with Urban Menace, at the same time as Corrupt. How it works, I don't know. Now I'm going to try the Ice-T comment to see if she's apologizing for the movie or trying to think it's a great piece. film production.
