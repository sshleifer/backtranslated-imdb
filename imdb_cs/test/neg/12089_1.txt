This film was excellent and could be a fascinating view of racism, attitudes towards women at work and the relationship of male women in England in the early 20th century. However, it just turned into a soppy love story. But what was worse is that the love story was absolutely incredible. Acting was largely poor, direction confusing, but there was no script and story. All I liked about the movie was how dark it had to be before the electric lighting. I really feel how little light a candle radiates.
