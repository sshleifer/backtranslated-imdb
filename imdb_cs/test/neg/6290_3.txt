KK should stick to singing - the whole movie was big. I can't understand the cruelty of boys and the romance between Miles and KK - the sex scenes were also unsecured. The end was terrible - unresolved - there must be a reason for murder. And the whole voyeurism of the boy was weird ... the mother always struggled with the boy - don't you think he'd get a little more Freudian with her? And why didn't someone teach KK how to talk to mono instead of monotone? <br /> <br /> I'm glad I paid only $ 1.00 for it. <br /> <br />
