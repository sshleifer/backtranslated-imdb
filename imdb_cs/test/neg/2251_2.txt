I'm sorry people, but I have to say that I really can't understand the overwhelming feelings everyone gets by seeing this movie ... <br /> <br /> When I saw it, I looked at my watch to know How much more time I have to spend with this nonsense nursery. So why this verdict? First, the film tells a story that brings no excitement! It's not even the fun-distorted reality of Quentin Tarantino we knew. This story could come from the head of every little child. It has nothing intelligent in it and nothing inventive and lasts for hours ... the story has a suitable content of about 30 minutes. The rest is just a terribly better scene to leave a somewhat cool picture. Does not work. Even previously seen cuts that Tarantino often uses only confused and are by no means cold. Second: Some guys go to Germany and kill the Nazis. Really? You think so? The only Nazis who were killed were a handful of boys, one of them was human enough to die rather than betray his companions. Is it the ugly face Tarantino wanted to give to the Nazis? A brave soldier who is braver than any of the "Basterds"? Certainly not -> failure And what happens to the terrible Nazi killing Basterdy? They are all killed by the Nazis besides the two who are hostages -> wow, what terrible vengeful monsters are ... <br /> <br /> Third: Any Characters? Yes, one! The only role and the only glimmer of hope for the whole film is Chritoph Waltz, who is building a really deep and very detailed character here. Great acting! Brad Pitt really sucks and is completely out of Waltz actor. He has never seen Pitt's weak performance ... And the rest? Some Germans you've never seen before and never see. When the movie started and I saw a group of seven Basteras, I was hoping to see something like "The Magnificent Seven": A group of extraordinary boys, each of whom has a distinct character who embarks on their fate and fearless ... when I saw "fools". No details at all, no characters, no real men, only some casual guys don't remember who got no chance to differentiate ... But you don't even have to distinguish, causing "Inglourious Basterds" "except that Pitt barely plays in this movie some role ... <br /> <br /> So I was really disappointed and see this movie in place # 40 of the biggest movies of all time is the only thing that leaves me open-mouthed ...
