The only reason I watched this movie is that it's Krista Allen. Ever since I admit that I'm following the Days of Our Life ... I know her as Billie. Sure, maybe there will be a reason to watch this movie .. that would be a soft porn area. It seems to be exel. And little more. I hope somebody will rent this movie only for sex scenes. Since if they bought / rented for something else, say quality television, they may die of a heart attack. This film includes little imagination. Even though I have a good laugh, it's stupid, and maybe I'll buy it myself, I'm just crazy. Rent before buying on this. 2 out of 10. (Note that I haven't given the movie 1 star yet. The sensual scene herself has gone up and has grown from 1. if they didn't have 1 in the pot and I'd like to return the money if it didn't.
