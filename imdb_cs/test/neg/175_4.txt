I was looking forward to it and, to be honest, there were some bright spots, but it would be better if he focused on one story rather than shooting around the world. Many dogs were a lot of fun, but I was bored with the fascists of wine pompously whining (;-)) about their achievements. I felt it would work better as an hour-long TV documentary, focusing on one of the many different questions she had explored. The most interesting is the French city near the Montpelier, which fights the campaign of the American wine company to get rid of the historic forests. The Mayor of the Socialists agreed to the agreement, the timed elections came, and the Communist Mayor, who refused, was voted to be very irritated by American winemakers ... hopefully the director's cut will be shorter than the original.
