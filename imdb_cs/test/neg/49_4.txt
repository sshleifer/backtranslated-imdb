Frightmare begins with a horror movie icon that kills the director and then his servant before being laid to rest. This icon, which has some features of Christopher Lee, continues to persecute people around him when a group of horror movie companies steal his corpse from the mausoleum he is in. <br /> <br /> The first ten minutes are well filmed, good writing and plenty of possibilities for murderous chaos. But the film is in the middle (though fortunately not as much as "The House of Death") and never gets the primary energy spurt. Lots of deaths are confusing as they seem to have people just fall when they see a floating coffin or other weird stuff. We see poison gas twice. But the box promises that this horror star will be the creation of all the monsters he played. Boy, it's a fake ad, unless he has spent his career playing boring old men taking a nap and watching "Matlock." dead icon. The modern equivalent (kicking Vincent Price or Peter Cushing) would be a great movie. Maybe it's okay if it's not too disrespectful. Sometimes the theory does not even appear in the application, and this film offers this example. The only swinging quality of this movie (except the beginning) is the short look of the very young Jeffrey Combs. I saw him and thought, "That's Jeffrey Combs," but I felt I was wrong when the box never mentioned him. But surely Combs was present. (Note for filmmakers of this film: mention Combs on the DVD cover, you will sell more copies if if you would be underwater customers.) If you are Jeffrey Combs Die-Hard, look at this early role. Otherwise, I can't offer it as a great choice for a horror movie marathon. Let me propose "Alien" or "Popcorn" because they are both pretty decent and stand the test of time.
