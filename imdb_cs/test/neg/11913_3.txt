Of course I'm not a fan of Monogram Chan movies. . The conspiracy, involving robbery theft of a bank vault, is a little far more attractive and far from the atmospheric mysteries Fox has produced. Mantan Moreland and Benson Fong (as No. 3 Son Tommy) provide some laughter as usual. But otherwise there is not much. A great title that is useless.
