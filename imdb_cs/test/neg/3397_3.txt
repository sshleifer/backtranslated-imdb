I've read a lot of comments about how this movie is holding books. I don't think any of them would actually read it. Edgar Rice wrote about a dangerous African jungle and apes were murderers and hunters. We now know differently and this film captures Apes in a more modern perspective. I have never seen the movie Tarzan, which would even approach Edgar's vision. Maybe one day Hollywood with the confidence of talented and respected authors tell the story. So if you've never read a book and enjoyed a good story about the feelings and fluffy look of a bunny on wild animals, maybe a good shout, check out the movie. I hope John Carter from Mars has more respect than Tarzan. You're missing, Edgar!
