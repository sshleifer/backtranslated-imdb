No matter what other people have said that you can't review this movie without comparing it to the original, if it was on your own movie, it would be 2-3 out of 5 movies, but it's a 4-5 remake of movie 5 The film, and so has the standards to meet, and we need to find out if it has achieved these standards. If the film was overworked, or, like in the Planet of the Apes, by the idea of ​​the original, you could look at the film in its own right, only with reference to the original. Imagine it like this if someone took a model in the 'Mona Lisa', built it differently and painted it, you could just compare the framing, the concept, etc. With the original, but if someone just repainted it to the original position you'd have to compare completely . The fact that this film is not just as good as the original, which has failed spectacularly, likes it or not, was one of the best films ever to be forgotten, the shower was supposed to be a celebration of Hitchcock , but in the end he really degraded him and his masterwork. Degrading aspects of this image were Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche. It is nothing to do with whether they have behaved better or not that the relationship between Norman and Marion in the original was indeed totally innocent, Norman in fact misunderstood sex, barely had contact with the outside world and when he met the beautiful Mariona and watched to change it, you feel that it does some of the fascination because it does not really understand sex and its attraction to it, which makes Norman a sympathetic and almost anti-hero, you are on his side because he does not fully understand the world and constantly fights with himself and with his "mother." In the remake that the whole dynamics is gone, I must admit that Janet Leigh is not my type, but she is very attractive and you can see that Anne Heche is really unattractive, so Norman find "her" attractive Marion is incredible if you add, that he masturbates to Norman Vince Vaughn while looking at her and you get Norman, who is just waiting for a chance to rise to any naked woman, no matter how uncomfortable he looks, further destroys Norman's innocent nature of putting porn spells in your room. It destroys the character we liked and we're sorry, it's like re-doing 'It's a wonderful life' and having the main character pimp, totally humiliating. The only other character I had trouble with Rita Wilson as Caroline, Marion's co-worker. In the original, when Pat Hitchcock says "he had to notice he had a wedding ring," he laughs when he makes fun of himself when Rita says it seems plausible. a man would flirt with her with Anna Heche over her. I admit, I am very impressed, the original 'Psycho' is my favorite movie of all time, if the film was reworked, with a different angle, then you could turn these characters on their heads and it would be perfectly acceptable . Hitch spoke greatly that the movie would be too bloody and made it black and white to make it smaller. This also made the film more atmospheric and frightening in its own way, and it gave him a beauty that could never be captured in color and it is a sad statement about how films are de-sensetizing the public that people have said as the shower scene was. More scary color. (nb before people think "can't spell" remember from England and we spell it) <br /> <br /> The remake should be just that it's a fake, a complete copy and very bad. I could compare, but it doesn't make sense, almost everything is better in the original. The only thing that is better is the performance of Viggo Mortensen as Sam Loomis, John Gavin was very flat in the original (Hitch called him 'Stiff' behind his back) and Mortensen gives more credibility if it's less sympathetic. William H. Macy and Julianne Moore are the only other actors to hold the originals. Overall, a movie that should be labeled "An Expensive Awkward Failure Experiment." Showing only compared to the original or if the original is unknown. But even the original 'Film would have 3 out of 5 if it was original or overworked, but as much as 0.5 out of 5 (for Macs, Moore and Mortensen)
