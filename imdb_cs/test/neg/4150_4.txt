An epic story of hope limited by budget and limited artistic ambitions. When I saw Terrence Malick making it, I was expecting something scary and lyrical. Instead, we get a typical Norwegian co-production ("Revolution" with Al Pacino, anyone?), Where - good enough - good intentions are destroyed by a terrible scenario, and where many characters are reduced to stereotypes. English dialogue "me-Tarzan-you-Jane" among the non-English-speaking protagonists is particularly interesting? one could speculate whether Nick Nolte and Tim Roth ad-libbed their own, as they almost sound like real people. The story is filled with improbability: we believe that we believe that Binh can speak embarrassed English after spending his entire life living as a peasant slave (his vocabulary, but unfortunately not grammatical commands, is growing enormously in the Malaysian refugee camp, without the benefit of night classes). Coincidence is widespread; I was wondering if an hour or two was modified from the first third: almost immediately following her mother in Ho Chi Minh City - after hitting her younger six-year-old brother, who discovers him! Mum gives him a gold medallion (or something of great value) when he breaks up, but he never says it again. His relationship with "Me Dead Inside" Ling is supposed to provide a compulsory "love interest", but he feels as artificial as Leonardo and Cameron in the "New York Gangs". Corrosion cruise ships show the frightening conditions of human trafficking. The only moment when the film is distantly exciting and unpredictable is the jerking, hand-held shot of the bridge during torn weather conditions. (By the way, sailing ships from Malaysia to New York via Cape of Good Hope and the African coast without stopping fuel or supplies is certainly an epic journey). The beautiful panorama of New York City reflects Malick's use of a magical clock, but I want to know why the Coast Guard didn't appear. Maybe they were watching the Super Bowl or something. Of course, Binh manages to track down his blind old father at a remote farm in Texas, with the same navigation style he exhibited in Ho Chi Minh City. I was impressed by how Nick Nolte was able to wander the hills and feed horses on a large ranch without the help of a guide dog or white pole. To show how the story of a refugee wandering could be structured and shot on a small budget, look at Michael Winterbottom's much better "In This World".
