Has anyone else noticed that this version is basically a remake of the scenes after the 1933 scene, with some scenes taken? This makes me think less of a film that does it, which shows a clear interest in creativity. In all respects, I tend to be biased towards Katharine Hepburn, but this version of the film looks like film plagiarism. The 1933 version was nice and sweet, though a bit annoying in the presentation and transition occasionally, and then this version took the script, music, and even a fair amount of blocking scenes from an earlier version. I do not understand that it would be appropriate to make a film again when it was a way to basically rework George Cukor's film with everything that is the same except for the people who work on it.
