The original Road House is by no means an award winning film. But it's one of the great guilty pleasures of all time. It shouldn't have been so hard to do the sequel. No big budget, stellar stars and spectacular visual effects. Even the story didn't have to be original. All he needed was a good atmosphere and some great fighting. I don't mean Matrix-style "wire-fu", just some well choreographed barroom battles. A lot of them. There are some decent battles in the film, but none of them are unforgettable and focus on the rifle. In addition, the way it relates to the original film is ridiculous, bordering on insults. Johnathon Schaech plays Shan Tanner, a secret DEA agent who has good hands and feet. But here's the kicker ... he's the son of Patrick Swayz Dalton !!!! Say what ????? Let's see, the original Road House was made in 1989. So for Dalton to have a son in his late twenties (maybe even 30) in 2006 ... well, you have an idea. They give her a cheesy explanation of living with his uncle Nate (Will Patton) while his father "traveled a lot". But please. This alone almost guaranteed the shutdown of this movie. But I turn. Schaech is completely out of its element. Sure he can throw a few kicks, but he has nothing like an actor. In addition, he is referred to as a "handsome boy" in the film. I never knew men who would investigate it, but I don't think this guy is too good. She looks sick. His face is too thin, and his sunken eyes look as though he has disappeared at any moment. I have never heard of him before, but I think he should give up games and return to his work. Jake Busey plays local drug runner Wild Bill. Busey is not a terrible actor. He was good at Starship Troopers, and even made a menacing villain in Hitcher 2. But here, he just chews the scenery in standard bad mode. Even his "threating" dialogue is yawning. We have to buy him as a man who has a city in his pocket. But why? What does? Because he wants to buy a bar from Patton "in some necessary way"? Ellen Hollman plays the role of a token. Woman with secret. Too bad that the secret is about as hard to find as 2 + 2. He is a local primary school teacher who will become a former army soldier. Guess what that means? This means that while she may tremble with fear for most of the film, she will be ready to break the head when the fur begins to fly. Well, at least it's hot. In fact, the fight between her girlfriend and Wild Bill is the best in the film. It's fast, brutal and fun. Which leads me to my next film problem ... fight. As I said, Schaech knows how to throw a blow. The same cannot be said for anyone he sees in the film. Of course the film will descend to Schaech versus Busey. Busey is an actor, not a fighter. He has no ability to stretch the film fight. Swayze could be a trained dancer, but his athletic ability gave him the means to get rid of well-choreographic fights. He also faced several worthy opponents, and had one killer (literally) motion. None of this here. With a few exceptions, fighting is forced, poorly staged, and routine. The firing pin looks like someone cast concrete 2X4 on the concrete, and even a few parts where the sound does not match the stroke. It's awkward. There is no good Southern / Redneck music of the original. The Road House had a Jeff Healy Band, which was a rather popular band at the time. This film includes singer John Otto, whose music is lukewarm, and his actions worse. He got one line in the movie that was probably inserted to calm down what fans can have. Either that or someone owed him a favor. My last film complaint is the one that comes out of just picking ... continuity. The movies are shot from the sequence and then it's the editor's job to put it all together. Well somebody should give the editor of this movie a little shove. Problems range from little things like people who don't look the same in photography to RE-USED at the end of the movie. Initially we are introduced to The Black Pellican Bar. When the camera moves through the bar you will see a band, bouncers and people who dance. At the end of the movie, when the defeats were defeated, we get another shot of the same bar, with footage of our hero sitting at the bar with his girlfriend. The problem is that shots of people in the bar are SAME shots from the beginning of the movie !!! No no. They are the same people who stand (or dance) in the same places, wear the same clothes. Want to know the funniest part? You see bouncers who were killed in the movie earlier. Do yourself a favor, don't watch this movie unless you feel the need to go out and hit someone. This movie makes you angry enough to do it.
