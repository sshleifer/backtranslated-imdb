Cimarron was painful. Even though Irene Dunn is doing a good job with a heavy screenplay, Richard Dix's pompous and overclocking role is brutal. The course of time did not treat Isaiah's character, as well as with other racial and religious concepts, well, though the film is somewhat progressive on the roles of women and the ill-treatment of Native Americans. Editing is particularly weak. This is undoubtedly the worst of all the "best" paintings.
