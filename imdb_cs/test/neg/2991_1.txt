Don't get me wrong: I enjoy arthouse movies, low budget movies, character studies and foreign movies. Unfortunately, I could not enjoy this - the ice stimulation, the complete lack of conspiracy and the character that you cannot have enough to hate, but you cannot tolerate enough to want it. <br /> <br /> For Me, Distant was like watching clippings from a realistic show - all the scenes that were considered too uninteresting and that wouldn't normally make the final cut were the only scenes. The camera in my apartment with two of my friends, who have been in motion for hours, has no interesting film footage. The distant surely makes the watchman such a way - long stretches without dialogue (almost 10 minutes before the first word is spoken out of credits) can work (2001 comes to mind), but for me, something else compelling must stand to pull me in. <br /> <br /> If you're the kind of observer who can sit in the movie and be happy with the analysis of the movie, maybe it will work for you. However, if you are someone who decides to watch movies to relax, expand your mind, or have fun, you should look elsewhere.
