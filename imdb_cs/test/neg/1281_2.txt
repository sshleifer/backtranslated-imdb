Why have they changed the cute, Rugrats TV shows that we all know and love into a lame attempt to focus on youth? He doesn't have to do it. All ages follow regular Rugrats. When I heard about it, I thought, "Hey. They filmed a TV series about the movie. When I saw it, it was as if I was watching ginger talking except to suck. Good job. When is a director in Rugrats? Never. Basically, all the episodes in this experimental series are about Tommy's love for directing. I do not like. I prefer to watch charts that change every episode. Not always the same. Also, when all the characters have their own story pages in the old series? Never. This series did it. I didn't like the fact that everyone was separating. I don't want to see Angela's side of the story. I hate her. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend this show if you like As Told By Ginger and Rugrats.
