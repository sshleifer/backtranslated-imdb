Like other comments, it may be a surprise for those who have not seen the work of Jeunet & Caro or Emir Kusturica. But you've seen Delicatessen, it's nothing new about this movie. I thought Delicatessen was great when it came out, but this movie comes too late to be interested. I don't think it's a worse movie than delicacies, but now it's boring to see it as though it was probably watching Delicatessen again. The film has no meaning, nothing that matters, or stays with you. There may be a distant resemblance to Kusturica's movies, but he's really in a different league, so you better go see his movies before wasting your time on Tuvalu.
