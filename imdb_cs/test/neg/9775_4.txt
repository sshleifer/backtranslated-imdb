This horror story takes place in the Namib desert in Africa. Canadian Systems Analyst Zach Straker (Scott Bairstow) is tailor-made for a diamond mining company. Although he hates field work, he finds himself in a lorry with a rescue unit in the open desert fighting sand flies and flogging, blowing sand. Four diamond prospectors are found ... and what's left of their scattered bones. During a long cold desert night, a monster with a variable shape appears. Zach and his colleagues are frightened when their car is stuck and the troops are dying one by one. There is no character development; let alone the dialogue. The desert scenery itself is beautiful and without giving up ... the creature is as old as the desert sands. Also in the cast are: Rachel Shelley, Warrick Grier and Patrick Shai.
