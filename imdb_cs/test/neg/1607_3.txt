Not only did I read the book and watch the movie, but when I shot it, I was placed on the USS John F Kennedy. Needless to say, film crews and actors can try to make people try to do their job. Now about the movie. As a Navy man career, I was quite angry as they showed life on board an aircraft carrier. I could discern inaccuracies throughout the movie (everyone who lived on the carrier), but that would be the site. One scene that stands out in particular was when they were in the CIC (Combat Information Center) and watched RADAR move across the screen. A beep sounded each time the contact moved. Unfortunately, this device does not beep this way (I was a technician on this equipment). The book was based on the fact that the film was not. Following the TV series was just as bad and the Navy finally realized that support for this series would make them look bad. If you're a Navy person, watch the movie see the carrier's life seen from the eyes of Hollywood. If your not a Navy person, watch Midway or Top Gun, at least those movies are fun and based on reality.
