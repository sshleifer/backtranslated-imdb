Harrison Ford plays a playing cop in a criminal thriller. The perfect ingredients that SEEMS for top entertainment with Harrison back to their Indy and Han Solo best, protect witness from ruthless and ruthless killers. How easy it is to be confused. If the film focused on the main, supposed motives of crimes and tensions, instead of stood up and sticking ice creams in people, maybe it could be more valuable. Incredibly predictable with the best way to send the enemy to corn.
