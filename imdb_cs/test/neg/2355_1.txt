Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive, and prolific directors of all time, because it is probably all these things. It takes real genius to frighten the generations of movie generators to enjoy showers and wear ties. But Saboteur is neither creative nor fruitful at all. Rather, Hitchcock set out with the intent of making a soul to create a movie to gather "American Pride", a sure call-to-arms, support-our soldier title, which was a popular time theme. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film, including but not limited to logical plot, characterization, believable dialogue, and fluent, running storyline. Hitchcock usually performs great spy movies just a few years before he reached the film size with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps. lines as his previous excursion easily provided. Without getting to the depth, there is a list of some of the main issues of this movie: <br /> <br /> 1. Despite having a plastered face on every newspaper across America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind. 2. At a party, Kane and Patricia don't want to run behind the door because they could be picked up by parachutes and told to be "castle ravens". What logically prevents spies from grabbing them and saying it anytime during the evening? Besides, does anyone have to remind that Kane is a wanted terrorist? <br /> <br /> 3. Since when can she tie her belt? 4. Nobody knows him ... his face is on EVERY NEW !!! 5. Spies catch up with Kane in the ghost town and assume it's the man Freeman sent to work with them ... shouldn't he have any credentials? I know spies don't run with name tags and photo IDs, but maybe a secret handshake? 6. The cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman's house, and no one seems to recognize him. 7. How exactly does the FBI believe Kane has no evidence? They don't even show that Kane talks to the FBI, the scene just disappears and we're forced to assume everything is now kosher. 8. When cops search a carnival, how do they know Kane is a woman? The blind man believed that Kane's story would not logically say that his daughter was missing, kidnapped, or even more importantly running with Kane. Why doesn't this movie use logic? <br /> <br /> This is a running list. The film is not exciting, the story doesn't make sense, and the world is full of people willingly taking the wanted terrorists to their homes and cars every day because it's no big deal. Hitchcock will fail on this one.
