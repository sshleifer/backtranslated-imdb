After the astronaut dies in space, he is brought back to the military base. Extraterrestrial embryos are discovered inside the man - he is the host of what could be a terrible invasion! This film comes to us from director Bernard L. Kowalski, who also directed "Attack of Giant Leeches" (see separate review), but may be better known for his work on "Columbo". The executive producer was Roger Corman, known as the creator of much better films than this one ... especially in the sixties. This film is cheese and poorly designed. What is interesting is the bad effects, not the film itself. One scene shows the detail of extraterrestrial embryos and is an embarrassing cartoon representation. Even after 1958. And then, when an adult alien appears ... you'll wonder why he's wearing shoes. Or if you're really receptive, you'll wonder why you saw a foreign suit in other movies. It is by no means the worst sci-fi movie you've ever seen. And you almost have to give some credit - an alien host overtaking the idea of ​​a military base precedes both "The Thing" and "Alien" by several years. I don't know if these movies have been inspired in any way (I doubt it), but at least it was a while ago. In addition, however, the film fails and is only great for hacking while drinking. I haven't seen the "Mystery Science Theater" version, but it's definitely one movie that is worthy of their insults.
