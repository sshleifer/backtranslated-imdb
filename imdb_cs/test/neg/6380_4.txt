This show has shown that these are the true colors that the Democrats have in power. He has never led the world in IQ, because anyone who thought he had intelligence was programmed to think in one direction (which is a scary thing). Central Comed Back to Earlier Time after Democrats took power for some reason - because now that the Democrats have rejected - which is as often as Republicans - Stewart no longer takes sweat on them. That is why the rating for this and the spin is decreasing. Basically most of the humor is either lame or lame Sarah Palin jokes - which all ranking down comedians now say. The facts that could support it speak for themselves. The show of Jay Leno, which does the same kind of humor, is on the verge of abolition. The ratings for Letterman & Conan and the shows that follow them are down. So Emperor Stewart is not alone. The problem is that if one of them starts abducting the powerful democrats in power, they could quickly increase their ranking because the best humor is always at the expense of who is in power. Bush's years show that because the ratings for this show & Colbert, & Letterman & Leno were higher there. O'Bama did one thing, proving that these shows must be willing to seize the chances and rip people in power if they are to prosper. Right now, the Daily Show & Stewart are falling, but maybe they may be lucky & Palin elected as the first female president in 2012. Then lame Palin jokes will become a grabber rating.
