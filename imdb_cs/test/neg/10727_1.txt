Jim Carrey is a special brand of humor and I personally think he's a great actor (for example, Eternal Sunshine). However, this film is probably meant to be nothing more than a Jim Carrey car, so be aware that if you don't think its comedy style is funny, you'll be sitting in this movie with a stone face because that he has nothing more than to recommend it. Although you like Carrey's comedy, I'm not sure this movie will be fun. I went to see him on Saturday night at 10:30 pm and the audience was definitely ready to laugh. They giggled in trailers that weren't particularly fun, but when it came to the movie, stony silence. I think it made about five real laughs. The problem with the movie is that he doesn't know what he wants to be. He can't think about whether it's a grotesque or serious. If it were stupid, it could be forgiven, but (guessing) it is also an effort for the relationship between the two central characters. <br /> <br /> The strength of the film is hold- and there is plenty of potential. But they started up in about half and remained largely undeveloped. In the meantime, you have to sit in the first 40 minutes as the life of the couple deteriorates. Four separate groups came out of this movie when I was there, and if my roommate didn't ask me to stay away from the house (his girlfriend just returned from a monthly vacation!), I would do the same. And in 25 years of the film, I did it only once before.
