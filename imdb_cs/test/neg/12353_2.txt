Rabbit Fever is a mockumentary collection of sketches, each one is focusing on a female personal device that was made popular by one 1998 episode of Sex and the City (the second half of 1998, rather than early episodes that were all directed by women). From the introductory statistics that make Rabbit Fever a soft porn movie, we are sealed with predictable sketches with real and imaginary characters in a world run with female addiction. Men as Germaine Greer explains rather arrogantly, they invented a gadget for women who make men redundant in their bedroom. Rabbit vibrator (which some statistics suggest accounts for about a quarter of all vibrator sales) is so called because of small rabbits-like long ears that vibrate to stimulate the clitoris, while rotating pearls within the shaft stimulate the inside of the vagina. The movie character interviews that visit Anonymous rabbits to help overcome their 'addiction', as well as well-known people such as Tom Conti stand out as a professor or Richard Branson (amidst the scenes of rabbits being banned on the plane) stating that he would like to provide free rabbits first class passengers and ultimately everyone. The main weakness of the film is that the idea is not enough to preserve 85 minutes of film, sketches do not have the writing skills of telling Charlotte Church or Ricky Gervais to be funny enough, and while it could make the desultors late Night TV does not hook people to queues in public at multiplexes to watch masturbation jokes. <br /> <br /> Lines like: "It's been almost a week since you used your rabbit - how do you deal with it?" wear rather thin after five minutes. The film is based on the idea that the mere mention of the word "rabbit" will laugh. . . and more and more. Mad midnight tickets to buy batteries can be fun in real life, but here they look more laborious and a special emergency delivery service overcomes their welcome. Oddly enough, the BBFC gave him 18 certificates despite zero violence, almost no explicit sex, and sexual links that are less "perverted" than any late night comedy show. The company protested this decision, but the BBFC did not move. At first glance, it seems exaggerated and their consumer advice simply says: "It contains frequent strong sexual references." One might think that teenagers will find masturbating jokes more humorous than the desperate night party, and a topic that is worthy of debate; but Rabbit Fever does not have the economical grace of a balanced approach to the subject. The best work is probably The Rabbit Song by Ruocca (who plays Thumper in the movie). For those who have learned and woke up at the end of the credits, there is a bonus scene at the end that assures them that they have not missed anything.
