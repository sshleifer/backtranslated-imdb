It's easy for a movie that tries to be exciting to end up being uninteresting. It happens quite often. Not only is Dark Harbor uninteresting, but it's very bad. A scene after scene is attached to an otherwise exaggerated premise. The troubled couple picks up a troubled stranger to find more trouble. Some movies build tension by building a story. The Dark Harbor is still expanding its story, but it never builds on it. I was hoping he would explode like other movies. He'll never do it. Also, characters do not have continuity from scene to scene. In one scene they can act in one way, but then behave differently in another scene. At first, you think they're just out of character, but in the end you realize they're not characters at all. They are just props for the final twist. The last ten minutes have been trying to be shocking. Instead, it's rather lame and uninteresting. The only thing that shocked me was that the movie was finally over. In less than ninety minutes, the film still seems too long. This is not one of those low-cost gems. It's more like a counterfeit watch that breaks when you take it home.
