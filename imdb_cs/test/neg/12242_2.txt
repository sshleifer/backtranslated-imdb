The spoof genre, which lacks creativity and humor for some time, is hacking again with no talent. No thing, no fun, no originality; just a few cheap money for filmmakers. It takes more than just referring to some recent movies and giving characters a double name to be satire; to make people laugh. Any chest can pick up a cam, and some bad actors in cheap costumes imitate someone. Since this genre is focused on inspiring sports films this time, there are a few lame references to films of this type: jokes are so weak that the characters actually have to emphasize links in different ways so they can laugh hysterically. It does not work. It's not a comedy. However, the same old worn out sophomoric "jokes" ripped off a high school sink (done even more than usual) are here. If that's not enough, there's a running "gag" bus running someone over. So funny, isn't it? Also, one pathetically poor scene does more product placement than Michael Bay; again with the same unsuccessful result. The music bit will fail. Pity Carl Weathers, once Apollo Creed in the Rocky series, is now stuck in roles like this. Beards for words. A marathon watching a snail would be less tiring than watching this movie. Probably much more fun.
