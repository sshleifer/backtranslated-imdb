I tried to watch this movie, but I didn't do it in the first 15 minutes. It's a terrible disappointment with regard to the cast, but I can't look around that dialogue is in English and some of the actors pretending to be Indian are not even close (read: Kristin Kreuk). Since India has only 1/6 of the world's population and one of the largest film industries, I don't think it would be difficult for filmmakers to find an excellent Indian actress who would play this role. And I'm not going to say this because of some blind patriotism, but because it's totally absurd for a non-Indian to play Indian / Pakistani. Some people say that 'as long as it is convincing, who cares?' But my opinion is exactly that she is not convincing and can never be - not because of her acting skills but because of her ethnicity. For example, although good actor Tom Hanks may be, he will never be able to play an Australian native! But it is getting smaller on the biggest faux pas filmmakers: with dialogue in English. It will completely destroy the mood, as well as any appearance of authenticity. If the same movie was made in native languages ​​(Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi) with English subtitles, it could have been an excellent movie. Unfortunately, as it stands, I do not recommend anyone who sees it, except film students who want to study "What not to do" in films.
