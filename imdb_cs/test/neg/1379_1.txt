Carlos Mencia is not funny. Carlos Mencia is not funny, from his special characters to this TV series wreck. I tried to persuade people for two years that he had stolen other comic jokes, and as for his comedy material, it is a regular "Johnny-come-lately" with much smaller results than a par. Psycho Astronaut Jokes? Britney Spears breaks up jokes? I hope this is just a planning mistake, but let's go to Carlos and Comedy Central, these themes and many more, have launched the introductory monologues of TV shows of late evening TV shows, Saturday Night Live, Mad TV and many more. Lampooning Ethnic and Racial Stereotypes? The comedy has no chance of evolving with Carlos Mencia around. Maybe people, especially viewers and executives of Comedy Central, will get the opinion, because this week in the magazine "New York" the magazine accurately labeled it: "Carlos Mencia, unwavering joke-filcher."
