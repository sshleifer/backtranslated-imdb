The story is about a psychic woman, Tory, who returns to her hometown and begins to experience her traumatic children's past (the death of her childhood friend and brute father). Tory finds out that her friend was just the first in a series of murders that still occur. Can her psychic powers help resolve crimes and stop ongoing murders? <br /> <br /> You really don't need to find out because, my God! So it was so bad! I know that all Nora Roberts fans will come to this movie and give him a lot of ten. Then the rest of us will see the IMDb score of 6 and actually think this movie is worth watching. But don't be fooled. The end was a predictable, acting TERRIBLE (not even about the South accents *) and the story was trite. Just remember ... you were warned!
