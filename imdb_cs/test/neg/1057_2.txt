(Warning: Some spoilers forward.) <br /> <br /> What an incredibly crappy movie. This makes Iron Eagle 2 look good. The story is as follows: Captain Holiday (Rutger Hauer) gets shot down by his friend Banning (Robert Patrick) to stop him from shooting down an iraqi airliner filled with innocent civilians. Six years later, Holiday returns to take revenge. Among other things, he sat in a tank, chasing Banning (now a colonel) and his pregnant wife in the field. It can burn shells while driving a tank. After the tank has blown up the bazooka, it miraculously survives and steals the fighter. With it he will shoot down a number of Allied fighters before attacking NATO Headquarters in an attempt to kill Banning's wife. A special bonus is that Baxter (who hangs in her office) has placed the insignia on the right shoulder back. Elegant.
