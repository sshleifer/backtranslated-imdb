This movie was terrible. The only explanation I think about the good reviews I have received from some is that they were written by the cast. Actually, watching this movie was painful. Even my grandchildren (6-13 years old) could not bear to watch it. As far as I know, this movie never got into theaters and for good reason. It's like some people sitting around with beer saying, "Hey! Let's make a movie. Who wants to be in it?" It's so bad. Apart from Luke Perry, who is only in a small part of the film, I did not know one other actor. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is in this case. I liked Sandlot (I) and in general I like silly and silly movies, but this film doesn't have a single quality. The people who wrote it do not have the slightest idea of ​​how children think, speak or act, and the film is a disjointed mess of haunted lines and stupid jokes. I rarely write negative reviews, but this is the worst movie I've ever seen from Man's Best Friend and it's definitely one of the ten worst movies I've ever seen in my life. If you rent it, remember that I warned you. The fact that some people actually rated this film as good is a sad comment on their taste and intelligence. I'm not exaggerated.
