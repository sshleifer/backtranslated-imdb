My wife and I remembered that this film is much better than it is. When we rented it last weekend, we wondered if we were watching the same movie we saw 22 years ago. We both agreed that we probably remembered a TV series that was forced to actually wrap the lines of the plot in its clock segments. This film leaves many loose threads, as others have mentioned here ... basically every story of the main character has remained unresolved. But I have to listen to the title song.
