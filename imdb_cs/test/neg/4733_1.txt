Where to start ??? I think that only three other movies brought me to the IMDb review and all were positive. As for this ..? Mind-blowing, awful, tragic, embarrassed, catastrophic, stupid, irritating, completely and utterly awful. <br /> <br /> I'm STUNNED, it doesn't matter, it's a theatrical release. I think I'm literally shocked. <br /> <br /> I'm not a "snob". I didn't expect beautiful filmmaking or intense character depth, but this is really a joke. We need to demand more from the films we see. <br /> <br /> Avoid. Like black death.
