Jack Brooks jokes are initially somewhat charming and lend intentionally to Campy's feelings at the beginning of this film. When I was deceived, I saw myself angry and angry. the end, in the hope that payback would be worth the super-boring wait. <br /> <br /> The top cannot begin balancing the entire setup time. Normally one can expect shallow characters from this genre. However, the fact that the pre-event waiting time index is so high should mean that some interesting character development will be devoted in the meantime. It's not like that. Although it is not without its initial spell, this film will eventually upset and disappoint. I wish I could get everything I set back to reinvest it in something that pays off.
