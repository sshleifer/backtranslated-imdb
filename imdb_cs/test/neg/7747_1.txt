Already in the sixties, those of us who were bad movie fans believed that "Plan Nine From Outer Space" was the worst movie ever made, and it will stay all the time. But in order to spread things out, we also thought that $ 3,000 was to be paid for the new car. When we got older, our innocence was gradually eliminated when we were exposed to films like "Hercules in New York" and "Overdrawn at Memory Bank", which completely redefined the genre of "bad movie". In this context, last night we saw a son, "Alien From L.A.", who moved the envelope to an extremely unimaginable few years ago. If you want to call this movie "bad" (or bad or enforceable), it will not do justice in the same way as any other term existing in English. Even if there were words with which to accurately describe this film, it would be without consequence because they would be banned in a civilized society. An alien referred to in the title plays Kathy Ireland, who apparently took some time away from modeling a swimsuit for Sports Illustrated, launching her film career. Her casting may seem a recommendation until you actually see the film. Make-up artists earned their money by making Kathy look drab and disgusting that you wouldn't want to touch her with the distant end of a broom - no average performance. To put it bluntly, he has a face in this film that would have frozen Medusa. Worse than her gaze was her voice, which was so grim that I couldn't think of him as a human being. Throughout the film I found myself craving the board to pull my nails across to cover the scratching of her dialogue. At the end of the movie, Kathy finally gets a man and finds herself in her beloved swimsuit. I suggested to my son that the film would be better if they put it in a swimsuit at the beginning of the movie, so we'd have something to watch. My son pointed out sensitively that if they took off their bathing suits and stuffed it into his mouth, it would significantly improve the film in two counts. I postpone his observation to a clear brilliance. If you have any doubts, compare this dreck with "Barbarella", in which a competent filmmaker will show you how to use the wealth of a beautifully beautiful lady in a fantasy genre. There is little to say on the plot, alone, because there was so little evidence. It is said that if a million monkeys kept writing millions of years, he would eventually come up with "Hamlet." By the elimination process, the rest of the time would come up with something that would bring this scenario closer. Imagine, if you want, modern Alice, who falls into a hole and drops 500 feet on a stone slab on which she stands up, herself scolds and starts looking for her lost father in the city's kingdom of Atlantis. He once spends most of his time in Atlantis, fighting or climbing stairs and ladders, and basically trying to keep in the hands of a general who seems to have no soldiers to do their bidding and who would look at Tiny Tim. macho. This summary, as it appears to be shortened, is likely to be longer than the shooting scenario. On the plus side, as you can enjoy in production values ​​and take whatever you can from sets and costumes in smoke and haze, you'll realize that this is one movie where you can truly See the screen where all $ 20 of the budget went. The idea that still went through my mind that filmmakers should not be given access to drugs and alcohol while they shoot a movie, or perhaps the previous one, if it leads to results like "a stranger from LA," though in justice, I must admit that I do not know whether they were actually involved in substance abuse or were just dead at the beginning of the project.
