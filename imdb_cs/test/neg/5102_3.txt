It was a very nice concert of one and only MJ. The choreography was excellent and the costumes were decent. The vocals were fine. I must admit that his vocals were on human nature and Billie Jean. You haven't heard him half the time. The other songs are for singing. The highlight of the show are: Jam Smooth Criminal I Just Can't Stop Love You Outside My Life Thriller Billie Jean (Dance is not singing) Black or white man in the mirror The concert was almost perfect. If it was someone but Mj would be 9. It's visible. I wish I was born so I could get a ticket for the best 1992 concert.
