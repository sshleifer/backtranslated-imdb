That might have been for Valerie Golino, but instead the film decided to shift its attention to another area. The film is about a woman named Grazia (Golino) who is married to a fisherman and mother of three. It is a free spirit and prone to explosions, so the rest of the village and its family decide to be sent to Milan and visit a doctor. The story takes place on Lampedusa Island in Sicily and shows everyday life with young boys in rival gangs and tries to find something that can be done on rocky terrain. Grazia's eldest son Pasquale (Francesco Casisa) adores her and always tries to protect her during her bouts of depression. Marinella's daughter (Veronica D'Agostino) is a blooming young girl who becomes infatuated with a local policeman, and the youngest son Filippo (Filippo Pucillo) is very impudent and ridicules the policeman's accent. When Grazia learned to be sent to Milan, Pasquale helps her to hide her in the cave while everyone is looking for her. This film could have a greater impact if it could focus on Grazia. On her side we see some explosions and irrational behavior, but these scenes have no effect on them. None of this comes from. The film looks great and is beautifully photographed so that director Emanuele Crialese won for it, but the story needed to focus on something more substantial. The film does a good job of showing us how life is on this island and what happens in the lives of three children as they grow up. Their speculation that Golin's character gives a hint that she is a mermaid as a creature, and therefore has difficulty living on earth. I also feel that the island itself expects its inhabitants to behave in a certain way, and if you don't, you may be exposed to the harsh reality of your rules. All speculation, but I think the film's attention could stay with the character of Grazie. After hiding in a cave, he really has nothing to do. In a sense, the character is stagnating. I wish Golino had more to do, because I always liked her and whenever she was on the screen, you can't take her eyes off her. It's a bundle of fury, passion and raw energy! What a pity Crialese has not given her a more complete role for her to act. When the movie ends your left feeling of an incomplete story.
