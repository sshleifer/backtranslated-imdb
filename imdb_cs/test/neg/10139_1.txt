Reba is undoubtedly one of the worst "comedic" series ever. I wonder how people come to write good comments on "Reba" ... Watching "Friends", "Married to Children", "Fraizer", when you laugh at it, you must never laugh at those stupid jokes and ridiculous accent singer who is trying to make his way in comedy and obviously has no chance. The actors / actresses next to Reba are all right, so I feel bad when I hit them on the so-called comedy show with the least funnies in the world (Reba). and appreciate those that may laugh at you
