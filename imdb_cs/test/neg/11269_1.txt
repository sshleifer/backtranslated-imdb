"Yagyu ichizoku no inbo" (say, "Shogun's Samurai") is somewhere between terribly boring and conceivable painful glances. As a historical epic, he could have had much more chances to be a rich saga ... but in reality it is nothing more than just another cheap 70s event with a real-life story and a charming sport of Sonny Chiba. Before I got into the middle of this movie, I was even tempted to commit seppuku! Music is like thousands of dogs warm, wailing in ears to a tune composed of Ennio Morricone (that's not an insult towards Morricone). The use of zoom lens cinematography is more than reckless. And as for the action, it's no more than a series of brutal attacks and oh-no-no-shocks. That's a horrible movie.
