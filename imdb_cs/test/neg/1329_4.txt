With all his technical glimpse, the 1993 "Stalingrad" film is very disappointing. Before, I read the Stalingrad campaign literary stories and saw a lot of documentary footage and photographs of the real battle and its participants. I don't think any film could really succeed in capturing the titanic struggle and suffering that actually happened, but I still wanted to see how it would be a relatively recent production of German film. While there are some good elements of this movie, it's generally a failure. In my worst aspect, it includes substantial anachronisms, as well as some very fictional and cliché elements, most easily in some meetings between a German officer and a Soviet woman. There are also some ideological elements of the film that result in very distorted perceptions, including what the cartoon of the German chaplain, some overblown class-reports of warfare, and the problematic portrayal of "good" vs.. "Bad" Germans. Certainly the German armed forces of World War II included men who were able to maintain some grace during the war, and others who did very bad things, but attempts in the film to show this contrast are very simplistic and childish. I give "Stalingrad" credit in the sense that it does not fully depict German troops in simple demonic quality, which is a stereotype that many people have today, but the film contains its own stereotypes, as it is almost too good. to-be-true pawn who has attitudes more similar to the nineties than the 1940s, and two completely evil pawns and back officers. Some recent films such as "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" are often praised for their "authenticity" in displaying graphic scenes of combat, but these same movies are deeply flawed and distorted in their portrayals of attitudes, values and the behavior of soldiers and civilians in the 1940s. "Stalingrad" and "S.P.R" have major and minor characters who lack selfless stoicism, which was common among regular people during the period of World War II. Certainly, soldiers throughout history have been notorious for their frequent grumbling and occasional cynicism, but self-absorbed, talky and touchy-feely characters in both of these films are something else, and are much more prevalent in our world today than they were in 1940s. While many people like to cleanse war films from the '40s and' 50s, which are more patriotic messages and are not as graphic about combat, many of those earlier movies, such as 'Battleground', are much more accurate in their depictions of typical soldiers. attitudes, and they are often successful in showing severe effects of war in more indirect ways. One well-executed part of "Stalingrad" is the battle between German infantry and Soviet tanks, which makes reasonable work to capture some of the horror and confusion in such a fight. "Stalingrad" does a bad job even though it shows the common appearance of the frontline soldier. Part of this could be caused by the difficulty in finding thin, looking accessories in our pampered and well fed America and today's Western Europe. Also, too many German soldiers in the film do not wear their uniforms and equipment correctly, and do not show a professional bearing that was common in German Wehrmacht even during the years of German defeat. If you want to get a good idea of ​​what the German army looked like, I recommend the following documents, which include the Stalingrad campaign footage: "The World at War", "The War of the Century" and "The Russian War". Paul Carello's "Operations Barbarossa in Photographs" by Geoffrey Jukes "Stalingrad" and Paul Carello's "Stalingrad" include many useful photographs. Books written about the Battle of Antony Beevor and William Craig are also recommended, and the latter is especially good about joint soldiers and civilians on both sides. Relatively recent movies, which in my opinion are much better than "Stalingrad" and "Saving Private Ryan" in portraying people's attitudes and characters during World War II, and the general feeling, look, horror and roughness of this the wars are "Der Untergang" ("Spad") and "Talvisota" ("Winter War"). While "Bridge Too Far" and "Longest Day" cover events on the Western Front rather than in the East, they are also excellent war movies, and keep very close to factual accounts. The last two films lack a portion of the grain that is more widespread in newer films, but compensate for this deficiency by other strengths, including truthfulness.
