First of all, I should like to point out that as a child I loved Winnie The Pooh and I really enjoyed The Tigger Movie, even though I was 20 years old. But this movie was so bad that I was ashamed. they were a fan of my youth. OK, OK I know it's a movie for kids and it's not focused on people like me, but these are my thoughts on film for other people age. The main downfall in this movie is heffalump itself, it has to be the most unpleasant character I have seen in a child movie (maybe even more annoying than a small child in Monsters Inc). It has the most annoying voice and prattles around singing stupid things and making even more stupid comments, I know, Pooh movies aren't exactly high eyebrows but this was offensive even to 2 year old intelligence! Second - Where was the story? Previous Pooh walks had a minimum point to the story-yes, I see it was about accepting people who differ from you into your hearts - but it really ended and I felt like I was watching a 5 minute cartoon on kids TV . br /> <br /> I don't have my own kids, but when I intend to show them quality movies for kids like Tigger, Toy Story and Finding Nemo (though they are too childish for me these days) I see how they would be very attractive for young children). Not with this horrible film attempt. Oh and one more thing - NOT Eeyore! He should have his own movie!
