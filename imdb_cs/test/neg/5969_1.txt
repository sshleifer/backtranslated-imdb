I think the film was one-sided, I watched it recently and I find a documentary typical of Western filmmakers who was biased. The fact is that prostitution exists all over the world, not in Tanzania, and not because of this fishing, there were prostitutes before Russian and other businessmen arrived in Mwanza. Poverty is truly endemic in Africa, let alone Tanzania, and that is not because of fish fillets, in fact the fishing industry has helped millions support their families in their daily lives. This film just defiles the good image of this peaceful loving country. As far as arms trade is concerned, the film could not justify whether there is any truth that truly critically examines films that are questioned about the authenticity of the creator of the film, their efforts to prove their point of view with a few signs that can be done for something really. Yes Tanzania is a poor country yes there are prostitutes and street children, but they are not a product of this business, it is just a common scenario in most poor countries indeed all over the world and in the western world ... What kind of waste. The pilot himself talks about sending weapons to Angola, which is more than 2,000 km south of Tanzania, and the war was also miles away from Mwanza in the DRC, the director could not prove how these weapons were transported from Mwanza to DRC! In short, movies lack focus and seriousness, it is relatively easy to find a character anywhere in Africa and has nothing to do with Darwin's nightmare or fish fillet ... The truth is that the Nile perch has not varied in all other species The lake, unlike what the film shows and also less than 25% of all catches from Lake Victoria is exported, the rest is consumed locally, allowing it to be right.
