Evil never looked so bad. They have it in mind. <br /> <br /> When my friend picked up this DVD at the store for half the price, I didn't know what to expect. Based on the title, I knew it would be worth laughing, but I didn't realize how ridiculous it would be. <br /> <br /> When I first went through, I missed a dialogue (if you could call it that) because we were too busy having fun on the movie scene. It seemed like it was written in less than a week and had no budget to come back and fix some minor shortcomings. Wait, did I say "smaller"? I had the opposite. For example, the main character is credited as 'Ken', but several times throughout the film he is referred to as 'John'. <br /> <br /> If the holes aren't fun for you, look at acting. No one seems too concerned about the zombie raids in their state, including the mother's main character, who is missing for days while sitting in front of the fireplace and reading a book. <br /> <br /> The budget constraints are just as fun for the movie. Maybe they don't have permission to film no matter where they are, because during BIG MOTOCCYCLE CHASE SCENE the characters follow all traffic regulations. Zombies who have just killed twenty people will actually stop at a parking lot stop. I'm not gonna do it, but then I'm not a zombie cyclist anymore. The end of the movie seems to have run out of money. It ends so suddenly that you don't want more ... It ends so soon for the second thought. <br /> <br /> So if you're looking for a good time with your friends, look for this movie. It's a big unintentional comedy.
