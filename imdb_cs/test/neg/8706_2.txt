With the title "10 Commandments" you would expect the film to represent the Bible account, specifically Exodus. Not here. This is the standard procedure with any Bible film made by Hallmark. Remember "Noah"? That was total fiction and one of the worst films ever made. At least this film had the "original" truth. However, Menerith, who was the main character in this film - Moses half-brother, is not in the original story. Other characters were missing, not to mention important events that were completely removed. So what can you ask? Because this should be representative of a real story; otherwise some might and do what actually happened. Nowadays, people get their religion from movies instead of church and read the Bible. It's also a big mistake. See Revelation 22: 18-19. The script is already written. Why change it? In addition to the Exodus account (which should be the main focus), you have the Cecil B. DeMille movie to compare it, which is clearly a much better presentation. , my wife tried to see. I told her not to give her hope because it was Hallmark's movie. She looked confused and said, "Why? Hallmark makes good movies." That could be so, but they are breaking the Bible. I'm sorry I was right. Not only the story, but also the performance. With today's technology, you should be able to make a wonderful Bible film. I'm still waiting...
