DO NOT CONVERT HYPE! <br /> <br /> I had to see why all the critics in this movie are melting away. I saw it and I still don't get it. The fence is thin, very thin. After the movie was over, I didn't know the name of the female leaders yet and one of the two male characters didn't even have a credit name, he was credited as a "farmer". I wasn't interested in characters, so I didn't care about the film. The scenery and cinematography have been brilliant, but it's also on National Geographic or The Discovery Channel. <br /> <Br /> I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
