I had the honor of seeing this powerful Broadway game with Kathy Bates in the lead. I only saw one more game in the 70s and 90s that had an emotional impact like this game. I was really looking forward to the movie that was being made, but I was very disappointed to find out that Kathy Bates wasn't going to show her role in the movie - at that time Broadway was not well known and the producers had to be interested in Star Power I suppose and cast instead of Sissy Spacek. Sissy did an adequate job in the lead role, but she never measured Kathy Bates. I love Anne Bancroft, but she seemed too young for this role. The movie was true for the game. Anyone who sometimes thinks of suicide should watch this movie to realize the devastation of those who are behind.
