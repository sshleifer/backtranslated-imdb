It's a pity they didn't believe the original enough to build on it. But "RoboCop 2" takes great ideas, imagination and original characters and replaces them with all the stereotypes that offer the sequel. <br /> <br /> The initial ad was cute and so was the following scene (reminiscent of the beginning in "Guys and Dolls!"), but in addition to thinking about here and there, this is one movie that is a slow, dirty slog down to the center of nowhere. Br /> <br /> Thoughts are introduced and then dropped, interesting characters from the original barely get some time on the screen, most of the new characters (Cain, Juliette Faxx) are so boring that they wouldn't stay no matter what the movie, and then there's the tone. In a blessed original, Paul Verhoeven knew how to focus on such an attitude when, when you grasped the attitude and sensitivity of good pulp comics, most of the repulsive violence would be fun. Kershner (though DID's direct sequel to "Star Wars") no. And the scene after the scene either tears you, looks away, or just tunes it in completely. <br /> <br /> And what about RoboCop? There should be a main thing, right? But there is a whole scene where it doesn't even appear, and what scenes are in them, they are so thoughtful and shaky that you don't know or care if it's part of a man or cyborg - because it's all boring. I've never seen such a quick fall from grace. Why does Hollywood make such a bad sequel? On purpose? Why; did movie makers make a bet? <br /> <br /> Only one star "RoboCop 2"; FX's good, but the story doesn't even try them.
