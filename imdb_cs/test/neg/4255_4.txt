Europe's Europe's Mario Racocevic is the only user who has posted a comment and covers the main points of the film. Once again, it is a difficult film to buy in the UK. I had to go through "Midnight Video", which has a Swedish branch. I went to the post office and ordered a post order and a similar title only on SKR30 and title. This movie goes under a lot of "aka" depending on when and where it is sold. The previously purchased "The Bloodsucker Leads Dance" (which you will find if you search on Imdb under "People" and enter "Christ Nell"). The actor who plays the Earl on his private island in the second film had his lyrics dubbed from an Italian to English actor with an unmistakably mournful and somewhat tired sounding voice. I smiled as I heard the same voice dubbing on an English soundtrack as a police inspector who investigates the murder of a prostitute killed in a movie in the subject. Of course my choice was to see another trip d elicious of Christ Nell. There are quite a few inconsistent sub-plots in the film that include blackmail / blackmail, slimy stuff with mothers of friends, the pursuit of a motor cycle that results in a gangland hit. "client" friends from the motorcycle, sleazy photography, cross dressing transvestite etc., which give the taste of this film summarized in the word - SLEAZE, (but artistic sleaze). no, though without an explanation of their "wheres and whyfores". I personally thought that there were too many subplots and not enough to put in the main story and the relationship of these subordinates to the central plot and the development of their character screen.Also the professional movie editor was very needed because some scenes seemed to last too long because they realized it, so the movie seemed to stretch out of the place; for example, the scene of a dancing transvestite.Christ Nell appears in one fruit scene with a client, but it is just a vignette and I left more of her, the director and the script. <br /> <br /> I love political misstatement in older films (that is, 30 years since its creation), for example, smoking in the office and the way some characters react to each other in the office, I would recommend 4/10 as a more realistic assessment and award it as such.
