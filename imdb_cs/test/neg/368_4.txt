Some spoilers **** Soap has some wonderful moments to recommend it. When Charlotte and Veronica approach intimacy, it's a beautiful, low key, really erotic scene. I also loved music scores and fine, subdued cinematography. I'm not sure if the curious stop and start structure of the movie comes from being originally in serialized form (the announcer describing the action in the sections is quite unpleasant). My biggest problem with this movie is his absurd depiction of transwomen and her life. Of course, it must be shown as a sexworker, scattered, impractical, absurdly gathered / girly, utterly hopeless in terms of dressing and inability to make interpersonal ties in the world. In addition, she is always shown with a two-day beard growth (for some bizarre reason) as if to emphasize how tawdry her life is. And she is waiting for a sex change operation when she seemingly has done nothing else to pass her the transition. In fact, this character resembles the queen of the campaign, not someone in the middle of the transition. These are typical fantasies of people from the outside who are not really connected to transporters. The Fetishization of GRS Operation Film is a way to objectify people who are going through a transition. This aspect of the film did not impress. At the very least, why doesn't she have a character who is played by someone who is actually a transgender ... I thought a male actor depicting Veronica was fine but nothing better. Much better was a woman depicting Charlotte, a very complex character full of energy, self-destruction, desire and contradiction. If she was so fascinated by someone with female energy, Charlotte could go to the female bar in two seconds to find her. Yes, she was attracted to Veronica, but rather as an abstract idea of ​​someone with male / female characteristics (gentle touch but with a good blow), not as a unique person. Yes, what Soap says about love is often beautiful and moving, but that does not mean that a stereotyped minority must be more stereotyped in this process. This film also proves that Danes are miserable dancers. For such a promising assumption (better done in the movie as "Miscellaneous for Girls"), the final film is disappointing.
