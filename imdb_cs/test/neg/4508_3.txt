Victor Buono as a Devil? Someone had to be drunk when it was decided to cast. This is not the worst part of this silly mish-mash of various creepy house equipment, but gets my vote for being the funniest part. While the film is by no means terrible, it does not come close to any other "haunted houses" of the 1970s, such as Amityville Horror, The Changeling, and The Legend of Hell House. Evil can be fun in points, but don't expect you to worry. It's a better approach as it is: the stupid horror made all the sillier's over-reputable approach.
