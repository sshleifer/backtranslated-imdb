I doubt that whoever wrote this script sometimes actually read Mansfield Park ... or if they have it, it wasn't very good. None of the characters are as they should be: Fanny is alive and aware of his ill-treatment, while Sir Thomas, who treated her very well, seems to have accidentally got into Aunt Norris's personality. In addition, the first person telling Fanny is very unsuitable for both the story and her character. Fanny is not a fun heroine, and I would say that she should not be. In addition, in the film version, Fanny flirts blatantly with Edmund from the very beginning when they were raised as brother and sister! Austen's Fanny would get rid of flirting of any kind, and the novel paints Fanny / Edmund's pair as very unpleasant ... how she should be. Unlike some other Jane Austen novels (P&P, Emma), Mansfield Park is not based on the strength of its female protagonist. It is a very different kind of novel than others; It's not a love story. I watched this movie because I just finished reading Mansfield Park, and I'm absolutely horrified at what I see; Miss Austen rolls in the grave.
