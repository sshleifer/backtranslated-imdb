(Spoilers more than likely ... nothing really important that you couldn't figure it out for yourself) Yeah, it's really weird. I rented it on the blockbuster because there was no film description on the back of the box, just a list of the bands that had songs in it. But after that I had time to find him, even here on IMDB. I still confused it with "Demon Night," but you know they're basically the same. The parts I loved most about this movie were all in the garage. The black guy was a hilarious way of shouting all the time. Even if the scream was not necessarily necessary, he let himself "CONTINUE ALSO!" so they would go by car to other cars. But then he got the balls and hit them with a zombie with a broom. The second part, which caught my attention a bit, was part of the crash outside the building with the guys the girl didn't want to come to ... What was the important aspect of the movie? What it was? Why was it there? Why did the movie end up with a guy who broke TV in the studio? I saw the zombies running on the screen, but they were far away. He could just turn it off. Yes, this movie was shot on a whim and yes, I hated it. Hello...
