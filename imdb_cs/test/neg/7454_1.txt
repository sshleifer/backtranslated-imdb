This is by far the worst thing I've ever seen on film. My uncle's home movies have more talent in them then this piece of crap. The man has very cheap paper machetes looking for his hand. The actor is an abomination in this movie. There are scenes changes in the hat drop. For example, at least 30 seconds we see a guy humming a song for himself that doesn't add anything to the movie. This has the worst dialogue I've ever heard in my life, I don't think this movie could be any worse than it is. I'd like to describe it as a chuck to make Norris's action movie go wrong. And I hate Chuck Norris.
