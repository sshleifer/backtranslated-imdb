Flesh liked it very much and was looking forward to the Heat, but he couldn't help but feel that Morrissey grossly exploited most of the "performers" who performed here. Stumbling around the naked in the intoxicating drug seems to be all that Dallesandro has shown in this function - a huge and heartbreaking contrast from the body. His semi-erection in several scenes is the only sign that he can act; mostly it looks like he bought drugs. Woodlawn is a revelation okay - she's the embodiment of the Lower East Side. But she is one woman show - seldom deals with other executive though, it has to be told her sex scene with a beer bottle definitely leaves Halle Berry in the shade when it comes to film expressions of raw passion. When he falls on a young, wannabe lover, it is with the vampire's ferocity. Two of the female performers, Andrea and Jane, have such unpleasant voices that you will have to mute the sound to get past their scenes. The fact that several of these artists committed suicide or were murdered a few years after just adding to the air of exploitation. But they seemed desperate to get Morrissey in front of the camera. There is probably no worse way to spend Saturday night, but at least they bring some time and live life.
