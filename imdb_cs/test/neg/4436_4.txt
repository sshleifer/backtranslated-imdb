The Quintet marks Paul Newman's only journey as well as Robert Altman's science fiction. It was said about Newman that he could not make a comedy, but he tried until he eventually scored a real success in that genre with Slap Shot. However, the failure of this film left him shy and never tried again. <br /> <br /> This is one of the biggest movies I've ever seen. It is a futuristic ice age, brought by who knows what, but it is probably nuclear winter. Even during the Ice Age thousands of years ago, the equatorial parts of the country still kept animals and humans alive, but apparently not here. Seals have survived and Paul Newman is a seal hunter on the outside. But hunters need a little R&R and Newman goes to a futuristic city where everything is so boring that natives have a game with six people and it's a kind of Russian roulette. To win you have to kill five other participants in the game. It's a sad turn to see what a person has come down. Which is one of the reasons I couldn't get into this story. The atmosphere is bleak, the story is bleak, people are bleak, it's all so bleak. No wonder this thing came at the box office for a short time. It's a movie that everyone thinks will never be on the top ten Paul Newman movies, including me. This is the future of a man who is a defective person.
