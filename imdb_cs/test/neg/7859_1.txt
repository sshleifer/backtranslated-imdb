"Heaven can wait" is a crushing hole and candy-coated misogynistic lies. I can't imagine any film students doing it today. Don Ameche is in almost every scene, and although he has a fungal voice that has undoubtedly contributed to his successful radio career, he has no charisma to bear this film. Ameche plays Henry, the groom. Lubitsch wants to make Henry's sexual incontinence delightful and entertaining, directing Ameche to play the role as brilliantly as possible. The combination of Amech's lack of charism and Lubitsch's insistence on blandness results in a leading character who is deadly boring and totally icky. With this man you wouldn't want to spend time; He gave you sleep. You wouldn't leave him alone with your daughter, regardless of her age. Something creepy would happen. <br /> <br /> The film looks pretty boring. The scene after scene consists of static, over-lit, diorama shots of cleverly dressed glazed-age shirts and bustles that crawl in too busy Victorian lounges. There are so many ruffles and curls and curls, so much lilac and sky blue and pink you need Dramamine. Sweet Bow Top. The contrast between message content and delivery is offensive. In one of the most hateful scenes of the film, an older woman is sent to hell because she is not physically attractive.
