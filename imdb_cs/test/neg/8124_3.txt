I still remember when Frog Baseball first aired on MTV. According to some strange, surrealistic way, the cartoon captured stupid actions that I think every boy growing up in America is engaged. I'm thinking about how I burned a crippled grasshopper with a magnifying glass, but it was interesting at the time. for some reason. We grew up in the 1980s and we all knew "stoners". They were children who wore Iron Maiden T-shirts to school, long hair grew, had immature mustaches, and were two centimeters taller than everyone else because they had two classes. We laughed at them because they were so stupid, even if they were not stoned. So it was easy to understand Beavis & Co because we already knew them, some of us were even them. To the extent that the GenXers, like me, would abolish the 1980s surplus and adopt the grunge movement of the 1990s, Beavis & Co was a strange postmodern anthem for us. Strange, because like Beavis & Co we didn't care if we had an anthem. It was just an inner joke that we all immediately got, though it was terrible.
