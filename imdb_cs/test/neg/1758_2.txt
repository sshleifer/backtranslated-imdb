Her view of embalming was totally unsuitable for this role. Her face was too white, her hair too stuffed, her clothes, and so on. Too clean (and fitting well, especially my father and his father's hat in the scene where Inman comes home) for any sense of precision. One thing would be if production allowed other actors to stay clean and perfect, but she was the only one who didn't understand. There was no smudge on her powder face. We believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bath and a mirror? Certainly she was the only one who used them. Tweezers also; What's with the eyebrows? She looked perfectly reasonable! The love story was unlikely. She approached the guy because someone told her he said he thought she was cute. So, she goes over teasing him, then flirting with him a couple of times, and suddenly it's love for steam with Odysseus and Penelope? Please. I should have known better than to expect something better from a man who brought us an "English patient." My reaction to this was the same as Elaine on Seinfeld: "It was sucked."
