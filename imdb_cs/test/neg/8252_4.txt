What is a mathematical genius who receives critical juices? In my opinion, BEAUTIFUL MIND didn't like me very much (FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING earned an Oscar this year), while GOOD BEEF HUNTING had several awards that were undeserved. When I attended the film school, I was told that GOOD HUNTING is a very good example of not starting the script and the tutor was right. This film lacks any type of opening hook and is usually very slow. If you wrote an unsolicited script like this, the script reader would give up on page 15 <br /> <br /> The structure aside from the idea of ​​a member of an American subclass, which is some sort of intellectual god, really doesn't ring real. Ask yourself: If this is the most beautiful character in the movie, how come he went through a short life without anyone noticing his abilities? Neither childhood teacher noticed his gift? Very unlikely is the fact that he has read so much mind that he is expanding the litratura. And if Will is so smart, how come he is so forgotten, what happens to young, good-looking boys in American prisons? But it's a cast that left most of the film down. Want to get a few actors to play the harsh hard gang members? Let's get Matt Damon and Ben Affleck who is like getting Russell Crowe to play a pacifist or Charles Bronson to play a liberal good. I couldn't convince myself that Damon and Affleck got scared when they smashed the smack of people in the chops and couldn't help thinking that even though they wrote the script, the parts should be given to different actors, after all Billy Bob Thornton scripts the films he has not uploaded and the same criteria should be applied here <br /> <br /> The film has some good points. Robin Williams is great as a man trying to show that his potential is also a very good Stellan Skarsgard, who is just one of the greatest actors of the character who find themselves out of Europe and, despite my previous criticism of the script, is quite touching. Dialogue in the park as the character of Williams explains to Will what he saw in his life <br /> <br /> But I have to repeat that there are fewer plus points than negatives in this movie and I have it. I agree with the people who said that GOOD BEES are boring and unconvincing
