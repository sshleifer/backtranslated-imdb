After reading the novel for the first time, I do not mind, for the purposes of filming, how otherwise it is written, if it follows, or at least includes, a plot. For reasons known only to Hollywood, important parts of the story are completely ignored and another storyline is added. The reason this novel has passed the test of time is no doubt due to the intertwining of both the characters and the plot as a whole. To interfere with this structure is to destroy the complex balance of the story and thus intellectually tell the story. Although this is the opinion, the cast of this film leaves a lot of wishes. Characters, described as very thick, should at least be designed to look cheerful so that the character can be credible. The days of slavery cannot be over, or certainly, the actors of this caliber would be in rebellion, in such a riot of the story. The face of Marian Halcolme is described as masculine in appearance, ... Tara Fitzgerald's very feminine appearance is not true. Again, Laura Fairly is described as "fair", if not "ethereal," so that with dark hair she does not feel that the novel's impression is set. ... Badly done, Hollywood! J. Hunter
