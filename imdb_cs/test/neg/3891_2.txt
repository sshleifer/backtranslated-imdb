Beautiful music. Beautiful photos, some scenes are breathtaking and impressive. But the dramatic tension is lost in a movie that is so poorly edited that it's hard to know exactly what's going on. Sometimes dialogue is incomprehensible. Then there's Richard Gere. It's supposed to be a factory worker who gets into trouble and gets a job on the farm. We see dozens of sweaty and dirty farmhands in the hot sun. Then we see Gere looking like he was leaving Calvin Klein's advertisement. Sam Shepard, another glamor guy, is supposed to be terminally ill. But it looks great. Nice try, but it just doesn't work. Brook Adams try hard but she gets lost in the landscape. A real star is a girl.
