Okay, some other people said it's not an action, so I don't have to toss it (even if I did). This isn't a wasteland, in fact it's a nice opportunity to see the actor try something else. But unfortunately this is not one of those opportunities. Now, the story: non-existent. This movie lacks the storyline almost as much as 'Showgirls'. Sure, a few ecologists, no ecologist, throw something else, tidbits here and there to please Seagal (that's what's in it). It doesn't make a story, not close. Now the end ... Even those of us who really liked this movie ... the end, you have to admit it was a little too much or very stupid. Now from what I understand it was a direct-to-movie video (at least in the states), but this is even too good for this one. This piece of waste should only be a cable, on TBS or Starz (late at night).
