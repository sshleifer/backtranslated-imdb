Why did they release this movie from us? It looks like they've set out to make this film absolutely slap on Anna Rice's surface and every loyal fan of the Vampire Chronicles. It ignores ground work set by Interview with Vampire, Mayhem Conspiracy Conspiracy and Stuart Townsend stumbling around drunk. Stuart is not our Lestat! Our Prince Prince, our adventurous rebel with the deepest sense of humor. Stuart is the second speed, boring rip off Dracula in black leather. Didn't read books or know character ... is illiterate? Tom Cruise is dyslexic and still trying to read books and knew and loved Lestat. Don't worry, it's not a "stand" vampire film that is simple and simple.
