I was looking at the sci-fi channel when it disappeared. Although not as bad as Wynor's "Curse of Komodo", this is still angry ... BAD. Wynorski uses the same island as in the "Curse of Komodo" as well as the same actors and house. The effects are top (surprising) but that's about ........ I don't know what else to say about this movie ....... oh yeah! As in "The Curse of Komodo", the government will join and decide to bomb the island! Also .... when I saw this part I laughed hysterically ... AND KOMANBRA !!! (part man, komodo and cobra!). Overall, this film is a bullshit of bad film standards. Just remember if Jim Wynorski had something to do with the movie. 0 out of 5.
