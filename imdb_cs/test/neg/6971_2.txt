I've seen Ed Wood's biopsy many years ago. Tim Burton paid a loving tribute to this extremely unconventional but enthusiastic filmmaker. Then I saw Plan 9 and actually tickled me to the end. Stupid story, kind of bad production values, but still fun and fun. Then it. What you can do about it. Since wood has been reported as a cross-dresser, it is surprising to see a film that deals with it as a cartoon. Yes, there are some stings in teaching the viewer something about the subject, but mostly it's some kind of really twisted self-parody. One problem is that he has one hundred opinions. On the one hand, it is a request for tolerance. Another shows transvestism as a disease. Finally, it tells the audience: "Okay, if you're schocked now, then wait until you see it!" The problem had to be that Wood had to compromise to make the film. You almost feel it when you see an introductory title from the producer: Personally supervised ... So where are we. This is neither a serious subject film, nor a universal schocker. <br /> <br /> The entertainment value is virtually zero. The wooden voice is fun, but just because it sounds so wrong. This was done in the 50s though, so one can argue that it was brave to make a film that even mentioned the word transvestites. It all depends on what the film is trying to promote. Schock. Rape scenes while mild is there just to do. So, sorry. This is a failure, but discrediting is not Wood.
