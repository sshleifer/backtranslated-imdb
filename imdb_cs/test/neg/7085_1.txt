This is perhaps one of the worst films ever made. Everything about him - acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography - is terrible. A stranger (a man in a sparkling suit) claims to be from a nearby universe; one assumes that the screenwriter meant "galaxy", but did not bother to get a dictionary to control his terms. A better title for the movie would be "It came from a planet plot." The story is excessively stupid and almost nonexistent. All humans receive magical MacGuffins who are in harmony with a series of unlikely limitations just to move the plain graph. Any thought of the passage of time is ignored. Now it's a few days after meeting the aliens, then BAM! suddenly there is only a few hours to zero. Do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You make yourself stupid to follow him. The end is especially stupid and should be accompanied by someone who went "Ta-Da !!!!" as the screenwriter simply pulls something out of his ass. I think the real extraterrestrial plot is that this movie is so bad you watch it. If you can watch the last 10 minutes without having to pack yourself ("enemies of freedom" - honestly) to laugh, you're retarded.
