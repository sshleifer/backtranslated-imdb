Well, I just caught the end of this movie on HBO, just the last 10 minutes or so, but I have to say that it contains the most ridiculous view of the distance EVER put on the movie! I am a serious runner on the track and a dedicated fan of the sport. However, nothing could ever prepare me for what is on the screen shown in the last 10 minutes of this movie, it literally defies faith! The image of runners is even more ironic because African runners dominate sport and are elegant and elegant. The female protagonists shuffles together as an overweight pregnant woman, and her "highly trained" male supporters are no better. In this race, this world-class runner is surrounded by overweight poodles, many of whom are WALKING! I find it interesting that the director decided to lead her in a women's competition, but at the end it turns out she misses people who seem to be hanging out on two broken legs! Are we convinced that this stunning star sportsman overtook only a maimed man at the end of the race? Maybe the director thinks the runners can't run faster than 12 minutes, and apparently never heard of athletes like Paula Radcliffe or Tirunesh Dibaba. Although you are not a running fan, you will be amazed at the insanely inaccurate view of the run, and this movie is only observable as an unintentional comedy. Here's a note for the director: The next time you decide to make a movie about a sport, maybe it would be worth hiring at least one person who was actually watching the sport.
