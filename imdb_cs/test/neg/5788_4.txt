Someone remarked that Charlie Sheen's character should be a martyr for what he wanted. Maybe you're right, but that's SEAL. For several months I served with the SEAL team from Norfolk, VA. In fact, I should say that our ship has been used for deployment in Europe for several months. I was a post clerk on board and these guys tried to get their mail every day. Since we had only one person to pick up the mail each day, we issued one card to one person. A different SEAL would come every day to pretend to be someone else. Well, after the third time I didn't tell them until I had proof of who they were. Å li NUTS !!! I thought they were going to go through my cage with me, gagging me, and then stealing my mail. Fortunately, I didn't just have a president on my side (the Navy), but a federal government (US Mail). That was the only time I saw that the SEALs stopped having what they wanted. They were allowed an unlimited shore holiday where we had to be back on the ship at a certain time. They killed and tortured a woman in France, and two SEALs received only one week's detention while the sailors were caught to steal a bottle of wine from a French wine shop and get a fight. No wonder why the SEAL retention rate is greater than 85%? As SEAL you are a god. So this movie has a pretty accurate task of showing how SEAL is acting and thinking ... unfortunately it is so unbelievable that normal people think it's fake.
