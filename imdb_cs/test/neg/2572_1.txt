This movie is undoubtedly the worst action movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry, but it's just pathetic. In fact, the best part of the movie (this movie is to be serious) is when the chicken speeds over the road, on foot, at about 100 miles per hour. This pathetic editing bug makes the movie totally cheerful for about 2 seconds, then it is back to "non stop, on the edge of your seat when you're trying to find a comfortable sleeping position, action!"
