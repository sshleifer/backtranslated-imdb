I'm not a fan of the original book, but I expected to see a better adaptation than Natalie Portman's movie I found terribly. This version is even worse. First, in this scenario there are very few books by Mrs. Gregory. George Boleyn's entire sexuality subplot is totally ruled out, and in this version George is just a nasty mistake between his duty to the Boleyn family and his duties to the king. I thought the title of the book referred to Mary as a lesser-known Boleyn sister, but used to refer to Anne here. Secondly, the script has characters that regularly appeal to viewers as they admit. Apparently it is supposed to give a little back story and explain their motives, but it is amateur in the execution. At the top of the wrong scenario, the direction is terribly bad. There are too many shots with a circling camera that is at best too stable and the worst in the worst case. Several speeches are given as if they were the first exam. The production values ​​of Henry's spectacular court are minimal. Costumes vary: some are copies of historical portraits and others are from a costume designer. And the king, the source of all power and kindness, is often shown ALONE. No court courtiers, no background servants - where are all the people? I am used to the Hollywood transformation of history into fantasy, but I expected better from BBC production. Even on the wrong book, this production is BAD.
