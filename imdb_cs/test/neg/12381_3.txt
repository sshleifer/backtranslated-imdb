This one is like cheesy, how come? The concept of a massive and indestructible extraterrestrial bird is already too bent for words, but wait until you get to a lot of goofy creatures as they appear on the screen! I tell you, I laughed so hard through this thing that I missed some of the interpretative dialogue? then again, this is often so difficult on scientific jargon and laws of physics and such (at which I have never been any good, despite my love for sci-fi movies) that it didn't really matter any way! Pt√°k ?? first depicted as a mere blurry form whistling through the sky but consequently showed in all its drooling glory? it's so inconspicuously stupid that it wouldn't be uncomfortable in Looney Tunes' career (witnessing a series of intermittent photos that begin with a creature in the distance and end up on the side divider extreme detail of the face)! Director Sears with his next UFO film, Fine EARTH VS. FLYING SAUCERS (1956) ?? with special effects provided by Master Ray Harryhausen (whom I just informed that I just handed over my copy to the other in anticipation of a recently released Columbia DVD); it also seems to me that some of the shots illustrating the bird ramp in New York have been abolished from the destruction of Washington, which was seen in the earlier sci-fi classic! Again, leads are played genres regular? namely Jeff Morrow (of THIS ISLAND COUNTRY [1955]) and Mara Corday (of TARANTULA [1955]); As with the above-mentioned FLYING SAUCERS, are these titles highly appreciated and loved by fans? as a result, they are extremely superior to this woeful contribution of the extraterrestrial / monster animal cycle prevailing during the sci-fi flowering and beyond (by the way, other flying threats have been featured in FLYING SERPENT [1946] I have not seen, and Larry Cohen's language face updates in Q: THE WINGED SERPENT [1982]). Unfortunately, The GIANT CLAW can't even reach a decent peak? who is so rushed to be "flushing", citing a jet pilot from the movie itself, whose bird rocket attack proves to be totally ineffective (ie, before Morrow realizes he is protected by an invisible barrier and then has to come how to get into it). Finally, in addition to unmanageable (and frankly boring) technical asides, one gets the feeling of "so bad is it good" to watch it: after all, it only takes 74 minutes? and in any case, the bird is such an unforgettable daft creature that every time he appears, a huge smile appears on his face!
