A post-apocalyptic warrior leaves to rescue some kind of nun and on the way meets some cyber-punks on skates who want to kick his ass. This is one of the hardest movies ever, there are scenes with silence that seem the last hours before someone comes up with another misspelled, badly acted line. There are action sequences that repeat - and we are not talking about the action repetition of quickfire 1-2-3 action on a particularly good kick popular with Eastern directors, we speak many, many repetitions of long, bad battle sequences. This is incredibly confusing at first, but then quickly becomes uncomfortable when you watch a 30-second sequence for 2nd, 3rd, and 4th time. Any kind of conspiracy or vision is lost in confusing continuity, the only thing that keeps this movie in the video player (except for a friend bet I couldn't watch all the way without asking it to be turned off) and disposed of safely, so it can hurt anyone another) is the fact that while it is painful, this film is unintentionally cheerful, I am not at all a fan of those "so bad that it is a funny" type of movies, but in parts I was in tears. Other points to note are the quality of sound and image, but it is forgiven because it is obvious that money is a major problem in making this movie. The Final Verdict - The King "So Bad That They Are Funny" genre, anyone who has such a kind of video night genre should get a copy. He also doesn't forget that it's actually the worst movie I've ever seen.
