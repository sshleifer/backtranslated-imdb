"Mature" is one of those horrible indies who get into circulation and give indies a bad name. Telling a stupidly unrelated story of teenage twins crawling out of a fiery car accident that kills parents and then sets off on a journey while walking happily, making a guy goo-goo and ending up in an army post, so no army would do any army . I want it (yeah, right!). An obvious attempt at getting close to age is a "mature" almost complete loser who wanders aimlessly when players drift in and out of a character that finally ends clumsy with Nara, which is anywhere. Not recommended to anyone.
