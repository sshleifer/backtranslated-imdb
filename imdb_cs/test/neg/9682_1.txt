This rendition of "Noah's Ark" has set Hallmark's (and Turner's) reputation back for about 100 years. However, production has a clear side ... learning experience for beginning film entrepreneurs in "making a movie" <br /> <br /> Where the quotes and situations can be found in the annals of biblical literature and common sense: <br / > <br /> "Okay, guys, let's sit up." "It's too bad that God created the sun to shine during the day we really needed it at night." "We're not kissing ... we just whisper in the mouth of others." The cut on the Ark building with the word "Georgia Pacific" set off on it. Metal nails. Children flying kites. Salesman (as James Coburn can sleep after this) selling Chinese hats. Pirates attacking a wooden sheet they wished to capture, with blazing tar balls of fire shot from the catapults. Glass bottles of wine (Noah was in constant state of inibriation. It was a miracle that he saw that the Ark was let alone). still rated G) Doing biblical pirates with an iron pan (teflon lined?). Landing on Mount Ararat after passing through Herculean planes. <br /> <br /> etc. Etc., Etc. Special Effects ... You have to see them to not trust them. <br /> <br /> The list goes on. This film must not be missed; but if you want a full TV version, you need to call NBC for the screen version ... but only if you agree that NBC will discard any responsibility for sending you the first thing. There is only a faded version (without pirates, etc.) in video stores ... ie, in the video stores they dare to store. Marvin Cohn <br /> <br />
