This movie makes "Glitter" look like "Schindler's List." Tarantino and Weinsteins really need to consider carefully before putting their names on the product. Green-lighting and P.O.S. like this, regardless of friendship, it's just a bad deal. Larry Bishop must be kept away from the film camera at all costs. Bishop writer / director / producer / actor shows that his skills are not sufficient for any of these works. The vanity in the south, "Hell Ride", usually allows good actors to chew the scenery ... at least when the camera is not focused on Bishop's weak attempts to steal every scene he is in. the last three words on "Hell Ride" are STINK, STANK, STUNK.
