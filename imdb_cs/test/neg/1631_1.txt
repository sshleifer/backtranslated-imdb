Like everyone else, I learned about this Turkey at Mystery Science Theater 3000. It is easy to rank among my favorite MST3K episodes of all time. I really couldn't imagine that the movie had to look at its own, though ......... it really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really bad . Miles O'Keeffe plays the role of Ator, Fabio's mentor-bound mentor who lives at the time of cave men. We, the viewer, are asked to suspend our distrust of knowing alchemy and chemistry and can build a complete hang glider in about 5 minutes. Yeah, right! There is also a pretty attractive actress (she can't remember her name) who wears a hub-cap like a chest shield. Oh, and I can't forget that this shocking Asian side Thong kicks. He had the simplest role in the film because he did not say a single word of dialogue throughout the film. He had to figure out how to make his character interesting without talking ... and he failed miserably. <br /> <br /> The movie is in no way observable and should only be displayed in the correct MST3K format. If you look at this version, you will laugh stupidly! <br /> <br /> "I'm huge !!!!" <br /> <br /> Rating: 1
