That's the worst movie I've ever seen, no bar. From fragile-looking, ill-lit sets to ridiculous acting, infantile conspiracy and delicate action sequences, this film is so bad, it's fun. About ten minutes. Then you get to the remote or power connector to end this movie without experience. Although it was apparently made with the entire production and acting group of collective language thrust into the face (please, God), I found Jack Frost 2 so terrible it was not worthy for more than a quarter of an hour. If you haven't had enough after this time, you have to abuse drugs.
