When the PUFFY CHAIR prompts, beware of its soft, colorful upholstery. The movie starts pretty well. Josh (Mark Duplass) and Emily (Kathryn Aselton) are girlfriend-girlfriends couple having a little hard time with their relationship. One night, an argument arises for Josh to ask Emily to go on a roadtrip to her father's house, where Josh plans to deliver a purple LazyBoy chair on her father's birthday. Emily accepts and picks up Josh's flighty brother Rhett (Rhett Wilkins) along the way, who resembles Amisha, who is more in touch with people's lives than his own. between Josh and Emily, as well as the bitter feeling for The Puffy Chair (that's very grubby at first and falling apart until Josh "convinces" the original owner to renovate him). Rhett quickly discovers that the cause of all Emily and Josh's problems is LazyBoy and sets him up for one night's torch ... <br /> <br /> And that's the last thing we hear about a chair, though there are many minutes left in the movie. The big problem is that the movie's title is The Puffy Chair, when it's not a chair at all, which lasts in the center. This is Josh and Emily is a convicted relationship and how the roadtrip seals their feelings for themselves. Once the chair is destroyed, it never mentions it, even when Josh's parents arrive at his father's birthday without a gift. Josh never mentioned a chair or his father. There is no relationship between them and the lives of these people. So why call The Puffy Chair and why isn't there a tie? Bad scenario. Another unpleasant thing is that Brother Mark Duplass, Jay Duplass, is not just a director but also a cameraman (and not very good). Almost every scene has a fast approach to characters that are grainy and focused before the camera automatically focuses and rights itself. Initially, it was on picturesque and artistic feelings, but quickly became unbearable. The acting in the movie is accessible and fun. All the actors / actresses did a good job. However, poor production quality, ending the end, and lack of coherence with the title, caused the film to cause too many problems.
