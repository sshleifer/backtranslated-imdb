Tarantino's previous films were from a guy in love with other films. This one is from a guy in love with his own writing. It's not insidious, its disgusting. I absolutely hated Inglorious Basterdy. The whole point of the movie is to entertain - if u call bashing head people and remove their scalps fun !!!! - and if there is one unforgivable sin, the film may commit, it is extreme boredom or resistance. . There's even one scene where 3 people talk for almost 45 minutes at the same table, before, fortunately, they're all shot. I wished they were killed after 5 minutes. Even Woody Allen knows when to close F ** K up. This table is a Tarantino style, but in other movies I really cared about what they were saying and the people who spoke. I couldn't care less here. All Quentin's films show huge trust, especially Jackie Brown. But here is the ubiquitous feeling in every scene, Tarantino had no idea where he was going with the film. Is it violent? Of course, torture and scalping are galore, but you have to remind me. Fortunately, the film was so thin, I didn't even remember seeing it earlier that day when I saw the title of the MSNBC review. It's from tricks and apparently dies to write a novel. But do us a favor QT and save us the movie. <br /> <br /> I came out of this movie halfway and would never advise anyone who would see it no matter what the quarantine fan. I give it 0/10.
