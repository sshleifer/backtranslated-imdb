It is true that I have fine-tuned it in the hope of seeing some of James Brolin's sponge cakes. Unfortunately there was only one, soon, and the rest of the film was very tame, and eventually made little sense. The story is there, focusing on Nick and Julie Atkins, a couple whose marriage of many years begins to grow. Nick, a successful businessman, focuses on working to the point of neglecting Julie, who is trying to fill the void by returning to school. Julie longs for the enthusiasm she and Nick had in their marriage soon, beginning to form in the form of strong sexual fantasies that prevent reality for a few minutes, causing her to do things like burning breakfast and disappearing her husband's documents. At first she fantasizes about her husband, but as the film progresses, she begins to fantasize about other people and encounters with random strangers she encounters. It will culminate in her demeanor with catastrophic consequences for her marriage. Can she and her husband recover their relationship? Is it worth saving? It could have been an interesting assumption, but the execution is so bland that you wonder why they bothered. Characters are not developed. Themes are not explained. Background information not listed. It is not explored how Julie got to the point where she could not control herself, and no explanation is offered as to how she will do it in the future. The end product is a confused mess that is as confusing as Julie's imagination, which is surprisingly underdeveloped. Acting is a mixed bag. Donna Mills as Julie does well with the material she is given, though her constant self-pity becomes sharper after a while. James Brolin behaves as if he was reading his lines from the cue cards, and even his anger at his wife's infidelity is hard to buy, showing so little passion for the whole thing. Supporting roles are mostly forgotten. Disappointing the treatment of what might have been an interesting story. More is a pity because it does not even offer the eye candy he has promised.
