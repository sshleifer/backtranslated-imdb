This film approached me from Straub's novel to entertain me. He barely reached the center of the film. In addition to changing Don Wanderly from Edwards' nephew to his son, he removed most major scenes and a number of characters that gave the novel so much life. There was only rubbish left. Straub's version was much better than this poorly executed film. I don't think casting did everything we could to choose members of the Chowder Society. Hopefully someone will come and actually remake this movie right in my life. I just hate when Hollywood butchers do the work of talented authors because they think their version is much better. It makes me sick.
