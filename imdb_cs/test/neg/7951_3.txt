Have you ever watched a movie when your left is thinking about what this is all about? Hello, say "Scream, baby, scream". It's not such a complicated story or something like that, it's just that it is played in three completely different modes ... 1. A funny film about drugs in the 60's ... 2. A much overwritten soap opera ... and a 3rd horror movie swing (very little on "Scream"). To my surprise, I found out that one of my favorite favorites, Larry Cohen, wrote it. Well, I think even the best must learn through trial and error. <br /> <br /> Play as something from H.G. Lewis (with only a smaller fx), this "bad" movie has its pleasures. Most of the time it's a short run time, there's a pretty cool jazz score to be heard, and there are some unforgettable scenes ... one of those where a group of kids decide to experiment with acid and take a nice long motorbike ride to the zoo . Camera tricks, which the director uses to describe the hallucinatory state, are only delayed but fun. Trust me, if I tell you, you don't have to escape from the house to catch it!
