This son of a son following was at least terrible. You would think that production would be better 10 years after the original release, but Retro Puppet Master was not driven or written by the original writers and contained a bad story, lack of any emotional connection to any characters, and slowly dragged into the scene. scene. No strong conspiracy, very low climax, you will find yourself slowly, as you will slowly resist throughout the film if you can sit the whole cylinder. I could never understand why the horror continues after their "last chapter". I hardly recommend watching this movie, but if you have to, I don't recommend anyone to sit with it.
