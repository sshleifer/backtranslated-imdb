Above all, let me say that I do not deny the importance of the topic in any way - quite the contrary. I am Polish and I have long known about the Katyn massacre (in fact two of my family members actually died there), so I was looking forward to this film. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I think the main problem lies in a scenario that includes too many subplots and characters, none of which are properly developed. The characters are painfully one-dimensional; their stories are intertwined but lacking in meaning. In my opinion, casting doesn't really have a chance to show their skills. An exception is Andrzej Chyra, showing Jerzy - the only interesting character. I wish the story was more focused on him. As a result, the film lacks emotion. Before I saw it, I thought I'd be moved, just for sentimental reasons - but in fact I watched it with a strange sense of secession, except for the final scene. It's done well and its location is interesting and provides a climatic ending, although the idea of ​​the Lord's prayer, which is being executed by executed officers, seems a bit appealing. Finally, the film may have some educational value for those who are unfamiliar with the depicted historical events, but in my opinion fails as a cinema work.
