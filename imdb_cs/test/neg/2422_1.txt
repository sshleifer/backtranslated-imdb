This movie is probably the worst movie I've been watching in a very long time. The deal is so wooden that the door could do a better job. The story is ridiculous and shallow, and the real "rugby" is far from reality. I still don't have "haka" as shown in this poor apology for fun. I'm not a Kiwi, but I know Haka can only be done by someone of Maori origin, not an American white boy. I suppose it was for the American audience so the shallowness and "end of Disney" are excusable, but hardly tried to point out the basic rules of the game except the prison party, where the protagonist suddenly takes the game of American football everyone's playing rugby. The only good thing about this movie was the final credits. It would be less painful to spend ninety minutes inserting toothpicks into the eyeball.
