Let's see that Joe Estevez is bad (as usual), but it's not the only problem with casting, writer Vivian Schilling isn't really a big actress, he's actually upset. Her script isn't so bad, it's just bad. In fact, if the direction was better and if the actors were better, it could have been a really good movie. But unfortunately, with all these problems, "Soultaker" can't be as passable as a horror movie, plus the pace is too bad. <br /> <br /> The MST crew was entertained with this fun, but it was certainly not one of their best efforts. 5 for it, nothing for the original.
