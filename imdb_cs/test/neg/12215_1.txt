Negative numbers are not available to express how bad this movie is! The wooden play associated with the story that has been reworked several times. Everyone in this movie should attend Anonymous Overactors. Do you think the original story could evolve from a general concept. The young men at the preparatory school have pledged to deal with the Pearl Harbor bombing. It raises interesting questions, but the way they are communicated is rather a joke. Typical figures were present, including a keen athlete and a nerd (including glasses). I couldn't be more interested in wooden dialogue and clich√©s. When I finished the movie, I had to put the DVD in the trash. Stay away from this bagpipe! You won't have 90 minutes of your life back!
