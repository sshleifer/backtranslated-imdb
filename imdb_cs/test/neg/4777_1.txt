Plants in the ancient Mayan pyramid structure kill everyone who is coming. Yes, it's weird because the passengers don't count on it until everything starts crazy. And in a movie like this, I just wanted it to be absurd and marching bands were attacked by machete-controlling plants. other newlywed friends who know about this place. When they get there, the Mayans scream at them and hide in the building. And when there, it is when the plants decide to take them, imitate the sounds of the cell phone, people and ancient Mayan dead people. Nothing was really scary about the movie and not even fun. Even the strange end couldn't save that piece of crap. I was looking for something really good, but nothing. Oh, good. "F"
