This film lacked credibility for two reasons. One, no big city mayor, and New York is certainly as important as it is. It would allow a city in its city to break into such a violent place to live; especially for voters who might have something to say about their future job security. Most of the victims in the film were mostly older, Jewish or defenseless. At the age of 62, I have never seen a film showing such a complete lack of respect for the authority this film has done. Even "Escape from New York," which was fictional, up ahead, ie They said it was science fiction, not resorted to such deep-rooted violence. In this film, most of the older victims were a victim and yet had guns but were reluctant to use them. Also, in this movie and I haven't seen the previous two, it's more lawful than the "Escape" movie. Second, gangs have never been as cooperative as my film shows about my research programs. On the one hand, he grabs a gang member from another gang who works around them and is killed. However, when the heroes start shooting at local gangs, another gang is welcome with open arms. Gang members are always perceived as outsiders and stopped. We should believe that when automatic weapons are used against our gang, other gangs want to be involved. Why did the outside gangs come to help? I believe that more than one outside gang came to help. What did they lose? Another question, why was the gang leader in jail and why did his prison prisoners ask for permission to attack Bronson's character? It wasn't a great movie and I could go on, but I won't.
