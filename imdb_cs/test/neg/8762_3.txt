There's not much to say about this, except it's probably the worst of the first zombie movies (maybe I'll watch the next, REVOLT ZOMBIES [1936], a month ago). For all the intentions of John Carradin's star to build up an army in duty The Third Reich is not seen with them that they would do much at all!; James Baskett (Uncle Remus from SONG OF SOUTH [1946]!) Plays his leader, who also serves as Carradina's servant. Black comedian Mantan Moreland reprises his role as a "smart cat driver" by King ZOMBIES (1941), as well as the exotic named Madame Sul-Te-Wan as Carradine's housekeeper. Unfortunately for Carradine, his highest success? zombification of his wife? it will bring him all kinds of trouble: not only will her relatives turn to his distant dwelling / lab to ask for her sudden death (which means she has to pretend a funeral service!), but in fact she turns out to be disobedient and indignant, eventually "convincing" her fellow zombies stand up against their master !! It is also a cowboy star Bob Steele (still best known for his bit in Howard Hawks' THE BIG SLEEP [1946]), who plays a secret agent in the US and acts as a Nazi acting as a sheriff! Fortunately, director Sekely would be much happier with another genre effort, TRIFFID DAY (1962).
