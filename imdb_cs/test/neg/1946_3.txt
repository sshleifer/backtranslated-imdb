The film had an interesting surprise. He closes somewhat psychologically. And the creators could finish it tastefully without making any more of Hollywood movies promoting homosexuality and / or other sexual deviations. This could end up with a "paycheck", but there were other motifs behind the pen. What troubles me is that the mud in the face has swept over after you saw the whole movie. As a disappointment "Talented Mr. Ripley". Yeah, I'm just another puritan. This gay content tarnished the whole movie. I would not positively judge a film for artistic or entertaining value if its only purpose was to support lateral political motivation, more for it.
