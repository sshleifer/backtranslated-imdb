when I first read about "berlin am meer" i didn't expect much. but I thought with the right people, the right places, the right music, and the fashion, you could at least make a trivial movie about hip berlin that they seem to talk about. but eissler has failed, it is so ridiculously apocryphal. it is a complete distortion of what is happening in the Berlin scene. Of course this is not all about hippness, but you should expect more from a movie that is sold as a "definitive Berlin film". <br /> <br /> And in addition to all the credibility, it's a really bad movie. average behavior and somewhat boring conspiracy. Interestingly some actors have proven in other films that they are actually quite talented. So it really must be a bad overhead skill. Don't bother to watch "Berlin am Meer", if you don't have 17, come from a small town in West Germany and want to move to a big city after you finish school. Then it could be nice and absolutely cool.
