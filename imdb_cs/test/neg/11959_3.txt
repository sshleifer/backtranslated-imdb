Scarecrow Gone Wild begins as a high school teenager Mike (David Zelina) and his friends decide to put "shame" on wimpish diabetic Sam (Caleb Roehrig) as a kind of initiation. Mike and his friend decide to take Sam to the cornfield, tie him to the cross next to a strange looking scarecrow and leave him there all night, sounds like fun? Well, things get in order when Sam enters a diabetic coma after suffering from hypoglycemia, and the vengeful spirit of Sam goes into a bogeyman who comes to life and begins to hunt children responsible for Sam's unfortunate life situation. Can Sam's best friend Jack (Matthew Linhardt) and his girlfriend Beth (Samantha Aisling) save the day & Sam's life? Written and directed by Brian Katkin Scarecrow Gone Wild is the third entry to the Scarecrow video & if I haven't seen either of the previous two since I saw the Scarecrow Gone Wild, I certainly haven't changed this in any hurry. situation that is certain. In fact, the script has a pretty decent premise, because Sam's bad soul seeks revenge and his friends must somehow keep the real Sam alive, but the way he says is poor and I suppose it's basically just irrelevant to the fact that it's a movie about the killer scarecrow running around killing people in not very cruel or imaginative ways. He said there are one or two scenes that will save her from one star rating, fart gag in the cornfield is funny and something that many immature boys (like me) could do when two boys bury their friend in the sand and then standing over it and peeing on it is also somewhat funny in the laddish juvenile way, and a cool bit when some guy starts singing terrible songs, so a scarecrow throws a stick that breaks him! However these OK bits are few & far between & as a whole it's a silly, boring, poorly written teen slasher movie with a very unpleasant character that irritates. It's also very predictable and has a stupid twist ending that doesn't actually have a scarecrow feature at all, a problem like looking at a movie called Scarecrow Gone Wild you expect to see a scarecrow go wild & I have to admit it looks pretty cool How Horror Is The Character To Go. Director Katkin is doing a reasonable job here, though what on Earth is with this hospital in the end & all that neon lighting everywhere & the fact that there is only one patient there & two employees? Cinematography is much better than the usual low-end, low-budget horror movie, and there is a nice, albeit unrealistic, lighting. The film lacks any real fear or tension and some of the medical terminology used throughout is a little iffy at the very least & I say that as an insulin dependent diabetic myself. There's not much gore, there's a few scenes where some actor has some fake guts placed on his stomach to imagine them being gutted, but it looks pretty fake, there's also a burned face and a few impalements, but little else. There is a fair amount of naked female breasts on the show if it's your thing. Technically the Scarecrow Gone Wild is pretty good due to some of the low budget abominations I've been sitting lately, unfortunately it's still a bad movie overall. At least speaking about acting, the better. Scarecrow Gone Wild is not as bad as some of the direct-to-video horror crap that has appeared lately, but with the fact that it's not that much better and it's still a bad movie, when everyone said and did. Not recommended, the two previous entries are Scarecrow (2002) and Scarecrow Slayer (2003), both of which also went straight to video.
