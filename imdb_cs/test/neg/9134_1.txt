Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi are both beautiful movies, but this last installment of the trilogy is major. They were too kidnapped with footage and photos, so little content. The executive producer puts his own picture in the movie ... It's just pretentious. Maybe if they had more than $ 3 million to spend, maybe it would be something. Actually, I thought Steven Soderbergh had ordered it because it was so bad, but director Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, Godfrey Reggio, ordered it. I'll have to assume they just didn't have the budget to make a decent movie. You'd think Francis Ford Coppola would like to be part of this movie and help get more money together.
