If it wasn't for editing from cursed words and superimposed blur when one character made another finger, it would be easy to confuse this low-budget snoozer for a Sci-Fi channel pilot. The story of governmental attempts to destroy the telekinetics group, which he originally practiced as military weapons, ends up doubling with the hero who is gifted in pursuit of a telekinetic survivor trying to avenge himself. Unfortunately, the film is talky, boring, predictable and even lacking in interesting special effects. Top-billed Louis Gossett, Jr. it has a lesser role than the evil government bureaucrat who has created the program and now wants to remove all traces. He goes through the part and it's hard to understand why he bothered. Other cast members are doing a decent work with a scenario that requires little.
