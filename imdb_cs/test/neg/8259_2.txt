What is a great cast and what a pathetic film attempt. The script is full of holes from start to finish. Incoherent, not coherent ... absolutely ridiculous. One of the most talented / beautiful actresses in the world (and I'm talking about Nastassja Kinski) is without a single unforgettable line. Worse, she supposedly dye her hair in the middle of the movie, but it's obvious she only wears a cheap black wig she bought at a dear ladies store. The most beautiful moments are given to the character actor and his dogs in the apartment house where actor Peter Coyote lives. Fairuza Balk is photographed badly, naboot. It looks like an overweight overweight that is laid out on too many all-you-can-eat-student-cafeteria buffets. I was so looking forward to this movie. I wanted it, but I think I'd rather watch Nastassja read her phone book with her hair.
