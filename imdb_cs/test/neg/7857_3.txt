For some of us, director Ernst Lubitsch, adored by his basic flattery and ironic comic touches, was somewhat wet when he came to collect material. It is not that Lubitsch is overestimated - on the contrary, apparently he was before his time in terms of visual narration - but the projects he joined (or were assigned to) are not completely dominating his comedy. fans like to tag them. With "Heaven Can Wait", screening Lazlo Bus-Fekete's "Birthday", Lubitsch is saddled with a sleepy Don Ameche at the head - and a combination of anemic conspiracy, colorless star and stale flashback. the framework forms the director. The evil man at the turn of the century "falls asleep without realizing it", representing the facts of his life in front of the entrance of hell. Ameche ... bad? That was the number one problem. The promising opening sequence (set in Hades Hall) quickly recedes to a rugged whim and supportive casts have little help. * 1/2 from ****
