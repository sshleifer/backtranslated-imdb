We all have to start somewhere, it was in movies like Escape In The Fog that someone like Budd Boetticher could learn his business before making good movies. In fact, the film was dated before it hit a film that will be released on June 25, 1945. <br /> <br /> The war with Europe ended almost two months, of course, Harry Cohn couldn't control the events of History. So I wonder why the public has not questioned why the Nazi spy circle helped the Japanese. Another very bad historical inaccuracy was that the FBI had nothing to do with Pacific or Asian theater. The cloak and dagger things were in the OSS territory in this part of the world. When you are an FBI man like William Wright, it's definitely good to have a psychic girlfriend like Nina Foch. He is about to go on a mission to the Orient to name the key underground leaders to launch a general uprising in China against the Japanese occupation. The Germans who annoy Otto Kruger's house learned about it, and the whole movie is spent with these guys who have already lost the war trying to help their allies. By the way, they refer to as 'Japs'. When Foch is annoyed by a fast car and knocks unconscious, he dreams of Wright's danger and sees what happens to him on the Golden Gate Bridge. He goes there and packs the plot. All the things you would expect from a nice noir movie is there, the fuzzy atmosphere of San Francisco, the dimly lit set, Budd Boetticher tried for the best he did. But they just weren't convincing, probably because they didn't believe this shit themselves. It is possible, but Nina Foch's dream and its psychological consequences are unlikely to be more developed and the development was left on the floor. I think it was just a crappy scenario. Budd and Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures had a fast-moving history against them.
