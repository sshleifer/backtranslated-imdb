Wow, what is the video rental rack in front of me? Nothing but a controversial "continuation" of up to 8MM. It was not a very good sequel to the film, which had a very definite ending and an abundance of emotional depth much larger than this film. Basically, from the plot of the conspiracy literally, the American diplomat, David Huxley, and his fiancée, Tish Harrington, embark on a filthy underworld of sex and pornography in Budapest, Hungary, to find out who is blackmailing them with pornography videos that take them with the prostitute Risa. The whole story is based on the different characters that make up these various sex clubs and tapes links around the city. The secret is resolved when, at the end of Tish, she finds out that ransom for video and (essentially later in the story) her fiancée, who came out of her trust fund, is basically returning to her future husband as the story unfolds to the bitter end. <br /> <br /> I didn't like how it had anything to do with the original 8MM at all. The only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that was, the fact that David ended up with some kind of slavery over him to keep him captive, looks like the eccentric world of the first movie and the fact that the whole movie has sex decorated in almost every key scene. Otherwise, it's a completely different film. That was for a lousy love story, even before it is known, which makes more end possibilities because I did not believe the words coming out of David's mouth all the time. But we were warned that he was a liar about most of the things that could get him into trouble. In most of the "shocking" moments of the film that tried to arouse emotions, the nude scenes were absurd. In the audience cheer for Tish to figure out to let this "hellish" sex debauchery. I counted at least 11 ridiculously shot sequences when nothing but sex was seen. Even the menu screen on the DVD is nothing but a film with naked women on it to make the DVD seem absolutely provocative. David wasn't a heroic person in the whole movie. You could argue that it was a major problem long before the end. The actors who played each role were all new to me, which could explain how much they got to get rid of acting and respect. There was a hole plot (How did David and Richard finally impress Tish's father by renting a rental they wanted when David was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try to find a prostitute?) Were there cheesy technological moments (like A talking e-mail program dressed as the Queen of Slavery) and the character of a gay brother who did nothing but show how the director tries to get Joaquin Phoenix knockoff to play this character. The tag line shown in this profile for this video is also complete because it wasn't even about the last breath. No one really dies. But they had a good car accident sequence that came out of nothing ... but it was a good 10 seconds long from one hour and a 3/4 long movie. <br /> <br /> Go rent (and maybe buy) the original. It's one of Joel Schumacher's better and original films. Everything's better from that movie. I wouldn't recommend seeing it if you don't compare apples to oranges.
