This movie is so bad that it's out of his faith. Even for a low budget independent movie ... just, good, sucks. I can't even believe that Troma would take such bullshit. Toxic Avenger, Squeeze Play, Rockabilly Vampire to name a few. But LLoyd, come on, it goes far beyond any taste. It contains some of the worst imaginable ideas. Unemployed street people who could be so good ... oh, wait, that's what they did. I mean, these characters have a negative charisma. With a bit of luck, the producer and director of this movie will have a huge karmic debt because of the special effects people will have. The script is full of plot holes about the size of Alaska, and there are serious problems of continuity. The worst thing is that it is not fun even in the smallest way the most forgivable sin in filmmaking. But, don't take my word for it.
