It's hard for me to understand what makes the viewer feel it's a powerful movie. I guess the main purpose of this film will be to study the character and effects of racism in the British community. It is therefore all the more disappointing that all characters are two-dimensional and acting is at the level of an art college. I'm always skeptical about "improvisation", another word I'm too lazy to write a decent script. I was embarrassed to sit and sit in the audience who laughed when he was sure to move the story. Racism is a serious problem, but I think the fine approach in cinematography works much better than laying it on a trowel.
