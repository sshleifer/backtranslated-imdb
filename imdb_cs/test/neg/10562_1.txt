I've been a keen fan of Jane Austen for many years. I've never seen this adaptation, so when I heard about it, I came here and read all the excellent reviews. On this basis, I eagerly ordered it from Netflix. What cruel disappointment! They took one of the finest and lightest comic novels and made it boring. It seems that each character was conceived with one facial expression, the only tone on which their flat figures were based. Although this adaptation seems to have used every word that Jane Austen wrote, they seem to have been passed on to characters in random fashion. Although it was done as a miniseries, this adaptation can confuse and feel as rushed as if it were made as a movie of the week. Mr Bennett is too harsh, Mrs Bennet is just a rattling squirrel, Mr Darcy is lifeless as a nutcracker, Bennett girls are almost indistinguishable, and Mr Wickham is a man no one would ever know twice - barely appealing cadre! I'm pretty fired!
