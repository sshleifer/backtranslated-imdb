... I can't believe there are people who recommend this movie ... This is a slow POS that doesn't go anywhere. Yeah yeah OK goes somewhere, but you see it coming from a mile away. Acting: Really really bad, maybe the bartender was fine. Editing: BAD! I suppose the editor was told we needed at least 90 minutes because half of all the scenes could go to the trash. Music: Don't get me started on it, the rarest score I've ever heard. Who is the singing in the last scene for a loud call? Direction: oh my, IMNSHO David Lynch sucks, but someone who tries to copy it gets even harder. Leave this.
