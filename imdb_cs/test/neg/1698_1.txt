The most irritating of "Dies d'agost" (August Days) is not just that, nothing in this movie, but that director Marc Recha has the courage to pretend that this film is some kind of homage to leftist Catalan journalist Ramon Barnils. If no mention of the Barnils' name several times represents "tribute", this pretense is utter scam. In this film, neither the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939) nor the special role of Catalunya in this war, you know almost nothing about Barnils. Also, you won't learn about the collective punishment that has become the heroic Catalan people for years after winning and vengeful Frank. Of course, the pictures of the Catalan countryside are very beautiful, but "d 'agost' does not have a vast and varied collection of scenes that qualify as travel books. The clearest indication of the lack of ideas here, the aimless abduction of Marco and David brothers during their camping does not create a convincing cinema, but the film's strongest impression is created by middle-aged hippies, instead of reading a good book about the Spanish Civil War. that Felix Morrow be a stupidly anti-Stalinist "Revolution and Counter-Revolution in Spain" that contains the stunning description of the 1937 Barcelona uprising.
