To say that this film is worse than to choke on its own diarrhea is a generous understatement. The only thing that is more pathetic than this incomprehensible piece of film waste is that the producers pay to register a lot of bills in order to assess a false rating. Snoozer Movie About Laziness from Goonies Kill people in fashion that completely ignores every law of physics (pulling on unlimited person's feet, causing them to be torn from the torso) is your idea of ​​a good movie, then knock it out. No carbon-based life form with a functional occipital lobe would in millions of years consider this movie to be scary or fun.
