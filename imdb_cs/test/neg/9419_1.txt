I had a doubtful opportunity to watch this movie on TV. It's a perfect example of how to take a terrible script and turn it into one of the worst movies ever made. Not only is acting bad and terrible effects, the film has more logical holes than ten pounds of imported Swiss cheese. I would highly recommend this movie as an example of how NOT to make a movie and which director should not be used in one of yours. <br /> <br /> I've turned off the TV for the last ten minutes of a scary show. To call him "pathetic" is a gross understatement.
