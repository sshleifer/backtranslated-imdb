The boy's sister, a slave fraternity, is brutally murdered by a street gang and sent a young man into a sudden psychotic rampage. He and his friends massacre half the city to bring his sister back to life. SAVING STREETS was released a year after this movie and was more fun. Linnea Quigley, who has a costume role in this movie as a sexy (and shortly naked) friend of one of the boys, also starred in STREET SAVINGS. This film is subpar, although it provides enough escapists to entertain and unreasonable nudity pleased its intended audience (me). MPAA: Rated R for strong violence, nudity, language and some sexuality.
