Apparently many people seem to like this movie, and that's amazing. It is certainly a very well-meaning film and I appreciate that in the era of heartless or emotionally harmful films. Unfortunately, the film has a lot of problems and it wasn't something I enjoy watching. <br /> <br /> The primary problem is writing. It's just not funny. When something tries to be funny or funny and fails, it's much worse than ever trying to make a joke. This film is largely a series of "handy" - but subtle returns among adult family members, none of which looks imaginative or apt. There are also several central spaces in the movie that seem like too much stretch of chance or motivation to motivate to be credible or really work. Some back story seemed more interesting and served to make the story around the edges look pretty good, but couldn't replace the moment from moment to moment that went through almost the whole movie. Direction / editing doesn't support the movie well, although I don't know how to explain it exactly. It seemed to me that things always seemed false to me, and that the actors were there for the most part enforcing the journey with unnatural material. They tried, and I don't doubt one person here. There were also too many small and charmless roles in her outside the immediate family. It is not a good rental in my opinion, though, again, many people have found it very charming (I am 38; I believe that people over 60 could enjoy this movie more?).
