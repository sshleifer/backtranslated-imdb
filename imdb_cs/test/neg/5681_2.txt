... and it says something. Regardless of how bad the film gets, I'm normally able to sit to judge the whole movie. I did this for about 20 minutes. It may have been a DVD, or maybe it was my laptop, but I couldn't hear the conversation, even at volume. The sound effects were fine, so there was a dialogue with the loudness. Just as I wanted to see this thing, I didn't want to sacrifice my hearing for it. From what I could say about the conspiracy, the film was one of the big flashbacks of the daughter's daughter. The mother, a military pilot, seems to have had to flee her ship, because one person on her ship she trusted has proved to be one of the enemy and is now chasing her across the desert planet. <br /> <br /> The only thing I liked about the film was the appearance of the main character; There was something I liked about her hairstyle. Well, it looks like this one is going to the dustbin ...
