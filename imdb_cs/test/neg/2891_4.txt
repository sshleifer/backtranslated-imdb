In addition, called BURNING MAN and FLASH FIRE for its various editions, this Australian made the film, shot in New South Wales is problematic for its producers since its inception due to several personality conflicts and prolonged shooting time that prematurely consumes its allocated budget, and though The plot is occasionally described in detail, under standard post-production completion and excessive cutting. Tom Skerritt plays as Howard Anderson, an American entrepreneur with "passion for building" who is in the process of building a tourist hotel in the Blue Mountains, without knowing that his business partner, Julian Fane (Guy Doleman) insured an incomplete ten million structure dollars, much more than its real value, and plans to destroy it as a result of normal summer fires to collect a nice sum through fraud. In line with this illegal plan, Fane arranges an arsonist to carry out an incendiary deed, a young man who also becomes a friend of Anderson's daughter, and whereas the future resort is in the midst of a critical sector of fire danger (one of them). Of the many inexplicable elements of the script, Julian has every expectation that his insidious design will come without serious obstacles. Given that the local insurance company, the victim of the crime, is majority-owned by Fane, politically skeptical, underwriters of Lloyd's of London, they send George Engels (James Mason) investigator to investigate the nature of the crime that was more sinister due to death. , possibly by murder, insurance investigator (Wendy Hughes) who, in the following tracks was apparently near the cause of arson.

Skerritt's semi-comatose and droning style is mortally devalued by this subdued sound processing, but Mason is very effective, as always, and has the best dialogue with Hughes impressive as an overly early written-out investigator; Doleman wins laurels with his performance as the malevolent Julian Fane.
