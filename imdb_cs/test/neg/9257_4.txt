This film was released in the UK under the name Blood Rites. It was banned completely and never submitted again for release. As The Gastly Ones, it was reportedly hit with the horror of hungry residents of famous New York's famous 42nd Street Grindhouse circuit. If you're looking for some bloody horror, then you'll find it in this movie. Unfortunately, we see a developmentally affected Colin (Hal Borske) chomp on a live rabbit, you have to deal with the shaky 16mm camera work that makes Ed Wood look remarkably amazing. Three Sisters are to spend three days in a family estate with their husbands before the old man's money is paid out. Naturally, in such a situation, people will fall dead. Family secrets are revealed and lots of blood are spilled, especially during horrible splits. Maybe it was the bunny the British objected to, I know I did.
