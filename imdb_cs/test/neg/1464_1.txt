This movie was taken with a digital camera and shows. There were enough annoying digital tricks used to alienate the viewer, also with the help of a terrible score. As if that wasn't enough, acting was also terrible. In Hartley's films, acting is always strange, but here it was only BAD, especially Satan (Thomas Jay Ryan) and Harvey, who (thank God) don't say much. After all these external problems, it is also very unfortunate that even the story itself is not so good. Jokes are predictable and incredibly straightforward, and events are only reflected from one incident to another. The so-called Armageddon Book of Life is nothing more than an excuse for actors to try to express their lines. Overall, this film is a waste of time and money and effort. Thumb down.
