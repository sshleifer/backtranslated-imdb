I am something between stupidity and hatred. I have long been a fan of Lovecraft (and Lovecraft's "purist"), and while this little amateur movie was of poor quality, it had a number of redeeming features. I went to watch and expected the worst thing I had ever seen, wondering if Lovecraft would turn in his grave, but I was shocked to find out I liked it. <br /> <br /> I want to have the film errors cataloged, so I'll just mention the few that won't let this movie be "stellar amateur effort". It is a very low budget and a video camera shot, so it has the appearance of some soap operas, but once you get used to the idea, then it stops being a big deal. The direction is quite amateurish and the framing shot and the use of distance in the shots is somewhat clumsy. This film was really scary and remained more faithful to Lovecraft's intent than almost all of Stuart Gordan and Brian Yuzna travesties (my main exception to those films that are Re-Animator and Dagon) together. The idea of ​​being impregnated with an old one is reminiscent of Dunwich Horror and Shadow over Innsmouth (which does not mean that this movie is as good as those stories !!), so the overall storyline is quite true to Lovecraft's thoughts. One thing that made me angry was that the words from the Bible seemed to be upsetting the zombie's crime. I'm not sure if it meant that the words "God" disturbed the Old or just this particular zombie. There was no real answer for that. The rest of Christian symbolism reminds me that Augustus Derleth took mythos. This was the style of Derleth that took mythos. <br /> <br /> I would recommend this movie just as a curiosity. This shows how fairly atmospheric film can be made with an almost zero budget. I liked the setting of the wine cellars. However, the outdoor shots were sad. The use of the same stretch of beach and trees (and almost the same bloody shot) to convey a long way to the characters was really sad. The headmaster needs an upward head. Acting was the standard for amateur film, with a blond zombie girl getting a personal prize for "Best impersonation of Gollum by an Italian actress". Actually, I think this film was created before the film The Lord of the Rings. Maybe Andy Sedaris watched her and thought, "Dang, she made a great Gollum!" One little kudo director. Makeup on zombies was like bad goth kids. I was angry when I saw it and almost stopped watching. I was like "Oh, that's how we know he's bad and obsessed," but later in the movie you see makeup like a girl on the face of an older woman (living). So it wasn't an attempt to say 'goth makeup zombie', but rather 'goth makeup was left after zombification'. However, the obsessed / zombie makes straight 'blue contact lenses' ... heh. On the whole, I still liked this movie better than Yuzna and Gordan (blocking the above exceptions). Yuzna and Gordan had much better budgets, but this movie did a better job of filming a Lovecraft-like story than they did, and on a small budget. One quick word for a makeup artist: I know you wanted "claws" or something on Zariah's fingers, but the long black nails looked really stupid. The Quick Score Writers: I know you couldn't resist, and apparently couldn't even the director who deceived it, but when the two characters stood up with the 'duel' weapons playing the little whistle of "Good , bad and ugly "killed any mood that the scene has accumulated. It was cute, but cute was not appropriate. The creators of this film have read Lovecraft and had great respect for it. I enjoyed a small nod to and fro: Carter's character with bad dreams and Pickman's character, who becomes a ghoulish zombie.
