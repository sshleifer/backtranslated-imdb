Basically, it is a fearsome movie with several features that may or may not be redeemed depending on how much you want. In the "opening" of "The Red Green Show" for the big screen, filmmakers threw away the rustic charm carefully chased over decades standing in episodes and around Possum Lodge in favor of a blandly-photographed "road movie" with a faux-hollywood "big" musical score a boring story that is not adorned with enough good gags to be a fun, even average TV episode. After devising a plot that holds the most Possum Lodge members off the screen for most of the movie and requires virtually everybody involved to be desperately meant for loving Harold (who is the hero of the film, usually a crusty red affiliate to be included in this incarnation for nothing more than the role of Harold's abusive head), the only artists who really get into the glow are Patrick McKenna and Peter Keleghan as Harold and Ranger Gord, who supply the satisfyingly large screens of their small characters.
