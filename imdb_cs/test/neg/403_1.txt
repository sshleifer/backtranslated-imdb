This is one of those movies you watch because it's bad. Such a movie you watch just to see it's a craft. Probably a horror movie, I can't imagine anyone being afraid of deception, especially the one that is translucent in nature where you can see the actor's feet behind it. Although no budget, a bit of attention to detail, and even an attempt to make this film believable, would make it fun because they would have to replace all the actors and the story. If I didn't have to be kidding when I was playing, I'd stop it after 10 minutes and give me some quality shows like Spunge Bob Square Pants (HAR HAR HAR). I highly recommend that Brett Piper and Quintin Terrantin really run out of feces. <br /> <br /> :)
