Clossius says "Baltic Storm" is banned in Sweden. That's not right! Instead, you can buy the film almost everywhere, for example at gas stations, shopping malls, the internet (of course) and so on. Often at a very low price because this film is so BAD and no one wants to see it, despite all the tricks that keep the interest. The film only appeals to conspiracy theorists, psyche and other people living in la-la-land and those who "know the truth." Work at a museum with a disaster in Estonia as a theme I met with everyone! I've heard of every theory that exists, such as cocaine smuggling, arms smuggling, biological warfare, nuclear weapons smuggling, red mercury, extraterrestrials, Russian-American - Estonian - Swedish and Finnish intelligence, often in various combinations. Some normal people have asked why we're not showing the movie? Only those who have not seen the horrible nonsensical film have asked the question. Again, "Baltic Storm" is not banned in Sweden. He has some fun qualities, but what the hell is Donald Sutherland in this movie?
