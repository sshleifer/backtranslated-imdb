The envelope and the assumption that they are there is so promising. As a slasher maniac I expect a lot from that. But what the hell is going on. The movie is terrible. Direction, storyline, tension and casting act is so amateurish. I even thought they were using a home video camera to shoot it. Happiness that I am still able to bring some good moments that make me love. Thanks for the bad package called "Camp Blood". <br /> <br /> 1/10
