The big problem I had with this movie was that the Lombard character was, as another user said, "unnecessarily cruel." Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith, who believes she is married to David Smith, who played well sharply dressed, but dull Robert Montgomery. The film has some humorous moments, particularly when Montgomery's character goes to great lengths trying to get his "wife" back. It is understandable that she is upset because marriage is not technically legal, but she discovers that she will only find out for three years. Lombard's character seems to be quite cool to make her "married" sincere attempts at her back. Although not very adept at this endeavor, Montgomery is still visibly loving, yet Lombard is as cold as the ice column. There are hardly any clues to any kind of reconciliation between the warring couple for most of the film, and in this regard, it is hard to see any kind of comedy - even dark comedy. To some extent, the film almost suggests a sadistic undertone, with Lombard's character getting "kick" out of her husband's weak effort. Although one can think of this other type of film, "Battle of the Sexes", the fact is that it is a very clumsy battle if: Montgomery's character, although certainly erroneous, is not flawed enough to become a typical male example genus. chauvinist / misogynist (an excellent example of this is Michael Douglas in 'The Roses of the Roses'). In fact, the character is largely effeminate, as revealed not only by the sharp dress of Montgomery (which probably owes greatly to a permanent sharply dressed actor himself), but also to his discomfort in the attempt-but inability to play the role of a effeminate bachelor. His only major flaw is his vanity, but this defect is not in balance with his partner's excessive cruelty. And there is no indication that he is trying to instill any jealousy from subconscious love. That's what makes him so harsh and sad. Montgomery's character just looks faint. In fact, no woman would want a man so weak to "carry pants" in marriage. But again, a woman who wears pants in marriage would never try to be so cruel because she had already confirmed that role. So the whole subject seems to be weird. This film is not even a champion of feminism (Lombard's character shows some signs of the kind of independent-oriented women of the 1960s, but that idea is soon suppressed and the character falls back to the 1940s), not even a sided battle of sex (as Montgomery's character is really a cipher masculinity and therefore the lost thing). This film is, on the surface, a slapstick, but under that veneer it is really much darker, with sadistic undertones. Everything that makes his resolution appear, well, special. (Maybe the oddity was the whole thing?). In any case, the slapstick isn't this movie.
