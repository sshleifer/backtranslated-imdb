I'm not kidding: in this movie there is a scene in which a hobo hits his head on a keystone tunnel and explodes (without a fireball) into a million pieces! Cannon screamed in front of me a boy in terror! ... In a G! This film could serve to convince children that Santa Claus is EVIL! His helpers are ugly, misanthropic, over-the-top and average! When Santa appears (here an anagram of Satan!), 200,000 elves start singing "Santa Claus comes to town" as if it were Druid's chant. Then, in the reflection of this movie "Rosebud" object (a bell that whispers hints why you can't hear it ringing: "doubt ... doubt ...), old Saint Nick appears, looks like Stoic Donald Sutherland, his face shining like Moses from "K10C." When we hear him talk, his booming voice sounds less like a jolly old elf, and like James Earl Jones's voice slowed by about 20%. place, boring and repetitive.It does not match any emotional threads (as in "Titanic" very effective score) .It is just thrown at certain points in order to generate feelings of heat and magic, there is no upset, partly because it does not match the images of the film are there are some wrecks of a musical train (no pun intended) where the scary, symphonic score bangs into a happy, children-voiced POLKY about the title locomotive, it just makes the whole movie as if it was in production! r /> <br /> Ree with other reviewers about how ... "dead" everyone looks like. The Motion Capture Technique is suitable to allow Kings Island-like roller tracks to look convincing from a distance, but "real" actors would need to be used. Overall, nice eye-candy for killing time in front of the TV, but not much else here.
