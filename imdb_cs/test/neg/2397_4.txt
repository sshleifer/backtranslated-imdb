Your time and brain will be much better spent reading or listening to the Charlie Wilson war. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, plays the most enjoyable character in the movie, Gust, Greek, and plays it as a eunuch. Gust, in the book, is a hard core and completely free to speak with his mind. He is not shown in the film as equally important to Charlie. And poor Charlie never showed blood donation (which he did every time he visited the camps in Pakistan). In short, the film is too bland and history is too old for our modern age. We do not care about the end of the Cold War and the defeat of the Soviet Union (which has happened despite Reagan, not as a result) by a well-funded group of people who were very willing to fight. It is not entirely the lesson we need to hear how well the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are going. (As I read the book, I still feel deja vu feeling, except that it was today).
