First let me say that I live in South Africa, where rugby is our biggest sport by far and our national side, Springboks, has twice won the Rugby World Championship, so it's a big deal. I've been playing all my life and I'm shocked by the bad attention to detail in this movie! At first I thought she had the potential to be a great movie with regard to casting Neal McDonough, Nick Ferris, Gary Cole and Sean Astin for the good, but it turned out to be a ridicule of the sport. They basically crushed him with your regular American Football movie. My first problem is that this film allegedly captures the values ​​of rugby, but discipline, or I should say that their overall lack of play is contradictory. In the finals, it looks more like an NFL game with Penning, who is engaged in the ball several times, before the referee ... who would immediately lead to several red cards, because the foul play as such would never punish the referee, I can assure you! Also, you wouldn't be able to find a rugby coach who had so little control over his team. Every trainer would pick a dump on the player's head if a deliberately stiff opponent or a double team, as if they had done it in the final ... red card and some suspension, dot. Secondly, it is absurd that a coach takes a brand new player who has played his wing all his life, moving him to a hooker who is a highly specialized position and says it is for good TEAM?! What?! Hooker is a highly specialized position in the front row where you have to be able to scramble very well and best throw the ball at a time when Penning NEVER does it for some reason or another. By moving the wing to the hooker without any extensive long-term training, it would first lead to your team's death at the time of the scrum, and secondly, the poor boy would probably break his neck! How good is it for the team I ask you about? Finally, the overall high emotional height of the film is too much because even though rugby is a great sport and builds great friendship and team spirit, it rarely gets out of hand and furious. I saw a real football drama with less emotion than this movie and it turned out to be great. That end up being boring and hard to watch occasionally. Hollywood has made several major sports movies over the years, but the next time they embark on a sport that just recently picked up in the states, they should try and do their homework and maybe get some experts to fight. <br /> <br /> IT RIGHT OR NOT ALL!
