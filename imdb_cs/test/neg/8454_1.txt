I caught it during a short run at the Philadelphia Theater. Despite her local provenance (and her relationship to the hometown's tragedy, the beating of Eddie Polec's death in 1994), I really have to hit this film hard. For reasons that are best known to him, the director has decided to make a full-length guerrilla film with nonstop handheld cameras and high-speed cuts. Such a technique could work for scenes of violent violence, but it is totally unsuitable for the rest of the material that makes up most of the film. Walk on the sidewalk, talk to my brother's brother on the couch, hell, even a kiss on the first date, are shot in the cusinart style, which dissuaded the viewer from being able to enter the drama. Martin also underestimated his story by wrapping too many topics: in addition to the birth of mob violence, we get anorexia, alcoholism, divorce, racism, parent abuse ... something I missed? Better casting (and a more focused direction) would undoubtedly link these threads, as Martin certainly intended, to show how one moral defect leads and maintains many others ... but good intentions don't necessarily have to be a big movie. Just a big mess. Martin, I know you're from my city, and I'm the man with you, I really ... next time do a better job than you did in Two Plus One.
