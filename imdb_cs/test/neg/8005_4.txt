The circus might be much better off if they reduce the number of twists and develop any better film that has a very talented acting performance that mostly works well, but totally losing the audience basically everyone who is every scoring and not back scoring. at the same time because they are backstabbing someone else and working with .... I lost? The film is even more confusing, clearly written by the first timer writer, has some balancing qualities, although Famke Janssen is particularly bright in Lily as an actress, but unfortunately gets a lot of time on the USELESS screen, which stands there and does nothing ..... dialogue is a bit shabby and accent sometimes irritating, but still worth seeing if you are a fan of one of the actors, especially John and Famke, who have the most time on the screen, just remember how to watch with a laptop to write who is double transition that every second.
