Don't worry - no spoilers, just say there is a very predictable plot. The couple decided to live in their father's nest to write a book / article / newsletter on their flirt with the famous tragic Hollywood starlet. All this production was similar to the college that makes the episode "Murder She Writes". The only act on which I was sold was old misty conversations with sources in the story. The directors seemed to think the movie was too long, so by the end they stopped pointing their camera at some kind of ghostly starfish image and brought fence enhancers to pack this thing. Don't waste your time - even the tried and true horror / intrigue classics fail in this movie.
