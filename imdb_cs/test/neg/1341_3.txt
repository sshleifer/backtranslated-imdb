The director / screenwriter Diane English's 2008 by George Cukor, a classic MGM comedy, unfortunately shows more mothballs than his predecessor. It was based on Clare Booth Luce's intriguingly attentive 1936 play about the relationships that develop between a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialists. Instead, due to English thematic overcoming, production appears as a widespread therapy session with a lack of wit. What is more, in today's film the diverse lifestyles of women have been reduced to stereotypes at the level of the sitcom, and the original central idea of ​​the exclusion of men from the story seems even more proficient given the openly pansexual evolution that has emerged among humans as well as men . women since the 1930s. To add insult to injury, a recent big screen adaptation of HBO's "Sex and the City" has made this kind of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs. The skeleton of the original game remains as the story focuses on wealthy Mary Haines, who has given up her promising career of designing clothes to become a devoted wife of Wall Street Financial Guide. As "Sex and the City", she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful magazine editor in the style of Miranda Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada"; Permanently Pregnant Edie Cohen Representing Wife Staying Home; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent each repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive handle. Through a moutha manicurist, she discovers that Mary has a husband who has an affair with a man-crystal Crystal Allen, a perfume girl in Saks who is more than willing to break a marriage when trying to become an actress. The rest of the plot does not matter that it is a series of scenes focusing on sister ties and bickering, none of the very illuminating and satirical zing that made the 1939 movie. <br /> <br /> Looking strangely at Youth at 47 Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a way that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she created in the '90s with "When Harry Sally met" and "Sleepless in Seattle". It is not that it is not suitable here, but her familiar rigidity seems to be contrary to the character's character. Annette Bening is slightly better at Rosalind Russell's stage theft role of Sylvia because she has proven to be an adept at transferring hardness in masking vulnerability, but her character is undergoing such a trivial transformation that seriously hampers the actress's performance. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow, transparent shopgirl versus a smart, hard-cookie cookie Joan Crawford to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are marginalized like Edie and Alex. Much better is Candice Bergen as a proficient, supportive mother Mary and Cloris Leachman as a housekeeper without nonsense. It probably reflects the insignificant response of the box office to the release of the film. set of accessories. There are two erased scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girl's night-in as contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and another extension of Bette Midler's portrait as a multi-married Hollywood agent advising Mary during the late night The two featurettes round out the extras of "Women: Legacy" about history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and "Women Behind Women" which has cast and crew talk endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-irony is that this version of "The Women" driven and written by a woman takes a haughty look at women.
