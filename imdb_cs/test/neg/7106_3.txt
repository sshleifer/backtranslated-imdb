I made a mistake that I bought it because I collect comic-inspired movies. Even at $ 6 it was too expensive. I thought there might be some campgrounds, "so bad" that it could be a good vibe, I was wrong. I have seen it a long time ago and I have not remembered any of it. Now I know why. I was bored from my mind and was looking for distraction to do something else. I'm for grrrrl power, punk attitude and absurd humor, but Tank Girl doesn't work on any queue. The scenario is bad, you don't care about characters and humor is mostly lame, with the exception of a few fun players. Special effects or placements are bad or often replaced by comic panels or animations, which are too unpleasant compared to live action. It's as if they didn't have the money to shoot cool stuff, so they resorted to drawings, even if it was cool (the uncensored animation feature would be better for Tank Girl if I thought about it). Action scenes were a cheesy but not fun b-movie way. The tank itself was far from impressive or dynamic, though it was interestingly decorated. In fact, the best action scenes involving the tank were in animation. It has some interesting songs from well-known artists like Bjork, Hole and Portishead, but instead of improving the atmosphere, they usually don't fit. Once they even break into a ridiculous song and a dance number that was simply pointless and terrible. I think when I completely tuned. I believe that Tank Girl, played by Lori Petty, looks like a fragile punk part, but beyond her "attitude" and sometimes barely amusing retorts, she is more dimensional and shallower than the worst comic characters. The jet played by Naomi Watts is probably the only salvation grace of the film and it is amazing how such a good actress has been involved in this mess. Malcolm McDowell wasn't too bad when he played his usual thief role. It could be a cult movie for some, but please take into account that it's really different from the original independent comics and the original creators were disappointed with the movie (check out the recording for Tank Girl on Wikipedia). <br /> <br /> Rating: 3 out of 10
