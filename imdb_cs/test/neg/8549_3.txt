Despite the horrible scenario (more on this later), this film is still vaguely observable simply because it plays two outstanding actors, Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda. In addition to one or two REAL stinkers, I'd probably watch anything with them in the movie because I'm a huge fan of Hollywood's golden age in the 1930s and 1940s. However, no matter how much I love their movies, I can't recommend this movie. The film begins with Fonda and Stanwyck on vacation at a ski resort. The two haven't met yet, but the movie starts loud and uncomfortable with a scene in which Fonda has a lot of yodels skiing. It was done so rude and made my grind teeth but I stuck it - especially when Fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped yodeling !! In retrospect, maybe I should just turn it off! Fonda is out in the fall and Barbara is in for help. He seems to be in the ski hut, but fortunately he is also a doctor and has an X-ray and health condition. He again becomes infatuated with her and suggests to her. Despite the fact that they hardly know each other, they got married and the film seems like a sweet but very mild romantic comedy. But once you return home, everything is not as pink as it jumps back into your work. a family doctor and beginning to show signs of being a control and potentially dangerous man for his jealousy. The film plays it all for laughter, but frankly, Fonda's behavior was really scary - espionage on her and her male patients, attacking or threatening ANY person she heals, tripping over a patient who already has a back injury and stomping at a surprise and urge party that all there (both men and women) are gone to steal their wife. He leaves as a combination of sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic, but it is all that should be for laughter. Since it seems to be a dangerous matrix, you think Stanwyck would file a petition for annulment together with a restrictive order! But, strangely, she's crazy, but she just can't stay mad at the Fund because she's so ........? I can't think of the right word - 'creepy' is all that comes to mind !!! Later, from blue, multi-millionaire Fonda gets a job that works at a counter in a department store. Then, through magic thinking, he and Babs seem to assume that his hostility and violent jealousy are a thing of the past - so anger and suspicion are likely to work. When this job fails, the film ends up with a Fund that buys its own hospital, so Barbara will be there and live happily ever after. They don't go on with the story, but I suppose he spent most of his time, based on the character of Fonda, a hospital administrator who beat all the patients. The first part of the Lodge Skiing and others didn't fit well, nor did the last "Horatio Alger" inspired the section where the rich boy did well in the business world. They were like three separate plots, but despite this, the most serious problem of the film was to seem to excuse domestic violence and vicious jealousy! What a scary little movie! Thank goodness, neither Fonda nor Stanwyck are known for this movie, but for all their beautiful movies.
