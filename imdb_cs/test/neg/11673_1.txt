This is not exactly what I would call the Mad Max movie, after seeing the Road Warrior and experiencing the perfection of the movie, I was a little disappointed after I saw it. It reportedly began as some sort of children in the wilderness of the film, and was merged with Mad Max Pass (Bad Idea). Casting wasn't exactly the best, I think you come to Tina Turner? One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains. No Wez, no Humungus, no decent Toecutter! Nothing actually happens if you are going to see this partial action action (can it even be called?), Make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max, or better yet both. Another problem with this movie is that there are too many people, even the Thunderdome battle sequence is boring, Max doesn't kill anyone! The music is bad, the characters are bad (not in a good way) and after seeing this movie I left a very bad taste in my mouth.
