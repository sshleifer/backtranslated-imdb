THE MOMENT'S PURPOSE <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.33: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Quiet <br /> <br /> (Black and White - Short Movie) <br /> < Br /> Two happy night boys (Laurel and Hardy) are unable to pay their bill, provoking violent retaliation from a hot waiter (Tiny Sandford). <br /> <br /> A typical L&H scenario, less substantial than some of their best work from that period, but worth a look. Stan this time concentrates on the center, catching up in a financial dilemma after holding back some of his wages to finance the city night, just to find out - too late! - that his damaged wife (Fay Holderness) had replaced her worthless coupons. Some of Laurel's prolonged details, as he slowly learns of a developing disaster, reveals his genius for characterization and mime. 1920's morale is represented by Patsy O'Byrne, playing an ax-faced busy body who is very pleased to highlight L & H's respective husbands (Holderness and Lyle Taho) to their husbands' bad behavior. End fizzles, but the movie still has something to recommend. Director: James Parrott.
