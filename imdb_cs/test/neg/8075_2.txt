Stephen King TV movies can go 5 or 6 parts and no one complains, right? So why just give Stoogs 96 minutes? I'm not asking for a mini-series PBS, but would one parter kill him? The film rolled over the events to be mentioned and mentioned the events that could have been left out. I want to give a greeting to the stars ... they had a hard job because they didn't really look like Stoogs, but the ghost was there. After watching the movie, I pulled out an American film classic tape that had a real deal on it and laughed. The film was quite emotionally sensitive, especially after Curly had a stroke and Moe had to keep the business going. When Curley started crying, I lost it ... As I said, the movie was good, but it could and should be much, much better. Maybe that's right ... The Stoogs were ripped off when they were alive and now, 25 years later, it will happen again.
