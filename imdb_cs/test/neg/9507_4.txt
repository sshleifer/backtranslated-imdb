(This is a show of the later English version of Disney, featuring Alison Lohman, Patrick Stewart, and co.) <br /> <br /> I really wanted this movie to be good. Really really. I'm a huge fan of Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away, and after seeing all the brilliant reviews on this earlier Miyazaki movie, I was eager to see it. But I was shocked and shocked about the quality of this film. The latter movies boast well-formed charts, three-dimensional characters and the best film music from ... well ... sometimes. This movie just won't come close. He could also start with positive aspects. Like all Miyazaki films, this one is still very imaginative, with a bizarre setting of fantasy / sci-fi in a post-apocalyptic world where insects are the dominant species. Nausicaa also boasts much better animation for other movies since its time. (though not as beautiful and fluent as Miyazaki's later films) And the English voice acting is pretty good. But this movie ... just ... not ... good ... Characters are all cardboard - from sweet sweet little Nausicaa, to mercilessly evil Tolmekians, for all in between. Once you've seen each of them for 30 seconds, you've seen everything there. And the fact that the plot is just running doesn't help. Then there is music ... Now Hisaichi is the hand of my favorite film composer, but Nausicaa doesn't do justice to him. Half of the music is the 80th key overdrive, and it usually enters and goes so suddenly that it distracts the visual rather than helping them. I very much believe that Hisaichim was told to write a lot of music before he saw the picture. But wait! There's a great message with this movie, right? Let's save the environment! It's a pity that this movie hits you like a sledgehammer over your head. There is a scene in which Nausicaa embraces the tree. No really. I'm not kidding. <br /> <br /> I'm a little sad to talk about how lame this movie is. But for some reason all the other reviews on IMDb adore it. And when characters have to talk to each other in extended sentences to tell you what's going on, it's lame. <br /> <br /> If you are the kind of person who worships anime, has 80 years of music, and bets a tree every day, Arbor, you will probably like this movie. Otherwise, you save your money on his later movies because of the rock time.
