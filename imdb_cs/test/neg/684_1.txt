This is the movie is really bad. I like to shoot on TV while napping and this movie seemed to be something good for sleeping and the boy was wrong. My body literally woke me up from sleep and said, "Hey ... this movie is terrible ... you have to watch it". I like bad movies with bad actors and stupid graphs. Something about unintentional comedy gets me. This film is impressively lousy. I really don't know how to properly express it aside from recommending you to watch it just see how bad it is. Seriously, you should watch it with people. During this movie I made the best jokes and no one was there to hear them. Worse than Swimfan. It's so bad.
