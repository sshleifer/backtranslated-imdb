Would it be too delicate for me to review what I say "STUPID" over and over again? Probably. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Seriously. There are better movies at Mystery Science Theater 3000. I saw this movie for the first time on a birthday party friend when it was still in theaters. Although it was actually * with friends * and one of their birthday parties, I had to leave. Actually, I had to leave. I just apologized and went out. Fortunately, some parents did the same, so I didn't look like a total blockbuster ... Anyway, this movie is terrible. It's nothing. It is painfully (as it actually causes physical pain) slow and ill-advised (literally induces vomiting) indecently. You almost regret Tom Arnold, but then no, because you remember he was actually in the movie. It really worries me that I even thought about it. I remembered why I went to the top, and I felt guilty for having even increased my rating with one viewer. Gags are not funny, characters are not interesting. It's just a pointless mess pratfalls and stupidity. There is a small crowd of then-eight-year-old children who watched the movie when it came out and considered it "brilliant". If you think your face is removed by a piece of furnace with a scoop of ice cream being brilliant, then by all means, go rent it. But if you have any dignity to avoid this big clutter of STUPID. SCORE: 0/10 ... maybe negative 1, actually.
