Can anyone give me a reason why only one American dies in this movie, and when it does, it's supposed to be a very emotional scene, but when the Delta Force team kills hundreds of Russians, in slow motion action scenes or thousands of Arabs, also in action scenes with slow motion, you should encourage and say "Take it, you non-American monsters!". I know I've used "slow motion action scenes" a lot, but that's because every action scene in this movie is, you guessed it, slow motion. Every last one of them ... And this group should be called "The Unbeatable Slow Motion Bullet - The Deflection Force" because they seem to have supernatural powers to help them avoid bullets. And if this supernatural power fails, they have some kind of regenerating superpower, which is all they need to kill a complete non-US army that stands between them and victory. Nobody cares until now because they have been put to sleep by another ridiculous, slow-moving action scene ... That means they mustn't laugh loudly at bad acting, mushy dialogue and an incredibly bad story. What is what I did ... The cast is made of unknown actors, which probably remains unknown because they don't even play characters. They're just playing guys with guns (and, not forgetting, superpowers) ... The only quality is that special effects are surprisingly not so bad (even though they're in slow motion) for a TV movie ... But that still sucks .. and at the same time it's so bad that it's good ... OK, maybe at the end it'll be a little repetitive ... <br /> <br /> 25%
