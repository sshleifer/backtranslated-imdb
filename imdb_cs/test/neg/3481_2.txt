This film is very unlikely. Read more reviews to see why. <br /> <br /> I would say that most of the characters were plastic, but they didn't choose such a little luxury; they just act like cardboard cutouts. Of course, they had to get real surfers to surf the role roll so it is crap to shoot whether they can act. At least Occy did not give crap and went with him. But "Lance" ??? The only person who rang the bell was portrayed by Gerry Lopez, who wasn't really involved, he was alone. He is used to stomping people. :-) The only reason I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 was because I was preparing a newsletter on my laptop when it came to one cable channel late in the evening. That saved me from having to pay full attention to this stupid time waste. In any case, I wouldn't get out of the way to watch.
