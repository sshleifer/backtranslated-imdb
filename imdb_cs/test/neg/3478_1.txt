Plankton, or the creature of Abyss, as I am positive, is more commonly known as & filmed under the name Creatures from the Abyss, appearing above the moving image & in the same font as the rest of the credits, begins with five 20 someone's children, Mike (Clay Rogers) his Margaret's girlfriend (Sharon Twomey), Julie's sister (Ann Wolf) and Dorothy (Loren DePalm) and annoying idiot named Bobby (Michael Bon), who decided to fit in a small rubber boat on the sea, don't ask why I don't know. Oh and the whole idiot Bobby left gasoline behind and never thought to tell anyone, so it doesn't come as a big surprise to end up stranded at sea without gasoline for the engine & make it even worse that they are trapped in a thunderstorm & discover a dead body floating in water. Shortly after their happiness, they seem to change when they hit the yacht and potential safety, in flash everyone aboard the yacht and start exploring. First, they will find a scientific laboratory with various fish samples and computer technology, then below them fully furnished and luxurious cabins. They find a pharmacist (Derana Sarafiana) who looks crazy and can't talk. They eat fish from the fridge that makes Dorothy throw up the vomit, bugs and slugs. They learn that these fish are living fossil 1000 years old and have been contaminated with toxic waste stored in the sea and that they fly, mutate, bite & are generally uncomfortable to be around. I really can't be bothered to go with this outline plot, so I won't, here's what I think ... <br /> <br /> This Italian production was made and directed by Massimiliano Cerchi under the pseudonym Al Passeri (I'd be hiding under by another name, if I did a movie so bad too) & I think Plankton is just one of the worst movies ever, so many things are wrong in this movie, it's hard to know where to start. Richard Baumann's first scenario is total stupidity, it doesn't make any sense and is so slow and boring that I was tortured to sit down. Why would five people just walk into the center of the ocean on a rubber boat barely enough to fit into all? What were they planning to do exactly? Why we often get shots from these fish creatures, but they seem to be totally invisible to the characters because they are never displayed on the screen, even if they are next to the character and how these fish get into the neighborhood because there is no water to swim? People's activities and reactions to things are all bad, they keep breaking up, making bizarre decisions that just don't make any sense in the situation they find themselves, and some of the dialogues are just as awful as anything I've heard. I could go all day on all the conspiracy holes and ridiculous kids, but if I succeed, I'll get out of the place. Fish creatures themselves look horrible, a mixture of rubbish rubber puppets and some really bad stop motion animation in the end, scenes where they communicate with human casts also look horrible with some bad super save. I've heard a lot of comments saying Plankton is cruel, don't make me laugh! Forget that there is virtually no blood or gore in Plankton, there are a few slimy scenes when Bobby turns into a fish monster while having sex with Julie, but it's pretty short and he's not killing her, just dripping slime on her several tentacles grow, and the fish head comes out of his mouth. Later, Julie's sheath begins to drip with some dark slime, but that's it, we'll never know what's going to happen to her or what's slime. Dorothy has a fish creature coming out of her screen, and she controls it, but again we never know what happens to her when Margaret commits suicide, a very short shot of a plastic harpoon glued to her forehead. Perhaps the coarsest scene is when Dorothy pukes that green thing with what looks like beetles & slugs in it. That's it, only one person actually dies on the screen and for the most part Plankton is pretty tame and as exciting as watching the paint dry & I almost fall asleep, it's so boring. I don't see anyone like this total crap, I just can't. Acting is terrible, dubbing is terrible, characters are terrible and I hated them all. Tecnically Plankton is predictably crap as well, with an estimated budget of only $ 250,000 all I can say is where the money goes? The sets are monotonous and boring with one lab and a few cabins, the special effect is on the bottom of the barrels, including the most false-looking exploding ships, cinematography is bland, the music sucks there is zero atmosphere or tension and as a whole Plankton, as well as its name, is as low in the food chain as it could be. I hate Plankton, it's terrible in every single aspect that it's over 86 minutes duration. Do yourself a favor and avoid this at any cost unless your either a masochist or an insomniac.
