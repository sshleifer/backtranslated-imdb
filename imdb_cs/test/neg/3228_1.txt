This is beyond stupidity. Two high school graduates travel to Nantucket for the summer and find situations that are totally rebellious. How was the film in 1986, was Ashton Kutcher at that time just a little girl in the woods? who bring a new meaning to the term mean. Writing is absolutely ridiculous. The climax of stupidity is where one person says to others: "Have you ever noticed that people go alphabetically to papers when they die?" <br /> <br /> I'll postpone the case.
