Art Horror tries to use unconventional aesthetics to cover the fact that it is just another serial killer cooler that ultimately relies on pornographic combinations of teenage sexuality and violent gore. The suburbs meet as well as in every piece of Australian writing (book or film) since the 1960s - a surprise surprise, the suburbs have dark girths - and the plot is as fanciful as you saw. "Neighbors would never know about this guy," says one of the filmmakers about Joel Edgerton's character. "But he was absolutely credible about what he was. Serial killers have no stains and scars on their faces. They look like a man next door." Another porn violence dealer who sees a serial killer in every street. The real meaninglessness of this film is that it is a genre film that no one has seen. Encouraged by substantial funding (including some from Film Finance - that's the government), it ran into the Underground Film Festival in Melbourne and had to rely on ACMI's kindness for a very short season. Q1: What does FFC do to finance flicks, even though they are 'art' and aesthetically unconventional? Q2: Why do these nasty movies (ACOLYTES; BEAUTIFUL; PUNISHMENT; NO THROUG ROAD) come first? Richard Wolstencroft & encourages his creators to believe that they give the masses what they really want, unlike what they think they want elite culture in government funding. The truth is that these brutal and forgotten nasties earn much more critical feedback - and they will win much more obscure awards - than they do.
