Appearance! Antoine Monot, in the imitation of Tichy Bob's Kevin Smith, is still asking for it, but writer / director Christian Zübert never listens. Zübert just can't say no wit, no matter how cheap. Best of this movie is his soundtrack. Of course, Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman, an old-fashioned bard subconscious of "fame about Mary", would love any story from a small town. In visual charm, Stefan (Lukas Gregorowicz) looks good on horseback on a two-color tanning car with six BMW series, which the aviator is wearing and does not go anywhere. It is true that * by chance * a bohemian boy (Marie Zielcke) sleeps with his wild girl, but then, who wouldn't? Thumbs up also goes to go black and white for a liberal dose of this mysterious substance they call zero zero, but if you are looking for something more serious about what may cause you intoxication, I suggest you check "Fear and Hate in Las Vegas".
