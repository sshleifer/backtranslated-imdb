Written by director and director of the camp Bruce Campbell. Easy to say, it's a shocking budget; in Bulgaria. The only thing I can definitely say is that silly isn't always funny. Campbell plays a wealthy American business man with a cheating wife (Antoinette Byron) and tries to close a business transaction before being murdered. He hires a taxi driver to hug him with a strange city; he didn't know his wife was with a taxi driver. During the moment when the Campbell was bludgeoned; a taxi driver is killed in the same place. The crazy scientist (Stacy Keach) is following an experiment that puts the cabin brain into the American head. With the massive stitches on his forehead, Campbell relaxes and wanders the streets looking for his wife; all the while he is arguing with a strange voice in his excessive head. Campbell twisted his rubber face to silently express himself as he says with himself. So Bruce does what he does best, and no doubt his fans will be pleased. I think it must have been written as a direct comedy. Rounding is Ted Raimi, Tamara Gorski and Vladmir Kolev. Watch it on Sci-Fi.
