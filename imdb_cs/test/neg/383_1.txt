What do you do with all the materials that won't finish the film? You can leave it aside if a director's version or an extended version is released one day. You can sell it as a track to be used in part of another movie. You could fire it. Or you can pick it up, increasingly accumulating from every movie you make, and then use it to create another film that does not respect cohesion or any sense. Throw a very primitive skeleton into it and include the number of opportunities (nay, apologies) to cast into your casts. Excuse the senseless nonsensical nature of the conspiracy by making it all in the mind of a horror movie director and you will have a horrible film. All this can only be done in a few days of shooting. And idiots like me will waste two hours of their lives and watch it. And then here and try to warn others. The whole chain of events is a big waste of time.
