After a long, hard night of saying goodbye to Walkabout in Islington, I needed a pick-me-up. My throat hurts, my wallet is empty and I ended up chatting with an addict at a bus stop trying to sell me gasoline. Today I watched "Red Sonja" and I can honestly say that I felt much better last night than now. Brigitte Nielsen leads a lot of fighters in different shapes and sizes to restore a green rock from some evil queen whose motives are never fully explained. Yeah, it's so good. <br /> <br /> "Red Sonja" is not a genre known for great movies until Peter Jackson has come up with some Oscar-winning trilogy. In fact, the best sword and witch movie I remembered before "The Lord of the Rings" was "Willow" friendly to George Lucas's children. Perhaps, considering this, one should go a little easy on this movie. But I can't - it's poorly written, misbehaved (except for Paul Smith, who is just average) and scaryly composed. The film is as compelling as the Flintstones episode, with costumes and scenery ostensibly raised straight out of Bedrock. Given the comic book source material, it is easy to forgive various conspiracy inconsistencies. Why Sonja insists on saving the worst boy, in this world or in this, is overwhelming. His personality seems to be swiping from a spoiled brat to a polite master by moving the switch quickly. Schwarzenegger displays less charisma than a field full of cows and just goes through the moves, a perfect actor for his breakthrough role in "The Terminator". It's easy to kick a movie while you're down, but the fact is, it's not a good movie, no stretch of imagination. When Nielsen mourns the death of his sister and Schwarzenegger, he gently puts his hand on her shoulder to comfort her, and then blinks, in this distinctive Germanic accent, "is dead", then you know you're in a rough ride. Several misfortunes have been raised at awkward points, such as the priestess of the temple, who, when sent to their death in a hole in the ground, seemed to enjoy experience - at least judging by the orgasmic moans that seemed to echo around the place. If you have to watch the 1980s fantasy movie that wasn't porn, look at "Willow" (but never take it as a ringtone confirmation). For the real thing, take your local multiplex and show Peter Jackson what a great job he did with "Lord of the Rings". Believe me, 11 Oscars really means it's a great movie - unlike the bloody "Titanic".
