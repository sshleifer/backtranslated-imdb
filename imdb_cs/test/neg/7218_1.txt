The original Road House was a classic kitsch film of the 1980s, which was nowhere near the appreciation of worthy writing or playing, was a very entertaining and popular movie, largely due to the presence of star Patrick Swayze and a great supportive cast, along with some excellent battle scenes and eye candy. 16 years later, and MGM / Sony is trying to recreate the spell that all of us quotes one inserts and recite three bouncing rules ... with a movie that quotes all the original best inserts and recites three rules . If it was an amateur fan, the film would be considered a loving tribute to one of Swayze's most popular movies. As a professionally shot film, it falls directly onto the Bargin Bin DVD, with the reuse of lines and conspiracies from the original film, a rather unpleasant sign of the lack of originality than the cold references to the original. Br /> <br /> With that, we said that with new lines like "I'll kill you as much as I killed your father," it's no wonder the writers decided to rebuild most of the original script. I knew it would never be anything special to be straight on Sequel DVD, but at least I hoped there might be some new ideas and new things that could live by the name of Road House, but What you are getting is just a 2006 remake of the same movie, with a little addict. <br /> <br /> If I were a director, I'd remove all the links to the first movie to avoid scratching the original and being characters. As it is, we got the figure of Patrick Swayze to be dead (killing the screen in the lame way by Jake Busey) and his brother and son now the main characters who quite strangely have completely different surnames. My favorite part was that Dalton's 'son' drove the same car that his father did, a really cool homage, though it was later destroyed by the car's goal, just like its predecessor. This is a good example of how this film goes too far, including sequences and ideas from '89. Of course, who can forget the legendary moment when Wild Bill promises to kill Shane. He killed his father "and then tried to send him in a completely different way. There's amazing writing. I see that Schaech is listed as a co-screenwriter. Stick to acting, or maybe nothing. <br /> <br /> it is OK, if there is nothing else to watch, and you want to turn your brain off for an hour and a half, or if you are a refuge. the point at which they will feel offensive how much this film will be first, as someone once suggested it as an alternative subtitle for this movie, "Even Jeff Healy is glad he won't see it!" Good Swayze Days!
