"Death Machines" takes a rather decent premise for action film (unstoppable martial arts killing machines, broadcast to eliminate opponents of a criminal boss) and turns it into a messy mess. I have seldom seen such a breath with a combination of tiny budget, bad acting, and a disjointed scenario released as the so-called Film. It is easily the worst martial art / action oriented movie I have seen in years, overshadowed even by the "Ninja Holocaust" (which had at least some good energetic combat scenes). The real "star" of the movie is White "Death Machine" (it's basically its vehicle), so it's prominent in many other scenes than its two cohorts. He is in good shape and not bad looking, but as an actor he is barely there - I think Chuck Norris in "The Octagon", just without energy or emotion. This is, of course, a deliberate choice by the actor and the director. .. but you have to be Arnold to pull something like that, and this guy isn't Arnold. <br /> <br /> The movie (and the director) doesn't seem to find time (or budget). ) to shoot scenes that would answer the basic questions they initially posed, such as: Who was the shadow character who gave orders to the Asian lady with marbled mouths? How did the "gang war" end? Why did the Asian mushroom lady decide to kill her zombie killers? And what the hell happened was that she left her assistant dead and she took the katana as a broom? However, finding the time to make a movie a completely strange bar fight, in which a sailor (well, looked like Popeye) destroys the bar because the juke box didn't work. This only applies to the rest of the film, because in this process there is also a KO "hero" of the film, a bartender / karate student who has been the victim of the first major task "Death Machines" (he had his hand chopped while killing his teacher). It follows one of the most un-called for "love scenes" between the hero and his girlfriend I've ever watched. Tague makes no sense - at the end of the bar fight she grinned at the scattered limp body and another thing in the "tasteful" cut of the shadow of sex and love that seemed to come from the Hallmark card. BTW, we never see a sailor again. And wait until you see a showdown between a murder detective and his captain - it is played as if the director and screenwriter have never seen a movie scene inside a police station, but he has heard about it second-hand and decided to include some without knowing how they work. The film is a textbook case of poor theater-level actors and actors at the level of theater groups who break down without a decent direction. Three "Deadly Machines" crash like lumps; The "hero" knows his lines but cannot carry the film, given that his character is ineffective wimp; his girlfriend is a vacuum charisma; and all the other small parts are barely observable. All this makes for a pretty bad movie - but "dragon lady" does more to drag a movie into an underground stinking territory than anyone or anything else. It looks ridiculous; Her tiny, bland face is overwhelmed by a wig of a ton-o-hair skyscraper, wearing a red silk dress like a robe and talking with a terrible mushroom delivery that shouts "the time needed with the dialogue coach". Poor lady - she was apparently on the way out of her element, and as far as I know she never appeared in the movie. <br /> <br /> To this low-level single-synthesizer soundtrack that never stops and never plays anything useful or interesting; lousy movie store and lighting; fighting choreography that is strictly hunger; and the general around idleness and lack of energy in blocking and theatrical business ... and you have one lame movie. <br /> <br /> As part of a compilation of 50 DVD movies, it cost me about 50 cents. It wasn't worth it. Feh!
