Reba is a very silly show. You can predict almost everything to happen. Barbra Jean is just too stupid. It's like there's no character. A show like this should have at least someone who resembles a person in real life. I think Barbra Jean represents a retarded person. Keira, or whatever it is, Reba, Brock, they're all stupid! Keira is like the smartest person in the show and is still stupid. EVERYONE IS STUPID! That's my opinion on Rebu. Since I have said everything I can say about this show, I will deal with the following few lines of text by saying what I am saying right now and do it until you have 10 lines. Push. Reba gets 2/10.
