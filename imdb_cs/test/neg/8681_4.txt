On the plus side, it contains interesting information about a wide range of topics, especially about Himmler, SS and their research field. It also has good piano music, interesting shots and excellent camera work. But it's a very bad piece of historical work. He has no clear aim, and the whole thing can be summarized as follows: Himmler has set up a SS department to research the origin of the German race. They went all over the world. They did a few things and started expeditions to all places ... (neoe of these ways were explored, the results were not shown, and the arguments were barely refuted). They wanted to prove that the Aryan race and the German nation were once and for all through historical evidence. They found nothing. Members of this research group were leading professors, members of the SS, and were therefore associated with the Holocaust and were considered OK after the war and continued to lead the German institutes. These facts themselves are fascinating, but they are never thoroughly explored, and there is no coherent argument in the program that either condemns or justifies these people. It does not seem to be the goal of the program, the objective of the program is unclear, it changes from topic to topic. Witnesses, although presented as trustworthy, are few and unsupported. Unfortunately, this program does not know where it goes or why and does not impress. Themes are fascinating, but this program is trying to capture a huge area of ​​research, and therefore it does not seem to know what's going on. I'd avoid that. Also "Holy Grail" is a German bloodline, it has nothing to do with the Holy Grail of Christian mythology, except that it would happen around. Mentions of expeditions seeking Christian Holy Grail are made but never followed. The title is misleading and the content of this document is not convincing and incomplete.
