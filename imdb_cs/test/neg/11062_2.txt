The Cave virtual carbon copy saves less lower budget effects and a slightly different chart. I knew the movie was going down the hill when I saw fake fires flickering with lights brightly reflected in the face of one of the actors. Conflicts between characters and subplots seemed to serve no purpose at all, and they added nothing less than less silence to the film. Acting was not as bad as a typical B film, and there was some credibility in their fear, but as professional cavers they seem too psychologically unstable for their chosen profession. Overall, it is not worth wasting $ 4.50 for rent.
