First of all, this film is so confused that it is almost impossible to summarize it because I did not understand the terrible story myself. An unknown cast, led by actress Laura Mennell, is just awful. The expressions and screams of Sara Tobias are ridiculous and ridiculous, confusing grimaces with acting. Last but not least, there are many good reviews about this movie in IMDb like this: <br /> <br /> - Top Notch- Can't wait to see more directors of work? the author has only one review in IMDb on September 24, 2004; <br /> <br /> - Incredibly shot, amazingly intense ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on 12 August 2004; It's not your typical blood and gore, actually better. 7/10 ?? the author has only one review in IMDb on 13 February 2005; <br /> <br /> - As an intense Asian horror movie !! - The author has only one review on IMDb on November 14, 2004. <br /> <br /> Coincidence? Or are they parents, relatives, friends or people hired by production to support this crap? My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "11.11 A Nova Profecia" ("The New Prophecy")
