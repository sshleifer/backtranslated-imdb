STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /> <br /> David (Johnathon Schaech) and Tish (Lori Heuring) are a couple in Budapest, for business commitments and staying in a luxury hotel. One night they meet an attractive woman in a nightclub and invite her back to her place where she ends up in a trio. Everything is fine until David gets any negative in the mail and he and Tish end up blackmailing. But when some people who are involved in fraud are found murdered, things get messed up and are forced into a stupid underground world of pornography and hard slavery to track down a woman who might have the key to everything. While the original film dealt with the concept of snuff movies, this direct sequel to the DVD deals with a healthier (!!!) theme of threesome and lean sex. It plays like a porn movie, a cheap piece of titration with lots of hot T / A actions. If that sounds like your idea of ​​a good movie, you'll probably like it, but you'd probably be more at home in a porn store than in a video store. This is trying to copy the original film's dark and voyeuristic feel, but while it does a pretty good job of still being unable to stick to the original. He has an apathetic story, with a fictional narrative. And compared to Cage, Schaech comes as infinitely wooden. Better than I thought it would be, I think, and better than the average one of these direct DVD sequels that seem to be coming out a lot these days, but really, we haven't seen enough? **
