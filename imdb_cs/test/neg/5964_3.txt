According to this masterpiece of the screenplay (pun), Charles Darwin was full of nonsense when he introduced his evolutionary theory because he didn't mention any extraterrestrial intervention at all. You see, the aliens have sent Chupacabras to Earth and form the missing link in evolution theory. However, the rest of the movie clearly seems to emphasize that Chupacabras are typically a Puerto Rican phenomenon, so I don't really know where it fits. Is it said that all Puerto Ricans are aliens? Whatever it is, it's insignificant. All you have to remember is that "El Chupacabre" is an inexpensive and imbecile amateur B-movie, lacking tension, character development and any form of style. Several people's souls are chasing this monster who chews a goat (reminiscent of the dwarf version of Pumpkinhead), the streets and ghettos of an ugly city. We have an incredible dogcatcher and an ugly female novelist, a couple of unpleasant cops, and a supposedly evil scientist with his proficient accomplice. Since they are all extremely incompetent in what they do, a monster can carelessly continue to devour all Latin American immigrants around. The monster itself looks fine and the effects of make-up on the remains of his victims are acceptably coarse and bloody. The performances of the actors are incredibly terrible and induce headache. Especially Eric Alegria is prone to being an over-ambitious employee in his first and only leading role. Yes, it is an incredibly stupid movie, but you have been struggling with worse and less fun low-budget garbage.
