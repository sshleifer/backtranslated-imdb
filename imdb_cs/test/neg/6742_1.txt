This film is so bad that there are no words to describe it. If I got an hour and a half video camera with a monkey, it would be a lot more fun than that. The story is so boring and unimaginable that it's not worth mentioning. The best part of the film was when the credits came back and I laughed when I knew that James Bond III played the lead. Trust me and stay away from this pile of rubbish!
