Very poor quality and performance. This film is a prime example of contemporary England and thought. There is no mention of Jesus in this film, nor does the film contain any type of Christianity as it is known. I am also very surprised because this movie is a BBC program and the BBC is stopping well known for their quality programming, but the BBC's attempt to compete with Hollywood psycho / drama films seems to fail completely. . Bad behavior, bad storyline, bad culture that seems to be without religion. I wouldn't even bother to buy it, instead better try to rent this or buy it when it goes to $ 2 bin.
