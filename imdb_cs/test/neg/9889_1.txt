This straight to cheap video is based on a true story. I have no doubt. This does not mean that it is particularly interesting (unless you are one of the main characters who have actually experienced this experience). A young woman named Angela buys a big, big old home really really cheap. Well, as we all know from watching Horror movies, when you buy a cheap house, it usually means that it is being chased in some way, in shape or form. In fact, the second house is passed to Angela the wise kid boy who lived in the house until now takes "introduce" Angela to one of the spirits! Nice boy, huh? Angela gets in touch with a psychic and paranormal expert and tells them her house is being persecuted and invites them to come and see ghosts for themselves. They come to a party and certainly there are ghosts walking around, sitting on the couch, hanging out in the garage and trying to seduce people in the bathroom. She sleeps at the party for several nights, sees ghosts and promises never to return to the house. (Look at the girl who is dead. I'm so scared. I'm so scared. "No emotion. If she was so scared, she didn't get up, turn the knob and leave? They look like ordinary people) They steal celery from the kitchen, move around POLTERGEIST's chairs and one bisexual female spirit seduces Angela who doesn't mind! This scene plays like a soft-core porn you see on SPICE (Ummm ... not that I know it! Hahaha) But the actresses aren't your typical porn stars, they should hit the beach and the gym more, and when Angela does NOT focus on the dead, she gets mad at them and stands alone in a room that screamed: "Why don't you leave? This is my house! They won't leave. I couldn't help but think of all those times when I heard Sylvia Brown's psyche on TV that if you have a ghost in your house, you should be with e calmly rationalize with the spirit and say, "Look, you're dead. It's time to go to the other side, in other words, get out! "According to Sylvie Brown, if your enemies are not ugly, they will leave! This movie looks like it costs about $ 50 to be. It has a really cheap feeling and bad deal.
