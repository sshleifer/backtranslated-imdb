I was twelve years old when I saw the original film (I lived in Italy and the Italian title was "FBI, OPERATION CAT!") This was a fun movie and not just for kids. This terrible remake is pathetic even for 5 years! What Disney owned to destroy their reputation and the memory of a beautiful movie I don't know and I just can't believe it. Even the title song in the original film (both the original version and the dubbed Italian version) was extremely pleasant and created a mood for the story. On this remake, the title song is even worse than the movie itself. It was nice to see Dean Jones, though only for the look of the portrait, he was regular on old old Disney movies. I can't honestly see anything else positive in this remade movie.
