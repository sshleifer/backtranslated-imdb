An hour ago I ended up watching it. As Dragonball fans, we think this movie is so bad that it's good. We will say one thing: without the six-cylinder beer, now is the way you can survive with this film. This movie should be watched with many Dragonball fans laughing their ass off. The best character in the film is Lord Horn, his make-up, his laughter and behavior, all this unforgettable experience. What we liked in this movie was the fact that Turtle Man was the same as in the cartoon version. We believe that the only character similar to the cartoon is a turtle. He is also sex maniac and kind of idiot too.
