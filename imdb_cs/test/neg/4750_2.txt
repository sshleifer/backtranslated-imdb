I'm sorry that these movies were one of the greatest disappointments of the year. After one of the biggest disappointments in the movie monster struggle with history, you would think they would learn from the mistakes of the previous incarnation. The sequel falls into many of the same traps, the plot line was completely forced, the dialogue was so bad that the film could be better on the dumb, and the action was fanciful and far from the heart pounding the brilliance of each monster of the original film. The best work of AVP-Requiem is actually a trailer, which, once you go through the film, realizes that almost every single death and every really great film in the movie has already been shown in a trailer that leaves little to reveal and little. be excited. I gave the movie another star for seeing an extra hot woman in almost naked. The film was like a sci-fi monster that took place in color, and also that nothing was a surprise when it happened because you saw it a thousand times before. The main failure of both of these films is that the creators thought that setting the movies in our time would be more interesting to us as if it might one day become with us. but what attracted people when they released the arcade game back on the day was that it took place within the above-average futuristic version of the ALIEN trilogy timeline, which allowed more inattention. This is where future films need inspiration. because I was honest, I saw a waitress killed by ALIEN, we were all worried since childhood that it wouldn't really do it for us. lets take the series back to its roots. Learn from the former masters and not deal with the winning formula by trying to make a "bold new vision" that we liked the originals for some reason, we want to see it again. Finally, the end is a real WTF moment of the whole movie, * SPOILER * after the big peak, the survivors are overcrowded by special Ops soldiers who justify their horrific actions by saying 'we've followed orders' and then turned on the dime and start doing everything nicely and turn into in the Savior. then after a long turn back with one of those who survived and staring ominously into the sky, we cut into the most bizarre cliff I had ever seen, with the characters you never saw in the rest of the movie (Save the Government Dude). the softness of the blow to the face reveals that there will be another film with a hint of conspiracy that blinks the sci-fi channel of the original film and lifts its nose. So in summary, if you have to choose between this movie and do any other activity on the Earth's surface, skip the movie and do the other.
