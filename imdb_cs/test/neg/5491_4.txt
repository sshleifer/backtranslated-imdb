It is partly unfortunate for "Illuminata", which is based on "Shakespeare in Love" because it deals with practically the same themes of life as art, art as the life and charm of theater and the same archetypal Foibles of Folk Theater, but it is much cumbersome. There are scenes that come to life as the game evolves and gets reinterpreted by the writer's life, but there's plenty of Orson Welles-ish ego in this produced / directed by / lead acted by John Torturro as a means for his wife Katharine Borowitz (with a lovely portrait of their son). Every actor gets his moment literally in the spotlight, but there are so many "masks" or pieces that look like 19th century social games Bill Irwin Interviews Susan Sarandon is diva Christopher Walken becomes another kind of villain - a gay critic Women need to reproduce unnecessarily because it's an art movie <br /> <br /> Art and direction are amazing, albeit quite dark, which should be appreciated as the best use of the Jersey Theater City as a movie file (originally written on August 21, 1999)
