I have to say, it's the worst movie I've ever watched, I can't believe I wasted $ 10 a blockbuster; this movie should be burned out and who sometimes has trouble. Who ever actually spent the money to make this movie mad = D This movie has TERRIBLE actors and some scenes have no meaning. The whole movie doesn't make sense. Also, the part where these "men" come to the canteen (National Securities Department), which has become the worst part of the film. How dare he say that Frank Sinatra's name is useless? What's with the glasses? When the boy and the girl are in the car and she "drinks" water, you can say she doesn't drink! Also, what's going on with a weird guy for dinner. And everyone knows you don't stand on tires.
