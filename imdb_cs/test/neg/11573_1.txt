During the first 5 minutes of this movie, I knew I was in one of those "pick-ups" a bit of a movie. The acting was terrible, the script was even worse. Who ever let these people write such bullshit on the film, they must make their living on the Commodities themselves. With the Russian MiG jets, which act as US Air nozzles, and guns that can miraculously shoot 50-60 rounds, fast fire without reloading is poor. In one scene, the commodo kills special forces soldiers at night, while in another they explain how cold-blooded the commodos and cobras do not come out of the night !!!! Also with the fantastic special effects available in today's film industry, they were just average for this low budget movie. Everything I said I watched to the end, wondering what other wonders were doing to make a bad movie of production. Shame Shame Shame, for producing such rotting !!! This film should be left on the floor in the salon !!!
