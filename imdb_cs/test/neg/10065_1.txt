The adventures of Hercules must be one of the most precious excuses for the film I have ever come across. You will have to look far and far to find anything that will approach the level of inactivity on display in this movie. Act? Bad. Adjustment ?? Bad. Direction? Bad. Special Effects ?? Bad and sad. Spiknut√≠ ?? Bad. Lighting ?? Bad. Camera? Bad. Costume Design ?? Bad and stupid. Everything else ?? Bad. Watching Hercules adventures is as pleasant as the root canal. Even for fans of bad movies, it's a real endurance test. This is either for masochists or Lou Ferrigno completeists (if they exist). Eight Things I Learned From Watching Hercules Adventure: <br /> <br /> 1. If you don't have a budget for real special effects, rotoscope scene from the previous movie. It will look great - believe me. <br /> <br /> 2. When you try to restore your Zeus flash, take your time to frequent stops to draw your body. It worked for Ferrigno and his two Amazon companions. 3. Any fight with sword, use of magic, and all other daily activities in ancient Greece have created a sound very similar to Pac Man or Asteroids. 4. Some ancient Greek gods dressed as accessories from Star Wars. <br /> <br /> 5. If you need to fall into a miserable runtime movie, add a Star Trek style credits to your titles and throw them into some too grandiose music. It also helps if you have a previous movie to load scenes from. <br /> <br /> 6. Combat scenes move much more smoothly when attackers attack Hercules one at a time. 7. William Berger did something for the money. 8. I didn't think it would be possible, but The Hercules of Hercules is the first film, Hercules (1983), looked like the Academy winner.
