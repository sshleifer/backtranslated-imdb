From the title, the tag-line, the summary of the fences on the DVD, etc. ... I was expecting something at least slightly epic, with historical fiction and romance that inspired you; this is what they did for example in Last of Mohicans, and I think they did a great job. Maybe I had too high standards for this movie and I didn't give him a fair chance. But the scenery was barely OK (how could they not come up with something more beautiful when they had such a landscape to work?), Both lovers had no chemistry and the conspiracy was so predictable that it was as if it had been worked out in 5 minutes by a 12-year-old imaginative. Nouvelle-France is a love story in a busy historic age. But the history of Nouvelle-France is scarcely a side note, and the story of love is trivial and does not dramatically make the viewer look after the fate of lovers. Surprisingly, the only good parts about the film came from something utterly unexpected and unexpected: Marie-Loup's relationship, the heroine, and her children (one natural, one adopted). If they focused on their family and forgot about the love story, it would be a much better film. Marie-Loup's parents were supposed to get more time on screen and character development, the policy that takes place in Britain should be more than a three-minute scene barely connected to the rest, rotten baddie should either be more developed or removed. from the script entirely (why hire actors like Vincent Perez, Tim Roth or Jason Isaacs to misuse them so badly?) Bad work overall.
