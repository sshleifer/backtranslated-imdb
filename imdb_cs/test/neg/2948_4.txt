The film begins with Reeve (Ekin) and his assistant fights against the same vampires. This scene is probably the best of the movie. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is kitschy, unrealistic, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer ripoff. The end also sucks big time. Some moments like the scene where Gypsy and Helen (played by the popular Chinese duo band Twins: Charlene & Gillian) fight for a teddy bear are particularly cringeworthy. The story is lame too, surely they could come up with something more frightening than a book called "Day for Night". <br /> <br /> Some good parts. Jackie Chan and Anthony Wong make the film bearable in their comic roles. But the good bits end there. Charlene & Gillian (of Twins) has never been able to act well and harass you to pieces and "friendly but lousy vampire" role has unfortunately been given to Edison Chen, who is a talented handsome boy. <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 -
