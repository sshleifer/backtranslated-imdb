The speed I think is a direct copy of the Hollywood movie Cellular (I haven't seen this one), gives the impression of a test game that is very exciting in the first four days, but in the end it gets into a very dull turn. I watched this movie today on January 12, 2008 on a rented VCD. It's the release date of October 19, 2007. But fortunately for me, I didn't even know or hear much of this movie, except that it's a flop at the box office. So in this situation, when I watch a movie, I feel that this movie could have been a very good movie, but then the director again falls into a trap for Bollywood traditions and missed a very good chance. Off course as Bhatt's film must be copied from another location. But now it doesn't matter if I saw the original movie. I just found a major theme like "Nick of Time" and "Badshah". The Sanjay Suri shows a news agent, but his wife thinks he's a cook. This will return the "True-Lies" memory. The only news was using the phone. But I also found out that it is taken from Cellular. So when a film is made with a mixture of so many other films, the future is very clear. The things I like about the movie are its pace. As the name suggests, things really happen fast and there is not much time to think between the scenes. But this break in the last 20 minutes so where the film goes in the traditional style of Bollywood Dhishum dhishum. The storyline is also quite interesting. Three stories running in parallel, one after another. One of Urmila's kidnappings, the other Zayed trying to help Urmile, and then the Prime Minister's murder plan. These three stories naturally mix as the film continues. But very ordinary playing and unnecessary style has killed the spirit of the film. Except for Sanjay Suri, no one is impressed. This also applies to Urmil, which is always promising in RGVs movies. Because of this ordinary playing, some scenes do not really express the feelings the director wanted. E.g. the scene at the end, where Urmila leaves all hope and shortens the phone, should have a good impact. But instead we just wait for the end of this scene. In addition to playing, some pointless love of style demoralizes the film. Showing such great villains is good for Hollywood movies not for Bollywood The background of London is also just for making the style and not a very smart advantage of this background can be seen. Especially in the end, all these dhishmums were totally useless. It may be the director's impression that the climax in Hindu films must have such fights. They look unrealistic, increase the length of the film, and make sure people leave the theater before the film ends. <br /> <br /> I'll find the whole movie here. If it's on TV or you can borrow it right. But then make sure you have the remote and forward buttons at hand. The next time you watch a movie on TV, you can watch other channels safely.
