Well ..... horror is not, but ....... !!! ??? Terrible low budget backwood-flic worst kind, kind and ... therefore pretty charming and funny to watch ... at least on my TV! A cross between Pete Walker, Herschell Gordon Lewis and ... let's say ... damn, I give up ... I just can't come up with some "nicer" parable for this gaudy movie. Everything is soooo bad that I have to enroll it in my movie collection along with ... Death in Venice ..... Necromancy ..... Blue Velvet and Good, Bad, Ugly ... Right! ?? People with some small talent for adding cruel inserts or sexy happenings to the movie are buying other people, they should pick up this movie immediately .... surely there's a fat lil 'gold mine waiting here, oh maaaannnn !!!!!
