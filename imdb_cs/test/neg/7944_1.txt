I don't think it is necessary to sketch a plot for you because the site and other users have done a great job. This is my opinion. This is by far the worst movie of 2005 and was really really bad there. I don't even have to go into detail because there's nothing redeemed about this movie. Bad behavior, bad conspiracy, bad direction, bad special effects - you name it. If it doesn't stand alone as the worst movie ever made, it's tied up with some other piece of crap. I'd be embarrassed for my friends to know I was in this movie. But hey, most people who see it will do it no matter what rating they get, so it's too much. When you feel the void is left between your neurons for two hours on your evening, don't blame me for it.
