Some people thought it was fun because they love the political issues discussed in this article. However, I am so tired of the state of the two-party system in our country that I cannot stomach propaganda from both sides. I was hoping for a horror show, but I got "cute" zombies and guerrilla bullshit. I'm watching my horror movies afraid. It wasn't even trying to be scary. It also does not have Romero's joke in his political-cultural satire attached to his films ... this was a ruthless story without imagination that was a heavy stomach for me (for wrong reasons). On the bright side, when you hate Bush ... you'll love it (I hate hatred or Bush with this statement)
