It's so bad that it's observable. The storyline deals with the grizzled spaceship crew going on drifting, apparently an abandoned Russian vessel. <br /> <br /> In an empty vast space, two vessels accidentally encounter (!) - and "Alien-esque fun" follows as a cyborg from a Russian ship threatens our crew. Spacecraft interiors are clearly a factory set (metal walkway, boilers). , pipe). In this totally unconvincing environment, 'Kody', 'Snake' and the rest of our crew heroes grimaces, grunt, run and constantly and repeatedly shoot their shotguns without shooting them. The continuity of gaffes are what define this movie, and are nothing short of amazing: <br /> <br /> Stuff appears and disappears. The rifles are carried. The cigar is extended by smoking. Rifles are stuffed again just to make sure. The content of the bottle is increased by being drunk. The film goes through the usual clich√©s through intense ham play, working with a poxy camera and Ed Wood's props to the top of the showdown.
