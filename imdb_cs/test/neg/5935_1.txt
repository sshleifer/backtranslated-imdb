First, a few months ago I read about the Left Behind series and made a mental note to look at it because I'm interested in how religion is used to drive people in our increasingly hateful world, so imagine my surprise and joy when I found a copy of Left Behind: World at War in my local library, I am innocently hiding between big budget action movies. Now, as a film, it is extremely poor. Acting is directly from the primary school's production and "special effects" would look at the early 90's. Being the third part of the series would be incomprehensible to anyone who wouldn't see or read about other Left Behind movies, and even with my previous knowledge it was still ridiculous. Religious Front, I don't think anybody who is not filled with the Lord's spirit will find anything in the film to convince them to change their ways. How is the Antichrist to be afraid of having a Russian accent, and the worst of his powers is any pitiful CGI? But my main problem with this movie is an unrelenting attempt to stamp people into believing it to be a big budget action movie. After picking up the box and reading the spiel, I immediately noticed something special ... nowhere on the cover did the real nature of the film mention it. For someone who does not know, it would seem to be for all intentions and it was assumed that Left Behind: World at War is no different from the newest Tom Clance. I didn't say anything about the copy I rented that he was third in the series. Since the whole series is that the Antichrist has deceived the whole world, I find it extremely hypocritical that filmmakers have tried to deceive me before I get to the counter! If you are so firm in your faith, then why not be honest about it? The simple fact is that it wasn't a "Christian" movie with a built-in fan base that goes with it, I really doubt it would ever see the light of day. If Cloud Ten hoped to see the error of my ways and give myself to God, I fear that I would die of boredom and / or laugh myself to death before I had a chance.
