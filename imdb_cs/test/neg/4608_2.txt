I'd put this movie 1, but I laughed so strongly, so many times that I had to give a little credit, in an off off off film shot was supposed to be funny. The film so bad you think chimps wrote it. You'll want the chimpanzees to write it. Dialogue so conserved that only it and cockroaches survive the upcoming nuclear holocaust. The film exaggerates its horror by translating scenes from the original Carrie (a really good movie) into scenes from this scene. As an intersplicing scene from Taxi Driver to Baby Geniuses. Do not rent it yourself, because you will not enjoy the experience. You will need someone beside you to confirm the wrongness of what you are viewing. The worst millennium actress goes to poor poor Amy Irving as a stone face, a monotonous, catastrophic wooden school counselor. The worst movie of the year so far (see also _Arlington Road_). - FRINK-3
