I recently saw Heaven's Gate. After watching this 3 hour 40 minute epic western that is not Western, I read Steven Bach's book. After considering all the events and the film itself, I still think this film is a complete waste of time. I believe that if someone tells you to look at it, they are actually trying to kill you to death. If for some reason you can enjoy this self forgiving over the idea of ​​a seriously bad movie, I have to ask why. Although it is not a reason to hate it, it is historically gone. It pretends to be about a situation that happened in Wyoming called Johnson County War. To put it simply, cattle barron times wanted to kill all cattle thieves and claimed they were all immigrants. You'll find that you just don't care about these people and hope everyone kills because at least something happens. Everyone in the film talks about things that happen, and they never show up. After you were sitting, although this giant waste of time, wondering how someone could actually do a 4 hour epic in which nothing happens. Oh and by the way, the Johnson County War wasn't a war, it never happened. The War of Johnson County, in fact, was called because it almost happened, in fact, 2 people died. I can't warn you enough of this movie. However, if you're like me, the idea of ​​watching a movie that ruined a career and putting United Artists on "for sale" a lot, sounds like an interesting case to study, then by all means, to watch this horrible, narsisistic, movie without textual text and lots of photos.
