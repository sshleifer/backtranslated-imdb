The behavior was bad, and the storyline, I don't think there was one. Some fat blond guy, who is always dressed in a dinner suit, kidnaps the kind of nightclub, I think he'll kill copper. The pointless fight then happens The kidnapped girl is put into the cage on the boat, why? The tough, uncompromising martial arts training appears, speaks bad English and does things that don't make sense. Her utter insolence. But he's got a nice car. Christ on the bike, this film was a waste of 90 minutes.
