Being a huge fan of the Conte d'ete (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115940/), I expected to be impressed by another French romance beach with lots of sincerity, realism and humor. Same director, same actress - what could go wrong? Unfortunately, Pauline a la plange is very disappointing. It is very slow and spoken, which would be okay if the dialogue gave a look at the characters, was meaningful or original. However, it appears as a typical soap opera alternating between an irrelevant pillow and jealous accusations. The only thing that will save this film from a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least "character change" with respect to Pauline. The source material is the standard fare (sexual awakening during a beach holiday), but it could be a decent movie, although some of the characters were interesting enough. Unfortunately it is not so. Although there are other shortcomings with the Rohmer seasonal cycle, most of his later films are definitely leagues over this.
