We sat in this movie and wondered why it was or the scene in the movie, what was it to do with the storyline? We were hoping everything would be a little clearer by the end. It wasn't so. I think the director threw the script into the air in a pique fit, and then some tiny (and vindictive) underling randomly assembled it, regardless of the scene that was shot (maybe with scissors and glue). Movie Themes Include: Communism Bad? Nihilism Bad? Bad parenting bad? Three bad? TV bad? Coherent Scripting Bad? Deconstructionism good? It's really not clear. Finally, no German water taxi would EVER have an unchecked staircase that would allow passengers to fall into the water. The amount of "achtung" sign everywhere is proof of this fact.
