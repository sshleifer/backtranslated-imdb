I hired this movie from my local movie store, in fact, I didn't expect anything to flash or explode. Since it was a "B" movie, made on a very tight budget. The opening scenes of the movie were somewhat original and so was the storyline and that's what made me hire a movie out. However, the film becomes very boring and frustrating at points. The story had a lot of holes in it and the acting had its fair share of disappointment as well as the end of the movie I was praying that power was about to strike me where I laid as I was very bored but more importantly frustrated with how it was story showed. I still don't understand what happened, and I don't particularly care. In the end, the devil would cry in anger to know that hell (his domain) was used as the basis for such a lousy film.
