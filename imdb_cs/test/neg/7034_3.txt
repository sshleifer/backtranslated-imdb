Actually, I saw this movie at the cinema. At that time I was working on shifts and went there during the matinee on a hot summer day when I couldn't sleep. The cinema was air-conditioned. It was a morning multiscreen complex and I somehow got into the wrong place. I intended to skip something else. But as things do, he won't sleep. In addition, shortly after the bad film began, I was also concerned about a group of female cleaners who came and used it as their social club. I was the only other person there, and it's a measure of the appeal of a film that usually expected the place to be empty and asked if I was aware of their presence. No no. Within half an hour, the cleanup conversation turned out to be more interesting than the fun I paid for. This movie spilled out of the screen with cheesiness very still mayonnaise. A species that has a little dark, fluffy tuft on its surface. In particular, I remember that my senses are being attacked by sharp lines of music that emit very little warning and even less meaning. The cleaners provided a predictable instruction by putting their fingers in their ears. The point was that some of the city birds would live in sticks between the people in the back and hold them. she taught a moral lesson or herself. Like you. Some "way of discovery". Sentimental committing about the entire production. First of all, the main actress had the unpleasant habit of staring at each hick with some intense blissful compassion, as if she was the patron saint of the saints. And I believe he wrote a book at some stage. Long before the end, I became fascinated by one of the cleaner silent and breathtaking tails of sexual unsuitability. One suspects that there are some who have been sitting quietly for a few hours without meditation. The best thing I can say is that I don't want to share their salad. I've never seen this movie advertised on television, which surprises me. It's just a kind of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having a job. <br /> <br /> If you ever work shifts, don't forget to get to the right theater. Or I hope to clean some ladies.
