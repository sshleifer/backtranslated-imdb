My overall feeling of this film is that it was a slow, exhausted, lackluster journey through some of the worlds that were truly unfortunate situations with a little redemption and an obvious message. The film is composed mainly of relatively uninteresting videos from countries with bad reenactments, all at a slow pace to the snail's temples and overlaid with depressing music. Certain materials and interviews certainly contain some compelling stories, but unlike the description on the back, it is not so much the story of the victim that it is said to be the director, Mr. Ripper, and he will not say well. This movie could include longer, better conversations with the people themselves and let them tell their stories. Instead, Mr. Ripper tells the story in a loving way, so it's a personal journey, and unfortunately it won't end. I have never actually had any sense of growth when exploring a subject, and never telling you what has dragged him in the first place. He just pulls us from one place to another, easily takes care of the situation and figures, hangs around and shows too many unusual shots of the slow movement of people walking on the streets and then goes to the next destination. He will do it again and again without any real development. I felt that this movie could be shortened to 45 minutes, but it was stretched to approach 2 overwhelmingly slow hours. We feel morally obliged to take care of this subject, but the director's self-confident, meandering, uninspired delivery of his journey will cripple you after a while.
