So let's say you're a producer, you have some money, and you somehow got Richard equipment and Bruce Willis, so now all you need is a script ... but why bother? See, this movie is really awful, acting is pretty good, but casting is a terrible device and Willis tried to play those characters that you just can't play. Now, this movie does not have a plot, or rather, there is something that is trying to pass as a conspiracy: there is an average hit-man (Willis) who is cool dangerous and sophisticated (actually there is nothing of those things but some dialogue Among the other characters, you should get this impression, so this hit-man is on a mission to kill someone, now there is a former IRA prisoner who is kind and kind and very likeable (outfit) that the FBI has released from prison so they will help them . so now the FBI's "investigate" to find this hit-man, the investigation consists of a series of improbable information - like any casual person has lost his wallet and someone used his name to buy a car - which is always right on money. Since there is no real plot and the script is so miserable, you cannot expect any real character development or tension, so instead of creating them through the story, they simply add some disconnected dramatic music that signals that something very dramatic is happening. , instead of actually creating something dramatic. is that it is a very bad movie and a complete waste of time that somehow has earned an incredibly high score for its level, probably because it is exactly what the producers rely on.
