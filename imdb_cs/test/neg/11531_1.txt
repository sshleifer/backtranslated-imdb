I had a good time for the first 45 minutes. or so, but suddenly it was all down. The tension began to dwindle somewhat, and jokes were somewhat the same. What kept it was good actors. But the problem with this movie is that it is trying to be cleverly funny, like Tarantino and God is that outdated stuff. Tarantino is sometimes overestimated, this film comes ten years late. At best it is for teenagers and I'm sure many of them will find the character of Johanna funny, which is for the first 30 minutes. Another problem I have with this is that the story is getting closer to the end, trying to find a point of recovery. Maybe it wasn't healing because the lack of passion comes with trying to be cleverly funny. Also, as in many movies, certainly, good actors who can afford it do not require better dialogue or just turn on the script.
