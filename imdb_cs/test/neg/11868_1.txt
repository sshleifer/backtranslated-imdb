At first glance, I must say that I'm looking at The Contractor, 2007. Also with Wesley Snipes. Better action movie and more dramatic conspiracy. The Detonator has a terrible plot for some kind of atomic bomb in Romania and a terrible action film director. moments and action movie turns into boredom. Indeed, what do you expect from Wesley Snips when he is offered terrible scenarios like this? Don't blame him, he needs money. It was the first impression I saw when I saw the movie 3 years ago. But I won't see it again. Screw in. It's shit. Push. I said it. PS: I don't think I said that "this movie sucks" on IMDb review. Thank you, Detonator!
