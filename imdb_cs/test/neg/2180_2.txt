It's supposed to be Charlie's masterpiece, but I'm going to say it's actually one of his weaker films. First, it's not funny. Not one thing in this movie smiled. Well, it's a quick jump into a box that was giggling, but that was one despair. Tramp's first - and only - talkie, where he talks (he sings in an earlier film), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was so glad he was watching in "Modern Times" and "Gold Rush" - two films that are the least ten times better than this movie. In this film, there is literally only one good scene Hitler plays with the world as a beach ball. This is it. Okay, so it's a lot of praise for being the first warfare movie, even long before we enter the war. No way. Not true. It's just not true, so praise can be a little rejected. The three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940, with "You Natzy Spy" - ten months earlier than the October issue of Chaplin's film - and the movie was actually funny! If you want to watch Chaplin's biggest movie, just watch it for information. And then pop in "Modern Times", "Gold Rush", "City Lights", "Limelight", "The Kid", or even "Tillie's Punctured Romance".
