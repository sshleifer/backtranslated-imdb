The main thing that comes to mind when considering this film is "risky". It is a quality film biography of one of the most famous artists of all time. The glove deserves better. Before I get into my thoughts on this biopsy, I have to say there are two things I thought were effective. First was the use of real fans footage and interviews at certain points in the film, especially in scenes depicting the first set of allegations of harassment children. I feel that this has contributed to a certain authenticity that was seriously wrong in the rest of the film. The second was a sequence depicting the courtship of Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley. I will not comment on whether I believe that marriage was false, but in many ways it was a relationship where care and affection existed between the two parties. That really happened in this movie; Flex Anderson and Christ Rae had enough decent chemistry to pull him out. These successful points are enough for a person in the mirror not to get 1 star. That means there was very little that worked. Very few actors looked like the people they should portray, especially those played by Elizabeth Taylor, Janet Jackson and Diana Ross. Also, the absence of Jackson's music was a huge loss. How can you effectively tell a story about him without his music? I understand that they were unable to secure their rights because it was low-budget, unauthorized production; however, if you can't have his music in a movie about him, you can also wrap it and go home because you're missing an extremely important part of his life story. The characterization of Jackson's film has also bothered me a little. I won't say he was worried and maybe there were a few fries of short value food, but here he was portrayed as something close to the mentally disabled. I don't believe Jackson, who is known to be a clever merchant, was as naive as the adult world works, how he was invented to be in this movie. the way this film was written was nothing shameful. Many lines or dialogue exchanges have been one extremely sinister, as Michael and Janet's "Tinkerbell" exchange, or absurd, like "Love Quilt" comments made by Michael. Also, screenwriters don't exactly have the talent for subtlety. There has been much wiring of upcoming events ("What could go wrong?" Types of lines) and extremely overtly threaded themes and motifs in the film (if I heard the word "Believe" once again.). This is what eventually film as something that could be considered incredibly bad. Maybe if we are a few years, or even ten years or three, removed from Jackson's death, someone will be able to bring his story to life in a more deserved film. In the meantime, we could have a better look at his life, and someone will be able to present a truly thoughtful exploration of who Michael Jackson really was and what it means to the world of entertainment. This very risky biopic wasn't the movie.
