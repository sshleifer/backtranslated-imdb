I was very disappointed in this movie. Twice I was tempted to go out because parts of the film were so demoralizing and depressing. The film has elements that relate to all marine things in life (pornography, murder, suicide, fornication, hatred, gang warfare). The graphic nature of the violence in this film was particularly worrying. Richard Dutcher makes the Church of LDS a great bear service in portraying missionary attitudes, commitment, spirituality and disobedience to obedience. But my biggest objection to this film was that it is the exact opposite of a film that feels good. The Dutchman's Divine Army was fine. His Brigham City was pretty good. This film, in terms of casting, acting and drama, was his best. But as for being inspiring or uplifting, it was as terrible as it could have been. In fact, this movie so demoralized me that I'm sorry I went. I lost interest in re-supporting the Dutchman in the LDS movie with a ticket purchase.
