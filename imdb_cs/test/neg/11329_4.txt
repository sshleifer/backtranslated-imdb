I only saw this movie once when I was about 14, but I was thrilled to make a 45th Division movie. Being from Oklahoma and especially now that both my sons are members of the 45th, I'd like to see that he is released on DVD. Maybe it sounds a bit distorted, but sometimes the 45th Division doesn't get the credit they deserve today. Channel history always talks about other infantry divisions when they talk about World War II and Korea, but you rarely hear them mentioning 45. One of the scenes that really stood for me was when they had an Indian speaker and a bewildered look they face German soldiers when they could not understand this language. I'm glad everyone Native American Code Talkers is getting the credit they deserve.
