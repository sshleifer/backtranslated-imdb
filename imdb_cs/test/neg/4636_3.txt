Here is an example number 87,358 of the Hollywood anti-biblical bias that is so typical of them. Soon after, Ray Liotta's wife did and women are interviewing for the housekeeper's position. The first questioned is an old-fashioned looking (dress, mannerism, speech) who immediately sets strict rules that claim to "be two hours of Bible study at any time." <br /> <br /> said, of course, to sound like reading The Bible is a worse punishment that you have ever been able to order someone, especially a child. Again, the Bible is compared to sultry people. Of course, the woman is immediately released. Liberal Black Woman (Whoopi Goldberg - Who else?) She is naturally the one who is hired and the villa saves the day! <br /> <br /> Yawning.
