Yes, it's pure waste. It might be interesting for anyone who likes experimental cinema (like me) to see lowlifes babbling and doing nothing for almost two hours but it gets very painful when you realize that you actually paid for it. It's probably one of those movies you like to watch for your complete emptiness and nihilism. I accept it, though for its shock value, decades before Trainspotting and Pulp Fiction.
