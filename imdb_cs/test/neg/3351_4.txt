If you look at the envelope and read something else about it, a completely different type of film comes to mind than what you get here. Then again I may have read a summary for another movie called "Mausolem" instead of as there were two films of this title released at about the same time with both featuring a plot that had key elements in common. However, reading things about the movie here I know I've seen this and not the one, and the movie is even less than one would imagine a movie with that title. I'll be honest, I expect more of a zombie-like image and to some extent you'll do it in this movie. However, there are more things to include occult and strange powers, while the introductory scene of people being taken away by the coroner at the beginning of the film affirms. The film also has an old theme that children go somewhere they do not belong to have a crazy party, in this case it is actually a mausoleum. Another movie I don't think has this key element that plays this prominent role in the movie, and I see that the score for this movie is also higher, it was still not the movie I was expecting.
