That was the worst movie I had to go through. 30 minutes to the movie and I couldn't take it anymore. Seriously, don't bother with this if you're not a sentimental nut job or one of those pseudo-artypic types who like this kind of dragon so they can feel more cultivated. Boring, though the deal is fine; the child is simply irritated. Some scenes are a little strange with very strange close-ups. I don't know why they were doing the whole movie in black and white, but any effect they hoped didn't succeed. There was nothing to be observed, and although his sad story, allegedly, was so stupid, it was hard to feel sympathy for the characters.
