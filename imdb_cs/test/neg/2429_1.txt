It's painful for me to see an amazing movie turn into some lame, repetitive and lazy series. It is filled with conspiracy holes and the plot is confusing in the BAD way. Whoever would be the writers who chose to turn such a big movie into this waste would have to do some research instead of filling it with single-layered and hollow new characters and classic jokes from the first film OVER AND RENEWAL AND EXACTLY RETURN. Sure you get a little creative, but its like seeing the same episode with a little twist. Just like listening to Creed or Nickleback. Kuzco has to prevent it from failing, Yzma has a complicated plan, but decides to go easy to save time and use only a potion, someone asks a monkey and bug, Bucky appears in the background, Kuzco flirts with raspberry, misses it without it sounded like a bitch, Yzma disguises herself as "Principal Amzy" and calls Kronk and forgets he's Yzma. I admit that this show has moments. Another problem is the fact that Yzma looks younger and Pacha looksâ€¦ weird. Also, no one can replace David Spade and John Goodman! Theirs who made Kuzco and Pachu Kuzco and Pachu! I'm sorry, but I'm giving this show two inches down.
