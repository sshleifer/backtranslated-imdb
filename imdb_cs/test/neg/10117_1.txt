This is truly one of the most horrific movies of all time. It is boring, cumbersome, poorly bred, and the teeth hovering. I've been watching for about an hour before I waited for a drama to appear before I realized it wasn't. The shoe budget shot was particularly painful. You must be the worst day for night shots because of Plan Nine from space. The only barely redeemable feature is the ridiculous "demonic" journey through the countryside with a plastic cat basket. How scary is that? And I did like moggys used as accessories, I think they are the least cheap. Though it seemed a little obvious, they were careful to place some tuna in the camera. This film is so terrible it should have a public health warning. When I took it back, there was a queue of people in my local video store asking for their money back. I will not tell you!
