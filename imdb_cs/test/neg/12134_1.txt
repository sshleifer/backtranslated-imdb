We've all seen bad movies, but this will take the cake. I saw that the Junior movie box was looking back at many times from my travels to the horror section of the local video store, and I was a little biased, it looks like it pays homage to the Texassaw Masssaw massacre, so I thought I could do it . Error! Junior sucks hard, long and with commitment. In other words, it's really bad. While winning my award for the most creative bikini top. AVOID!!
