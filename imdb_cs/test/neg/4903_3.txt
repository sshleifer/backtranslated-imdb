After some internet surfing, I found a "Homefront" series on DVD at ioffer.com. Before anyone gets excited, the DVD file I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off their television 15 years ago. Resolution and quality are bad. Images appear to expect you to see the old re-recorded video again. Although the commercials were edited out, the end credits of each episode still have vocal announcements for the segway into the ABC news program "Nightline", complete with top news headlines since the early 1990s. Even with poor image quality, shows were guarded and sound quality was fine. <br /> <br /> The cast was almost perfect for this show. Everyone was believable and they really looked at it. Their behavior was also above average. The role of Jeff Metcalf is played especially well by Kyle Chandler (most recently seen in the 2005 King Kong Remake). Similar costumes were very authentic, as were sets, especially the 1940s kitchen with vintage appliances and decor. The direction was also creative and different for the television show at the time. For example, conversations between characters have sometimes been interrupted by conversations about the same subject among other characters in different scenes. The dialogue of the various interviews was kept fluid despite the fact that there was a fourth place between the signs and places. This is in good direction and editing and in this case it worked. When I started watching this series again, I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago. Despite all the ingredients for a good show, plot and storyline, they are disappointing and confusing from the start. First, the exhibition itself is completely misleading. When WWII ended in 1945, there was no further fighting so apparently there was no longer a "homefront" either. Curiously, the first show episode "Homefront" begins in 1945 after the war ended. This is like shooting the first episode of "Gilligan's Island", which shows how survivors were rescued. The entire premise of the show's name is completely lost. I was still hopeful with the possibility that the rest of the series would be flashback, but no, the whole show was held from 1946 until 1948. Moreover, this series fails in every attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940s . . By the third episode, it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thin veiled vehicle for an ultra left-wing political program. The show takes place in River Run Ohio, near Toledo. However, the show's ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio. The cast includes Dick Williams, Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr., who portray Davis's family. Much of the series shows that the Davis family is discriminated against by evil "whites" to the point of being ridiculous and utterly absurd when not laughing. The racism card has played and played Hollywood for over 40 years. We understand it. We are also tired of having our nose on it every day. The theme of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it's a kiss of death for every show as it was for "Homefront". The acting talent of Williams, Winston and Macer was unnecessary in their roles as a stereotypical "frightened / angry black family". The wild exaggerated racism in this series seems to be everyone in Ohio being a member of the KKK or something. The issue of racism in this exhibition could be addressed in one episode with a simple nose-to-nose or fist-fight, in which bigot gets a well-deserved demolition and leaves him on it. Engaging a large part of the show in a racist thing is really really really fast and it's just stupid. In another ridiculous line, the big head of the local factory (Ken Jenkins) is portrayed as Ebenezer Scrooge as a character who is against pensions and raises and is concerned about the acid dripping on his employees. Workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro-communist propaganda message to the viewer. Personally, I think this series has great potential. Writers could easily place the timeline in 1941 ?? 1945, as the name suggests, and showed that the extraction of food and gas rations and work 14 hours a day in war factories. Of course, the loss of overseas brothers, sons and husbands would also add drama. The situation was also ideal for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their city during training or on a trip to Europe or the Pacific. The possibilities for good stories and land are endless. But no, Homefront writers (David Assael and James Grissom) have completely ignored any relevant or interesting plot. Instead, they completely missed a point and wandered into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and leftist politics. It would be unfair for the participants to condemn the whole series, but the land and the situations in which they were located are utter waste.
