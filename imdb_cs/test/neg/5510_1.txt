Really terrible. Obviously, trying to cash on Star Wars Madness, but there's no excuse for this nonsensical piece of waste. The plot is lost before the center, the characters are forgotten and the child is such a non-talent that all he does is pose for the camera. The alien planet they land on is actually a naval depot in Long Beach, California. This movie actually made me physically ill when I watched it. Roger Corman has made some good, bad movies in his career. <br /> <br /> 0/10 - IMDb won't let you score zero.
