Confectioners outperform in all bad contexts, situations aren't just funny with cheesy voices and poor low comedy timing timing, a clear attempt at dry / black / dark humor is obvious and it fails to meet all the good things with a joke. With a high cringe factor and a low laugh rate, I was shocked when this show went through the first season, I personally like Scrubs, The Office, 30 Rock, Trailer Park Boys, Pulling, Peep Show, Simpsons, Family Guy and I know what your thoughts are, these shows aren't weird at all, so some of the other good shows I've seen are Jam, Garth Marenghi's Darkplace, Book Group, Asylum, and Snuff Box, which are genuine black / dark humor / satire and all are at least 5/10. Garth Marenghi's dark place is particularly cheap, overworked, and weird, but the context is well thought out and works so that it is really fun there too.
