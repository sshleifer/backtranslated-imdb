Well, I thought the movie was bla 1/10. anyway the best is the first 5 minutes of a movie with a nerd or girlfriend, that's the part of the guys who watch out for Tho she had big hooters, I thought he's a really casual actor? Heck no, it wasn't actually a model named Larissa McComas, but he already knew that <br /> <br /> So it made sense, but that was the rest of the movie (that I saw anyway) did did not care 4, and did not bother to watch the rest of it is <br /> <br /> all I needed to make C be satisfied, so 2 of you that just care about it well there u go enjoy
