When a stranger calls belongs to a group of this year's remake, with movies like Poseidon just above the horizon. The director of Simon West (Con Air) helmet of this updated version, with a lot of relative unknown casts that signal either mortality is high (that's not), or that established stars are driving clear from potential Turkey. <br /> <br /> In a relatively short 87-minute timeframe, these are mainly two acts. The first, which lasts an hour, is the setting. Our heroine, Jill Johnson (Camilla Belle), scored 800 minutes of talk time on her mobile phone (math) and her parents confiscated her cell phone and grounded her. Paying your debt, working part-time as a babysitter, and taking care of the rich kids Mandrakis, is her first stint. Huge Mandrakis Castle gets a full tour as it's where all the action will take place. Lots of rooms (made for good hiding), indoor pool size aquarium-pond (get wet, for wet t-shirt-treatment), and check it out-of-light light detector that you just know will contribute to terror by manipulating lights and shadows. Naturally, prank calls, red herring are sufficient to cross this runtime act, but most of them fall into the tensions department. There is a small trend where actors are invisible who provide and instead. Recent attempts include Edward Norton in the Kingdom of Heaven and Hugo Weaving is for Vendetta. Here, Lance Henriksen makes homage to an anonymous, nameless psychotic killer, but it just falls. Why? The script doesn't give him much dialogue. Most of the phone calls made were silent (mind-masturbating) nature, which I thought was a waste - they could also definitely have rejected an unknown place instead, and the work would still be done. The second meeting where the main event takes place is too late. And bogeyman, well, he's just a bogeyman. Those who expect blood and gore will be disappointed because it is basically one of them that catches your attention in the first hour (eye candy always succeeds), and this act will allow her to solve everything at twice the quick time, ala Rachel McAdams in Red Eye. Don't expect any form of character development or subplots to deal with. The end tried to be too smart for your own good, and came across as a cheap way to end the movie. There's nothing good about this movie to excel from this movie - without fear, no excitement, no mysterious villain, and a lot of security flaws, especially the door alarm - the only thing that's good is to provide a 4D number.
