He was horribly horrified and horribly horrifying at the horror that he had in mind that Anna Paquin was playing a neurotic teenager struggling with "things-to-go-bump-in-the-dark" that bothered her and her family shortly after moving to their new home in Spain (?!). A little more geographically re-planted rip-off "The Shining" and most notably "Others", weak-handed "Darkness" is basically your typical run-of-the-mill B-horror feature with a few predictable lame scares that can be seen by viewers miles away (so say)! In retrospect, I suppose I shouldn't keep my personal expectations high enough to make this film really good, given the fact that it has been postponed for almost three years before it was finally released around last year's American cinemas across the country what was eventually a lukewarm ticket sale and very sharp reviews by critics. When do filmmakers ever learn that there are more films (whether horrible or otherwise) than just a false chance of little financial gain? (Turkey-Zero Stars)
