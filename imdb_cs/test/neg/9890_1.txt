This film is to take place in Milford NJ. I know the house is based on, just like a person. As you can see at the end of the topic, she was killed in a World Trade Center incident. I know this because I was one of the cops who helped identify her remains. (There was only one lost in our area). Nudity in the movie went a bit far. I am not the first time, but the actors could shoot the scene with both women without showing it all. This film is in bad taste and I can't see how the family gave her a blessing. This is an insult to the person on whom it is based.
