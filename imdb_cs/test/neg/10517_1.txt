Everyone knows that late night movies are not Oscar candidates. Good. I admit I was a bit drunk and bored and I thought I'd get some skin-and-max. It's pretty bad when information about a TV guide makes the movie fun in the description. It even gave him half a star. To be fair, I sat and threw the whole thing because man was soooooooooo bad. I couldn't stop laughing. I mean words that come out of the mouths of these people and how they try to be serious. Most of the time, I think people on the screen were trying not to laugh. In fact, I think they laughed in one scene. Anyway, the film doesn't make sense. It was like one Sopranos episode with a fat homosexual. Only Sopranos is a great show. But it was horrible, I mean, no nudity, just sex scenes from the 1990s. You know the kind that uses shadows and silhouettes instead of shadows. I gave her two reasons this film does for a good movie about drinking. I mean, with all the cheeses, it helps to get the wine out. If it's late at night, and all that's on TV, it's and that Tony Little guy and his bicycle, then I suggest Tony Little.
