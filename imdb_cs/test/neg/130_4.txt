The movie watched the trailer and looked quite interesting. The film's production is also quite good - it looks like it has a good budget and doesn't look like a cheaply made film. Acting ranges from good (Joe Morton as Professor Simon) to OK (Kelly Overton as Eve) to bad (James Haven as Don). <br /> <br /> The actual content and graph of the movie is weak. The film begins as if it could become interesting and ends with a poorly executed, unsatisfactorily boring, twist. Watching the first 10 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the movie would make this movie OK, but everything in between makes this movie totally boring. It is as if they made a short film and then tried to force him to be over an hour long by filling the filling material in the middle. <br /> <br /> If you want to lose a good hour and half your life, watch this movie. Otherwise, avoid this extremely boring movie.
