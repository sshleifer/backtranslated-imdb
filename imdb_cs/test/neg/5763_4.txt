The "Curse of the Forty Years" really does not deserve a long and detailed overview, so I will only have a few random observations about it: Cool introductory credits. <br /> <br /> - No conspiracy. - Is there anyone who has ever seen a horror movie and can't figure out who will survive in the first 20 minutes and who won't be walking in this group of stereotypes? - Hey, this newbie (Alexandra Ford) is pretty hot! Richard Lynch (Made for 100 Years) and John Phillip Law Have Fun - Karen Black has a bigger role, but it's not fun - it's a bit embarrassing. - Martin Kove is on the screen for about 40 seconds, but he still has his name on the video. Did they pay him for this look or was it the other way around? - I hate cheap computer effects in horror movies. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4.
