I will only start with citations from other reviewers who describe it best. "This is easily one of the most overrated films of the year and probably the worst movie ever made by Tarantino." "Just a good thing in this movie was Mr. Waltz's appearances." <br /> <br /> "So I was really disappointed and see this movie on site # 40 of the biggest movies of all time is the only thing about leaving me with my open mouth" Now for more information to go and read "Hated to "Review. One thing I hate about film is when it treats the audience as a bunch of stupid people. (Spoiler forward). Now I know that Tarantino's style is based on imagination and fictitious charts, but Adolf Hitler and 200 top Nazi officers will attend the film premiere in occupied France and have only two guards in the entire theater and surroundings? Where also American-African walks freely with steel doors locking doors and igniting fire. These two guards are then executed in seconds and open the door for our 2 "heroes" to kill Hitler in a blank space with about 100 laps ... very stupid. At least challenge our intelligence and create a smarter plot to kill one of the most feared tyrants of all time (Go watch Valkyrie). In addition, Mike Myers impersonating a British general is more realistic and authentic than the one who does Hitler, just imagine. What has further destroyed it is that the only clever and powerful character who has nailed all the film, with its psychological and mind bending interrogations, ends up being tricked by the most thoughtless character in the film. After watching the movie, I was sympathetic to the Nazis who were portrayed to have more bravery and humanity than our Basterds !!! Imagine that. <br /> <br /> My recommendation if you have insomnia, 2 hours 33 minutes to waste or want your mind to break, go watch this movie.
