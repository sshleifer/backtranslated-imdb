This film is a waste of time. I expect the action movie to have more than 2 explosions and some firing. He was never too much an actor, but here it is worse. He was certainly better in his earlier films. His script for the whole movie was probably no more than one page of stupid nonsense one liners. Why didn't they just say "Border Patrol"? Combat scenes could have been better, but either they couldn't afford it, or the battle choreographer suffered from a lack of ideas. This is a low cost action cinema.
