Sometimes it is funny to watch movies that explode from your couch, but at other times it is terribly painful for both your eyes and your mind. House Party 4: Down to the Last Minute is one of those rare examples where both your eyes and your mind are asked to turn off the movie. This last installment of the House Party series is by far the worst, not just a sequel, but a movie released by Hollywood. This is very obvious soon in this "feature" that director Chris Stokes loved Ferris Bueller Day Off with passion. I say this because it is very clear that Stokes had no difficulty in removing Buerer's originality from John Hughes and decided to make the film completely humorous. One would think that by stealing themes and pictures from a more fun movie, your own movie would at least be able to create giggles or two. With House Party 4, Stokes has shown that he doesn't have what it takes to drive a sequel, much less Hollywood film. From his confusing and jerky story, the inability to make sense of his characters and the recycling of old / tired clichÃ©s when Stokes thrive, all the Stokes do hit a larger nail in a coffin that holds House Party movies. It reminds me of a student who forgets his project in an hour and quickly packs super glue, macaroni, cat hair, chewing gum and straws and introduces him as "Hannibal Crossing the Alps". It looks awful and you feel ashamed of the creator. So where did the movie first dive into the realm of comic stupidity? Frankly, I don't think most places allow me to talk so long, so I'd like to hit some of the bigger topics that hit me hardest. I can't still shake Ferris Beuller to get started. It was as if director Stokes was ashamed of having to order another sequel to the House Party and decided to bring a completely random pattern (from a fun movie) to see if he could carve and embed elements from the original series into this formula. That was a huge mistake. When the director tries to do what will eventually happen, there is confusion in the audience. We think we're going in one direction, but instead we go on. This is exactly what you can testify at House Party 4. In one case, we have John-John trying to have the "biggest party of the decade" while trying to record a record (ok, he reminds me of the original House Party), but then we whisk on this random island, where Uncle Charles is afraid of flying, grandmother gets drunk, and some idiotic mind-numbing moments with supposed killer. Again, we start a little strong and end up chaotic. That's the confusion I'm talking about. Director Stokes was unable to keep his hand on the pulse of humor or on the ability to tell a sequential story. He would rather cut himself, leave the jokes cheap, and think the viewers were idiots to try to revive the stone series. One would think that when he gave the director the task of filming another party from the Party, he stepped into it and thought it would be him who could revive him or bring him back to life, instead of stokes wanting to pay him . Br /> <br /> I realize that I am slowly getting older as the days go fast, but I believe that I still hold my hand in the culture of the younger generation. I listened to rap and R&B grew up, but the "Immature" group never got into my cassette deck or CD player. Why? I don't think they have anything else like that, but it would be beneficial for director Chris Stokes if you shot them in his new House House movie as a leader. Nobody in any studio realized that it would be rather fast in red? Or how Stokes playing with a comedy car repairer, nothing like a director who doesn't have a sense of comic timing, is in itself the only source of possible humor. It was one of those few times when I actually missed Robin Harris, and I never thought I'd tell a movie. Outside the band that played the lead role, I also thought the rest of the cast continued to suck in the life of this movie. Uncle Charles was annoying when he tried to humor. Kim Whitely was totally useless for her scenes (literally and figuratively), while? well ?? everyone else falls into this category. Where did Stokes spend most of the budget for this movie? Not for special guest stars, because while this movie may have boasted some, there was certainly no one present at the "unforgettable" House Party, or a possible dream that perhaps Kid or Play would make the final look. House Party 4 followed no preset design that eventually destroyed this feature from foundation down. Could anyone explain why you need to use "escaped murderer who was the driver of a licensed taxi" for humor? Stokes reached deep into the bottom of the barrel and produced more muck instead of substance. For once, I can admit that there is no redemption value for this film. The House Party 4 buried series, and when I hear there may be more in the pipeline, I just hope Hollywood realizes that this series has died. Hollywood has to leave this series in the end, forget the past and continue in the future. I think the sequel Who's the man? they could start them in the right direction. <br /> <br /> Level: * outside *****
