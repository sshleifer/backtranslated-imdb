It's really a shame to see so many talented people involved in what happened to be wasting talents. The story is a clich√©. The direction is too confident and the characters are almost cartoons. One of the most unsatisfactory aspects of this film is Gerard Depardieu's performance in English (this film was shot in French and English). Although one of the best actors in the film, he gives them the worst performance of all. I must say that although Bianca Gervais comes very close ... <br /> <br /> On a more positive note, I must say that the newcomer, Juliette Gosselin, gives amazing performance in both versions. Unfortunately, the only good thing I remember about this movie ... <br /> <br /> Anyway, I have to apologize for my not very good English ...
