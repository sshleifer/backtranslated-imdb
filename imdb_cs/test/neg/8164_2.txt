I like movies, all genres and from big dollar glasses to small indie projects. But even though the contribution to this piece of waste is 25 years old and its attempt to honor the fifties, it almost suffers from the aspect we are considering movies. During the film I have been alerted to several "student films", I had a chance to watch, an effort where creativity is needed to fill the gaps where funds are needed. <br /> <br /> All in all, the chances of better use are 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> 2/10
