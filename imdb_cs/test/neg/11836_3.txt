T-Rex is in a small western town in the open and encourages Sheriff Eric Robers and animal control agent Melissa Brasselle (who goes through her role in a very uninterested way) to get to the bottom of things. He discovers that a mad scientist (Corbin Bernsen) is unnoticed, regardless of government sponsorship, continuing a long-abandoned US research project called Operation Jurassic Storm (ha!) By creating a dinosaur army in a remote underground lab. Before long our heroes find themselves trapped, the marines are called, the power goes out and dinosi are ready for a quick lunch of anyone they can get on their claws and jaws. Despite this very straightforward scenario full of holes, mismatches of characters and free ends, this direct video projection of JURASSIC PARK and CARNOSAUR is quite well digested, thanks to good production values, throughput FX, occasional laughter and lots of thoughtless actions. Someone pointed out that the opening scene in this film was stolen by CARNOSAUR, but anyone looking at Roger Corman's production knows that it allows directors to reuse clips from his first movies to save time and money. . <br /> <br /> Score: 3 out of 10
