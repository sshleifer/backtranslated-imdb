This strangeness contains touches similar to Bunul, but does not support interest. A 10-year-old roams the bizarre America in a stolen Mustang, while the usual cult suspect movies (Dick Miller, Mary Woronov, Susie Tyrell) commit malicious acts in the name of comedy. Like his WEATHER CLOCK and VAMPIRE KISS, the screenwriter is looking forward to wiggling. I remained intact because of the wide-ranging negotiations. You know you're in that when a meat loaf and flea give the most appealing performance. (And how did this child test on screen look like? It's unbearable.) Recommended for a dozen SONNY BOY fans ('87).
