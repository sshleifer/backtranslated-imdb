I waited for a while to watch this Lone Ranger movie. I finally saw him on the Lone Star Channel and I was very disappointed with the whole movie. Clayton Moore and John Hart acted better as Lone Rangers and Jay Silverheels as Tonto than the two stars in this movie. Very bad behavior was done by everyone in this film. Even the plot was bad and far more appealing. I believe that a horse depicting Silver was the best actor in this whole film. I'm really sorry that the characters that Clayton Moore, John Hart and Jay Silverheels played and revived on the silver screen were so tainted. If they don't find actors in the future who deserve to display characters in the same way that Clayton, John and Jay did in the past, I won't spend money on buying a movie. I won't see this movie again. Wayne Davies
