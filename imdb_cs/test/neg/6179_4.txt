As I learned, this episode is trying to make a statement about how real criminals are very bad people, and that is just as scary as a paranormal. The "paranormal" images associated with the villain Donnie are purely symbolic. It's just a normal human being. The problem is that I don't buy it. Donnie is not just more frightening than paranormal. He's not that scary at all. As a guy who seems to be confused and strange, rather than dangerous, likes dead girls and hair and has just recently become a murderer, he is considerably less intrusive than most known real-life killers (eg It's Like a PUBLIC BACK) version Ed Geina). That's why Scully is horrified to see nothing but hair and nail bodies cut off (something that is not much different from normal personal hygiene) before anyone is killed or injured at all, completely out of character. He sees things a hundred times worse in almost every other episode and hardly collapses. <br /> <br /> As Comic Book Guy says ... "EVER's worst episode!"
