My mother and I rented this gem a few years ago when she was visiting Thanksgiving. I rarely laughed so hard. It is a typical low-budget horror movie with silly special effects, a worse plot and worse acting. Are you really expecting a classic when Linnea Quigley receives top billing? I thought not. <br /> <br /> Since this movie has some fun value, I give it 3 out of 10.
