"Racketeer" plays Carol (stripped of "e" that usually appeared at the end of her given name) Lombard as a woman fired from the company because she left her husband for a concert violinist (Roland Drew) who has since become.

It is practically a compendium of what was wrong with the oldest talks: stiffness, steadfast cameras, stagnant acting, and the ridiculously slow pace of line delivery. At that time, the sound crews told the directors that their actors spoke every line of s-l-o-w-l-y, and did not start speaking their own line until the former actor had finished. Five years later, it could be an interesting movie, but director Howard Higgin faithfully follows his dictaphones and systematically cheats on talents we know that Lombard and Armstrong had to watch their later movies. "The Racketeer" was made in 1929, a year that despite the transition problems from silence to sound he gave us some legitimate masterpieces? Vidor's "Hallelujah!", "Mamoulian's" Applause, "Wyler's" Hell Heroes, "Capra" Ladies of Leisure "?? all from directors with a strong will to tell the dictators of the soundboard to stuff themselves and let their actors talk and act naturally. Too bad Howard Higgin wasn't that strong; As it is, observing naturally the fast-paced actors like Armstrong slog over part in the ridiculous way he was told to talk, one can't help but wonder where this 50-foot gorilla is when Armstrong needs him.
