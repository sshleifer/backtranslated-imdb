Mockumentaries have recently spread so much that access requires the injection of fresh and creative material every time it is used to maintain its vitality. This film brings nothing but worn-out aids of similar stories, aimless scenario, weak ad-libs, uninspired acting, and selfless self-confident humor. The assumption would seem promising; the legend of the Loch Ness monster is made to order for one of these goofy mockumentary misadventures, with a huge range of history and legends waiting to be utilized for outrageous satire. However, filmmakers are losing this huge potential. We got some fool who put the fake Nessie in the water. Gee, that's original. The next scene has one unpleasant idiot who threatens another nasty idiot with a gun. Sidesplitting. Some gratuitous footage of pretty girl in bikini. Annette did it 40 years ago (and far better, by the way). In the course of the film, someone seems to always shout: I suppose this is designed to wake the audience who nodded at this point. show the type of "interview comment" made by characters. Not only did you get this tired joke every five seconds, but apparently the actors also improvised; this is the only explanation for how funny jokes are. If the lines are like "I have never seen anyone writing a book on non-evidence", they were actually written, then the writer should be filmed at Nessie. No wonder Nessie was violent; it obviously saw this movie.
