I'm one of those gluttons for punishment when it comes to sitcom these days — still checking them once in a while. My observation is that most of them aren't too funny even those on big networks that are getting high ratings, I just don't understand who is finding them intestines busting funny. While a few of them made me smile, none of them could laugh at me, usually changing channels after a few minutes. Now, on the FOX network, new shows such as changing your underwear will go out, for some reason they think they can make a good sitcom, badly dead. They have to beat this dead horse so much that it is hiring only to anyone who can find a miserable pilot with a bad dialogue and just spew them out. Let's take a brief look at the last piece of junk that Fox has spewed out "War at Home" <br /> <br /> I've been watching for about 5 minutes and it was generous. In this particular episode, Daughter's Mouth Gone to Her Parents I Make an Adult Now Rant.The Dad Gets Told Tells Her "OK ​​Alright, Go For It And Do What You Want If If You Problem Is" To Which She Answers " Well I guess your crazy, but hey, at least I didn't get AIDS "(cue laugh track, no way that can be a live audience if they weren't paid to applaud such trash) - I found crack about having no AIDS in such bad taste . Well, at least I don't have to watch these other stupid things. Take FOX help, stop wasting your time with sitcoms.OK well you have the Simpsons, but it is now getting very old and tired too.
