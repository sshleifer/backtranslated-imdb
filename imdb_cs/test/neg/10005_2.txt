This German horror film must be one of the strangest things I've ever seen. I was not aware of any relationship between child abuse and vampire, but it is based on real character. Our hero is deaf and muted as a result of repeated beating in his father's hands. she also has a fetish doll, but I can't figure out where it came from. His co-workers find him and tease him. During the day, the accountant is knowledgeable and at night returns to the cemeteries and funerals and drinks the blood of the dead girls. Of course, they're all appealing, or we wouldn't worry about usually tearing their clothes up to the waist. He graduate eventually to actually kill, and that's what catches him. As I said, a very strange movie that is dark and very slow, as Werner Pochath never talks and just spends his time drinking blood.
