I disagree with Dante depicting Democrats supporting Democrats as an IQ average creature 23. I believe their behavior should reflect a lower IQ than that, something in the order of Pelosi IQ ... One-digit number, please. <br /> <br /> The MOH series is fairly uneven and the worst episode. Dante, one more helpless Hollywood liberal (or an apolitical nerd who sucks on a left-wing organization to light his pitiful career again), finally realized that his directorial efforts had been imprisoned in low-speed stages for nearly two decades. now he has come up with this irritated, rude, leftist "satire" of the Bush administration, Republicans, and capitalism. Maybe he felt he wasn't obviously political before. It wouldn't be the first talent ever to use Asinin political propaganda for another career when everything else fails. Producers of turds such as "Piranha", "Howling", and "Matinee", Dante were as a useful contributor to the horror genre as Adolf Hitler was to world peace. TH uses humor with the lowest common denominator, cheap and predictable gags that even the most frightening of all trade union members would have no difficulty understanding. Or have you ever seen a clever, gentle, intelligent liberal satire? Populous manure has the most basic of all messages, so the language and the way this message is communicated must be as simple and basic as Sean Penn's name. And what better people send this message to cracking sheep than a few cocaine-sniffing Tinseltowns who all have fallen so low that they are forced to write for television ... <br /> <br /> I don't want political propaganda, either left or right , in any type of film. But placing in horror - all genres - is a testimony to the infinite stupidity that rules so supremely among Hollywood anti-intelligence. So the vapid was Dante that he hadn't even noticed the hilarious stimulus that zombies would vote for a democrat ... (That's what you get for completing a film school: no source of wisdom or useful knowledge by any section of imagination.)
