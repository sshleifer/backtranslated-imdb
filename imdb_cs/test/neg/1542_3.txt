There is something frustrating about watching a movie like 'Murder from Numers' because somewhere inside this Hollywood formula is a good movie trying to jump up. However, at a time when credits scroll, it's not saving. The whole thing is largely deflated by the "cop" of the story, where Sandra Bullock and Ben Chaplin's murder detective characters are confused by the embarrassing sexual affair that is becoming increasingly trivialized, the longer the film continues. Although Bullock is strong in his role, it is not enough to impose a faint script and lazy running. Ben Chaplin's talents are wasted in a forgotten role (he did much better in the underrated 'Birthday Girl' during the year), as did Chris Penn, who has such an ungrateful little role that he regrets talent like him. By the way, the storyline really isn't a factor in this movie at all. Two teen murderers playing Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt are the only real reasons to see this movie. Their talent and chemistry work pretty well, and they do well. It's too bad they weren't in a much better all-round movie. Barbet Schroeder is very safe for such an experienced filmmaker. The Bottom Line: It's worth hiring if you're a fan of the genre, but everyone else will live a filled life without ever seeing it, except maybe on network TV with convenient commercial breaks.
