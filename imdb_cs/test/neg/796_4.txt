Ha ha. - oh no - what to say about this movie? Yes - green eggs and ham make more sense than this movie. Where to start? Many good things have already been said - so I will not disclose in the same territory. I believe you already have a movie summary - so I'm not going to paraphrase the movie. <br /> <br /> First - let's start with good. <br /> <br /> 1). If you like the psychological thrillers that think of you (like me), the first 29 minutes of this movie will be for you - that's one of those movies that illustrate the question you've always talked about in long cars when you were kids. (What if you chose one family member to live, another to die, or what if you had to die drowning or fire) This movie is a great concept - bottom line. <br /> <br /> 2) The wardrobe did a great job and brought us back to the 1970s. Realistically, how hard is it to achieve this? Okay, that's all good. Let's talk about the wrong. <br /> <br /> 1). This film feels like a 2-hour episode of "Twilight Zone". This could easily be 90 minutes. This could make the film acceptable. <br /> <br /> 2). Do you remember the movie "From Dusk til Dawn?" The film started interesting, then in the middle of the movie it just got a little worse? Yeah - the same thing. I would dare to say that writers started with the concept, then they had no idea what to do with it. I got a deeper thought provocation from the Transformers 2. <br /> <br /> 3). Yes - we get a dilemma in the movie. We understand philosophical undertones and the utilitarian approach - but the story has surfaced too much, has not explored the current arc of the story, and has taken (forgive me) a completely offensive direction. <br /> <br /> 4). The end didn't make sense. Not at all. None. This film would be a great term paper in college philosophy 101. If you are on board from your mind, in bed sick, or have you ever enjoyed a hit in the face with a cake, and you can see it for free -line - by all means, go for it. <br /> <br /> If you need to pay anything to watch this movie, don't waste your time - you'll be better off watching old Howie Mandel stand on You Tube. You get more philosophical stimulation reorganization of the sock drawer.
