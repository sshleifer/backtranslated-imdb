All I can say about this film is boring. The introduction to the film is perhaps the worst introduction to a horror movie I've ever seen, I think the angry chick that hit a guy in the pan's head isn't scary at all, which is what I suppose the director was aiming for, but in fact was "slightly" funny. The action in this film was out of pathetic; a note to directors if you are making a horror movie, hire some good actors, not some popular teen soap star who has no idea how to act. The death scenes in this movie were out of the ordinary. .. no gore, and i'm sorry but horror movies without gore or good tension are just cheesy. I think this girl is killed by the hair that is wrapped around her in the middle of Tokyo, and nobody sees her, they just claim her "missing", wow that's amazing! <br /> <br /> You and your friends want to see this movie, make sure you bring some sleeping pills, because I guarantee you won't do it by the end. nor did they care about what happened at the end. Cheers
