After sitting on this movie, I decided it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I knew it when I was exposed to three young girls who were screaming and tugging at each other (OMG!) And then watching the same thing, only women who are old enough to be my mom do it. And that was just the first few minutes. Yeesh. Here are my comments ... <br /> <br /> 1. Middle-aged women + ridiculous dance moves complemented by hips and over costumes = not a good idea. 2. Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing the way out of a paper bag. Even in this pile of excrements virtually no one else could be. 3. The songs were so random. It was clear to me that they had been thrown, impatiently, into an incredibly inventive plot. 4. My three-year-old nephew could write a better script. <br /> <br /> During the film, I either crouched heavily or laughed. And normally I like film musicals. Of course they should be a little crazy ... but this was ridiculous. This is a waste of talent. In this movie you have great actors and actresses ... I am embarrassed for them that it is now their career. I'm sorry to waste money and time on this piece of crap.
