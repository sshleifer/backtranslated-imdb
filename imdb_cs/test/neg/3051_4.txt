One of the many silent comedies Stan Laurel featured before he teamed up with Oliver Hardy, 'Mud and Sand' is ho-hum hokum. The story is badly incoherent - even though it may be due to a modern arrangement - and humor itself is not inventive at all. <br /> <br /> The potential plot is triggered and ignored; for example, Stan's promise that Fillet de Sole will pay for what she did will never happen. Stan's character does not seem too focused, but it is a common criticism of his work before he has developed the fame of Stanley Laurel & Hardy, so it might be that I expected to see this deficiency. <br /> I firmly believe that all silent movies should be preserved and viewed, and I'm glad that this movie is still available. It's not just a great movie.
