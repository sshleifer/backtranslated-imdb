This film was one of those films where I was totally deceived when I thought it was a clever 80-year-old cover-based movie, but it wasn't. It was perhaps one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The cover image does not match any part or scene in the movie; it wasn't really a chain saw. Even the tag line doesn't fit into the movie. The film is about a group of cheerleaders and two potheads running into a barren cabin, in a cool forest, for a weekend getaway. However, things get cooler when they start being murdered by an unknown killer. At the same time, the local sheriff's department hunts for a dangerous killer. I'll list the issues. <br /> <br /> 1. Playing. The boy was cheap and terribly bad. It seemed unnatural and it seemed very written. None of the actors seemed to try to play with good intentions, and therefore they seemed to be stupid and tired. It was a bad performance of all the characters in the movie, so I'm not going to point out specific people, but I'll say that the stoners did a terrible job, just like the police and cheerleaders, which is no surprise. br /> <br /> 2. Plot. This story created a perfect story for good fashion fashion, but instead it was sprinkled with conspiracy holes, unnecessary and useless scenes, and a total silly story of murder intentions. There was a big conspiracy, including how the killer killed the last victim so quickly and yet he was in a group of girls when it happened? Ex-con practically served useless in the film outside of being an unnecessary plot device. There was random and unnecessary sex, and the nudity that was spilled in it, even for b-movie or my taste, was a bit too much. As for the killer's intentions, let's say it was stupid and there is no point in killing young girls. In addition, there were also some very predictable killings I saw coming about 30 miles away. <br /> <br /> 3. Technical page. The light was okay, it certainly wasn't the worse lighting I saw in the movie, but there were points where it was supposed to be dark, but it looked more like an afternoon. The house seemed to be darker with the lights on, then the lights light up. Working with the camera was moderate, had no good shots or amazing pans or zooming in because he thought it made the job of building some tension with framing. Overall, this film is a conspiracy, character development and performance wasting, a waste of my time. What I thought it would be a big slasher movie turned out to be one of the worse movies I've ever seen. Acting was really bad and wooden; But the technical aspect of this movie saved me, because if the camera worked or the lighting was wrong, I would turn off the DVD player and discover something else. I would recommend this movie to those who like kitschy b-movies and those who follow the iconic classics because this movie is definitely. I would partly recommend this film to those who like the 80s. But for me, this film was pitiful and utterly terrible.
