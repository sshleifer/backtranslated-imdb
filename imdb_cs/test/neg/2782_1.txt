I knew well when I rented this DVD that it could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. But to say it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen would be easy. I wonder if there are any legal actions that could be taken against individuals who have allowed this film to be produced. I think the funding had to come from somewhere, someone had to give money to make it !! ?? <br /> <br /> I'd like to identify a few production values ​​that led to the failure of this movie, but this movie violated every production standard in the universe. I couldn't do it through the whole movie as I started to get dizzy from the horrible shooting technique. I also can't tell you how many scenes I just ended with zoning during an inexplicable scary dialogue. I feel like I've been scarred all my life. If you were watching this movie before getting this warning, you should consider setting up a support group for the poor who viewed this monstrosity.
