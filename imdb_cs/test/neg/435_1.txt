I just don't get it. Why call it the sequel to "The Werewolf" when he has no connection with him at all? The first movie was funny * and * scary with special effects. (If memory serves, the Oscar category for special makeup effects was * created * for this movie). "Paris" is none of this. Terrible effects, and nothing else. You don't see this movie. Instead, rent the original werewolf in London. You'll be much happier.
