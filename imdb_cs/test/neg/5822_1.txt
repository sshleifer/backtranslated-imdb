Terrible direction from a terrible scenario. Even the DVD looked muddy and focused. Laughing accents across the map. Unlike most other commentators, I had no idea that it was a boy in love in the mud, but that was immediately reflected in the opening scene and in all the lovingly drawn footage of naked or shyly dressed young men, usually wet or glistening with sweat and longingly looking at each other.
