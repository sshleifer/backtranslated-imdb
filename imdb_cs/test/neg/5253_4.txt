I've heard a lot about Beowulf, maybe because I'm from Romania and a good part of the movie was shot here in my country. I was expecting a lot from this movie. Finally, I was disappointed. It's not as bad as other users have said, but it's definitely bad. It's all about a monster killing people in the 6th-century mansion and Lambert who kills him. Lambert is good because he's in all his roles, but other characters suck, and neither action is too good. In addition, the only thing that could save this film, special effects, is also very bad, the monster looks terrible (not scary but terrible). And another bad thing: music. The film tries to create the 6th century atmosphere. But all the action sequences are presented on rock music, which is very bad. I think the rock action works perfectly on a movie like Charlie's Angels - where it's the perfect way to shoot your action. But here it was a very bad idea. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10.
