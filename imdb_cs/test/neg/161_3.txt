This film is about complicated friendship, romance and fraud between two men and two women during World War II. Much effort has been made to make "The Edge of Love" look right. . However, I consider these efforts too high, especially in terms of color tone. Most of the first half of the film is processed so much that it has a strong bluish tone. It's hard to tell who's in this tone. Another harmful point is the fantastic use of the image splitter lens. There are many scenes that have three or four images of the same thing, for example, three smiling Keira Knightley faces or four pairs of arms in a hug. It just makes the film confusing and hard to follow instead of being artistic. <br /> <br /> It's boring when it comes to conspiracy. The way the story unfolds is not at all concerned. Sienny Miller's unstable character is unpleasant. In fact, all the main characters are unpleasant and uncomfortable. Keira Knightley's accent is impossible to understand, making it another obstacle to understanding the plot. <br /> <br /> I highly recommend avoiding "Edge of Love" if you watch a movie just to appreciate great costumes, nice sets and lighting.
