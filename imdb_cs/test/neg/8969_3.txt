Any chance of seeing Katharine Hepburn in something I haven't seen, or her early film career, is a delicacy, and at this level the movie is fun, but it's a terrible mistake like Hill Billy. Her famous New Zealand testimony slipped away, so lines like: "I'd rather rustle some Vittles" quite ridiculous. Is she so beautiful and so young? it almost overcomes this major mistake. The story is an old-fashioned melodrama, and so the younger generation may think it's a pretty insidious thing, but this was the core of American entertainment until the 1940s. He has his moments, but you may need to appreciate it.
