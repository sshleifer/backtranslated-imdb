Consider an action hero lighting a cigarette in the dark. While trying to hide / seek bad guys. (Probably give a light signal to say I'm going) <br /> <br /> That's one of 100 scenes you can laugh at. (I think the movie should be in the comedy category.) <br /> <br /> Terrible overhead, a horrible script, bad stuff, cheap special effects. (They used a tunnel to hide gaming in the dark) <br /> <br /> 3 out of 10 (also because I laughed at seeing those pathetic mistakes)
