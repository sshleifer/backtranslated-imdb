After seeing PURELY BELTER, I came to this site to check it out, but not only did I have to look at the biography of screenwriter / director Mark Herman. As soon as his name appeared on the opening credits, I knew I saw his name somewhere, and after checking, I found that he had written and directed the film version of LITTLE VOICE, one of the most underrated British films of the 1990s. > <br /> PURELY BELTER is a completely different fish pot. It is a grim stereotypical view of Geordie's life and very uninteresting. Everyone is either a joker, a single mother, a thief, a drunk or a drug addict. Since many scenes are set at school, PE teacher is a sadistic tyrant and he is closest to a movie that ever gets into reality. Oh and everyone is very nasty, which contributes to a gloomy atmosphere that is useless. I didn't like PURELY BELTER much when I was looking and now that I know who Mark Herman is, I like it even less. With LITTLE VOICE Herman proved that you can make a fun uplifting comedy with the northern souls, but I had to ask where his undoubted talent in this film went?
