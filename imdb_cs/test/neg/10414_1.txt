I was attracted by this strange story of "real life" to this film. This means that a 20-member fellow in the Big Apple will return home to live with his parents and even more with a floppy brother.

Or "why talk when you mutter?" Or maybe, "as soon as the camera returns to the" coma. "Lips move when they talk? Hardly. Facial expressions? None. Facial muscles? Atrophied.
