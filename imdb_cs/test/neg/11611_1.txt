I'm in no way faceless when I say this movie was worse than any other movie ever made. Worse than "Batman & Robin". Worse than "Manos, Hands of Destiny". Seriously, it's so bad. When people tell me the film is terrible, I use the "Two Girls" scale to figure it out. If the movie is comparable to "Two Girls" then I won't watch it. If it's twice as good, maybe I'll watch it, but just to laugh at the retard who paid someone to do it, because the film is as good as this one would still be a waste.
