I'm a fan of Get Shorty. This is a sequel to the film that did not need any sequel. Chili is back, but Rene Russo is gone without peep. Unfortunately the Chili game was played in the first film and rather than finding an interesting personal arc for him, they simply let stand around repeating lines from the first movie. It's quite lukewarm. Travolta looks old here. It's like people moving around him because his bones are still creaking. His pink lip gloss and blue eyes are very special. The second bad role is Edie (playing Uma Thurman). She is a music producer, a role that requires her to be just Reuben Kincaid. ("Hey, those kids have a great new sound.") In each scene, a bad pitch is motivational or emotional, or both. Watching is painful. Despite a lot of problems, Be Cool will improve after a very unpredictable start. I'm sure I laughed at it (Vince Vaughan runs on fire, Cedric The Entertainer, Ludicrous, The Rock, Dances). -shirt that says "widow" to it) but offers no great memories after it's over. It's a helium-light love fest from the first shot. There is no one who is invaluable in the first film as Gene Hackman. It's just that you're doing well in the world, for a couple of kids who deserve a chance (Beyonce & the Rock). Ho-hum. The first was not preaching. Working in (repeated) gages and lines from the first movie is annoying, as is the stupid concession to rock fans (raising his eyebrow twice). droll inside jokes: Steven Tyler says, "I'm not the kind of singer who does perform in movies" ar ar. <br /> <br /> The versatile spectacular line-up is part of the problem. The first movie was not burdened by "stars". <br /> <br /> We even call it for renting an apartment.
