Now I know that a lot of black humor has fun on typical black things like gold teeth. But that doesn't mean they're always funny. Don't be a threat is an example of this. City film is certainly suitable for satire. The problem is that Wayans and consortia not only try to satirize the typical "ghetto" culture, but also question valid statements made in urban movies such as Boyz 'n' Hood or Menace II Society. Personally, I think the creators of this film should get their heads from the intestinal movements of their white masters. In addition, the film itself is terrible. It's fun. Jokes are racist. Instead of satirizing the urban film genre, filmmakers show their views on "ignorant" urban (ghetto) blacks. Now there are some more jokes in this movie, but I believe this is the main fare. In conclusion, this film is stupid and the creators should use their talent for constructive comedy / satire. They have examples in Men with Black Hats (which were made before this film) and Friday.
