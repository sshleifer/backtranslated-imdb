My grandfather gave me this DVD. With such friends. The front cover looked scary enough to look at him. What is a bloody mistake. Basically, the movie follows three people on the bus and what's going on with their friends. The first one is about a guy who buys a car talking to him. The second is about a guy who wakes up to find a casserole clone in the fridge. And the third is about a woman doing online dating, but she turns out to have a robotic hand. <br /> <br /> The DVD was rated 18, but even a 5-year-old can watch this and not be scary. entertained. The film should be rated 12 for slight fears and oath bloody word. Overall, this movie is totally shite not coming close to it.
