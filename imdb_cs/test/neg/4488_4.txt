This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this film had every chance to be as great as The Notebook, but what sets two apart is a laptop with a dream team leading in McAdams and Gosling , but here's the balance thrown unhappily from idle acting Channing Tatum <br /> <br /> I felt that many scenes were uneven just because of its performance, a lot of emotions in different scenes are lost because they can't act, leaving an unpleasant and uneven situation , Amanda Seyfried did a great job just to let Tatum drop the ball and the mood was lost and the scene couldn't recover. This story deserved to be filled correctly, but what it was was a handsome boy who couldn't act. Tatum should stick to what's good, movies that are more about his physical abilities, though horrible, like GI JOE, stand out and fight. The less he talks, the better. Try not to think of me as a tired Channing Tatum, who I entered with an open mind because I was surprised many times. likes Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave Tatum the same chance that I did not consider him a sum of his past roles, purely his performance in this film, which unfortunately meant a collapse
