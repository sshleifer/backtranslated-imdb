I see what this film intends to do. Unfortunately, it just never finishes the deal. The reality crime aspect works well and the footage is the first. In fact, several scenes are incredibly evocative in a moody manner. Especially the detective storyline spoke to a defeated woman, a scene of detectives going through rubbish, and a father who bound flies. Occasionally several scenes break in too much dialogue. Instead of seeing the viewer, the viewer treats him too much like a book. But the real problem lies in adjustments. The story does not happen. It will not allow the whole to get out of the sum of the parts. In the end you are confused about what is happening. Those who like this kind of detective film like to follow, put together puzzles together with the main characters. With such poor editing it is difficult, if not nearly impossible.
