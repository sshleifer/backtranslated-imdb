I loved the Millennium series played by Lance Henriksen and that's why I bought the movie. Apparently at some level it was a mistake. Mutant / monster films are usually very bad and this film is no exception. The basic idea itself is not entirely rated as unsuccessful (but this movie would never be successful, even with a good director) and actors, but the way it turns out is just a class B movie The scenes to be scary seem to be more fun, and the creature is not at all trustworthy. However, this movie with a group of friends in a turbulent mood is watching this film as such. unintentionally cheerful.
