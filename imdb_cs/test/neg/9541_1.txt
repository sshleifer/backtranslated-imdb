If a copy of this film fell into the wrong hands, the world would be in serious danger. I'm a huge fan of "B" movies, and I've seen my share of the bad, but the alphabet isn't a letter that could adequately describe this disheveled piece of solidified blisters. This movie even surpasses "so bad that it's a good" phase and goes straight to "so bad that your world will seem a little less meaningful to watch" in the stage. It's hard to say what's more worrying: .1. The fact that the people who wrote it thought they were their political satire (I use the term very, very, very loosely) was so funny that the movie .2. They were able to find as many other people as they agreed to work with them, apparently little or no money. The fact that someone thought it would be good to choose this crap for distribution on a horror anthology DVD. If I were a weaker man, I most likely stuck a spoonful of grapefruit in my eyes and then blindly threw myself to death in oncoming traffic after watching this. But as I stand, I live, but I am forever scarred by experience.
