I watched this movie and turned it off because it started playing about 1 hour ago, and I have to say it's an hour of my life wasted and not going back, acting is stupid and the scripts need a serious look at and whoever is he wrote, he has to be slapped, maybe the TV will explode and tear me out of my misery ..... The only good thing about this movie is that it has a good eye candy in it for boys and girls. , most of them would like to disappear when it comes to film, special effects like sh * t, Dante? who thinks a guy dressed in leather tight leather pants and a half leather jacket is scary, looks more feminine than most women in this movie, the voice of dante is pathetic, nobody threatens it or scary at all .... please tv please blow up do povětří !!!!!!!!!!
