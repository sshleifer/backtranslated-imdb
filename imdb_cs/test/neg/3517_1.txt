This film is a very bad example of an uninspired narrative that tries to hide behind the facade of "artfilm" and tries to shock the audience with unmotivated violence (against women) to hide the lack of psychological depth of characters and internal conflicts. Everything in this movie is opulent, thanks to Bela tarr, through photography, acting, music, story and editing. When you are suddenly, unreasonably, forced to watch close-ups of "charismatic" hunters looking for Hungarian rural people on your ships, while the soundtrack is trying to convince you that this is a dramatic moment, even if they are just on the road. For the burial of a local alcoholic, that's one thing. Putting totally unmotivated rape scenes as a shock is another thing for which I have absolutely no understanding. This film is really hard to enter into a particular genre of artistic (East European dramatic) films, but it lacks the subtlety, observation skills and "soul" that other directors have.
