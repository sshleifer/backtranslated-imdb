This late effort Fredy plays as a modern day (that's a 70 year old) gothic thriller, but comes shortly with excitement. Definitely not a terribly bad movie, it's a jut that feels that many of Freda's later movies have someone who gave up when he saw the first day. It starts pretty well, almost giallo like in tone, then it turns into gothic territory with a decent (albeit terribly clich√©) set. Then suddenly, Fred seems to have lost interest in the film, and all we get is an extended shot of Camille Keaton and burning candles. Then, in about an hour, we get some violent climax with decent special effects. This is followed by a slow pace with a very obvious twist of the end (if even intended as a twist?). And along the way throw a few very ominous explanatory scenes and you have a Tragic Ceremony. So in some parts it has its qualities. But then he suddenly stumbles and collapses before you. Damage. btw stay away from SHAROMA DVD, a useless murky pan & scan release that kills what could be a good visual experience.
