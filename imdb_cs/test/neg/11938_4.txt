I really wanted to love this movie, not just because it had Aaron Eckhart in it, but I thought the assumption would be cool because I enjoy movies and shows that revolves around the chefs. Cinematography was good, but besides revolving around cooks, everything else is just a clich√©. Oh and little Miss Sunshine was very uncomfortable in this movie, though Abigail Breslin seems to be a bit irritating in every movie because she plays a lot of roles where she is. This has some decent flashes of cooking, but the food really didn't play a big part in the movie than I expected, which was a big disappointment for me. This film had some good potential, the cast was great, but they had very little work. I like the good light romantic comedy, but this was only bland. And longer than it should be because it was much longer than it was. It's not a horrible video, there's nothing missing in not seeing this movie. <br /> <br /> 4.5 / 10
