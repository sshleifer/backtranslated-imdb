I hated the first movie is really boring and we just see Octopus at the end. The Land of Dead Bodies is located in New York Harbor. The police have no trace or suspicion until Nick and his colleague realize that the killer is a giant squid. Everyone, especially a police captain, refuses to believe Nick's story, and soon the harbor will be filled with boats for July 4th celebrations ... good that it's time. <br /> <br /> Acting is this movie not bad, but not very big, but fine and able to watch. These are some really cheese scenes for the movie, but if you do, you should enjoy the rest of the movie. <br/> 5/10
