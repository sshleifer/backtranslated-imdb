The box completely distorts itself for this film. The cover shows a look at the legs and panties in a short skirt. The title is `Tart '. The synopsis on the back of the box seemed like Cat, the main character, was an outcast who became one of the popular students, but the popularity led to a bizarre lifestyle she couldn't escape. Everything that this box had built was a terrible lie. I was expecting some sort of miserable version of the "Heathers" video that targets today's teenagers. Yes, this is really a plot; So if you don't want to know what happens, stop reading. We have one unlikable, boring rich girl. The best friend of this harsh girl is the skank. Skank gets expelled from school so unlikable girl befriends with some British girl. This leads to an unlikable girl dating this boring guy who box refers to "the most popular boy at school." If this guy was the favorite guy in their school, I wish I went to high school because I could kick him off. Just as any movie tells you, the most popular guy in school is always the killer or the addict or the thief, or in this case, all of the above. Anyway, everybody ends up with a flattering main character because he's Jewish. Then the most popular guy in the school beats his best friend, the skank, to death with rock because the skank caught the most popular boy in a homosexual act. The stoic mother unlikable girls and the younger hypochondriac brother are there for her at the end. Oh, and the whole movie is about how kids and their terrible parents are stupid too. Gee, what's wrong with that? That sounds like a fantastic movie! That is what I thought. But you see, there are no nice characters in this movie. The main character is boring. The directors made her average, while during the film she still spills out what a madman is. Skank is not enough skank and has little time on screen. A popular boy is nothing to write about. Popular girls are just your run-of-the-mill rich girls. There are no moral lessons. A cat, a boring main character, not a madman, will never become one of the really popular girls, and (worst of all) after all he goes through, he thinks he's still too good to be the girlfriend of a single sweet girl . To be honest, I have no idea why the film is called Tart. I asked who was the cake? Is it a pie? Are they all cakes? For 94 minutes, theoretically this is not a long film. But after I actually watched this terrible waste of VHS tape and didn't know who the cake was, I was surprised that the film was only an hour and a half. The film felt like it was two hours and a change. After a while, I was hoping the movie would be about pop kids. At the very least, if you look at the box of pop cakes, you know what to expect.
