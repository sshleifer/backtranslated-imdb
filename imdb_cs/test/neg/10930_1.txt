This movie is by far the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The woman "EX" pretends to be a number of people to gain access to her former husband. Killing people for nothing in the spa to reach her goal. Women I don't think they ever went to school. Just the whole movie does such silly expressions and it looks like it's trying the hardest to avoid looking into the camera. In most cases, not. She makes friends with wife and son Ex Husband, doing it to use them against her husband. Initially, when you look at this movie, you think "Ex" wants to kill his ex-husband, maybe because he treated her badly. But in fact, women are obsessed with a man and want him back. Both of them enjoyed a lot of fun (of course using whips). My advice to the general public does not buy this movie, do not rent this movie and do not look at it like me (at 15:00 on FOX)
