Killer Flood: The Day of Damn Broke: 1/10: Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof. Even thanks to the low standards of catastrophic films, let me fix myself, also thanks to the low standards for movies from television disasters. Where should I start? The dam model may have seen the dam's photo once, but I doubt it. Most of the dams, especially those that produce electricity, have oh. I don't know the nearby power plant, some water gate gates that could pass, damn even a high voltage electric wire. The dam is also somewhat inadequate. Two, count, two employees of the entire dam, all three shifts. Employees were apparently imported from two clich√©s that took place in two world wars, because they heroically and rather unnecessarily outraged the deadly scenes supplemented by photographs of grandchildren. One of them can shoot the dam itself in a way that defies the description. Special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on a photo of the city by a method that makes the 1960s Godzilla Matrix-like movie. A three-year drawing with a blue crayon on a film composition would produce better results. Since the money is unfortunate, how is the rest of the movie? Needless to say, the scenario and gameplay are followed by special effects. This is not a rough diamond. That's rough. So it's a guilty pleasure? Killer Flood is terrible enough to generate some laughter, and the film itself has such a serious incompetence that makes good cult classics, but bad catastrophic films must age as fine wine. (Avalanche, The Swarm, Meteor) It is also doubtful that Michelle Green, who is hiding from floods in the Golden Retriever's bin, will sometimes match the great Henry Fonda, who is hanging out with raisins to be deadly bees. Look with me in 2024.
