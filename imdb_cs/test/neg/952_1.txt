This show is what happened to Screen Savers after the G4 got its hands on it, taking it from a useful source of information about the computer to a show that had as its highest point of pushing a miniature web server up to someone's posterior. Since G4 ratings have fallen, they have moved from their original target groups, generic hormone-driven young men, who added eye candy to workers and the sex counseling segment. Now even the players applauding the show are turning away at first. I look forward to the show and the net, the overdue and deserved demise.
