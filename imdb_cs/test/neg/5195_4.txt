If I knew what I was presenting, I'd run away from the theater. The film is terrible, in the literal sense of the word. Despite remarkable images, places of interest and a subject that may have been fascinating, the film is dead. With this period of Greek history I was not familiar and am ready to experience a great movie. The creators hand is heavy. it is not enough to see the train going; we have to look at it from a distance, we have to look at it by car, we have to see the smoke, we have to see that it slows down and we have to stop it. The director's approach is didactic. Likewise, the characters they create never develop, they never change. Are they so stereotypical that we wonder that they should all be? Every girl? Everyoldmusician? Is there any reference to this allegory? It's the most striking movie I've seen in a long time.
