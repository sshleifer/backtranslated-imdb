It sounded like it was like the silence of a lamb or a zodiac or something, but not. It was more like one of the Halloween movies without any jump scenes. It was a bit like Plan 9 from outside, in the sense that the main evil man was still making early speeches that made me want to go out for a snack without pushing a break. The idea of ​​a man who is so mad to kidnap people and torture them as a form of spiritual enlightenment is actually an interesting idea, but execution was too much for television. I have to say it was better than waiting for a movie written and played by Dee Snider. Good first effort. He might learn some lessons and his other efforts would be less clumsy.
