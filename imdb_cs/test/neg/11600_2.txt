First: warning. <br /> <br /> I recently saw this movie on the DVD in the Universal 'Hitchcock Collection'. The source print looks immaculate, but the image is a bit soft, suggesting it could be a second generation copy from the video. Framing is too tight, so all the songs are terrible. The movie title is also trimmed. I will gather from other IMDb reviews that a much better version is available. Mr and Mrs Smith is just a footnote to Hitchcock's career. In his long talks with Francois Truffaut in the 1960s, Hitchcock provided a comprehensive overview of his entire work, but he could say about this picture that he did it as a favor of Carole Lombard and that he didn't understand the characters he was just making the script Norman Krasny. In truth, there is not much more to be said. It's a comedy that takes place from the same form as it happened at night, His girl Friday and the story of Philapdelphia. Carole Lombard is typically a feisty wife who learns that her marriage is technically invalid, falls out with her husband on the weakest pretexts and spends most of the image 'adorable' inadequate. Robert Montgomery does It is good enough to wear her husband, but it is hard to lose patience with him. Long before the end of the movie, viewers say, "throwing out a stupid cow, not worth it." Gene Raymond plays the best friend he's dealing with. It is believed to be Southerner's 'old family' court, although it is not obvious from his accent, and is only manifested in a drunken scene (which he plays very well otherwise). He is an honest, generous, smooth gentleman, so he is, of course, bullied and sponsored by Robert Montgomery and has done a lot of jokes - though not as badly treated as a similar character to Ralph Bellamy at His Friday Piece. Br /> <br /> This film feels like it was created by people who knew only about comedies that consist of rumors, but didn't really see it. For example, a good comic comic game has a strong central idea with a series of continuing comic threads that constantly blend and overlap. Here, all the comedy elements are pulled out like beads on a necklace. This is a screw comedy by numbers. It is the same with the direction. Typically, these comedies race together at an ever-increasing pace that rises to almost hysteria to the end. Hitchcock won't get it. Its direction is somewhat lethargic, and the image becomes a spectacular sequence of scenes that seem somewhat overwritten (but malnourished) and slightly long. He has never been a particularly good actor director, so he just left it. They do it well. Hitchcock had a good sense of humor he often used in his thrillers, but he didn't have a comedy like a genre. His later troubles with Harry were also a mistake in ignition, for similar reasons to this movie, but at least he got involved in the picture. Here's the movement. <br /> <br /> All the people who are associated with this film were good experts, so it's not particularly bad. It's just a little derivation, overly known, too long, and rather flat. Mr and Mrs Smith are only once for Carole Lombard and Hitchcock fans.
