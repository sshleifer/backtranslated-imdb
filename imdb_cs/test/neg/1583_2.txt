OK, what was this story about again? I'm afraid I've never read the book and, frankly, it was one of the most confused movies I've been trying to watch for a long time. I have a little confused number of memories between a sister, a patient, and a man without a thumb. The film didn't even explain what they were looking for in the desert until they found it; or even how in the world everyone knew each other to meet. After a recent look at "Pride and Prejudice" with Colin Firth, I tried to make a study of his film career. Watching other movies of his, and recklessly, other than "What the Girl Wants" I'm not much to find where he played in it was good. I'm definitely not saying that HE was not good. She is indeed one of the best actors I have seen in modern film, but the content and quality of the films she plays has many wishes. "An English Patient" is another perfect example of where a director, writer, and crew are too close to their subject to see the viewer not getting the picture? literally. The whole movie seemed to show off Ralph Fiennes as a dramatic actor with long periods of emotion that was boring. Nothing is really explained and every subject needs a psychoanalytic evaluation from the beginning! It seems that the character of Kristin Scott Thomas enjoys a description of erotic stories that stand in front of a totally male audience and the irritation of other men than her husband; Colin Firth, who plays his husband, doesn't have to have all his balls in place and is supposed to be a secret agent? I guess; and Ralph Fiennes walks like Roman Mr. Darcy (sorry Colin!) who thinks he knows all this. The rest of the cast is cast (pun intended) for four winds as the plot roams. The nurse's mental stability sub-plot (Juliette Binoche) and her motives and involvement with Naveen Andrews is another confusing element that leaves the viewer a disgusting taste. But, of course, the viewer is still wondering how the first two characters (Thomas and Fiennes) ended up in the world as well as in the world. What was the attraction? There was no chemistry and no buildup. Just slap, boom, thank you! And isn't it romantic that Fiennes ended up a traitor who helped the Germans by putting them in the desert? (sarcasm) <br /> <br /> To describe this film, I would simply say, "How to impress your gynecologist with mammograms and cheat on your sweet, lovely husband who loves you." The last incredible part of this plot is to understand how someone would choose Ralph Fiennes over Colin Firth. Firth had a very small opportunity to show one of his acting talents? in fact, when I watched the movie, I thought it had to be one of his first. The scene he'd been waiting for his wife all night was just two second clips worth seeing in the movie. In that, I'm not interested in watching it again. <br /> <br /> The best scene I liked was an air accident where Firth was trying to pull them all out. Too bad he missed! It would save another twenty minutes more of a barren movie. However, the desert desert scenes were nicely decorated.
