You don't have to believe it, but when the credits of this movie turned, I was looking for a director's name. When I saw it, I burned it and never forgot it. This movie is out of horror. It makes Ed Wood's films look like Orsen Welles. At least B movies are fun, it was the soul experience. The quality was so bad, I wondered who allowed it. I heard Uwe Boll runs fourteen miles a day. This is because wherever his films are viewed, the city's people must fire him with a pitchfork. The screenplay was terrible, the lighting was the same as high school football, and the cinematography was just over the quality of Bigfoot Roger Patterson's video. Acting was executed by people who were too embarrassed to have any trust in their production. Finally, there was a movie that Alan Smithee wouldn't want to give his name to. That day I learned to avoid any man's film despite the circumstances. It's not a bad thing from what I've heard.
