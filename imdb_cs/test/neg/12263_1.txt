I'm not prone to ranting and my expectations were low to start, but how did it look like a good idea? Just because you have a camera, some big ugly friends of actors and delusions of talent doesn't mean you should go out and make a movie. This was supposed to be the film equivalent of the singing in the shower, that is, it should never have seen the light of day. However, in some way this waste found a distributor who helped him escape from 3 to 4 feet. It goes from bad to worse. We're talking about a low budget, one scene of torture consists of a guy who throws a cup of coffee at him when he is tied to a chair. Apparently it's very painful because a big baby goes on screaming in agony .... maybe he ordered decaffeinated !! Playing is worse than wooden (I could watch a tree for 30 seconds before I get bored if you can look at this waste for so long that you are a better man than me!) And the battle scenes will be at the nursery playroom. Do not touch this film if you do not like pain (in which case you should try to pour out lukewarm coffee over yourself). I'd like to say it's so bad, but it's really awful.
