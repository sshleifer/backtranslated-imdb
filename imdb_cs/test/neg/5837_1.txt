I like science fiction films and even, with low ratings, made for television, bargaining, movies that I could still find interesting. Well, I found this in the store and brought it as a selection for a movie night with a group of friends. <br /> <br /> I was, literally, * emabrrassed * that I brought this movie. Right from the start, acting is bad, the story is dim and the story is almost non-existent. All this leads directly to what the movie really was: Soft core porn graphic film. The film began with a women's prison where all the sexy women working in mine are in prison. First mention that this film is NOT serious: attractive women in prison are forced to do physical work. Yeah, right! It does not matter. When P continued, he was overshadowed by the absurd scenes of people who have sex. In the middle of the movie I stopped watching with my friends, it was so stupid. The next day I thought I'd give the film another chance and watch the rest. I watched for another 15 minutes and surrendered again. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a decent, science fiction or even science fiction monster, DO NOT LOOK Lethal Target! If you want to see a low-budget, soft-core that is light on your desktop, then you'll see a Deadly Target.
