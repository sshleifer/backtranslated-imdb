This film was woefully terrible. The sound was terrible, the action was ridiculous, and the effects were sick. If you have a life you don't see this movie because you will want to kill it. This film will be totally out of Blade (which is undoubtedly a really good movie ... or a trilogy I should say). I watched for 10 minutes and had to come to my computer and comment on how bad this movie is. I don't really know why my family is still watching ... oh wait, yes. They laugh almost non-stop at silly action, dialogue, and acting.
