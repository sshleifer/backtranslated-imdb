I don't think I can add much more to what has been said about this movie. But I can offer a little memory of seeing ST-V in the theater. In the last (terrible) scene, as the camera pulls out of the campsite and it seems likely that the credits will start at any moment, the viewers seemed to rise. Normally for a movie like this, at least-some-hard fans stay to watch until the final disclaimer. As people registered, I remember not hearing any laughter and funny joking, just low whispers. fans would like it. What kind of idiot is that. The biggest fans have discouraged them from the fans first! Favorite Worst Scene: Target shooting on Voyager, via periscope! The space must be much smaller than we thought.
