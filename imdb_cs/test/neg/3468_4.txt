'Leatherheads' is trying so hard. He's trying to be light. He's trying to be a comedy. They're trying to be a love affair. Let's try to be 'His Girl Friday' through 'Sting' way 'It Happened One Night' through a dozen sports movies. Unfortunately, the effort is not made and the film is as dirty as the last playing field. A movie fan would watch a big battle scene in the bulldog talkeas Duluth and a few soldiers and realize that the fights John Ford introduced with such style and verve and humor in movies like "The Quiet Man" or "Donovan's Reef" or "The Searchers" might seem easy, but apparently not. I bet George Clooney thought John Ford would be easy. How hard it could have been: masculine running amok, punches, bottles broken overhead, intact pianist ... just put it on the screen with some action. Excuse me. It takes a master to make a combat scene flow. Movies are not a wish to exist. Humor is tough. Romance is difficult. Slapstick about lost art. Once I read that you never want to sit too close to a ballet show. Something about not wanting to tear down the fantastic performance bubble by blowing dancers' feet or snarling the cable cars. This movie is such that ... all the tensions and good intentions, handsome actors, nice sets, but it beats through its steps rather than galloping like the original Galloping Ghost, which Red Grange movie is loosely based on.
