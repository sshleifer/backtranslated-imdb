If you go through this movie without loudly mocking the screen, you're a better film director than me. <br /> <br /> Calculate logical downtime, common sense jumps, and credibility ... more than two hands! PS: If one more movie uses a place that is clearly UCLA and claims to be another university (in this case: Berkeley), I lose it.
