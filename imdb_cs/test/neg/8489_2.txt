I liked this movie, not good, but the worst I've ever done. Though everyone else is saying it's one of the worst movies ever made, I thought it was all right. There are plenty of immature jokes. Sometimes he wants to be funny but fails. The story is OKAY. It can be a little hard to follow for a younger audience, though. Acting is pretty bad. Jamie Kennedy is the worst actor. Sometimes it is even ridiculous. Alan Cumming is probably the best actor. He is funny when he is supposed to be, but some of his lines are terrible. Oh, and the main bad thing about this movie that I hated was Tim Avery's voice when he was obsessed with the mask. The voice is HORRIBLE. Also the scenes in which they are are so unbearable that they are almost unbearable. I'm sure they could cut it out and not affect the movie. <br /> <br /> You can live in general without seeing it. It's a nice movie to watch if you have nothing else to watch, though. They could certainly leave without continuing, but it's a decent effort. 4/10
