SPOILERS <br /> <br /> This movie was rented as a joke and what a joke it was. The film is based on a dog trap that is looking for El Chupacabra. Dog clothes are so ridiculous. It looks like he was sewing a patch on his hat and for some reason showing his "muscles" by rolling up his sleeves. During the movie, mostly at night, you can see how bad the lighting was. They're in a car that is brightly lit and black in the dark. You can often see the shadow of a camera man on the ground. Costumes are terrible, lighting is terrible and acting is terrible. That's a good movie for laughter ... maybe.
