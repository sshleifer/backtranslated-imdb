The art student in Rome is obsessed ... or something. She has dreams of being nailed to the cross and Satan rapes her. She has it (I think) and turns it into a drug addict. That's probably all I could take and turn it off. An unthinkable "Exorcist" jerked. I caught it on the cable in the 80s and was horrified ... and not in a good way! This film is supposed to be a horror movie, but it turns into nothing more than a sexual film that is disguised as a horror movie. There's a lot of useless female nudity and the actress playing lead has to degrade more than once. We see her being raped by Satan (a hot guy), masturbating, coming to her own father ... I have to give her points for bravery. Add to this a bad dubbing, cut (rape scene seems to have been a little cut), lousy acting and a story that doesn't make sense. One of the disturbing sequences (nailing it to the cross) ALMOST works, but the miserable "special" effects destroy it. This is one of the few horrors that was so bad that I stopped watching. Skip it.
