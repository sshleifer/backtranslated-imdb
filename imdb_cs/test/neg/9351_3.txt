A long time ago, in the galaxy far, far away (familiar), water has become the rarest commodity (it must sound good) and a small minority controls its distribution (which is a surprise, it only has a heart attack and dies of surprise). A group of ice pirates (water apostates? Wet bandits? ... oh wait, the last one was used) try to find a way to the legendary unlimited supply of water with a beautiful, but corrupt (Druish?) Princess. and a group of idiots - despicable villains in pursuit. This movie has the potential to be a really great comedy parody ("Star Wars," David Lynch "Dune"), but it was just not properly processed. That's right, I believe the term is "humor". It's not really succeeding in the fact that it's all funny, which is a shame because it has Angelica Houston, Ron Perlman and Robert Urich, (hence three stars) who are not exactly slackers in the acting department. <br /> <br /> Certainly a rental shop and you definitely drink straight up.
