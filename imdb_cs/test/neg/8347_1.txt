The Story of Volcano Eruption Center L.A. sounds like a nice plot for a movie disaster. But this is a missed bigtime. The film looks chaotic, has a story that is hard to watch or believe, and acting was very bad. Im consistent with many comments that Lee Jones is just good at bossing people around as a boss in a particular area. He's in the emergency room in this. Being chief of such an office is naturally a good idea to bring your daughter to dangerous scenes. Smart thinking. Ann Heche touches the walls and walks in tunnels that predict 678 degrees Fahrenheit. Yes correct. In addition to bad behavior, these factual mistakes make the film look almost as stupid as Armageddon. The only good point of this movie is that there is no Ben Affleck to make things worse. Avoid this movie at all costs.
