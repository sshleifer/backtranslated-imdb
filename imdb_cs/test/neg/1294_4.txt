After the huge disaster movies in America, such as The Day After Tomorrow and Deep Impact, it was refreshing to see something on a smaller scale, such as Flood. They are mainly used by unknown actors and actresses, and in fact they focus on England. was a welcome change to the pace to see the Empire State Building that was destroyed. However, it is not a strong movie on any basis. While it is quite shocking to see all your favorite London landmarks are destroyed by a very fake CGI storm surge, the flood does not really deliver on anything else. Performances are bland, being rescued from the pit of hell by David Suchet and his refreshing calm performance as Deputy Chairman. He might be a little quieter on what's going on in the movie, all the fake water was flying around in London had to be quite angry. It is understandable that the effects will not be as good as TDAT and DI, but CGI was at best average. Bland, disappointed and sometimes tiring. Watch it if you have to, but watch something else.
