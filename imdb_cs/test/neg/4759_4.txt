The ridiculous comedy that gave an arm. I like one of the notes here: "Can't do today". Well, he couldn't "The Philadelphia Story" without chasing a car or two. But does this mean that the image is worse for wear and that it is old-fashioned? I don't think "Susan slept here" was good for every generation and it should be quiet in the memories of Debbie Reynolds enthusiasts. There is no spark in this story of a writer who plunges into a much younger girl for "screenplay research". Dick Powell makes his farewell screen look in what he had to be embarrassed for him. Reynolds is empty. Produced by one Harriet Parsons - who gives her famous mother Louella a number of inane plugs. * 1/2 from ****
