Like the jungle beauty, Jessica Alba is a wonderful smile and sensuality looks over the movie, but unfortunately they are the only two things worth watching this movie for. Theoretically, we should follow the story. The plot is thin and hard to believe on earth. As beautiful as Jessica Alba, she does not add any of the sparks she has made to the credible "Dark Angel" series. Since Dark Angel seems to have Alba been reduced to a mere eye candy (but what an eye candy!), And is the only reason for putting it in movies. The sleeping concept of a dictionary is a daft and unlikely, with little character development (or a character that matters) to make us take 109 minutes to run with this world. Despite the short film times, she still feels too long and strenuous. It seems a pity that a talent like Brenda Blethyn, Emily Mortimer, Bob Hoskins, is wasted on a straightened story. barely picks up a pulse. This film really escapes the trick, exotic environment, more than capable of casting, beautiful cinema and the chance to use themes and dualistic concepts of "civilization". But there is little narration, no drama, no sense that we follow a love story, more a lust story and women who are happy to please people without a doubt. Let's be honest, if Jessica Alba allowed you to sleep with her, do you think you could focus on learning a tribal language? Therein lies a big problem, both in suspending distrust and in what constraints are limited and limited. For example, consider the fact that Jessica's album will undergo the mental and physical suffering of pregnancy and the birth of her forbidden love, but all we see is her graceful and tortuous minute, then beautiful and crooked, with her baby, the next. br /> <br /> I'm sorry that the movie with the promise will not appear near its potential. I could write endlessly film flaws, but it bothers me. The film looks good, the assumption could be made in a beautiful movie, but unfortunately it shouldn't have been.
