It's a great movie for kids. It just sucks for the family. I really hoped for something like Goonies, which is a great movie for all ages. This film was just too focused on children with a silly script and characters who call each other little names like booger breaths. ??? But Alan Cummings was pleased. And why do people compare Willy Wonka to this movie ... just because there's some thematic song that is very similar to Willy Wonka's song that doesn't make this movie like Willy Wonka.
