Wrong, badly written, and badly directed. Special effects are cheap. Best performance is Yvette Napir, but it doesn't say much. The story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to space station sabotage and an attempt to save those who are stuck on board. There is little tension and even less action. There's a hound that's not bad, but the rest of the movie is just a waste of time.
