Another sadistic and ultra-sleazy late 70 / 80s revenge movie? Wes Craven certainly launched a popular trend with his "last house on the left" though "Terror Express" is more like rip-off other rip-offs, like "I Spit on Your Grave" and especially "Night Train Murder". This story has absolutely nothing new to director Ferdinand Baldi. This is actually just a soft core porn movie that gets a little rough over. On a night train from Rome there are three hopelessly imbecile losers running amok. They provoke male travelers and sexually harass women. Things get a little out of control and the convicted passenger comes to rescue a prostitute who is still fine. This is a very tame movie and there wasn't even enough budget to buy several bags of fake blood. This type of movies is generally infamous for brutal rape sequences and discriminatory behavior towards women, but sex in "Terror Express" is not disturbing at all. On the contrary, these "rapists" spend more time with the oral pleasure of their victims, and then they come together! Music is great, the dialogues are unintentionally merry and the characters are the ridiculous ones I've ever seen. Demons are wolves and train passengers are so motionless that they look like part of a set. If you like your exploitation as it goes, it's your movie. However, your hunger for blood and controversy will definitely not be stopped. "Terror Express" should be in porn videos.
