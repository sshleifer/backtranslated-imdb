Norman Wisdom's final car was leaving his previous trips? bringing his accident-prone milquetoast up-to-date, this is the product of Swinging Sixties! The end result is an unpleasant and sometimes embarrassing comedy that mixes the typical star grotesque (and sentiment) with mild sexuality and even milder satire; the plot has to do with a manager on the way for a bank conference falling for teenager Sally Geeson (who doesn't mind getting into it with him but doesn't take their relationship all seriously either); Sarah Atkinson appears as Geeson's friend, who warns Norman of her blatant figure. The film is not nearly as bad as Leonard Maltin's BOMB rating, and if anything, is interesting for his middle-aged treatment. life crisis (being in many ways similar to Hoffman [1970] and 10 [1979] oba both of them, by the way, I was just watching); in the end, Norman even tries to bring his wife to a new way of thinking! Nice things seem to be doing a lot of good tunes in the nightclub and Norm alone sings a catchy title track!
