Well, I think I know the answer to this question. For money! We were so bombarded with Cat In The Hat and the goods we're almost convinced must have something good in this movie. I confess, I thought the trailers looked bad, but I still had to give it a chance. I should have gone with the instincts. It was a complete piece of Hollywood waste. Again, to prove that the average person can be programmed to believe anything he says is good, he must be good. In addition to the insulting fact that the film is only about 80 minutes long, it obviously started with the moths to eat one script. It is crowded with unsuccessful attempts at senseless humor and terrible pastel scenes. Jumps across the universe with no goal or direction. It is then composed with, ............................ yes I will say it, BAD ACTING! I couldn't help but feel like I was watching "Coffee Talk" on SNL every time Mike Myers opened his mouth. Should Cat Be a Middle Age Jewish Woman? Spencer Breslin and Dakota Fanning were also worthless, but Mr. Myers would have somewhere to disappear under the rock until he was ready to do another Austin Powers movie. F-, no stars, 0 on a scale of 1-10. Save your money!
