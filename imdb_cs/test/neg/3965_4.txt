The man is pulled from a London street and taken to a foreign country where he is tortured as a terror suspect. Dull, banal movie bored me. The idea then the movie. When I realized I had no idea who was on the screen, I was halfway into this movie. It was as if they took every other similar film and pulled out all the thoughts and placed them in one place without imagining a real idea of ​​the character. Certainly his good deal with passion, but there is no emotional center, there is only every kind of filmmaker feeling. It is not. And while the story introduced id in theory important as a movie warning is too boring to convince anyone of it, especially if someone has seen other, better movies similar to ilk (rendition with Reese Witherspoon for example)
