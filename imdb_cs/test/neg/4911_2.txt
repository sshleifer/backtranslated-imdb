weak direction, weak conspiracy, unimaginable music, wondering why Udita Goswami is first in the film world? She tried to uncover a lot of her talent (mostly skin), but she couldn't impress her. The music was not so impressive that only one song "Jhalak Dikhlajaa" was worth listening to. . Aksar, title? they tried well to justify the film's title at the end, but it didn't make sense .. <br /> <br /> there were many unwanted twists and turns in the story, which made it more boring. however, if someone is a fan of Dino Morea, go ahead and watch it.
