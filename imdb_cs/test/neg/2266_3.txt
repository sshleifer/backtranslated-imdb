As everyone knows, no one can play Scarlett O'Hara as Vivien Leigh and no one can play Rhett Butler as Clark Gable. All others pale in comparison, and Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whalley are not exceptions. One thing I couldn't get was that Joanne had BROWN eyes. The green eyes were the most distinctive feature of Scarlett's good looks, and those sequels were stripped of those. The film, like the book, had a few vacations there. The new characters were not so memorable that I forgot who they were. I felt as if her journey to Ireland had done nothing at all. It could only be 11 years, but I didn't see any change in her attitude until the last word, 10 minutes when Rhett told her she had grown up. If he didn't tell her, I never knew there was a change in her attitude. She really loved a cat, her baby. She likes this baby because she was with Rhett, her only beloved husband. However, if you read Gone With The Wind, you would see that children have no difference in Scarlett's world. Frankly, it seemed to me that there was too much without Rhett. It all cares if Rhett and Scarlett come back together, and Scarlett gets too long for it. It's virtually nothing compared to Gone With The Wind, but then again what isn't? If you read the novel, you will enjoy it better than the movie. I'd watch it just because it's a sequel to Gone With The Wind, no matter if it's worth it. This may not fully satisfy you, but it will be possible in some way.
