Othello is ready to burn the viewers' eyes of this movie. The bad portrayal of Shakespeare's characters and the terrible portrayal of Desi & John's love made this film a terrible dirt that's it. Othello, directed by Jeffery Saks, is far too great and cruel. Othello is a pitiful drama about love between John and Desi. Their mutual loyalty will be tested by his friend. In the opening scene of the film, it is clearly shown that the love between John and Desdemon is inseparable from the faith. A moment later, Ben Jago, John's boyfriend jumps to the screen and scares the audience and immediately tells them what a liar and a powerful hungry man is. This film was far worse than the Shakespeare novel itself. It has been said that it has a small amount of good parts. For example, the love that was shown between John and Desi, was depicted very well and it seemed that the couple were so inseparable; just as it was explained in the book. Although the love between them has been shown exceptionally well, she still hasn't shown jealousy that Othello was as good as he should be between Cass and Desi. Love, Jealousy, Scam, This film is based on all three main themes that were in Shakespeare's novel. But the novel really explains how it all happened much better than the film. For example, the conclusion of this story ends much more in the book than in the film. Much more detail is also included in the novel. That's why this film is so disappointing, believe me, those who read it will also disappoint him. In conclusion, this film was by far the most horrific depiction of a novel that has ever been revealed by mankind. By avoiding this movie, not only do viewers save two hours of their lives, but they also save an eye or two of the disgusting faces of Ben Jaga who jumps up on them.
