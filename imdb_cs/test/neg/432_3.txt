you will probably be very disappointed with this sequel that is not sequel.AWIL is a classic.but this movie is about as far from the classics as you can get.what joke.special effects that are not too strange, horrible dialogue, without acting. fast and unconvincing (not to mention the ephemeral), on which about a third of the film left.did mention that the story is less than lame.there should not in any way be a serious horror movie, but it's stupid to be funny in any good way . The rating currently (4.8 / 10) is too generous if you ask me for the American Werewolf in Paris: 3.5 / 10
