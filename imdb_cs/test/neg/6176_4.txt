After the success of The Wrestler (see my review), Mickey Rourke had this "gem" head right on the video. Each copy was rented for several months and I even heard some good buzz around it. A few months later I caught him in a film network and sat down to watch him. First of all ... one of the places in the movie (Walpole Island) is a place I regularly visited as a child because we lived very, very close to the reserve. Cool huh? This is the place where the cold ends with this bagpipe. I mean, the story is decent enough to force four, and even the direction isn't bad, but the performances are just terrible and totally ridiculous with some really wasted star power and Mickey $% # @ * &! Rourke plays native Canadian / American hitman?!?! What did they think in the Lord's name? Neither is native blood, and his attempt at a generic native accent made him even more ridiculous. They could go anywhere with this story ... could they hire an indigenous actor, or change Rourke's character, how about a white man raised by native parents? Instead they made Killshot a complete and complete joke. As you might have caught Mickey Rourke "stars" in Killshot, I use that term freely. I never really liked Rourke, although his Oscar performance was pretty decent. This shows and confirms my resistance to him. He looks bored, keeps bored, and his humble attempt at portraying Native borders on the insult I think. He does a decent cold-blooded murderer, but the story never explores his part, which is completely back to the story. Diane Lane, although well respected in Hollywood, turns into another drab performance. She had her moments, but generally she doesn't start in any performance. It seems to be great, but then, if it isn't, it's even more disappointing. Thomas Jane plays her protective husband. I always felt that Jane deserved a greater career than he did. I think he's got a blood star in his blood. Everyone said and did his performance in Killshot is not actually bad. He does not take things too far and is in a way hard and almost heroic. With him and Lane, he has a decent chemistry, but his character doesn't get much. I have absolutely no idea why Rosario Dawson A) made this film and B) had any character at all. Her character is absolutely useless and has no sense of conspiracy or story that would do any kind of performance that would be just as bad. I seldom saw a character that would be so incredibly useless. The only redeeming character and performance in this film is the one that Joseph Gordon-Levitt gave as a frightened mini killer who wants to contact Rourke's hitman. Gordon-Levitt is crazy and funny at the top and his character is actually engaging. If this film was entirely about him, it would be a smudge. It literally saves it from total stupidity. His performance is almost worth watching this drivel for. Oscar nominated director ... whoa wait? Yes, the director nominated for Oscar John Madden (I think a football coach could do a better job) helms this mess. In fact, I've never seen Shakespeare In Love, but I remember the critical response he received, and it surprised me because the direction in this movie and the characters was absolutely terrible. Screenwriter Hossein Amini did nothing I knew, but he seemed ready to write another movie, Jack Ryan, and I can't even imagine why they want it after this mess. I understand that it is based on a novel and I really hope that the novel is the world over this mess. A little action and some hockey attempt at the emotionally charged story of the hitman and his partner and the mess they've been involved in. there is no reason for you to go through this pain. I did it for you and I still feel the pain. 4/10
