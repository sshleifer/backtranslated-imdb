John Waters owes me 2 hours of life. In 1990, I saw how it was projected and I am still in pain. Not before or since I saw such a terrible piece of film waste on the screen. There is nothing positive about what I can say about this film. Acting - terrible; conspiracy - ridiculous; music - cruel. After the film, my friends and I asked for money back from the theater manager. He explained that since it was a free screening, he couldn't give us anything in return, no matter how much suffering we suffer. How Johnny Depp's career survived this trainwreck movie is someone guessing.
