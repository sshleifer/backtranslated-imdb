Edge of Madness is a story about a woman in 1800 who gets a hand picked up by a dirty Scotsman who can't keep his cock in his pants. It just happens that he has a younger brother who is rape and kills him, but constantly says it was an accident. This makes his wife go crazy, she gets a fallacy and she does fall because she loves George too much. As I said, this type of thing was done before. That's just more "artistic" because it's Canadian and it's an independent, low budget production with hardly known actors (except one boy from Lassie, yes, he's in it). I don't know if this was an Oscar bait, but it was definitely boring. And this is based on a 40-page story. Half of this story is incorporated into this film and I'm happy. Otherwise, I would have given birth. Unfortunately, I had to watch it in my Media Fundamentals class and I had a challenge. Read the story and compare and contrast with the movie. BORING. <br /> <br /> You know, it's harder to answer movie questions when you don't like the movie. Oh, I hope this is the last type of task I got with my class. For what was worth, Annie Herron was absolutely hot, she had a nice, soft ass and she liked the nude parts of the movie. <br /> <br/> 3/10 for boring, Oscar lures and graphic sexuality .. more nudity.
