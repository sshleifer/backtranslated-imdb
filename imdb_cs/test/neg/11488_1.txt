I'd like to say something else about this movie. I saw comments how beautiful Russia is and Russia's views are great. Hello guys it's not Russia it's Bulgaria more specific capital of Sofia. So this is not Russia, it's my country. About the film - well in Bulgaria, maybe in addition to the gray zone - all films by American directors are in one word terribly similar to this. It's a shame that Patrick Swayze has to play in such low budget films. Most actors are Bulgarians, but this film has no conspiracy that has no energy what I can say - a weak and boring film clich√© no more. Hey people remember that it's not Russia in fact it's Bulgaria.
