SPOILER - This movie deals with conspiracy and discusses the end. I hated this movie - mostly for political reasons, but also for moral and aesthetic reasons. Politically, this film has celebrated war and military technology - throwing things up. We are encouraged to cheer up when music grows and Afghans use our weapons to blow up Russians. And no American soldiers put life on the line - so it's a fun war. Aesthetically, there is no real human emotion in the film, only smug, privileged people are sarcastic, feel superior and do whatever they want, regardless of consequences. And speaking of the consequences, the film does just a few small hits on what led Afghan armed forces. I read an earlier draft of this scenario and ended September 9th - Charlie Wilson realized that things were terribly wrong. But that wouldn't let viewers feel good. That's a good movie about killing Russians. And I was sick.
