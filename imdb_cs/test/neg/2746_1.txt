I like basketball and this was an interesting movie. But in the first ten minutes of the movie, I knew it would be miserable. It was wrong and too slow. Moreover, it was very, very racist, sexist, anti-Semitic and homophobic. Sometimes putting in racial, ethnic and other types of curses has a sense, illustrating the bigotry that exists. There was no sense in this film of terrible fanaticism, and no one learned from what was said. The problem is that it was an adaptation of the game and a 1982 remake of the film, which dealt with the 1950s basketball team. Having this movie takes place earlier in time would make a little more sense. It wasn't about modern times, and writing was terrible. I don't know how the game was originally written, but I can't believe that any movie is so bad and hateful as this movie got on TV and video in 1999. It was disgusting. Don't waste your precious time on this.
