The first 10 minutes of the film makes fun of the sequel and pg-13 movies. These are two reasons why the film is so bad. They constantly refer to a movie called "Get Leo" which is a movie-in-a-movie version to get shorty. Every time you do it, you'll be really upset. Travolta is not very cool, not even Keitel. However, Rock and Vince Vaughn are cheerful. These are not the funny things you would expect in Elmore Leonard. If you haven't seen getting short, you'll probably be just fine. If you liked getting short, you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter. Wait for the DVD.
