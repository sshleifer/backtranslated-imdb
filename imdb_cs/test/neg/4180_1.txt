It must be one of those times when you come across a movie with a neat cover, my first impression, sweet, full moon, crows, a scarecrow that holds a scythe. OK my impression (I watched a scarecrow on TV a few weeks ago), perfect, nice slasher movie to start the evening. ................... wrong, absolutely wrong I think 5 minutes in that I took it, but I thought I wasted 3 $ on it so I did it Finished where the scarecrow is, No Im Guessing His Feet Fisherman Man Wearing Heavy Rain Boots. you see it so often. I watched this thinking .... OK, when these brats get into this guy, I thought in one place they died. but no .... I mean frig, their still alive. I just laughed at a few reasons for how bad it was. one was at the beginning of the approach. the director / actor / writer says, "Remember, I had the feeling, but I have it again" and it was either zooming in or out, checking back to hell. but I think the scene was supposed to be shocking, I think the more shocking his wife has had the same shocked look .... OK ... believed him? I'm sorry but YEAH .... I didn't know she was psychic until I read the movie box to make some sense of what I was witnessing. Not only did they use pictures to make you think this movie is at least clear. another thing that made me laugh a little was shouting in the camera to be scary ....... OK ............. .. shooting girl close up shouting into the camera for 5 minutes ....... the truth ..... I laughed at the causes of these kids being unable to behave like other people in the movie. Br /> <br /> At the top things of the scythe must have lost or something ... The cause seems to mean a bad guy had just a cane. there is no ax, somebody should ax the dam to produce a movie <br /> <br /> Don't fall into the picture, this movie is a sh * t. I watched the trailer and guess what it has <br /> <br /> GIRLS, THAT YOU THINK ON ME AND CORN
