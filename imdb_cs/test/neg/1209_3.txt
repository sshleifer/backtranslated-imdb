It's hard to believe that a film that was bad wasn't made once but four times! Most movies require some "suspension of reality" to enjoy, but this takes too far. The basic scenario is the Air Force pilot who is shot down over the Middle East. The US government dragged its legs to recover it, which led the Doug's son (Doug Masters) to try a rescue mission. The problem I have with the film is that it captures the US Air Force as one colossal joke. In the film you will find that Doug and his friends at the air base managed to secure two F-16s, all ammunition, fuel, Intel for the mission, and so on. Safety at this base seems to be a joke. No one seems to have a problem that a 16-year-old is fully qualified to fly the F-16! <br /> <br /> If that's not enough, you'd think manufacturers would at least try to get the ammunition right because people liked to see things throw away. It is not so! Several times in the movie, Doug fires AIM-9 rockets on ground targets. AIM stands for "Air Intercept Missile", meaning that the weapon used to attack targets in the air. He also fires 15-20 missiles, where the maximum F-16 can hold them 6 AIM-9's. The film also lacks continuity. You will see a plane configured with one set of ammunition and another scene with a completely different ammunition package. Also, 20MM does not just completely destroy anything it touches! The F-16 will hold 500 rounds of 20MM, and it is mostly used for self-defense. I could go forever with conspiracy holes, flaws and absolutely bad movie information, but I won't hate you. If you're in the mood to see a good Air Force movie, your choices are rather slim. Most military films deal with either the Army, the Navy, or the Marines. Until Hollywood comes up with the Air Force movie "Saving Private Ryan" or "A Few Good Men", we're going to have to watch movies like "Iron Eagle". <br /> <br />
