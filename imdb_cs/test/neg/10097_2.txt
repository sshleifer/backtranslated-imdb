Eric Roberts "Stars" in this Tommy Lee Thomas debut film. He plays the leader of the corrupt ring of guards. Though evil according to the standards of most people, its character is the kind of guy who is pretty nice to give you supportive wires while you hang chained to the ceiling when you are tortured by electrical prods "Lethal Weapon". The film has an intricate plot about prison corruption that makes no sense. Thomas's Clint Eastwood's squinter eyes, Dolph Lundgren's one-liners, JCVD's acting skills and the body of the smallest guy you know at school who took steroids after graduation. Martin "Cobra Kai" Kove's career shares this low point with Roberts, in the movie it's hard to tell whether Kove's character is drunk for the whole movie, or if Kove just came up like that. I couldn't blame him if he did. Fortunately for everyone involved, this movie has "so bad it's good" quality that can be fun if you have nothing better to do than do.
