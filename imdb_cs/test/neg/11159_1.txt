Let's summarize how this film is with two details: Arnold Antichrist: "Let's see who's the worst" he said with a straight face. And you can say he's not trying to be funny. <br /> <br /> How do you think Arnold will fight the evil of all evil? Blessed Water, Cross, Priest. .nooo! with a bazooka, yes, nor did Satan expect them to be so smart. After the beginning (which reminds you of the Devil's advocate), it does not go anywhere. Somebody will give me the two hours of life. Never look at it, rent it to not buy it. <br /> <br />
