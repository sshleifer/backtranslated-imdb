This film was worrying, not because of the subject, but because of the way it was worked out. The extremely obese mother (Angela) didn't even do it on the cover of the video case when most of the other actors did it. This is not fair, but it is a statement in itself. I also noticed that her picture is missing in IMDb (maybe her own choice) and it looks like it's her only movie ever? The language in this film was brutal over necessity. I watched my 10-year-old son because he was rated PG in Canada and the tongue out of their mouth was shameful and disgusting. They have never appreciated Shirley Maclain as many others seem. LOVE Kathy Bates and it will always be. The Chinese part was unpleasant. The little boy Alex is a big little actor. I'll have to find out what else has been done lately.
