Above all, let me say that after watching this movie, I felt like I was sold a piece. Remember, it's not a movie mistake that IMDb listens to it as a comedy and a second horror first (though I don't know how it's done ... maybe a movie crew moron). Since I am a fan of the horror / comedy genre, I checked it based on it and I am, so I'm sorry I did it. Where to start? First, to touch my beginning, there is no comedy in this movie. He tries once or twice, but at best he never gets more than laughter. My reaction was primarily rolling eyes and wondering why someone thought such a tired material would be fun. There's also no horror here. Can't find a second of voltage. You think I'm exaggerating ... I'm not. No tension, very little blood, and not much violence on the screen (sorry, but in the horror of a flick of cut off as well as good things starts with a major foul). Damn ... there's even zero nudity. Call me a purist or a youth ... I prefer some of the horror swings if they can't come up with the original land / premise. And this is tired, how the hell was the "reality TV show wrong"? It was done earlier and much better. Like Wrong Turn 2 or ... ummm .... whatever the movie was called Edward Furlong. So bad is the movie. I don't even remember the name of the movie, but it was better than that. I also enjoyed one note saying that the timing for it was good because the "TV reality". Has anyone from the past sent it with a time machine? Are you kidding me? This thing is waste ... and not in a fun way.
