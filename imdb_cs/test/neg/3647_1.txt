Just do a little research on making this movie. Something as simple as Google search. It was funded by the US Army and promoted just in time for elections. It's a great idea, but I'd rather see the DOCUMENT, not something that the Bush administration would regulate and communicate its reality. The timing of the film's release, its tone, and the fact that MS&L promotes it, ask questions about the film's intent. "According to MS&L director Joe Gleason, he and his colleagues are also providing key target reports on the Iraq war in specific constituencies," Eartha Melzer wrote. "Was the leftist art house one of these constituencies by the crowd? Is the government recruiting documentary filmmakers to promote the US population? No one involved with the film is willing to tell who initially made money for the film or how it was represented by the Army PR firm."
