I'd say it's a movie in the background. Play in the background as your inclined work (laundry, email check, etc.). I thought it was a movie that was made before Amy Adams succeeded in Enchanted. Poorly! It was in 2009! The scenario / scenario is pretty awful. I love musicals, but singing is just mediocre and doesn't move after the plot. Ughh. It almost seems like it's for a cinema-based TV movie. I'm watching a TV show? Even a secretary breaks into a song. What's happening f @ # $?! She seemed to have the best voice. Amy Adams was so great at Enchanted. The main player is average. Definitely disappointed. This film would be good for life, but that's about it. :(
