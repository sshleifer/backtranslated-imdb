"Love Life" explores a very culturally relevant marriage scenario of convenience between a lesbian and a homosexual. It seemed to me that the subject was convincing, even though the conflict was a bit forced and too easy to resolve. For example, Thomas falls on Joe a little fast and comfortably on the plot. There are many continuity errors: one other user commented on different cars in the garage, Joe's glasses ... the one that got to me most was the fact that Joe's facial hair changed from scene to scene. Eventually I found myself more switched on by this movie before I moved. Stephan D. Gill has a pretty nice body and shows him quite a few times with the skill of pornstars and exuberance, all too often acting chops. Many times the movie seems to go to porn. Stephanie Kirchen did a great job, but her moment of enlightenment at the end was a bit shocking to me because I was in the mood for a good shower shower at the end of this movie.
