That was the most realistic movie I've ever seen. I can't believe the writer and the director didn't see that almost all the movies look like SF. For example: <br /> <br /> 1. It is impossible for a killer to stay on a cold glaze and get up so fast after 10 hours. <br /> <br /> 2. You can't get through the water mains like in a movie (believe me, it's my domain) <br /> <br /> easily. Let's say the chain was made of steel, but the water pipes were rusty and made of iron. 4. If you try to cut a leg with a visible weakness (at best it is more likely to die because your deer fails) before it gets into the bone (shin). And there are more other examples.
