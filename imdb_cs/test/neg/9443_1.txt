Perhaps James P. Lay knows what to do in the sound department if the director is watching him. However, 'Dreamland (2007)' cannot achieve anything as a writer or director. There is nothing at all in this film, no story, no character, no events, no atmosphere, no conspiracy, no twists, no gambling that deserves this name. In each of these departments, this film is billions of light years behind any short film that has some real thought in it, even one minute. It has nothing to do with the work of David Lynch! Actually, I think it could be used as a mental torture or as a negative propaganda material against the West. <br /> <br /> Recommend it to your worst enemies!
