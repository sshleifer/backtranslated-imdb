Frankly, I really didn't have much expectations for this movie, but at the same time I was hopeful. She did not raise my hopes with the director Albert Pyun - one of the most famous b-film authors. I mean, how much Albert Pyun flicks so high? Yeah, exactly ... but the movie advertised a decent cast. Rob Lowe, Burt Reynolds (pre-reborn stardom), Ice-T and Mario Van Peebles. It's all to make a squat as the movie is so boring and moves so slowly that energy just seemed to leak straight out of me the longer it went on. It runs over 90 minutes, but it's a story telling that could be told in a 30 minute apartment. I don't know what Pyun was doing here. I mean, the movie is dripping with artsy style, but sometimes it's blurry and maybe I'm an idiot waiting for more from Pyun this time. In fact, it seemed to have a budget and a potentially large cast of material, but it's all unnecessary. Mad Six is ​​not much action movie, it's not really really. I think the saddest thing is that I found out that the final credit is the funniest part of the movie. The musical score is actually half decent with some smooth female vocals, but the rest is complete waste and less so, the better. Avoid.
