This film was praised to the point of ridiculous. "American Film" is a boring documentary about a boring person so ordinary that you find equivalents in almost every corner of America. It takes a long time to look hard at a guy who has failed in almost everyone in order to make an independent movie. If his failure was for other than his own selfish aspirations or were in the name of real art, the film could have had a chance. America has a lot of better stories to be told. He should be washed away and many critics have a good reason to be ashamed. Really two inches!
