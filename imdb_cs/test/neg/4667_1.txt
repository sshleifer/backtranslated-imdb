Once I liked some of the Hollywood action blockbusters of the 1980s. They had icons like Arnie and Sly, but I think the action film in the 1990s has fallen into new depths. The worst of them, I think, was Armageddon. The storyline is blatantly invented and removes the worst clich√©s trying to wake the audience. Melodrama is so cruelly saccharin and terrible that you can't really wait until Bruce Willis disappears from the screen. Unfortunately, Liv Tyler, who has performed admirably in several fine independent performances by directors such as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, has decided to jump into a commercial bandwagon. This film symbolizes the new Hollywood aesthetics of great special effects and the rare little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That's the norm these days, and I'm beginning to wonder if there is a writer role in Hollywood. It looks like they're just hacking hacks and committees to write simple scripts. The rest will leave the technology. In Armageddon, there is not a single piece of great human heart emotion. They just feel empty and bland. I can only imagine one good aspect of this film, which includes Father Liv Tyler, who does not even appear in the film. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith provides a thematic song for the movie - a ballad that really rises and at least pulls a little in the hearts when end credits come. predictable, cumbersome film. It means shallowness, lethargy and the decline of human intellect. I'd even watch the eighth Friday 13th.
