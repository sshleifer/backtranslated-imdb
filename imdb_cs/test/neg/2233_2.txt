At least with this episode. Here we have the time of the traveler, Professor of Gilligan Island, no less, returning in time to 1865. What we do - why, of course, try to save Lincoln! There are no interesting variations on this old theme. As another reviewer has claimed, this episode is especially drab and unstylish, with little suggesting that "professor" really is back in the 1860s. Budget constraints are easy to understand and the direction is firm. John Wilkes Booth adds a spark but remains very flat. Too often we feel we are on stage, waiting for something clever. At the end there is less turnover, but I emphasize the smallness.
