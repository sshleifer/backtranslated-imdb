This film promised a lot, so many beautiful and well-playing actors, but with a story that had virtually nothing to say. So many potentially promising conflicts between family members that could be developed and processed, but all were dropped and not taken care of. No story was told, just a show of acting, techniques, beautiful scenes - that was all EMPTY. But again, acting was excellent, so many individual scenes were fun, but as you became increasingly aware of the lack of thoughtful ideas, acting also made no sense. So from the promising start you became increasingly disappointed when the story was happening.
