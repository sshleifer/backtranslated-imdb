The creative team behind Evan Almighty should have been able to make a better film. They play one of the most popular Americans and are brought to director Ace Ventura Pete by detective Tom Shadyac. Damn, even Steve Oedekerk, who has written and directed in recent years the cruel Barnyard, and has achieved written recognition here has done a better job. The fact is that Evan Almighty is not the worst picture of the summer season, but it can be the biggest disappointment. The title and creative team behind the painting suggest that this is a continuation of the species by 2003 by Bruce Almighty. Jim Carrey was in the lead, and while both Steve Carell and Carrey are both entertaining guys, he's the one who's more suited to this kind of material. I heard Carrey was offered this sequel to anyone else, but the actor refused to staing that he saw no more places for his character. So Shadyac went to Carell, who, since the fun piece of the original 2003 shot for fame. After sleeping the hits of The 40 Year Old Virgin and Little Miss Sunshine, the man became a big business, and so it is he rather than the rubber faced by Jim who leads this production to the theaters. The story is seen by Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who has been elected congressman, so he and his army are moving house and state, so Evan can find success with his work. His wife (Lauren Graham) and three children have doubts, but generally point to the support side towards Evan, who looks optimistic about the future. However, the stomach starts to dwell quite quickly, God (Morgan Freeman) seems to say Evan is approaching a flood and that the politician must build the Ark. and animals begin to appear two by two. Evan then starts to build the boat, but the neighborhood is not happy, nor is a political scientist (John Goodman). Anyone who is waiting for some crazy laughs of some of Tom Shadyac's movies will probably be totally cool with this movie. Ace Ventura, Liar Liar Liar and Hell even Bruce Almighty, where there are pretty funny pictures, but all of them, the projects have one thing and that is Jim Carrey. Shadyac did not make a valuable film without Carrey at the helm, worked with Robin Williams, Eddie Murphy and now Steve Carell. Carell will not desperately want to work with the director again after the unsatisfactory Box-Office and critical mauling, and when Carrey is doing more serious projects now, Shadyac should quickly find a new comic muse. Carell himself is quite boring, anyone who felt that his bit in the first movie (although quite entertaining) deserves full length, should be taken back and shot. I expect that after Bruce Almighty's Box-Office draws that it was a universal studio alone, but you know when a good comedian can't do anything with character, then scren persona dud, and that's exactly the case with Evan Almighty. Lauren Graham is no big shock, because neither Evan's wife nor any of the children will make the right note. Freeman lets it all hang freely as a god in another fun and cool performance, but he seems to sporadically carry the piece. Indeed, the most consistent source of laughter is Evan's secretary (Wanda Sykes) and colleague's colleague (Jonah Hill), both of whom laughed twice more than any other project. Oedeker's writing was worse (Barnyard), but also better (Ace Ventura When Nature Calls) than his work on this production. His screenplay has really funny moments, but it's also full of charming family moments, and humor is never strange or offensive enough. The film takes tame and easy swipes on religion when it should tear the concept into pieces, a really introductory church sequence in the Simpsons movie shakes the religion heavier than the entire 95 minutes of Evan Almighty. With a little bolder and more cordial it could have been a much better picture. I have no doubt that the core of the family will enjoy this film slightly, but if they are satisfied, it is a completely different question. There's a line between being attentive and worth the line that Evan Almighty always finds on the wrong side. Maybe if you feel bored and you can watch purse movies, but I think I can think of a lot of better ways to spend my time and more importantly, I have the money to tune into this average comedy.
