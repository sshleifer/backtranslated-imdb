We searched it hard-to-find VHS after watching two excellent Merchant-Ivory pictures back to back. Knowing it was an immediate cash desk failure, a failure as a rent, I thought it might be worth seeing just as much based on the reputation of M-I. Very bad! Nine years ago, it was the goal of the Liberal Agenda, which was to destroy the founding fathers and indeed had some success in eradicating founders from many American classrooms, such as New Jersey; whose eradication of our great founders quickly ended when the Washington Times shone the spotlight of truth into the NJ's school council and their subversive act. A small part of it was headlining alleged Sally Hemmings-Thomas Jefferson connections, regardless of the inconvenient DNA findings that failed to support the insane left agenda. Does not matter! They got James Ellis, author of a dubious reputation, put it in the book, and Columbia University sealed the deal by giving Ellis Pulitzer. As for Jefferson in Paris, Liberal Agenda Spins begins at the opening scene where James Earl Jones claims to be Jefferson's son. Rotation simply continues to flashback to Paris. The unmistakable truth is that even if one assumes that the lie is true, the Hemmings accusation would be insignificant detail in the larger matter of Jefferson's extended and vital diplomatic mission in Paris (as well as in the Netherlands, where he provided substantial financial support for America). when our infant nation was without resources. Apart from Liberal Spin Job, there's nothing but interest in this dull and tortured boring film. Some of the other history is truly accurate - by adding credibility to the lie framework - but this film has one of the most interesting moments in American history and reduces it to cure for insomnia. Please do not ask me why the Liberals have decided to fire the Founding Fathers because I am not wasting my time explaining the actions of these people. Don't ask them; they usually respond to these questions with the same answer: "SHUT UP!"
