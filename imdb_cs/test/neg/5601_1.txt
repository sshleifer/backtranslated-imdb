I don't know what legal or illegal substances they - writers - were about when he wrote this horrible piece of dragon! Casting - Sucking The Going - Sucking The edit - sucks The whole space of the film is that a girl with psychic / telekinetic powers meets a lesbian vampire club, you must be completely out of your head to watch 1 minute. The only reason I should have watched it - it was here! Network as part of a two-image purchase and a movie that appeared after it was real I wanted to see. I quickly switched the whole thing and I was amazed at how stupid this movie was at twice the speed! Do not let this film rent, buy or watch ... vampires in the film suck as much as the overall movie and production does! If you want a good lesbian vampire movie - Hunger with David Bowie, Susan Sarandon & Katharine Deneuve - excellent movie watch / own / rent on the site of this piece of pure sh * t
