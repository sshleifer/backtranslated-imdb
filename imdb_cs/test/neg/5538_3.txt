Artist Daniel King (Chris John) and his friend Laura Peters (Lara Clancy) are invited to move to an old house in Cornwall, UK, with their child-rich friend Natasha Carlton (Carol Kentish). Natasha fell in love with Daniel, who is an ambiguous man in his sentimental life. While alone in the house, weird things happen and Laura is scared and scared. When Laura meets the old mad priest Gabriel Norton (Brian Blessed) on the way, it is recommended to leave the house immediately, because evil lived there. But the couple will stay and have to face the tragic consequences. What a messy script and horrible and kitschy movies of this "Devil's Harvest" are! The camera and camera work are not completely wrong, but the Chris John and Carol Kentish amateur performances and James Shanks direction along with the horrible story, ridiculous situations and dialogues make this film one of the worst I've ever seen. Sometimes I have seen a couple of film school shorts on YouTube that are better and better than senseless and horrible "Devil's Harvest". It is not a horror movie, but a horror movie. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Colheita do Diabo" ("Devil's Harvest")
