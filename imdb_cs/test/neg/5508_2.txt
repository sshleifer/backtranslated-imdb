I am a fan of the bizarre style of Jess Franco and a lover and his trashier films, and my personal opinion is that in addition to a few very entertaining films, he has also created several masterpieces, such as the brilliant "Paroxism" aka Venus For example in furs of 1969. that the 180+ films that this director directed in his career include a lot of big smelly movies. 1981's "Sadomania" is definitely one of these stinkers, just totally wrong and a plot of less film with the ability to carry the hell out of you despite constant sleaze and nudity. Sure, constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes, but because it goes on and on, that one is quite likely to get bored after a short time. The only thing that really watched me was the intensity of the sleaze, which is generously spoken, slightly entertaining. After a couple of newlyweds get lost in a desert on some island, bunch of topless women carrying guns, guards of a local prison camp, are stopped. While the husband is expelled from the island, his wife is taken to a prison camp, a place of torture and sexual humiliation, a sadistic nymphomania, Magda, and an extremely degenerate governor. Of course, prisoners are absolutely hot chicks, most of them are blondes, guards are totally headless women carrying rifles. who will watch it anyway. The only interesting thing about "Sadomania" is the high rate of exploitation, even for the movie "Women in Prison". There are probably two short scenes in the movie, in which we see a woman wearing a top, sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to top, and some scenes of torture are really ugly. <br /> <br /> It's amazing that a movie with this extreme sleaze can still be so boring. Sleaze will keep you in the beginning, but after the first 45 minutes I wasn't really sleeping. I also wonder why Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson from all pornstars, who, according to most sources, was a transsexual man who was born as a human (well, maybe for this reason). If you really want to watch, make sure you have enough beer at home to sit down and watch it only for sleaze and exploitation (and maybe even a mild unintentional fun factor). Don't expect it to be very entertaining, but it's almost incredible how a film with such a high level of leanness can be so boring. I'm a fan of Jess Franco and I'll always be, but "Sadomania" is just bad. 2/10
