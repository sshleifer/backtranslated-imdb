How can ANYBODY give something higher than '1'? I thought "Manos, the hands of destiny" would forever be the worst movie ever to hit my optic nerve. I really didn't think anything could be worse. I was wrong. "Galaxina" is the precious film in which EVERY SIMPLE COURSE is painful, blind, bad. How often have you watched the movie and commented: "Who the hell LIT this?" From lighting to soundtrack to effects to scene to acting to cinematography to. . Well, everything, this film is absolutely irreversible. It's so bad that I couldn't tell for a while if it was the worst comedy or the worst drama I've ever seen. It's too bad, though it's ridiculous. I would have eaten a plate of broken glass before I sat it again.
