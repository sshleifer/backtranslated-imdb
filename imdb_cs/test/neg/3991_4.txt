I have great respect for Mr. Argent's work, but this film lacks many features that make his films truly unique. The opening of the film is great and prepares you for a truly scary horror movie. What happens to the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not build into much. But there are good performances and a lot of great atmosphere. The end of the film is weak with regard to everything it builds on. Where there should be some great climax of huge dimensions, instead you get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror movies are used, so it feels like they just need to pack it. A few scenes are unforgettable for their paintings, but in the end they won't make the film a really good movie. If you don't feel that you have to see everything this director has done, I suggest you hand over this ...
