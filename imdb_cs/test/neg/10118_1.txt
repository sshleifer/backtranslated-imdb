Hm. Where should I start? I usually ignore any rating IMDb has when searching for a movie because I think I might like it or anything, and at least I should give it a chance, but this time I wish I paid attention. I know some people liked it, and I'm not trying to say they shouldn't. On some parts it was fun. But if you are like me and do not like watching cats that move in the undergrowth for 20 minutes, random scenes of rapid cloud movement, caged dogs for the next 20 minutes set to "exciting" music and close-up faces while people talk then you can avoid this movie. The actors were either positively wooded or over the top, and the quality of the film was horrible, fuzzy and grainy and bland and not at all artistic. And I know we should have thought that Carol wasn't just a crazy maniac with a gun that shoots innocent people with this strange religious psychosis, but ... well, he doesn't really convince me otherwise. In fact, I ended up really dislike her crazy character. And what was with the soul in the universe? I understand it's a fantasy movie, but come in. I say, the angel at the end was a scary creepy. It was the strictest thing in the whole movie, WAY more scary than Darth Maul's lava demon. I give them props for the scene, it was good. But not good enough to really see the movie. And the initial credits were great, but don't be fooled! I'd rather use anything that went into the credits to make the film better. Bah. I wish I didn't buy it for the $ 2 I paid for it, instead I bought a candy bar. : /
