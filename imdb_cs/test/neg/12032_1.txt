A low budget can be an excuse for a bad acting talent and a pathetic, fake gore. But it's not an excuse for bad writing. It is a talent that is capable of writing dialogue without sounding it mechanically. The dialogue in this film was on the same level as most of the instructional videos that were shown to the fast food workers in training. Also, I understand that you need to make a few exceptions when it comes to acting talent when you only have $ 20 to spend. With what has been said, no serious director would look at these scenes and say, "That was perfect". I see a better character on Canadian television. This film had a paper thin graph, bad gameplay, bad dialogue, and no intelligent thoughts at all. It just proves to me that some independent movies are for some reason. If your looking for a quick fear, rent something else. Even "Cable Guy" was a scarier movie. After watching this movie, I think I would be better off watching re-run on X-files.
