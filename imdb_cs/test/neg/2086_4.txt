This Western spaghetti uses three American actors to take away some of the typical spaghetti aura. The story is about the amnesty that New Mexico Governor gives to all willing criminals to give them a chance to start a new life. Usually this opportunity is limited to past events, but in this movie it looks more like a killing license, because even new crimes (eg Threatening Governor) are forgiven. The story is an endless string of killing where almost every character has only the goal to deliver more corpses. Only a few leaders have perseverance. Clay McCord is haunted by nightmares related to a childhood event where he surprisingly killed a lot of people. In the midst of eternal chaos, this kind of reflection lacks credibility. Compared to similar films like BANDIDOS, none of the characters in this movie were likeable to me. <br /> <br /> In addition to poor content targeting certain customers, this movie is well shot, the files are somewhat detailed and acting is average. <br/> <br/> 4/10.
