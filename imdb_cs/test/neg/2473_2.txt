I can't believe I actually sat the whole movie! It was totally awful and totally crouching - yet I sat with him and thought it must be better. No, and I missed 2 hours of my life. Will Smith is much better at action movies - I loved him in I, Robot, State Enemy, and Independence Day - and I don't think he could really be expected to play the whole movie as a romantic lead so Cary Grant could. Then the script was unbearably scary again, and the dialogue was so great. I didn't like everyone, except for Albert's character, and even what I found was done with a heavy hand. To watch a modern romantic comedy, watch something like How to Lose a Guy in Ten Days, or when Harry Meet Sally. The 40-year-old virgin left me with a smile on her face. I even preferred music and lyrics over this - and yes, I know it's cheese, but at least he didn't take it seriously and was sweet. I also did not like the main female leadership - and I was not convinced of the chemistry between her and Will Smith. Overall, I think there were two scenes I liked (and certainly not the end that was naughty and unconvincing!) - Hitch called Sarah when he didn't give his number quite sweet, and - No, I'm sorry, that's the only thing I liked about the whole movie. Don't waste your time.
