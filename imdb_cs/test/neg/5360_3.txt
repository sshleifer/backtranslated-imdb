Let me first say that I am a ghost believer, and I really know that they exist. I had enough experience with them to know they were there. What I hate are people who bring the Bible and Religion into it all. People forget that there is more than one "Bible", thousands of religions and beliefs, and different ways to interpret what is said in the Bible. Not everyone believes in God and not everyone believes in stereo religion. Religion does not do everything, one of the things that I should mention in the Bible that many do not know is that even the most used biblical raids violate rules written in ... they should never wear more than one At once, slavery is fine and under certain circumstances you can murder your neighbor. None of it, "That was the Old Testament, and now we have the New Testament." If the Bible is God's Word and cannot be changed, there should be no changes or versions. Religion is full of misinterpretations, mixed facts, and people who follow him so blindly that "there is no other way." The apologies used by these blind followers are either pathetic or they cannot explain the irregularities themselves, and instead use the excuses given to them either by their pastor or teacher. But, anyway, to review. I am a decent fan of "Ghost Hunters" and when I heard this show was coming, I was quite excited and I thought it had some potential. Like I like to watch "Ghost Hunters", I don't like some of their members, and I don't like how they can dismiss the site as creepy, but can't explain anything that is happening. Just because your investigative device doesn't answer does not mean the camera didn't shoot the show. I'm glad they're skeptical, but it's as if they didn't understand that just because you didn't get anything on your recorder and movie, it doesn't make the place scary or not. If the Ghosts were so easily captured, it would be known as fact, not faith. Is it rather "the right place at the right time", something that is just like when there is something that comes to mind that it will "play" for you? This show is a little stupid. Usually it is boring and there is a lot of talk, a lot of psyche, but nothing happens. The filtered narration of the main person is usually either boring to listen to, or basically does not need. Also, relying on the psyche is too abundant because I believe that very few of them are really gifted. Silvia Brown is one I definitely believe, but most of them are sometimes hard to believe. I really wanted to like this show, but of the few I've seen, I haven't been impressed yet.
