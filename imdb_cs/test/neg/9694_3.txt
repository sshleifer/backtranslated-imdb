Sorry about that. But if you have seen this "epic", you will probably know about total disregard for the true Bible text. Now I'm not completely next in the line for the saints, but I know the basics. And these were the basics. God wanted to destroy all the faces of the earth because he thought they were damaged to the point where they did not return. He chose Noah, a rough diamond and his family to be spared from their intact ways. Noah builds an ark, as God has instructed her to flood the rest of the planet in her, his family and two of every creature. These are the basics. In this movie you have other people who move by sea, such as sellers and pirates. But I thought EVERYONE was destroyed. I think NBC managers were never in church. There are other inaccuracies, as I said, but since I'm average Joe, I have no idea what they are. Excuse me. Back to the movie, it was inaccurate, as previously said, acting, but some effects were good, I'll give it. But as a whole, I have seen a better and more tasteful rendition of the story that takes place as a small scene on The Simpsons. God will help NBC executives go to court. 3/10
