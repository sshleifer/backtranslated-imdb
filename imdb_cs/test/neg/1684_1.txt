This is probably the most irritating show I've ever seen in my whole life. It is indescribably the most pleasant and idiotic show I've ever seen. All this is bad. Synopsis: Every week a week comes for parents to handle different situations with their children. I couldn't understand what kind of idiots would produce this mess in the first place, not to mention a few seasons. The script is bad, very bad? it contains both kitsch and unethical jokes that you usually see in rated R or NC-17. Especially for a young boy character where all he does is be happy is what one called family show humor? Casting is also terrible because all you see is really really the BAD actors, the season. Final word: This show is a real torture !! This show provides a picture of how irresponsible a parent can be (with misuse of energy rather than understanding). It's from millions of times far from reality. Listen to Kenny G, who would have sent in compared to that. Watching the washing machine revolves around wouldn't hurt your eyes just like this show. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0/10 (Rating: From) <br /> <br /> Note: Show Is So Bad That Even Mother Flying Away Pull Daughter Out Of Show.
