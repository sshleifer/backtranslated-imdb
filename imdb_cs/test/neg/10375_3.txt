I just saw it at the Castro Theater in San Francisco and I was having trouble getting awake during this incredibly repeated, unlit movie. It's a 75-minute film that feels like 175 minutes and has about 20 minutes of modestly engaging material. It's not bad in any offensive way, it just repeats things that have been said many, many times more interesting and provocative. With only a few exceptions, the talks continued to go on and on, creating little emotional contact or context with the whole subject. It's more like a "how" guide for something that can no longer be done. I was alive in the era, but I felt a small connection or nostalgia for what was presented.
