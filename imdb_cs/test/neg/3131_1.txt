It could have been an excellent movie. However, as many other people think. If the entire movie has to be read, then it will be removed from the movie and become something else. It has an excellent rating for me, and I couldn't wait to borrow it. But once I did, it was a real downturn. Here in Boardman, Ohio I couldn't find an English version of anything like that. This movie was also compared to Dark Hours, and we won't watch it in Boardman, Ohio. Not available. So I think we'll never know how good a movie he was.
