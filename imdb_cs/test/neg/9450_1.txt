Dreamland began to be of medium interest but never went anywhere but Tedium. Low rentals with no actors and ridiculous effects are not recommended for any reason. The best thing to say is that it really made it to a place in the Nevada desert. That's it, I can't think of one good thing except that about this smelly. It is assumed that the final will be some kind of revelation, but it will fall like the rest. I thought of one more good point about this cheese, the less than an hour, even if it still carries its welcome long before. When a girl walks in the desert at night, it seems to last forever, and he's getting worse from there. Terrorist attempts are not effective at all. The story is an attempt to twilight zone style, but wrong. Check out "Retroactive" for a good B-movie science fiction.
