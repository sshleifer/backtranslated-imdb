Clever overall story / place for story. The event is decent. Children are uncomfortable and their motivation is unclear. The lead villain was a nice change, but he could have been better. "I Love You" was more than played than "finished", but at least Van Damme got a chance to show a little tenderness. One of Van Damme's better movies.
