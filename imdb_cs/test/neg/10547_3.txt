This is by far the worst of a series of toxics. Playing in Tokyo is terrible and you can understand them in half the time. The main problem with this film is all the sudden changes from the original. Just as he is in this other friend of toxie, or it can be the same character with a different name and play by another girl. Why is this movie made as a Disney movie. After about fifteen minutes, he starts with the time of gore and everything goes well. There are 2 amazing murders then the movie goes straight shit. After 20 minutes of film, the movie is incredibly fun. H * LL IS SUITABLE TO FIND. Well, if your drunk isn't watching this movie. You have been warned.
