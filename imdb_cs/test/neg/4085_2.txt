This is definitely not a comedy - I don't know what it was on the market. As a serious film, it lacks any substance. If you're not fresh from Sunday school or need your Noah fix, you'll find you're bored of tears. The support cast gave up what was left of the movie. Lauren Graham plays an empty housewife without real depth. His kids don't add anything to the movie. They seem to be just beginning to take care of their absent father. Jonah Hill plays a haunted internet addict who doesn't look funny. <br /> <br /> I found the original as a decent movie. Disappointed that this really wasn't going anywhere.
