I'm 35. Bruce was a man in Evil Dead and I still enjoy watching ED1 and ED2. It was also great to see him as King two or three years ago in Bubba Ho Tep, in which he showed versatility and great acting talent. But this Screaming Brain adventure is definitely not for Bruce's early fans. I'm either too old for this sh17 or I'm no longer part of Bruce's target audience. I am positive that children from 9 to 13 years old love this film. But this widespread comedy matin√©e sci-fi contains about 5 minutes of quite interesting moments and the rest is a cheap humor for children. Campbell should talk seriously with Sam Raimi and get their brains screaming together for the final photo of the reunification of Evil Dead to help me regain my interest. At least a good director would be behind the camera ... I'm sorry, Bruce, that's not what I'm saying. Take care of yourself.
