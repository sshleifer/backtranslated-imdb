So it's Friday night and you want to watch the movie ... all you want is something fun, not too windy, or anything that might require a long night of philosophical discussions. So you pay $ 10 for watching the Mod Squad. The trailer for this movie should pop me out, but come ... it's three of Hollywood's most beautiful people - a feast for the eyes. But that's about ... a chain of Prada moving ads. And what did the Hollywood producers forget? Plot. Why do these kids run around the streets after some unknown enemy? Where are they? But don't worry, after a while you stop worrying. I was on the verge of walking out of this movie because I thought sitting in my room and staring at the wall could be more productive (and free) but at that time it was over (90 minutes - it's just saving) grace ). So, still willing to waste $ 10? Go, make a nice hot meal.
