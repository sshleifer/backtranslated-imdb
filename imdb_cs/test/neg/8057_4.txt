This film is about the painful journey of a young man to discover his sexuality. <br /> <br /> The film is raw and unpretentious. He does not rely on steamy sex scenes to attract viewers. Although it may seem that conspiracies sometimes seem disjointed and disconnected, some events are not properly explained. I can understand this because this film is a collection of memories that are very personal for the director. Subplot about his sister and mother may not exist in the film, but I can imagine that this is a very important event in his life. <br /> <br /> The low movie budget is clearly recognizable. It is a pity that the sound effects are poorly made. Narrative and some dialogues (especially the classroom scene with a French teacher) have so much echo that it's hard to tell what they say. Ambient noise, noticeable traffic noise, is also captured throughout the film. When the scene goes to another, the level of traffic noise changes. This movie is probably not fun, but it certainly serves as a keen diary of a young man's journey into the embrace of his sexuality.
