This movie just doesn't work. No two ways. I saw it for the first time in '98 when it was released and I didn't like it. I bought it for sale a few days ago because I thought, "What the hell, I'll try it". I don't regret the money I gave for Hamilton, but the fact remains the same. This movie is nonsensical, boring and uninteresting. Stormare is usually a pleasure, but it is when he makes movies in the US. He doesn't do it back home. Of course, the movie is well done (if you forget the odd stock footage here), but in the end, the only thing that really raises Hamilton over one stardust is Hamilla's move as a bad Hawkins man. He is seriously having fun with the character and is also responsible for two good moments in the movie. And that is really a lot. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
