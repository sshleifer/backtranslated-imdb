I rarely give a rating less than 5, but in this case, I have to weigh. Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful, intricate books, original characters, sharp dialogue, refreshing plot. Films based on his books go back to Hombre (Paul Newman), Mr. Majestyk (Bronson), and out of sight (Clooney / Lopez) among others. Even when they do so, films at least have a certain level of storyline. This one, .... it's just not a nice addition to the catalog. Acting is bad (I don't know why because they are very capable people) and the story is being processed with stupidity. Characters are rearranged, lack of chemistry, actors and actresses are misunderstood. As Elmore Leonard is a really great storyteller, I hope everyone who doesn't know his work would be discouraged from reading his books because they saw this unsatisfactory rendition of one of his stories. The story is a sequel to Get Shorty. If you haven't seen the movie, don't watch it. If you've seen Get Shorty, don't continue this. <br /> <br /> I saw Be Cool a few years ago and I saw the vid again tonight. He wasn't allowed to make such a negative impression for the first time because I forgot how grim this continuation was. Fortunately, I don't think anything less than those who appeared in this film for doing so. Probably waiting for something more. Get Shorty was original and great fun. I'm almost always happy with Travolta, but it's much better in Tarantino Pulp Fiction and in the previous Get Shorty. He could not enjoy what was going on here. And I hear that Freaky Deaky, another book by Elmore Leonard, is in pre-production for 2008. Hopefully they can pull it out. <br /> <br /> Read the books. They're almost all great.
