Good,. So I went to this loving RuPaul. I still love him, but I think a little less. This is one crude film that shows many male genitalia. It is a spoof of black films from the 1970s and is deliberately wrong. The only fun part about me is that all the voices were looping with those that drag queens, even the voices of real women. That's on top, nonstop, laughing your back end is that stupid, badly made movie. I would never look at it again, but I appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do. There is no rating, but it would be R or even NC-17. RuPaul did a much better job.
