This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and definitely the worst movie Nagesh Kuknoor. I can't believe that a person who created a movie like Teen Deewarein can create a total crap like that. The picture of the film itself is really flawed, that Zeenat must look for Meera and get her leniency to help her husband avoid the death penalty in the Court of Arabia. Ordinary logic says that Zeenat cannot easily find Meer, so he will not rule the Judge, so Zeenat can safely create Meerin's signature or thumb print and make it to the Judges. The next saddest thing is that Shankar has given the wrong address in his passport, so Indian government officials can't get to the address, but after some time Meer gets Shankar's suitcase through the government. Wow! Doesn't it do that Soudis is more well connected in India than Indians? Nagya does a little bit more than a portrait in a Chopra role-playing movie that looks at Meera and looks for Meer's father-in-law, Girish Karnaad (this guy is just useless) helps to get her as a hold. Nagya can not speak Hindi and he has been helping other guys translate the English dialogues he writes in Hindi. This time, his assistant seems to have been in serious intoxication when he wrote dialogues like "Imaan ki Chalaang" (a leap of honesty). Within minutes, to our worst nightmares, Meera not only takes this honest leap, taps her legs to make "Imaan ka Naach" (a dance of honesty). One of the only light films is his cinematography and really nice shades. But since Bollywood has learned something called Post-production, almost all movies have vibrant colors and pretty mixed backdrops, so no big deal. The conclusion is that making a cheese film is not limited to Chopras or Johars or Barjatyas, Nagyas and everyone is ready to hit.
