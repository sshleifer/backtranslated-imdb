This film basically uses marital rape as one of its main comedy devices. Now I turned it off the moment he literally tied her to the bed and raped her, but I can't imagine how it finally turned into something cute and funny. This film not only wasted a wonderful cast and was consistently unfair, in fact, it was somewhat brutally disturbing and misogynist. As many people seem to be the sweet family behind me. "I certainly enjoyed preserving those apricots last night" is not a funny joke when you know it means forcing a reluctant virgin to have sex with you in the hope that they will eventually like it. Watching the peek tom jerk off is not family fun. I honestly feel worse for watching half of this scary "comedy" and I'm totally confused with these positive reviews.
