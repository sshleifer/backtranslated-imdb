The prey has an interesting history, if you don't remember the ads in the newspaper in June 1984, maybe you caught it on the movie channel in summer 85, but it doesn't remember anything else. Again, the plot is the basic murderer in the forest. But ironically, it was filmed by Friday the 13th. The prey was actually shot sometime in 1978 by one of the actors in a conversation years later. But released about a week on some drives, (yes, Jim, namanci showed it in June 84). But he's got an old look. Maybe they did so later so that they could pay in cash all the other terrorist films that the market flooded in 1984. Now in the story, it has a back story, a forest fire in 1940 leaves a lot of Roma burned to death. But one of their children will survive (our monster) so glimpse to this day, which would be in 1978, we have an older middle-aged couple who camps only for Monster. The tag line says this is not human, and its GOT ANX, but Ax was only used in these first two murders. Now we have a lot of teenagers who look in their camp in the mid-20th century. We all know that they are prey and the monster knocks them one by one. It seems longer for 80 minutes. We also have a lot of wildlife footage to fill the emptiness for 80 minutes. Overall, it looks more than 70 years since he got into a horror movie of 80 years. Hi Prey had the potential to be a good horror killer in the forest of the movie, but he falls a bit short .. This however features a pretty scary cool looking monster at the end, and we have to wait until the last 2 minutes to see him. A side note, the monster continued to play in the family films of Addams in 1990 .. \ t
