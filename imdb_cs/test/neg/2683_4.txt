After Loomis gives a quick recap of Michel Myers, we remember 1989 when Jamie is kidnapped by a black man before police stations burn. Micheal returns to Haddonfild to find Jamie and his child. In this release, Loomis gets more scenes and seems to be more active than in the final cut. The score is much better, more consistent with Parts 4 and 5, none of the BS electric guitars. And the end makes more sense. For these reasons, along with the fact that this cut has more characterization and tension, and cuts to factor gore (Halloween, contrary to what it says "Friday the 13th" Franschise, has never been about reckless gore) is why I prefer to this Producer's cut bootleg. Not to mention that the cut magically transforms peat into gold, it just polish the grass a little and make it more understandable. The whole cult conspiracy is still very stupid, just like Micheal, who was the father of the child. <br /> <br /> My Grade Cut: C- <br /> <br /> My Editing: D-
