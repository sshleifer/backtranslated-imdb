Sorry people, I love the work of Ray Bolger, but one thing he's not is not a leading man. Maybe if you pretend to be the last man on earth, this romantic plot can work, but now! Here is a movie that exists only to show the title song, which was a big hit for the Basie Band a year ago (1951). And some pretty handy singing and dancing will save him from total disaster. However, the story story is pathetic, even in 1952 musical comedy standards. And other songs are as memorable as the Evening In Paris Cologne event. Dialogue Plays Stars, Day & Bolger. Only Claude Dauphin's Boyeresque spells keep his character three dimensional. So how do you make this movie on video? A.) Fast forward the entire dialogue ... B.) Give up Doris Day's vocals and Ray Bolger's free legs. And don't miss the Dauphin's cheerful look at the rain-soaked, windy revival of "April in Paris." C.) Finally, keep a few bottles of Cabernet chilled and clever. Bob Raymond
