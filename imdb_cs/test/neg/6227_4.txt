This movie is not that good at all. It's pretty stupid, quite uncomfortable, and very poorly done.I really just saw this movie because one of my friends said they hated this movie. He found it a pretty bad movie. The only thing that is remotely good was the fact that it was a little fun at times, and I also feel that if it were a little bit better, it would be all right. it was totally overworked, it shouldn't look like it was filmed for a film festival, and if the script was improved, it would be a good movie for slasher. not, but instead of what it is now, a lousy movie. The acting is cruel I felt like I was looking at a couple of teens acting like a Halloween show or a Thrill ride or something. Kills are pretty cheap (as the movie itself), and basically everything else is low-class. \ TOverall this movie really is bad and you shouldn't miss out on anything if you decide to skip this movie. <br /> <br /> 3.8 out of 10 stars
