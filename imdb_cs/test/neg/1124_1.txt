** WARNING ** MISERABLE MOVIE ** WARNING ** The day before Christmas Eve, some nut case decided that we would have fun by sending this movie as "fun" on TV. What in the name of the gods was? This film is filled with terrible humor, contemptuous action, miserable jokes, and conspiracy catastrophe. Randy Quaid plays an idiotic role as cousin Eddie Johnson. Eddie is a dead man who can't even do the simplest tasks. He was dismissed because he was stupid as a brick, but the company he worked for apologized, so they sent him and his family on holiday. But when he is so stupid that he managed to get the vacation into disaster. All-in-all is the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have nightmares that are still in miserable action and even more miserable jokes in this movie. It's so sad you have to see ... Oh no. The nightmares I have are much worse than other nightmares you'll ever have. Trust me ... I hate the movie so bad because it's acting, humor, "jokes" and the story. The only good thing was nice scenery. Well it's my opinion, and I sure hope everyone agrees with me ...
