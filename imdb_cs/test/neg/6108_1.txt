As a writer and extinct Orthodox Jewish woman, this film has immensely released me. Dialogue is shabby and wasteful, characters who are too engaged in lines from tremendously prosaic to incredibly melodramatic must not be spreading to really textured individuals. One-piece musical scores try to balance the blandness, aptly go into silence to expel the viewer and screenplay from protracted catatonia. As an adolescent revolutionary on his own righteous tirade, this film is blown away by the wisdom of his revelation - the patriarchy is bad - and wastes his energies thoroughly and beats at this point. The resulting artistic crime is a complete lack of imaginative development; Moral crime is the reduction of human beings into cartoons: martyrs and slapstick.
