What I had hoped for (or even expected) was the well-known "stop motion" images and extremely slow motion, extreme approach, and everything that included the fisheye. In short: the art of a) finding interesting visual events and b) capturing them in the way the human eye is unable to play them so that the human eye can see. Things that made another Qatsi hits. <br /> <br /> I was just wondering how the creation of the whole would fit the name. When I watched the movie, I felt that the focus in this third part was a message and not a cover. That's okay, especially since the message is so valid. But I already knew the message, and there seemed to be nothing else. More than half of the film was solarized or stained or billed or transformed through another filter. It looked a lot like the effects your camcorder does, but you never use it. Many images would be nicer without filters, like a giraffe and a zebra chase. One could say that "technology or any human harmful resource has disfigured our beautiful nature", but why is it to use these seventies effects? When it was more than 10 minutes in this cheap effect, I was ready to leave. I hope the rest just couldn't be so bad that I stayed. But then there was slow motion: slow motion is good because it gives you time to analyze the moving image. But if there is not more than 24 or maybe 50 or 60 frames per second, then it just isn't enough of the motion to slow down. Please note the movement slowed down as it was with beautiful shots of foam and splashing water (some) of laughing people and the song of singers singing soldiers. I admit that archival images can't be reworked, but I've seen a lot of it anyway, it could be without it. It had to be a lot of work to search archive footage and the effects couldn't be so easy to apply and organize. In addition, much work was mixed with each other. It shows that the creator was unable to prolong or save the film. But I didn't like mixed things a bit ... The idea behind it was sometimes nice or even smart, but the implementation was inadequate. Computer-generated images didn't bother me so much but outdated. 'Bits' streaming along the circuit (in the first part of the movie) looked newer and nice. Mandelbrot is always fun, the fractal mountain was smaller. I was pleased to hear the cello playing the lead role in music. A little less vibrato at certain times would be appropriate for Glass' music, but that's a matter of taste. Of course, as mentioned above. I hope that Qatsi's next story will soon emerge, where computer images will play a less important role and which will inspire someone to get back on the field. <br /> <br />
