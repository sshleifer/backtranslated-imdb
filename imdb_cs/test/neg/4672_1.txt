I like action movies. I have a softspot for "B" flicks with bad dialogue and wooden acting. So I frowned to come up with one of my guilty pleasures that was worse than this blockbuster. I can not. It would be hard to put together a larger piece of cr * p than this Bruce Willis vehicle. Armageddon is a story (and I use this term freely) of the "Super-Drillers" team to fly to destroy an asteroid before it destroys Earth. Realistic? Not really. But who cares? It's action. I'm not blasting premise. <br /> <br /> Small Spoilers: <br /> <br /> The movie begins with a few scenes designed to introduce threats and characters. Bruce Willis is a team leader who is tough as nails and spends his first piece of time on the screen chasing around Ben Affleck, with an unforgivable gun to sleep with his daughter. For some reason it didn't make me laugh. It was forced, just like everything in this movie. The team is called because they are the only people in the whole world who can drill an asteroid. Well, I'm ready to accept this assumption if it gets us into action - the supposed film meat. More humor attempts, with each character going out doing some crazy, nutty thing before the blast. Again lame. They finally take off. Here's where the movie really pi. They come to the rock and work. You would believe it, nothing works properly and everything has a tense countdown !!! Whoah! Ten, nine, eight ... one - Oh, surprise we saved the day again! And I don't even understand me on a jerky cameraman. When I saw it in the theater, I thought I'd be sick. I can only assume that they were trying to cover up the gargantuan holes that left the insipid performance, every few seconds by cutting it off to another shot (from someone who was erected on MTV - Mr. short attention alone). Just when I thought it couldn't be worse ... wait - there's a made tearjerker end that was so pinned on it did the rest of the movie Citizen Kane virtual. Summary: Jokes were not funny. Go on - well, I said I'll let go. Behavior was wrong. Really bad. Even Billy Bob couldn't get up over the script, which was worse. Camerawork - bad again. (I didn't mention the stupidest scene of love in the history of movies - I think animal crackers). Rating: 1 out of 10 (I give half a point to Steve Buscemi who smiles me against my will and another half of the point when I was able to look at the beautiful Liv Tyler and try to ignore her This is far and the worst movie I've ever seen in theater. .. ever.
