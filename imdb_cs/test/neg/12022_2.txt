I come out of the fight because this film was so well filmed and so well occupied that I was twice angry with his de-evolution than I was with less work. Without revealing too many conspiracies, I can only say that one part of my 2 VHS set was a disturbing, unfolding joy of bizarre but plausible plot developments. The leading character was suitably naif-like, but also intelligent and very open. The events he has to deal with quickly are the separation of parents, the cultural shock when his Pakistani roots collide with the complete collapse of the English straitlaced society in the 1960s, the doubtful transformation of his father into the revered Buddha Suburbia, and the conversion of his cousin into a feminist militant as his the best friend suddenly becomes an icon of a growing punk movement in the 1970s. Besides. What made me so angry was the amount of detailed work that every actor put in the creation and creation of his characters in the first part, just to get the whole thing into very bad porn episodes in the second part, too much to justify the development of the plot, and too explicit to seem erotic. My biggest pet is when directors let their private fetishes interfere with the truth of their movie, and that was the best example for me. I felt a bit like being invited to a party of very clever, funny strangers just to have the door locked and guests couldn't communicate and we were all forced to watch bad movies from the 1970s instead. What an insult to the hard work of these amazing actors! Why not just start cheeseball? And why discard a great leader who can really act, and then cut him off when he stands out for great performance? I almost felt as though he was tired of endless sexual scenes where everything he was doing was lying where she was pouring her pan for another bare naked actress. Bottom Line - The first part is a minor genius, Part Two is the second level soap opera perversions. I know the book is quite explicit, but I felt that these subtle actors were just as exploited in real life as their characters in the movie, and that made me quite angry and it was very annoying. Only John Waters can rip the dubious humiliation of actors and conspiracy and seem artistic. My suggestion is just to watch the first part, throw the other one in the garbage dump and I will love the Buddha forever. Score A + F = 0
