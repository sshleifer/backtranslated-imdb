Like Final Fantasy, if you look at the still shot - it doesn't look so bad. But when people move, it's totally scary. The uneven jerky movements, the frightening lack of emotion, and the lack of a sense of life in the face give me horror. Characters don't even appear ALIV / organic. I saw a preview with a daughter who actually fell asleep! She wasn't even involved. For the record, I thought it was easy for both Pixar-esque films and a number of "bad" 2D movies like Sinbad. Lighting is painful and gives children the look of holding a flashlight under their chin at the campfire. Lip Sync is bad - worse than Final Fantasy. I also seriously question whether Hanks plays five characters .... it was a major distraction throughout the movie. The role of the conductor is frightening - even if I can't pinpoint it that way. It reminds me of my father's false "telephone" voice in greeting his clients. I think that is why the different roles are disturbing - you are aware that the voice is the same but still distinctly different. This gives each character the feeling that he is ACTED, unlike real human characters. The illusion of reality is violated by multiple Hanks. I saw the technique - la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks just can't get closer to interpreting it with the voice itself, given the scary animation. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't lose my money - wait for the rental.
