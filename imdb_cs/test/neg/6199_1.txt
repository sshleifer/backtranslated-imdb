I was looking at this movie just coz it was expected to be yet another entertainer David Dhawan. The bad bad comeback from David Dhawan.he made a lot of funny movies in the past that didn't make sense, but none of them was stupid! What is a waste of talent and beauty? Donna, why did the actors agree on a doin movie like this. <br /> <br /> There was no practicality in this movie. The film is under par and does not justify the standard and potential Bollywood. The only thing worth watching in this movie was katrina, but we don't need to watch a movie like this to see her! Being remodeled by Hollywood movie Hitch its clear, Bollywood cant directors don't even make a proper remake. I consider it the worst I've ever seen. Terrible 1/10
