After his success with the Nightmare on Elm Street in 1984, director Wes Craven decided for some reason that his next project would be this television film. I'm not a big fan of this director as a whole; Quick Exploitation The last house on the left, as well as its modern Scream slasher, fits well with me, but the rest of his work is very affected and missing and I would call him the master who marked him as others. The main topic here is cryogenic freezing, although it is rather a springboard for conspiracy than an important part of the film. The main influence is apparently the excellent zombie movie of 1974 and we focus on Miles Creighton; cryogenically frozen businessman for ten years before the accident, which means he must be defrosted immediately. Miles is part of a project for people who are sick; pay for being frozen in the hope that they will be revived in the future when their illnesses are cured. Miles is revived successfully and is considered a miracle ... but a person who wakes up is not a person who has been frozen because Miles returns without a soul. This movie might be pretty good judging by the idea behind it, but instead we got a conspiracy that doesn't really have a lot to do, and it has to be said that Craven isn't the best of the movie's potential. "The focal point is" soul, "but it seems that not having a soul and simply having a murderous intention / no compassion is the same, which is a bit unimaginable. The film was made for television, so it is not particularly ugly and it is clear that not much money has been spent on it because the production is very cheap. Michael Beck has never become a very popular actor and it is not surprising to judge from his performance here; while he is passable, he largely lacks charisma and is not formidable in the central role. The plot is not going too badly, but there is a real lack of tension and / or tension, and things are too slow to slow down, with the result that the film is occasionally boring. Everything is also reduced to a predictable end. Overall, I have to admit that this movie wasn't overwhelmed at all, and when it comes to Craven's filmography, Chiller would have to go down with Shocker, the sequel to Scream and The Hills Have Eyes II.
