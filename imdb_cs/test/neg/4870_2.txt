This film is filled with so many idiotic moments that you wonder how it ever happened. For example, they get into the drain from the Capitol and while they are in the canals you can see the sign pointing at the various government buildings, and then they come in the middle of the street! I very much doubt that government buildings would provide public access through urban sewers. Anyway, I gave this place 2 instead of 1 just because of its comic value. I laughed all the way when I joined the movie.
