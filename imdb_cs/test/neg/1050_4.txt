It's really a two-half movie. The first detailed description of the life and friendship of two boys (one privileged Pashtun and the other shot down Hazara) in the late 1970s before the USSR invasion works very well. Young actors turn to persuasive performances and vision in Afghanistan as soon as they have thrown the present situation into sharp relief. The real problem comes when we move on to the later stage of the story, where we join Pashtun as a person living in America. His young friend's ancient debts lead him to return to his homeland and it is really at this point when things fall apart. It is believed that the central adult character is sympathetic, but in fact acts as bullying and roaming in self-pity. It's hard to really care for him and you can't help but feel that a really interesting story is one we don't see - his childhood friend. As soon as he returns to Afghanistan, he tells himself that he fits into a series of highly coincidental coincidences. Most notably, he managed to hit his childhood enemy after all these years almost immediately (though not looking for him), despite the chaos that had consumed the country since then. This allows him to confront past demons in a way that is simply too comfortable to be credible. The resolution of the story is also conducted with horrible, youthful sentiment that undermines all the really serious points that the film can try to make. Although it is possible to begin to see characters and their abuse. lives as symbols of a state that has been torn by world politics is hard to see as a film that deals with any broader political debate. Instead, the story is reduced to the emotional path of self-discovery and healing. Unfortunately, this character is so boring and wrapped in itself that it's hard to really get involved in his story, while making a really interesting movie about Afghanistan itself is useless.
