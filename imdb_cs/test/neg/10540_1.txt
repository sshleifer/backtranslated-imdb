The best thing about film is the name, as described by both the storyline and the acting. At the very least, they can't say they didn't warn you ... Like a button labeled "Don't Power It". Segal must have exhausted things that move like planes, trains, and ships, but the plot remains the same. Under the cover guy who fights slowly but still beats like 40 mercenary types, and he doesn't even react. What amazes me is that Segal is now as big as a barn and the villains still can't hit him in the hallway with a machine gun and 50 clips of ammunition. Where do all these bullets really go? The only redeeming feature of this film is to watch Nia Peeples pound Ja rule (the real name Jeffrey Atkins doesn't sound like punk) into the floor. I could spend days watching the woman kick her leg over her shoulder like this ... especially dressed! It was just a bonus watching Jeffy get them kicked and fun hoping one of those kicks actually landed. Sorry, it's just time we got a stupid guy like a tough guy who couldn't act as a film rapper. PLEEEEEASE! Who actually came up with the idea? I would have thought it was the one who decided that Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore would pass like funny athletic angels. The only surprising step in this movie is that they don't make a politically correct thing and come to Jeffy and save the day. There is no doubt that Snoop (otherwise known by his mom as Calvin Broadus, who doesn't sound so cold again when you call him Cal) was in the movie that he would throw some marks on her and probably save Segal's life or something.
