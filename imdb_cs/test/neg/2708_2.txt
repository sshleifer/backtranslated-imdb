A film that divides the ear, a quasi-old-fashioned screwdriver that is designed to show off Madonna's comedy attributes. She really goes far to the proverbial limb that plays an out-spirited parole who tries to prove she was ready for murder (the body was found in her car's trunk after the red light was running ... great laughter). After an energetic sequence of animated credits, which is much more fun than the rest of the picture, we have nothing to look at, but the Madonna is black mascara and red lips embossed with its platinum hair and pale skin. What's next? Griffin Dunne seems defeated when he played Maddy's goalkeeper, while a bad selection supporting the cast struggles for laughter with a lousy dialogue. It is an unfortunate return to director James Foley's talent, who inadvertently allows his star to run uncontrollably in the shabby thirties (but even Katharine Hepburn in "Bringing Up Baby" had a human side). Poor. * of ****
