It is high time that American critics and fans began to uncover their undeniable, careless worship of movies like Sergio Leone 'Once Upon and Time in America'. The checkered history of this rich film (and the magnificent, fantasy myth associated with its production and many versions) contradicts its mediocrity at the narrative level. The film plunges back and forth in bouts and beginnings, its central figures melting and seemingly from a place that is surrounded by ersatz's decadence of towering systems, the details of production and a clich√© until 1984, but a wonderful cinematic confection. audience. The timeframe of the conspiracy is confusing, unusual and laborious, leading some critics to imagine that the opium figure of opium binging be the forerunner of some future 'dream reality', as well as sepia toned memories. This ham, an extremely fan-friendly apologetic interpretation, overlooks the glaring narrative discrepancies. Even in this full (?) Run time, the characters appear and disappear with an alarming sudden: the character of Deborah is clearly rooted in the child's form, the cold and unattainable "trophy" woman, nor does it indicate the gravity with which it will be restored. her relationship with post-prison noodles, the aforementioned re-union has been completely false since then. The guilty pace is somewhat to blame, some succession stagnate for too long, which means very little, suggests to a director with such a small limitation and narrative economy that he often feels obliged to usurp every iota of the screen to show off his production, fatal to a movie that contains characters so fierce and reserved. The life-trajectory of characters is presented to us as a microcosm that reflects the historical trajectory of American adolescents through the ban and its prey, ending with the (quarreling) ruin of its dying central characters (rescuing Deborah- and make-up departments). one miracle). This concept is commonplace, even banal. The character cast as pictured in one note script (written by seven Italians no less) are flat and clumsily played by all but younger actors, who at least undertake a few variants of facial expressions. This is understandable due to the almost unusable material. Some critics say that characters may seem so absorbably absorbed, but actively seek their own goals, assuming others to compete (for example, when Noodles gets out of jail, Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him if he is Whether this is what he wants and later deals with business provided that Noodles will suit). This explanation of their sudden abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily alien and serves only to emphasize the complex ends of films, whose unwavering supporters will unfortunately defend their attitudes towards film unfortunately short of meaning. Although Ennio Morricone is highly revered, it is undeniably modest and repetitive, it is an emotional editor that the scenes themselves, many violent, do not guarantee. At points, it is questionable whether Morricone watched the same movie that I was so incompatible with his work. As a paean of American filming, it succeeds in terms of mood (helped by several moves of masterly segueing between time periods) and visual (not helped by the score), but lacks narrative coherence and fluidity.
