A group of four young men attending a prestigious private school are part of an old covenant made up of their ancestors at the time of witch hunting in the late 16th century. Each of them has the strength that ages whenever they use it, and they suspect that a new kid at the academy might be from a family that was supposed to have died long ago. This new person wants a lot of everyone for himself. It's not a horror movie because it's trying to present itself. Yes, there is magic and all the supernatural things, but this is really just an action movie. Very average action movie. It focuses almost exclusively on being cool and neat and devotes little attention to the plot, which has a lot of sadly untapped space for interesting twists. But none of them has been put in, and before the movie is half bigger, you will know what is being played and by whom. <br /> <br /> There are some good scenes here and there, especially a car blast that is magically refurbished after colliding with a big set, but that's about it. Worse yet, director Renny Harlin, who has some fun, if not clever movies, relies on tear-off metal music and too sexy to carry the film, making it probably the saddest "horror" movie from the disastrous "Alone in the dark." It's not as bad as "Alone in the Dark" because a few neat scenes are actually slippery and not ridiculously incompetent, but in the end it's the best movie that can hope it's a nice and cozy home on a late night cable. 3/10 <br /> <br /> Rated PG-13: Violent Action
