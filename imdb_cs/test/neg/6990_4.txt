Why is it that virtual "x-rated video games" women can speak through the mouth, but the virtual combat champion Dante must use a combination of telepathy and through dramatic facial expressions? I think they either needed someone who looked more like a villain (Michael Bermard's big brown doe eyes do not feel exactly fear in the hearts of goodness, no one, except perhaps the cast of directors who consistently threw him as a thief or a heroic "evil boy.") OR they needed him to use his real voice (and move his mouth), and maybe give him a costume that wouldn't let him endure as a painful thumb while walking down the street. (but of course it is the future and we must assume that bad fashion is considered a norm.)
