This film starts on the wrong leg and never gets it. The first scene shows the Life Flight helicopter landing and you can see the mountains clearly behind the window. For those of you who may not have been in Houston, there's no change in height. The city sits just above sea level and 5 ft. The slope is considered a great hill. To go with this scenery, all the shots outside the hospital immediately tell the viewer they are not in Houston. Trees are all missing leaves or are pine trees, neither of which Houston has the power. Even the hospital itself is very incredible. Memorial Hermann Hospital is one of the best hospitals in the United States and sits amidst a cape in the Medical District, just a few miles from downtown Houston, but each of the hospital's external shots shows that the hospital is in the suburbs or even the one who in charge of the real tropical storm part of the movie, he went out because the numerous radar shots were bad. The first radar picture in the movie is Hurrican Hugo hitting South Carolina. Later we will see Kris Kristofferson leave her job and one of his assistants tells him that Alison is moving back south through Houston, but the radar image he shows has Alison clearly moving north of the Gulf of Mexico to Houston ... probably first landing Alison. <br /> <br /> It's not that bad about acting. JoBeth Williams, Kris Kristofferson and Rick Schroder do a decent job because they think it's a direct TV movie. The storyline is decent and the fact that it's based on a true story is a little more fun. My one problem with acting is the image of the Houstonans with great strong Southern accents. and the general audience does exactly what it should: have fun. If you are looking for a factual description of what happened to the city of Houston in June 2001, you will be disappointed. One thing to keep in mind before showing this movie is that it is based solely on the evacuation of Hermann Hermann Hospital and not on Tropical Storm Alison and the impact on the Houston subway itself. If you are looking for a de facto description of the impact of Tropical Storm Alison on the subway in Houston, I can propose to track the weather stories of the meteorological channel for Tropical Storm Alison. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of *****
