Not bad performance. Whoopi plays pretty well. Nevertheless, the story and situation cannot be believed (forced PC stereotypes). Sometimes they are good Jews and Blacks against evil White Christians (ho-hum). Typical Hollywood fantasy. The film has its moments, but it is not the one that I would recommend to go out of the way.
