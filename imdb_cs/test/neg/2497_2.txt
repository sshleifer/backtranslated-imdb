Six stars to portray Paul Newman General Groves, negative four to include a highly fictional event where the truth is well documented. In fact, Michael Merriman did not exist. His character - or at least his fate - is based loosely on it by Louis Slotin, a Canadian physicist who did not come to Los Alamos until after the war. In May 1946 he drove his deadly "tail of the dragon". This is a critical point. The effects of hard radiation on the human body were not known until they were observed in Hiroshima and Nagasaki explosion victims. If someone died of Los Alamos radiation poisoning before the Trinity test, it is very possible that scientists would suddenly stop their work and history would change. Whether for better or worse, we can only speculate. Someone should ask producers and director if they have added Merriman's character for dramatic effect or have produced an anti-nuclear message. For a more consistent and accurate handling of the Los Alamos events during the Manhattan Project, see TV movie, "First Day", or better yet, read Peter Wyden's book on which it is based.
