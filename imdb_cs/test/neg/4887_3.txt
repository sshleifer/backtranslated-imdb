I bought this one for a few dollars in a local video store when they cleared their tapes for DVD. I doubt it will replace this place, somehow. I couldn't say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's very boring. No real cannibal scenes. Me Me Lai is not pretty naked enough time (only about 4 or 5 times). And it's not the Thai goddess I expected. So two of my reasons for watching this movie have been eliminated. There is some heavy animal violence here for those who have such kind of stuff. The big fight between the mongoose and the big snake is bloody enough. Also torture animals, some of which are real and some fake. Fortunately, it's fake somewhat funny, but the real one is just a little scary. Generally speaking, it's a 70's movie - too long, underdeveloped, not as deep as it would be. . But it's different, isn't it? ONE AND HALF STARS!
