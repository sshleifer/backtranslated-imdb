License fees track this waste, And pay for it with hard-earned money? Without humor, no hint of laughter, God knows how he won the BAFTA! Now we have been exposed to "Eastenders" for twenty years. When, when is a great British public seeing this terrible soap at what it is? Crass Pap! This program no longer distorts the East End reality in London than everyday life in Beirut and has never done. Eastenders I know (real) are kind, courageous, hardworking and loyal. And one of their greatest attributes is humor. They were Eastenders who went through the worst of the London lightning and still held two fingers on Hitler. And what do we see on our screens for five days a week (including omnibus)? Nothing but a bunch of sighing, lamentation, "dead from the neck" that seem to do something other than sit in a pub all day. What a great advert for Britain is !! Do writers really believe this garbage they are pumping out? Obviously, the audience-minded part of the public is doing it, but then I heard that someone can be brainwashed to believe anything.
