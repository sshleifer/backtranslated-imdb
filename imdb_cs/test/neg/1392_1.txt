What is it now - the days when minority comedians feel it's okay to insult their minority and expect to get rid of it? Carlos Mencia is not George Lopez. There is a difference. When I watch comedian Carlos Mencia, I think he hates his own people. And more than that, I think he was forced to model his show as "Hispanic / Latino / Spanish" version of Dave Chappelle's show. What a terrible mistake. (Note to Mencia: Please do not make "Block Party". Just as I would like to see Santana, Tierra, El Chicano, Christina Agullaria, Jennifer Lopez, Shakira and the reunion of "Xica da Silva" on one scene, no) Carlos Mencia likes to use the word "beaners" just as Dave Chappelle liked to use the word "n". It is neither funny nor acceptable, even if it is from "their own people". Carols Mencia also likes to say, "If you are offended, too bad". It is not an insult, it is a defense because of what is said and asked to be accepted. Carols Mencia goes on - he doesn't respect everyone for what he supposes to be a comedy. It's not a comedy, it's not funny. There is a subtlety that they are able to look at themselves and others to laugh out of the comedy and not laugh out of enforcing stereotypes that another race believed in the beginning. Mind Mencia needs polishing because Carlos Mencia needs polishing. Find out what's funny and not what sets more prejudices in motion and then - do it. In the meantime, the show, Mind Mencia is a passage.
