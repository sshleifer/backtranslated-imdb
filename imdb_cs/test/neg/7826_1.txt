The story is incoherent and poorly written. We get threads and a possible hook in the act, just to see him disappear. If a writer bothered to read his work carefully, it would be obvious that Madsden's initial problem and the encounter with the "bad" girl indicate that there will be a problem with them when they try to solve his problem. The problem is nowhere. The relationship goes nowhere. There is no sexual tension in any of the relationships. Nobody digs anyone and nobody is. Writing and directing is ridiculous. You feel that someone is struggling with the mess and pushing the story by trying to get some excitement. Is none. The writer / director is simply a beginner whose confused effort has somehow become a film. From simple mistakes like "... they took polaroids ..." - in Japan in 2007? insulting mistakes, such as nudity for eroticism, make this an insult. You can't make them much worse. And the 'Madsden' plaster on the talent list made producers think they would have some success. He barely acts. Asia is definitely ... and the result is some pantographic heroism. <br /> <br /> Give him a big mistake.
