In the year when "Singin 'in the Rain" and "High Noon" were released, this crowded Turkey somehow won an Oscar for Best Picture. Half of the film is nothing but a circus performance. The other half is soap opera and melodrama. Heston and Wilde both outperformed, though they are limiting models compared to the annoying Hutton. Hutton, who played the middle-bar artist, acts as a jealous high school student in a poorly-produced school. Grahame is the only cast member to turn in decent performance. DeMille has no interest in telling a good story, just in creating excessive spectacles, no matter how boring.
