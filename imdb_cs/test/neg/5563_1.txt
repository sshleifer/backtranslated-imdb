What should I say? I only saw the shock of curiosity, and that's really a shame ... I grew up in Brittany with stories about Celtic legends and spent 5 years in Rennes, the city where this movie says it's happening ... Shame on Neither the actor nor the camera from this film ever came to Rennes. They could at least choose a city, or probably a forest, but neither SEEM as Brittany nor Rennes ... And when he calls it a Celtic legend, it's really a spectator fool. Besides the details, it could have been a good movie, but it's crap. Stupid script, silly characters and no originality. Definitely avoid.
