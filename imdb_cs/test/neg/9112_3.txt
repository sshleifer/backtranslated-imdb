This film is terribly suffering from "Julian Grant" and his incompetent leadership, Steve Guttenberg, who is trying to win the Bruce Willis competition! Writing is a reckless Hollywood action thriller; Sean Bean - one of my favorites - David Fraser and Kim Coates give a decent performance. The film is definitely below average. 3 out of 10! I was wondering what the Hollywood studios thought, actually putting in the hands of a weak director like Grant. And I'd like to tell Sean Bean "what you were thinking, even when you're thinking about participating in such a movie, after such great movies as GoldenEye, Ronin and Patriot Games!"
