"Red Sonja" is faulty, weak and missing. The campground is not good either. There are only two good things about "Red Sonja"; Costumes (though the Red Sonja costume is ridiculous. Ironically, a girl who is afraid that her men will be touched because she is raped still chooses so little clothes, even when it rains.) Ennio Morricone. Yet the film is somewhat observable, but we do not recommend it. The story is very simple and didn't bother to be interesting. The story could be forgotten if there were some good action sequences and some humor, both are present, but they are seriously wrong in many ways. The film is taken too seriously and tries to impress, but fails completely. Brigitte Nielsen is a terrible leading lady. I don't know who's the worse; Her or Arnie and above; He can't act. There is absolutely no chemistry between the two characters, which makes the love story unbelievable. Even worse was Sandahl Bergman as the main villain who acts more than a paper bag. Ronald Lacey was somewhat good in his role, but my God looked terrible, changed so much since his (well-known) role in the "lost armed robber". Maybe it had something to do with his illness that forced his life in 1991? And by the way, what was wrong with all those "lost ark robbers" in this movie? In addition to the role of Ronald Lacey, Pat Roach, Terry Richards and Tutte Lemkow, they appeared in the role, it seemed to be some sort of "lost armed robber". Interesting is during fighting, although some of them are useless and weak. <br /> <br /> It's really awesome for fans of the fantasy genre. <br/> <br/> 4/10
