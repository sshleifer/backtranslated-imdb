Italian horror champion Dario Argento is called a lot of bad things to non-fans. And he deserves absolutely no will. In fact, every time I hear something wrong about Argento- I think he really talks about Michele Soavi. He just does not get the same amount of attention because his films have never been so successful in theaters. His best film - Cemetery Man 1994 - was probably his least successful. Or just didn't get the attention he deserved because after that, he left the film and went to directing television. He never came back. So people really don't know how worse his other films are, because by the time they saw them, Italian horror fans are already fans of aesthetics. Which means you have to accept the fact that they have almost no meaning and are usually very unattractive movies. This is where the church goes out of its packaging. Because visually, it's so cheap and ancient, you can feel dust. But he also has his spell, though there are few. The camera is really arresting them and the music score is extremely complicated and big. Since Argento is why people saw the work of Soavi, I don't know who would capture the church before Argento's Suspiria and Deep Red. Soavi is a little hack. A bit like Italian Mick Garris - the highest example of a director who prefers style to substance. The defects of the church are constant and abundant. The film starts with a somewhat interesting prologue that shows knights on white horses, who are recharged by a village village similar to what you see in any Robin Hood adaptation, some time ago. These scenes are intense enough, energetic and quickly get to the point. Then we cut to the present, where the film style takes over. Yeah, the movie's okay to see. And about 35 minutes now, in the 1980s, anywhere in Italy, the film is so interesting that we get to the slowly emerging horror elements. So now we know that the purpose of the film is to build horror. And it's a decent build, for the most part. But as the film approaches half the point, we realize how the film moves and ... nothing happens. The storyline is very simple. I think. Two people who work in a church, one as a book catalogist and the other as a wall art restorer, discover a scroll / bible that one thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or an invaluable artifact they can sell. and get rich. So he follows his "map" only to reveal the power beneath the church to hallucinate him, while slowly becoming a demon that hallucinates everyone else. So while he is doing his demonic work, someone who has gone through strength will kill himself in a way that will capture everyone in the church, while the demon 'contagen' will spread to everyone leaving a black preacher and a little girl who slips out of the church every night to go to Club as the only 2 people who can stop the spread of spread outside the church wall. This seems to sound action and Soavi's style is much more lethargic than Argento. But I've never seen an attempt at a surrealistic movie that is so dull. No no. Nothing happens in the whole movie! I've seen expressionist (or impressionist, I'm not a film school super-grad) movies before, but most of them actually show things that are happening (John Carpenter's Halloween for One). Follows quite closely in the footsteps of Lambert Bava's demons (from Argento co-produced). We showed up at the place where the pile of people gathered, one turns into a demon, the others are isolated, the man infects everyone except the survivors, then the demons either get out - infecting the world, or getting the survivors when demons die. This film puts all the same elements in place. Except, unlike Argento's work, nothing happens. Well, there are a few things going on. But only one bizarre succession has much more fun demo movies on Lamberto. A random female neck is impaled by a demon using a part of the fence that he pulls out of the floor. What's bizarre about it? It happens about two dozen people. What they do? Nothing. She dies, her head in a detailed source of blood. But all these people don't even notice it, even if it is done in a simple view and not less than 8 feet away. Maybe 4 people will notice that the demon has started to strike everyone he can while running towards her, so they get out of the way. She is killed and shot after she dies, all just sitting around is quiet while the boy plays the saxophone. No no. That will happen. This is more than logically incoherent - it's just stupid. The scene suggests that a woman just disappears and no one has seen her. Everyone just forgot it. And this 15-second thing is the only thing that happens in the movie. I'm not saying it's the only violence, gore, or the murder we see. It is not. It's the only thing we can say is happening. For example, in one scene a beautiful woman sees in a mirror that looked old and ugly. She starts pulling her skin on her face, but when she reappears a few minutes later - no scratches. People are absorbed by fish and their faces are squeezed by subway cars. But later they appear as totally uninjured members of an obsessed cult, in a scene that commits the ultimate horror heresy - replicates the famous scene from Roman Polanski's masterpiece of 1968, Rosemary's Baby, the greatest horror film ever made. Even if Argento did, I'd be furious!
