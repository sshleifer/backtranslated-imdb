Great concept, perfect characterization and voices, but a complete waste of time. The real shame, because it had a higher goal, was probably not a bomb that was (was); too addicted to scatological humor, to start with. I am impressed by the comments from "educated" reviewers who refer to "good science" behind this piece of child waste. Unlike "Finding Nemo", where (with a little suspension of infidelity) attention to detail was overwhelming and science was as good as the context would allow, "Osmosis Jones" was utter nonsense; Don't worry about science. A humor aimed at eight-year-olds, but a subject more suitable for some non-professional teens.
