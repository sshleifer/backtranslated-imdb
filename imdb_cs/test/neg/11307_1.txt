Horrible Horrible movie, I still can't believe my friend saw me see! No conspiracy, bad behavior, unreal scenes and a very stupid dialogue. All I have to say is that this movie is the worst movie I've seen and it's worse than Halloween III, which I put 0 stars too. So I give him 0 stars and 0 of 10, well on tu 1, but you get a point.
