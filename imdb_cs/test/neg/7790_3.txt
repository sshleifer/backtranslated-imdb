I once had a conversation with my parents who told me that British film visitors in the 1940s and 1950s would check the country of origin of the film before they saw it. No matter what the conspiracy was or who it was, if it was an American movie, people would want to see it and if they were British they wouldn't want to see it. It might sound like a ridiculous generalization, but after seeing the FOREIGN HEART, I understand why people preferred American cinema to the home variety in those days. British fortune lacked working class members in the 1940s and this shows in this film. They all speak in English of the dee daa upper class accent, which makes the British royal family the tip of the working class and what it does is to alienate a large number of potential British viewers who would undoubtedly watch Jimmy Cagney in WHITE HEAT because people should if the relatives were certainly not empatized with a violent gangster in cinematographic terms more than any first-class English shrinkage in 1949. That's fun, the reason people go to cinemas. Even the characters' names seem bizarre - Leonora! How many Britons were named Leonora in 1949? And the protagonists drink cocktails. And they use words as "austere". You get the feeling that it was not marketed to the British audience in 1949. But why should it be if most British moviegoers were waiting in cinemas to watch much more fun US imports? Watching ATSONIZED HEART IN 2005 I was amazed at how it all was, in fact, it's so old that I thought it might be the spoof of THE HARRY ENDFIELD SHOW. What I did not believe was the fact that these types of films approached the sinking of the British film industry, an industry that did not rise until American money was invested in a crowd of enjoyers such as ZULU, ALFIE and James Bond
