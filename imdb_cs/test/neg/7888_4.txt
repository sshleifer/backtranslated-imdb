Leon Errol manages his double role as uncle Matt Lindsay and Lord Basil Epping, but I have problems with the "Mexican Spitfire" because they are all brought up to produce misidentities and they are pre-wired. Errol is funny as stuffy Lord Epping, but I would prefer much more wit and much less repetition. <br /> <br />
