To begin with, let me say that I am not a very artistic person and that I do not have a "new" art. As has been said, this film is absolutely crazy, and in my opinion it is not crazy in a good way. The film is filmed in black and white with a series of very loosely linked stories and is a film for those who can look at modern art and say "wow, I feel the energy and passion of this image." The only reason I gave this movie 3 out of 10 is that I was actually able to laugh at some parts, but mainly laughed at the film's utter insanity. Two of the characters throw chairs on the lawn, do what these characters did, I have no idea. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
