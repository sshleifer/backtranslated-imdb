I've seen Shallow Grave years ago, and * that * was one of those movies that I kept in mind for a very long time. It was intense from start to finish and with a number of sudden twists. But all these things made sense. I can't say the same thing about dead bodies. Above the title is a subtitle that claims to be "even better than a shallow grave". This is a big lie. Dead bodies lose strength and become much less convincing during the movie. Two supporting figures, for example, proved to be much less innocent than it seemed to be the first. This could work as a surprise, but it didn't surprise me. I saw it a few minutes ago and * that there is a big difference with a shallow grave. Another thing I need to mention is that the characters in this movie often don't respond very realistically. It behaves more often when the film reaches the end. It would be much more interesting for me if some of the characters stayed completely innocent and didn't know what was going on. For contrast, it would be better, for example, with Tommy and his friend, who must carry * huge * secrets. But no, for some stupid reason, the creators of this film have decided that all the characters should show their darkest sides. It doesn't work in a movie like this. The end felt like an open end. He left me with an unsatisfied feeling. I expected so much more. <br /> <br /> At first I would give this movie six stars because it's not a bad movie. I liked watching it. Most of the time. But sometimes I saw some really bad acting and unrealistic scenes and because of the unsatisfactory open end, I hold four stars this time. And because it is a mistake, I spend time and money. Unlike the Shallow Grave, I will probably soon forget the dead bodies. It's just not such a special movie. <br /> <br /> Manufacturers could do a much better job with this movie. It's a pity not.
