Well ... I like Patricia Kaas. She is a beautiful lady and a very talented and versatile singer. Her acting in this film is more than competent and, in my view, the only redemption of this film. It gently captures the essence of a solitary singer with a very serious problem. However, what I really don't like about the movie is the shameless location of the product for the well-known French chain of hotels. The other thing is that the story seems to praise for as long as it really decides what the film is and what it wants to be. You can say positively that the film is not predictable, but you can also say that it is simply boring because of lack of cohesion. There are some nice shots in the movie you can't help thinking that all the parts just don't add to anything at all. It's really a shame because Kaas really shines in this movie.
