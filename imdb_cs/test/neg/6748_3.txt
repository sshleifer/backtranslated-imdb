Now there's a thing - to make this movie work, you'll have to accept the following - the woman who is murdered is alive at the end of the movie, the detective stops interrogating the dead woman's fianc√©e because the journalist asked him No, and the same reporter struck by a good-looking blonde dragged into a nightclub for suspicious behavior, she ends up getting married in exchange for leaving her out of the hook. Are you following me? I can't tell you how many times I stopped and flipped the image to repeat scenes that just didn't make any sense. Eventually, a blonde (Claudia Dell) and a reporter (Richard Hemingway) remained married, but I have no idea how they came to this decision. In fact, I can't figure out how the filmmaker came up to do it. I suppose there is some fun value here just for utter nonsense, but it would be nice if a few pieces fit into it. Yet I'm not ready to add this to my Top Ten Worst list. I think the night scene with the feathered ladies could save her. But why was it in the movie? I just don't know.
