First of all, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this movie. However, it said, I can't say it was a "good" movie. I went to the theater with quite low expectations (something I learned to do). I'm glad I did, because the storyline and the development were not stellar. The jokes were humor of low quality. But I was in the right spirit to enjoy them. <br /> <br /> I wasn't the only one. In fact, the whole theater laughed loudly. I didn't hear anyone complain when the movie was over. I even saw one man drop out of his chair and laugh! But again, I have to warn you, Grandma's boy is not the highest quality movie. It's a funny (though low-brow) movie, and if you're going the right way, you'll really enjoy it. And don't take children.
