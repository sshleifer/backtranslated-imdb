I suggest, if you have already seen the original American Graffiti, you don't see this movie. If you haven't seen the original, I still don't recommend it, but it will be much less painful to watch. The characters from the first movie are great and you joined them in the end. This film tries to show how bad their lives have become. It's a chore to watch! On New Year's Eve in 1964, '65, '66 and '67 we have four stories about the characters from the first movie. In '64 we have John Milner (Paul Le Mat), who is now a professional drag racer. She meets strange girl Eva, and although his plot doesn't go anywhere, it's the best of four. In 1965, we have a toad (Charles Martin Smith) who is stuck in Vietnam and more than anything else he wants. They're trying to find ways to get hurt or do stupid things. In '66, we got Debbie (Candy Clark), a girl who Toad picked up in the first movie. Now hippie smoking and I'm not really sure what her plot was. It was her visit to the concert ... nothing happened. Finally, in 1967, Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Laurie Bolander (Cindy Williams) have problems with marriage ending in an anti-war rally and police action. None of these stories is very good. The script in some parts contains a very, very bad dialogue. These poor figures I enjoyed in the first movie ended up where they were here ... why? Why was this continuation done? I think if it were a continuation, it had to be a Vietnam war and a hippie and a police action, but the real thing is that this movie shouldn't be done. The direction was stylish, but it's just a huge headache. Each story has a different style. Milner is just plain (depending on how you watch it) on a wide screen and is filmed as the rest of the movie should be. Toad's graph was taken at 16mm and what it means is a bad looking image, which is the size of a small frame in the middle of the screen. Debbie's plot is filmed on multiple screens. One screen could be in one place, but for a good majority it is from two to twenty screens at once. Don't bother trying to watch the screens because there's nothing going on. Steve and Laurie's plot have the strangest shooting style. It is a style that really means nothing and is stupid and meaningless. Instead of just a widescreen wide screen, it's a wide screen that looks like a full-screen widescreen. Although I don't like others, at least I understand what's going on, this just doesn't make sense. Music is the thrift of this movie, not that it could save! Bob Dylan, Simon and Grafunkel, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and dozens more have nice songs. They don't save this function, they just do it a little better than it is. It's still bad! Overall, this is an unnecessary sequel. Any fan of the original should avoid this faint continuation! <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 110 minutes. PG for language, drug use and violence
