If you are a kid who likes fairy tales "real life" adventure, see. If you like youth movies for kids, why don't you see it? :) If you are a parent about to see a movie with your children, you are a better way to opt for a squirrel! <br /> <br /> The start of this movie was a bit funny, and set up some good spaces for events. But after such a humorous presentation of characters, settings and potential conflicts, the story became a bit boring. When more or less the same thing happens for the third and fourth time, the word "predictable" repeatedly comes to mind as well as parts of a spoiled LP or those you really hate. And the culmination of a conspiracy ... * sigh * ... of the poor, the poor, the poor!
