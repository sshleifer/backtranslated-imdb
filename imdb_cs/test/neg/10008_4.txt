The rich ranch horses in Buenos Aires have a long-term policy of non-trading with Crawfords of Manhattan, but what happens when a Muslim Latin son falls to a certain Crawford with bright eyes, blonde hair and some energetic movements on the dance floor? 20th Century Musical-Fox has a shiny veneer, but it seems to be a little frayed around the edges. It's very hard on the frenetic, gymnastic-like dance, extremely thin story. Betty Grable (eleventh hour replacement for Alice Faye) is up, even when paired with leaded Don Amech (in brown make-up and smooth hair). Also good: Charlotte Greenwood as auntie Aunt Betty, a limousine driver who always sleeps on this job and Carmen Miranda plays herself (who else?). Argentina's stock footage has far surpassed the action shot on Fox's backlot, and some of the supportive performances are pretty terrible. At the time of the big race finals, most spectators will have enough. * 1/2 from ****
