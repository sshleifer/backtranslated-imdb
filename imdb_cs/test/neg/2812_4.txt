Reports of the brilliance of this film seem to be greatly exaggerated, and if other reviewers have not followed another film, I don't see how anyone can find this film anything other than a boring, incomprehensible, clumsy, elongated and sometimes unbearably irritating. . I'm not some horror fanatic. I love j-horrors and euro-horrors of American horrors every day, but I feel the need to warn all potential viewers of this movie before investing two hours of life in it. It could have been that big. The reporter explores a series of bizarre deaths and events that seem to be unconnected, but many unintelligible tropics seem to unite them - dead pigeons, noisy sounds, the presence of strangely bound knots ... Our reporter goes from person to person Interview with them shooting them and then on. Three important characters belong to this tangle of people, a young, shy psychic girl, an extremely irritating, crazy psychic, and a crazy old woman and her boy whose meaning is not revealed later. The problem is that the movie is not remotely interesting, which makes its two-hour run unforgivable. It's not even remotely scary or scary. Probably scary scenes, such as ghoul faces, are being made incredibly bad, they are displayed twice or worse when we tell us it will happen. Other techniques such as telling us that the family just interviewed "died five days later" just didn't worry me, let alone slightly crawled. The film rises a bit, as our reporter, cameraman, psychic and cursed woman goes to the village to "remove" the curse that unites all these deaths. At that time, however, I was in a state of catatonic boredom and I couldn't care less, so all the creepy cameras and shocks were wasted on me. "Final Tape" is pretty good, but I gave up again and wanted this movie to end. Boring and boring, not scary and not scary, I would advise you to stay away from Noroi. He has promising moments, but this is a movie that was poorly made and not worth your time.
