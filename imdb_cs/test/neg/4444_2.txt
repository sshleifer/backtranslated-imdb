The Altman Quintet must be considered more than just wrong: As many other reviewers have pointed out, the thoughts behind the film and some of the ways to display these ideas should work - and still do very little in this difficult movie. . Partially hazy camera lens - I remarked to my wife that it must be the most disturbing overhead I have ever seen - never let me get into the world of film. <br /> <br /> In general, there are serious problems with mise-en-scene. It is clear that no small number of ideas have interfered with factors such as costume and production design, but neither of them is very effective in inducing a trusted world. Maybe it's a matter of scale; the film is so incredibly tied that I laughed out loud as soon as there were five million people living in the city. (Yes, I understand the limitations of the film's budget. Perhaps the pictures here and there have helped.) In all the unsatisfactory movies I've ever seen. Great ideas and big metaphors don't always go through art - it's just part of the game.
