Piranha begins as expected, silly white people will discover new lands and use them. For a moment I thought it could be a cannibal movie. It starts as many others, shows nothing but shots from the pristine Amazon rainforest. I know it can be Florida. At this point you imagine some animal mutilation or natives. Instead, you get William Smith's acting talent, who played in L.A. Vice and Angels Hard Hard. He plays Caribe, the acclaimed hunter I would describe as Jack Palance Light. He's bigger in character, but not quite good at Jack Palance. As for the natives, you won't get so many. Where's the piranha? Should I still ask that? Caribe is hunting people now, I think. He doesn't really follow anyone until the end of the movie, just stares at them. Caribe races with one of the motorcycle tourists in the too dramatic way of Smokey and Bandit. The challenge for a motorcycle is for no reason other than the action order. I can't tell you how many times I've seen a tourist challenge that's unknown to jungle motorcycle racing. Never really. They live, die? Will you care? Who wants to race on motorcycles? Attention: this film contains an extreme dry appearance. My advice is to rent Jack Palance classics like Craze.
