Following Dylan Moran's star of the enchanting misanthrope bookstore owner in the Surrealist sitcom Black Books, I saw his comic potential begging to be used in a theater or larger film trip. This first big screen in the lead role (he had a portrait as Rufus Thief in Notting Hill) had promises of promise, but as a strained Steve Coogan vehicle, a release officer, has too many folds that should be pressed in Preproduction. The storyline is so intricate that I didn't bother to repeat the finer details (the script has every character for us) and the laughter comes from show-business jokes. Michael Caine is pompous who ran Richard III's production - updated to the Nazi occupation (one of the few real laughs, a satirical blow to Ian McKellen), in which everyone forever makes Hitler's greeting every time they come on the scene. The convincing Dylan that he should act on his own should be a conceptual act that should steal money from some harmless gangsters through his prowess. Followed by confusion (both on screen and in the audience), Dylan and the daughter of one of the gangsters are blissful sub-conspiracies, and congratulations on Dylan dressing up in a special dress and making funny accents. Michael Caine adds some choices and Dylan's comic timing is on the money, so why isn't it good? It has a certain charm you would expect from movie 4, but it also has a premature baby girl acting as a compass in a confused and irrelevant plot - not in writing on screen 101. The exposition obscures everything else. You want to see Moran and Caine acting like a comic foil as they appeared at the beginning, but pairing lost their charisma when they're at the end. Actors are a fun, though unpredictable effort. It should come on TV during a rainy Tuesday afternoon, then you. Otherwise, you should better track your old Black Books videos or rent Withnail & I.
