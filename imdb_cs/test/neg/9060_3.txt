It's really bad that John Candy has lost unnecessarily his abilities on so many horrible movies (Delirious, Wagons East, who is Harry Crumb ?, etc. This one may have just a few laughs, but it's usually just really bad individuals and stupid physical stuff) We honor the memory of this comic by remembering things like airplanes, trains and cars and Uncle Buck.
