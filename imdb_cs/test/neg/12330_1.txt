There is no way to avoid a comparison between Cat in the Hat and the Grinch Who Table Christmas, so let's get this part out of the way. First, let me start by thinking that Grinch was an underrated and underrated movie. The cat was ... well, just awful. Jim Carey has been cast because he is a brilliant physical comedian and is fearlessly committed to overcoming the outrageous characters. Mike Myers fell back on his old trick bag. Why, Why, Why Mike Myers ??? Children could care less and Austin Powers' demographic will not spy on this movie. So, what was studio thinking? The cat was probably also associated with Linda Richmond. Can we talk? Why New York Accent? Not quite in line with what Dr. Seuss wrote. Myers was even allowed to sneak into the Scottish Shtick. I was wondering how many different directors and studios they were trying to replace before giving up and saying "as long as you don't tell fahklempt", you can keep the accents. "Meyers never seemed to find any kind of comfort, either with costume, makeup or dialogue. <br /> <br /> There were few jokes that were inappropriate. When Myers picked up the garden hoe and delivered the camera: "dirty", everything except the rim shot was missing, and it wouldn't help. <br /> <br /> The same people who created "Whoville" clearly had a hand in the creation of the city and houses in 'Cat'. and the props were very appealing, giving the viewer a great deal of distraction from bad writing, direction, and Myers, and Dakota Fanning was the only actor who knew she was in a movie based on Dr. Seuss' classic, and remained faithful to the genre. > <br /> Call SPCA, this cat should be castrated and never reproduced again.
