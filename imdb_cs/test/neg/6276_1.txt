This movie looked like out-ofs of deleted scenes from high school movie class experiment. It didn't make sense! It was well done, but I'm just sorry because of the character because they had to appear in this slop. Foreign machines were created with Pentium I technology and no creativity, they were crabs! Illuminated and barely seen strangers were Frisbees with their feet. WHERE THE TRIPODS WERE? Editing by director / writer / producer / make-up artist / gripper Latt, he jumps all over the place, with some scenes repeated several times. Most of them seemed to be filmed as a result of Hurricane Katrina. Next time Latt wants to make a movie, someone has to hit him. Just in 2005 he made 11 films! This does not include credits for writing, editing, directing, or visual effects on other movies. If the others are such a snot-load, then he's just making fun of us. This was Spielberg's torn film, nothing more. I look forward to Latt's "BackBroke Ridge", "X-Man IIV", "The Hillocks Have Eyes."
