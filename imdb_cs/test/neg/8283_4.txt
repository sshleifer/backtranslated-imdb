Interesting slasher movie with more suspects. Includes a typical girl flashing her bosom (Denise Cheshire) when she changes in a swimsuit, a creepy suspect - each one could do the deed, expecting the breast to break through to get the ball (Linnea Quigley), very unusual forward pass, more bare breasts, track and field action that will NOT be at the Summer Olympics, and a mysterious secret. <br /> <br /> breaking end. No, there's more. Doesn't that guy die? I bet Anne (Patch Mackenzie) is not planning any further visits at home soon. <br /> <br /> If you like teen slasher movies, can you be perverse, even if all the actresses are over 18?
