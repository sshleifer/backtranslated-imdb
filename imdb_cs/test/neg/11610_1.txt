In my local video store they have a special place for two girls and a guy. It's a really long joke. The clerk leases it for free. They value their customers too much to let them lose their hard earned money on it. <br /> <br /> I was very surprised to find that people gave this film a good overview. Maybe someone can explain to me. (Or maybe the positive comments were jokes? Did people put them in the movie? Maybe the director's / writer's mother's?) \ t compared.
