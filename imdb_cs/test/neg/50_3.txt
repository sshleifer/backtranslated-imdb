When I was a child, my parents borrowed a lot of horror movies. We loved them, even though they were bad, they made some joy. It was a movie that is hard to review because I only saw it once as a child, but it's nothing I want to track down again, so I can do a more detailed overview. The story has an old legend of a horror actor dying. It seems to remember that he was acting a bit like Vincent Price without being sympathetic and elegant. He commits murder and dies, but what is it? Is the movie already? No, because some children capture the body for some reason and are ready for a fun night when they are killed by the ham behind the grave. I remember that the murders were nothing so special after the first couple, and I remember that this film was rather disappointing. He seemed to have a good presumption, but it just couldn't deliver the goods because more cold killings were needed and the super horror actor needed to add a bit to his repertoire.
