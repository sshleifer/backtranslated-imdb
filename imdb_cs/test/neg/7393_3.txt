Well, they sent it on TV between midnight and 2:00 pm - it seems like it's the right time to watch it, and then go to sleep later ... <br /> <br /> No, actually it it didn't work out to my expectations. I think the Dogma concept is good because the film will then get closer to what's really going on between the characters involved by cutting out all the unnecessary effects and music from the mood making. But again, this concept requires some interesting action between the characters. I cannot say that I know King Lear (Shakespeare version) very well, if I knew the game, I should probably have been able to predict a large part of the movie. Well, the crisis can bring the best and the worst aspects of the character - and we're definitely seeing some bad things. Oh yes, the color of civilization and culture can be very thin and behind this color you can find an animal. If you then compare it with "Italiensk pro begyndere" (Italian for beginners) or "Mifunes sidste sang" (the last song of Mifune), you see the same thing, but the opposite: The crisis can certainly bring people a glance at their lives in a more constructive way. And if you dare, you can win. When the movie was over, I thought, "That's why I haven't seen it yet ..." The film has its own beauty. The quality of the work of cameraman, actors, etc. is good. But the script might need something more. The plot may not hurt.
