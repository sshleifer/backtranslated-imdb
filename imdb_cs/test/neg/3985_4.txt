I saw this movie shortly after watching Moonlight & Valentino with Elizabeth Perkins, Gwyneth Platrow, Whoopi Goldberg and Kathleen Turner. There are many similarities between the two movies. Both have large castings and good dealings. They both have nurses' stock figures that are very different, offensive stepmother, friend / confidant, emotionally unavailable father, dead mother, and surprise lover. Both films have experience of life-changing realization, and both films suffer from a "love that controls all sentiment". Both add a little titration with Cameron Diaz in black underwear and a partial back shot of Gwyneth Paltrow naked. Both films seem to have been invented as if the writers of the films were based on market research. and said, "Okay, there is a market for relationships about relationships between women, so I'll write about two sisters with offensive stepmother?" In other words, instead of a drama based on the truth of the relationship, this relationship is invented to match the dramatic situation. It seems forced, characters don't seem real, relationships are incredible. The distinction of tension between characters is simple with simple apologies that completely shame years and leave everyone feeling warm and fuzzy at any time. It just isn't real. Romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> In Her Shoes characters are somewhat crowded than Moonlight & Valentino, especially a stepmother. Sydelle Feller is so bad that it's hard to believe her father will stay with her, or even take her to the top. <br /> <br /> If you like Moonlight & Valentino well. Pleasant performances, in fact, actors bring depth to their parts that go beyond the fabricated sentiment of scripts.
