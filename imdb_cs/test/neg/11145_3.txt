All the hype! All additions! I was confused that I missed the big screen. Where this film worked, it was in little detail. In all other cases, it failed. Arnold has done so much better in recent years. I thought the days of the commando and the last action hero were out of our lives. Sadly, this film goes to the smallest common denominator and reduces Arnold to a gaudy, hoarse, wrinkled muscle that simply knows how to fire weapons and throw things away. At the last moment of the clich√© (and once again), which was predictable from the beginning, we see a glimpse of an actor who proved to be more than what he was paid for at the beginning of his career. I wasn't interested in the film because it never broke new ground or anywhere else than where you expected it.
