Sometimes funny but generally boring. I met Robert Hegyes of Welcome back Carter (aka Epstein) as a former celebrity criminal. There is a knee slapped, gut busting scene with a French lady who has a bad reaction to American food. S. Baio, S. Kellerman, and Tom Arnold are charged, but have only minor roles. You never know characters and it's hard to worry about what happens to them. Not recommended.
