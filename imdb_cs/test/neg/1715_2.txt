I actually enjoyed Tycus, if not much more than mocking the values ​​of production. Dennis Hopper was fine, though he wondered if he would participate in the project if he saw the special effects they used. Plus, what was the ninja scene with? It was just out of pace. Maybe someone came up with a clear idea in the middle of the shooting. Well, this movie is great when you're drunk and you need a good laugh. Cheers.
