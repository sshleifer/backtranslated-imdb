Wow, Kiss The Bride wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good either. It certainly wasn't "Later Saints." The film will fall apart in the center ... maybe it would be a more fun movie for about 30 minutes. However, the film is over and over again filled with annoying undercuts and throwing scenes - the whole sequence of gold comes to mind. <br /> <br /> Although "Kiss" was created for theatrical release, it looks and sounds more like a TV movie. Each scene is lit as a department store. So many characters are gone. And <br /> <br /> A nice Tori is actually a nice surprise. He steals every scene he appears in. One scene pissed me off. It was a trial dinner in this larger room with lots of tables - all decorated. But only 5 or 6 people in the room at 250! Where did everyone go? Gay Cinema has sunk to a new minimum ... but not as low as horrible movies are being produced and shown here! Channel.
