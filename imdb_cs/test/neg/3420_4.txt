Recap: Not fully familiar with Shakespeare's Macbeth story, but my wild guess is that it's pretty close to the original, just now. It tells the story of Macbeth, a member of the Criminal Syndicate in Melbourne (?). He is a prized hit-man and in favor of Duncan's leader. But he and his lady have higher ambitions than that, and they are planning the murder of Duncan and the throne's competition. This is the story of betrayal and cold, brutal death. To use the story, but change the settings to the current but still retain the original (?) Dialog. It creates a huge contrast between classical poetic work and violence. He promised to be extremely violent, a promise he held, but not in the concept I had imagined. It's really bloody, but violence is slow. Not only figuratively speaking, it counts, but literally. In fact, a lot of actions are slowed down to slow down and that's what brings the film to its knees. What might be a unique force, a contrast between redundant and poetic dialogue and extreme violence, is now turning into something else. Now they both slow the painful movement, so much that sometimes it becomes boring and boring. Also, I can't figure out the context in which three witches work. For the present time and reality, I thought such magical witchcraft had no place in the film. It seems to be doing it, but it seems to me that it's absolutely right. It's not a subplot, but a complete sub-story with its own rules, completely different from the rest of the film. It looks absolutely in place. It must have been possible to convert it to something modern. Perhaps the drug-induced hallucinations (which I suspect the director is hinting at but then left too much witchcraft to be believable)? Now they are bringing sections of the film, which is clearly next to the story, and I just waited for the real movie to start again. Clear disappointment, but maybe something for Shakespeare enthusiasts? <br/> <br/> 4/10
