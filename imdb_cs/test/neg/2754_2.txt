Don't be wrong, High School Bigshot is a bad movie. High School Bigshot is about a geek who plans to get rich and get a girl. But it is all wrong, and of course, by the end of the film, the dead will end up with some other people, fortunately including the girl. The morale of the story is to care for all women for wealth. Also for us people, I think we should just accept that either "we have it" or "we don't have it"! <br /> <br /> I could easily find out how this movie could be rated 1, but it's above the worst movies. Acting is not quite terrible, and production values ​​are not terrible. Despite all this is a bad movie and not worth viewing for many reasons. Of course, if you insist on torture, follow the MST version. <br /> <br /> 2/10 (maybe 1.5 / 10)
