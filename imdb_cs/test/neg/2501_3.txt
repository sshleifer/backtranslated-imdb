As a serious horror fan, I think that some marketing tricks are used to sell movies, especially the really bad ones. So I wouldn't say it naively that I thought it was an erotic horror blow from Cannibal / Zombi / Jungle Holocaust. Unfortunately I was wrong because it is very hard. I should have realized that when I saw that a special "No actual or identifiable minor" was used. Notice the identifiable part as if he dared to catch us? A group of scientists, half of whom are beautiful women in a bikini, is led by a naval captain with a hobby for 69ing on the beach, in search of mutated indigenous killers. Because of a nuclear bomb fired on an allegedly evacuated island, radiation has turned this last man into a bully / murderer. . Sex scenes are exploding. Women walk around naked, exude a strange excess of confidence, and one even asks for rape when her husband turns her down. Well, two chicks slapping each other will naturally turn into a lesbian scene because women are horndogs. I saw the cub throw other chicks, lettuce and fingers. <br /> <br /> If there is something you should know about this movie, it is. Because the rest of this mad movie is the same. Who am I kidding? Here's another ton. Like the white "Duchess" who pays for two blacks to mark her as a team in the lounge. Or the "Duchess" took off from above to use it as a bandage when the captain cuts off. When she rejects her advances, she starts crying. And because he's a good man, he reluctantly lets her please the other crew members. I waited honestly for pizza to show up and the "Duchess" asked if there was another way to pay him. research. Wait, I thought this was a zombie? But the zombies will not enter 73min, but by then all the others have entered. Did I find out that I have hit several scenes several times? This is my first porn movie splash and I don't think it subgenre any justice. I think it's a woman in me talking when I say I want more conspiracy and less sweaty, drooling, hairy sex. The fun is that it could work like a decent horror movie, because the idea of ​​atomic bombing mutated the bitter man and killed his family. Even Eastman's character shakes his head and walks away from the couples with a pair of spears. This makes me wonder if it was a character or writer himself who was disgusted. I don't feel like going to the sound or the quality of the movie because you should already guess it was wrong. This production was filmed back with 3 other films, including Erotic Nights of the Living Dead, which do most of the same cast. Eastman said it was done because everyone wanted a vacation and paycheck. I don't know, I feel like I was talking about the sound. The sound was strange during the sex scenes because at a time when the cast speaks Italian, it seems as if they recorded English voice recordings and played it in their dialogue. While 2 people are boned, I can clearly hear someone in the background saying, "No! Yes! Wonderful! Wait!" There was a slightly fun Italian score that couldn't save this movie. SFX was, at best, minimal and consisted of several blood. And I would like to point out that there were no violent rape scenes, as clearly the warning label said on the DVD cover (ahem, another marketing trick), so no fear there. Just worry about the bad movie. <br /> <br /> Presented in 1.85: 1 widescreen format. I was looking at the Region 1 Not Rated version running at 113min, released in 2005 by Exploitation Digital. Apparently, Alfa Digital has a XXX version, which is the same run time, so I doubt it is anything else. Prices vary, but you should not pay more than $ 25.00 per copy. Or, as I would recommend, pay nothing and pretend it does not exist. Favorite quote: Shipmate, "Civilians are unlucky. Women are bad luck. They're scientists too? They really have to be monsters." DVD Extras: An original trailer with hard shots and kills to look more interesting than It, Trailers for SS Hell Camp, Emmanuelle, & ENOTLD and a very informative interview with Eastman. Bottom Line: Lame porn, but even weaker as a horror movie. Be real porn or watch real horror. <br /> <br /> Rating: 3/10 by Molly Celaschi www.HorrorYearbook.com
