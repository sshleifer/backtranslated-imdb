The gates of hell opened and spat out the film, then closed again. Watching this movie makes me appreciate other movies I've seen, just like all the other movies. Nothing makes any sense in this movie. It would be really long before we could mention any conspiracy problems. In fact, except for the warnings, it really isn't worth losing some of the almost endless space available on the internet writing about this movie. <br /> <br /> From now on I will check the IMDb before watching the movie. Hot Hell, IMDb makes me write more about this movie. I think I should warn you about Edison's strength when I'm with her. But if you had to choose between the two, choose Edison Force.
