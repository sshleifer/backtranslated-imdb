... the film comes together, which can be absolutely terrible from the opening titles to the studio logo at the end of the final credits. It was such a film - the type you can't stop watching for fear of not getting the moment of its ever-decreasing quality. Forget about the low budget, which is indicated by the slow monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential motorcycle without crowds, no traffic or a recognizable location. Forget the messy logic that is needed remotely to make the real graph credible. Forget that Roy Scheider adds some of the hammiest dialogues and does not completely hide his shame. This clunker is a horrible pace, bombarded with a score that's just laughter, and seems to have been edited by a third grader. All the scenarios that revolve to hide the hardest thing about shooting a presidential story about cheap: to be presidential. I sincerely slept briefly in the last reel, and when I woke up, I ran back so as not to miss one unbearable frame. Try this drinking game: every time you see it's recklessly aping another much better movie. You'll also succeed. Not since I saw "Man" w / Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy, I've seen so kindly an incredible project. I can make copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars. Thousands laugh.
