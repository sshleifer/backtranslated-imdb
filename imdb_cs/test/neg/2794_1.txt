Don't take this movie seriously, rent it with some people who want to play Mystery Science 3000, and you'll probably laugh at your ass. The bad guys aren't so scary, it's funny, it's like some 7th-class dude with a sickle in a scarecrow that gets up. Acting is merry. I love occasional self torture with a bad horror movie and this really chuckled me. I recommend this on this basis. Of course recreational drugs improve the experience. Oh, there is a nude group swimming scene that will allow some star dust for a 5-star system. The black male token gets hurt badly, but continues his wit, as well as using injured body parts quite easily throughout. Enjoy this complete and utter shame on movies.
