This horror movie starts promising and is the moment when I thought it would be really good. However, at the end it becomes rather boring, rather fast. Acting is pretty good as well as the location and the story starts pretty well too. The problem is not enough killing on the screen and the end where you have a monster basically turning the tail and running. I wanted to see more, especially after a very good sleeping bag scene where I thought the movie was going to be the winner. Unfortunately, after the film showed the monster very little, and the back of the DVD lied as she told me that the wilderness literally came to life under the people and was able to devour their body ... now that it was a movie, almost inevitable. It is true that viewers would feel uncomfortable and could cause tension, but that's what horror movies are supposed to do! Instead, we have very few footage of creature or creature as it was, and when we see it, it's mainly on the defensive. It still wasn't all bad, it just needed more horror less hunting and more chomping.
