This film is really apologizing for filmmaking. Stimulation is poor, the budget must be depressingly low and the action is limited (ie, except for Bela Lugosi). The sound at this time is also terrible, with so much extra noise in the background that it sounded to me as if it were taking off for the entire movie. If these things bother you, don't watch this movie. <br /> <br /> If you do, you'll find the film's idea is very good. The German plastic surgeon (Bela Lugosi) was hired by the Japanese to operate on several Japanese agents and turned them into noble American businessmen that the Japanese kidnapped and killed. After finishing his job, he was betrayed by the Japanese and thrown into jail. He later escapes and travels to America to seek revenge on his patients through a series of high-pioneered murders. It looked like Bela Lugosi was the only decent actor in the movie, and, to be honest. , the rest of the actors were completely forgotten and irritated. The leading actress was somewhat boring and stereotypical, while the police officer assigned to her was an ordinary, chauvinist, and always the right dominant male, found in many films of that period. I also found that working with the camera was totally uninspired, often choosing the exact same angles of exactly the same rooms over and over again. After a while it tends to drag the film down and set a very slow pace for "action" that is either nonexistent at all. The idea is fascinating for me. and with a better writer, director, script, equipment and actor, he can become an excellent film. Sadly, these disadvantages keep the film back, and I can't recommend it to anyone other than the most open film lovers.
