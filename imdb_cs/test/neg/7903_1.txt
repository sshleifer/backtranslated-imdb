I will start by being awake as black as black, and I can tell you that it is very sad when blacks think it's a "black film". I can't say I've ever seen a movie that's a badly directed or worse story. Snoop is my dawg and everything, but he didn't feel the movie at all, I don't know how much he was paid to be in a bucket of crap called a movie, but I hope it's enough for it to smell the smell. I'm just about promoting the movie, but this was bad, really bad. In every aspect, it blew out chucks, no real storyline, a lick story, a cast couldn't act, and the best was a white boy! Almost asked for a refund on the way out of the Theater door, half the crowd up and left before it was over, I still wish I had. Save some pain and go see something else ...
