A group of 7 gold prospectors are heading to a mine that has recently been reopened after the earthquake. Of course, they do not pay attention to the local legend that something is there and killing people. This low budget ($ 25,000) horror movie has a mild cult consequence and I'm not entirely sure why (unless it's because it's so dark). I admit that the last half-hour is quite amusing, but an hour of pure torture. Lots of walking and talking and our titular weirdness will not appear until 45 minutes. Even in the extras co-writer Chris Huntley admits to committing an unforgivable sin that is boring. I would forgive them if they were strict amateurs, but this group graduated from USC, so I hope they know that the exploitative film should be exploitative. Anyway, as I said, the last half-hour is fine because the three survivors are fighting the monster stopping the move and there's a great score similar to John Carpenter. I wanted to see more of the monsters, but it's literally on the screen for 45 seconds. <br /> <br /> Although the film is not the best, Red DVD code has given this much attention. You have interviews and audio commentary from Melanie Anne Phillips, producer / actor Mark Sawicki and co-founder Huntley. Stories of how the film was made are quite fascinating and inspiring (like a garden cave set). Even more interesting are Sawicki and Huntley's USC student shorts, which are actually better than production. Huntley was a pretty talented artist and it was a pity he didn't go for anything else. Sawicki worked in Hollywood as a visual effects and cameraman. VHS is a bit legendary, how dark it was and I'm sure it's much better. However, you still have scenes where the only picture is the five helmet lights that are reflected in the dark. Safe to say that the original MY BLOODY VALENTINE is still "horror movie in my" championship.
