To describe what is really bad with this movie, it must include some * spoilers *, so if you want to see it and expect to be surprised, you don't read it! I liked everything about this movie except the plot; and in a thriller like this plausible plot is necessary. This is well acted upon when a little slow motion, and work cameras and Portland scenes are excellent for low-budget, unpretentious images. The dialogue is very good. Mason is a seriously withdrawn youth who works in a telemarketing insurance company. His high school friend Berkeley is his employer and cares for him as a brother, although Mason is obviously mentally ill. Mason has nightmares that send him and gasp for his inhaler. His visions and nightmares indicate that he has had serious problems with good-looking women in his past, and the film seems to indicate that he can be a serial killer of women. She meets a live, pretty girl named Amber and draws her into her notebook. He attracts him and poses for him to paint a portrait. She sees more of it and begins to wake up from her withdrawn state, which almost becomes halfway man. Then something goes wrong. Amber finds sketchbooks with drawings of other girls and starts to wonder. He becomes frightened and pulls away. We wonder if her sudden cold can overcome him. His behavior becomes more erratic. <br /> <br /> This is a revelation setting. To explain how this film terribly wrong, I have to explain what happens. * Another spoiler warning! * To make this conspiracy work, we believe that Amber, a truly departing, beautiful young girl will go for a seriously emotionally disturbed young man who has at least the beginning of his friendship. Unoccupied view and can only speak monosyllables or not speak at all. He is far behind the nerdy, he appears on the verge of total catatonia. Yes, I know, girls can be attracted to all kinds of weirdoes, but usually the type of Charles Manson or punk rockers, guys with some bad manic energy. Mason is practically a zombie, not there at all. Any energetic young thing would cross the street to avoid it. It is simply unbelievable that this girl is attracted to him. Moreover, there is no trusted reason for Berkeley to indulge in a crazy Mason. But wait, it's a revelation. Amber doesn't show up at Berkeley's house for Christmas dinner, where Mason and Berkeley, his old friend, await her, he has to tell him that there are no Amber and all his other ex-girlfriends he drew in many sketchbooks. All! She and everyone else are just figments of his twisted imagination: they dreamed of them. Well, that explains why a normal cute Amber would go for Mason, it's just a figment of his imagination. It could have been the last revelation of the movie with proper preparation and setup, but unfortunately it isn't. At that moment Mason returns to his apartment and finds Amber there ... he is angry, kills her. But now we have to understand that Amber is actually real, not Mason's imaginary girlfriend. Finally, after proof that Amber really exists and that Mason killed her, Berkeley has to admit that he was wrong to misjudge Mason. That would work if Mason was on a graceful journey from the outset, but since the audience always suspected him to be a totally derailed and possibly a female killer, it's no surprise to us. We suspected what was over and did not understand why Berkeley had not seen it. But then they let us again: if it were real, why would Amber be attracted to catatonic Mason? To make the end worse, have we never been able to understand whether all the other Mason friends, those in the sketchbooks, were real or were Amber the first real? And if the others were real, did he kill them too? What did he do with bodies? The problem is that the creators did not know what to do with the material. Maybe it could be a way to straighten it up and say a credible story, but this is not the film.
