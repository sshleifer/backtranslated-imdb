I was hoping that I would like this movie to settle in the evening entertainment. I like Judy Davis and Juliette Lewis and the seemingly seemingly seemingly unpleasant assumption. Judy Davis did a great job but had very little work. Juliette Lewis was wonderful as expected, but she had nothing to do. The story was full of "twists" that were just stupid, and as often happens in movies of this type, no one behaved as if it were a real human being. And personally, I thought Marcia Gay Harden was completely wrong. The film also seemed to have moved around the center from a black comedy with a touch of farce to a total farce with a touch of black comedy. One reviewer notes that other reviews seem to want this film to be something else, and therefore refused it. All I can say is that I * settled something * with the film and kept it. This one feels that the director had some great ideas, but he couldn't pull them all out. I give him 4 out of 10.
