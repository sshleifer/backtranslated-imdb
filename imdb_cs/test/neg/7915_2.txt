... because this is another dead. Idle voice acting, second-degree animation, fictional and no-humorous songs (though the bit sung by the devil would be worthy of Tim Curry), and a weaker plot than Earth before time 99: Fossils on the show. I have to admit I didn't see the first movie. I'm not a big fan of films involving heaven or dogs, especially not in combination. Yet I hope to see you first soon because HAD is the reason why someone would create such a divine, horrifying sequel. <br /> <br /> If I didn't get this movie for free, I wouldn't want it. I don't have it at all. The only thing in this "heavenly" movie was the devil. 2/10.
