PREY <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.37: 1 <br /> <br /> Sound Format: Mono <br /> <br /> Lesbian Couple (Sally Faulkner and Glory Annan) Living in a Far Country the house is driven separately by the arrival of a young man (Barry Stokes), who turns out to be an alien who eats meat, the vanguard of a massive invasion ... <br /> <br /> Despite his shock budget Continuation of Norman J. Warren to SATAN'S SLAVE (1976 ) represents much more than the sum of its modest parts, thanks to the surprisingly complicated Max Cuff scenario (apparently his only merit): Faulkner and Annan's obsessive relationship while living in isolated splendor in the English countryside (making Derek V. Browne beautiful and sinister is eye-catching cinematography, though Annan discovers a bloody garment in the room above the mark one (or both) of these doe-eyed psychologically disturbed, which may explain the absence of their respective families, some of whom are they seem to live in a house at once or else and "go" under mysterious circumstances. Stokes's unexpected arrival casts a relationship into a mess, partly because Faulkner has a pathological hatred for men and partly because Annan attracts him and creates tension that results in a peak of calm violence. There's an extraordinary, multi-layered sequence in which Faulkner attempts to "wipe out" his helpless visitor by dressing him in women's clothing, though Stokes' extraterrestrial mentality allows him to stand above the intended ridicule. At least the early scenes, the relationship between Faulkner and Annan is portrayed with extraordinary grace and dignity, but this cordial sapphic connection quickly divides into a crowd-pleasing episode of sex and pulchritude, culminating in a horror explosion when Annan dares to be angry Stokes after a violent argument with Faulkner. The final suites are (literally) gut-wrenching, especially Annan's final scene, which seems to have been cut off for reasons of censorship in 1977 and never fully restored (what remains is still quite alive, so recover!). Outstanding performance of three leaders, backed by the unobtrusive direction of Warren, who takes full advantage of the stunning forest sites to compensate for the film's shortcomings in the film. It was originally released in the US as ALIEN PREY.
