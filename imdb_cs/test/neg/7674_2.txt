This is what happens when a franchise gets lazy, and no one can think of a new twist to add. Remember what happened to the "Childs Play" line? The first three were played as horror movies, with real horrors (though predictable) that dealt with the subject of film. Then people came to the doll to stop, and decided to play for laughter, the other two are black comedies ..... <br /> <br /> Well, that happened here, but I think it wasn't. Something like saying "I wanted to make pancakes for dessert! I did it deliberately!" when your souffle explodes. But the milk was spilled and it had a certain value in the theaters, as if it could. <br /> <br /> When the floor ripped out of the passenger seats, I expected the passenger to extend his legs through the hole. , start running Flintstones-Style, safely land the plane in the Alps. I did. It should fit into the stupid camp of the rest of the show. Like having the character of Kennedy reacted calmly to the news that his date was a whore? Even in 1979, one would not easily accept the idea that he had just poured a heart on a paid companion. He allegedly felt that he had created a connection with a soulmate, who is subsequently shown to be a mercenary-sex-worker with coming-line. Who wouldn't feel deceived by experience? And yet he giggles and hugs his friend's waist as they leave. What is cheap packing of a slimy scene. Ouch. I had a taste for soufflé and served in crazy clichés. And no, you didn't do it deliberately!
