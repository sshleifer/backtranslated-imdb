I remembered the horrible movie I bought at Camelot in the summer of 1989 when I visited my grandparents. It was a time when I just discovered movies like Re-Animator, From Beyond, The Return of the Living Dead, and Dawn of the Dead. I was ready for all the horror / gore genres he had to offer .... or so I thought! I was only 12 years old at the time, so I don't remember it very well. I remember a psycho running with a corkscrew killing people and a couple of cops (I think) who drove in a car that didn't really move, but they hit the side to look like it was ... a real movie. I also remember that it was the worst movie I had ever seen until I threw it in the garbage. Something tonight made me think about the movie (I can't believe I actually remembered the name), so I jumped on the imdb to see if it was listed. To my surprise ... that was! And five more people saw it .... Amazing. Although I remember that I hated the movie at the time, I wished I'd hiding it somewhere because I'd like to check it again to laugh (it would probably be a good movie about a drinking game). By the way, I'm glad I'm part of an elite couple who saw this little "treasure". I'd like to pick it up for a few dollars ... but be careful, this is not a recommendation ... it's terrible ... it's just for nostalgia.
