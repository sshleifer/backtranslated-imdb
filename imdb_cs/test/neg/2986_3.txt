This is a bit of a slow motion for horror, but the quality is better than you could expect for a director's only pursuit of IMDb. Camera work and lighting were both surprisingly good, and acting ??? though variable? is better than it often appears in the genres of India. As a leader, Robert Field is quite stiff, which is especially unfortunate given that his character, Claude, is the film's narrator and the center of the film. activities. However, it was Christopher's entry (Brandon deSpain), which I considered the turning point of this film? and not in a good way. The twist is introduced in clumsy fashion, and slow-moving pulls out and too wordy. On the upside, Pete Barker is always fun as Father William. It's an easy stand-out in what's a fairly common offer. While I was interested in the first half hour, I ended up quite disappointed as things happened.
