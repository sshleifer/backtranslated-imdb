"Ashes of Time" was a daring project but ended up being a pretentious film. This film is a good example of how to tell a simple story in a difficult way. The story of "Ashes of Time" is quite simple and it is two words: "love triangle". Because of those "love triangles" stories crossing, jealousy, hatred and love are the main dynamics depicted by the characters. The narrative part is seen through the eyes of Ou-yang Feng (Leslie Cheung). Ou-yang Feng lives in a desert where he acts as a mediator of various swordsmen and becomes a tool of destiny to attain revenge. Unfortunately, "Ashes of Time" cannot tell these simple stories of love and hate. Wong Kar-wai has lost the desire to make every film of the film a painting and aesthetic experience. In fact, in addition to casting beautiful actors (men and women), everything else in this film is a failure. Dialogues are minimalist and not original. The image quality is very uneven, the cut is one of the worst (at least me) in the genre of "swordplay" and finally filming a rare sword fight is very confusing and annoying. Even the attempt to build art scenes is not always achieved: the so-called erotic scene of "woman on horseback" is ridiculous, not erotic and useless. Wong Kar-wai wanted to bring 100 minutes of pure aesthetic experience and forgot that the film is the first to say the plot. Forgetting that he adds a clumsy film that does not fulfill his artistic goal.
