I know that many people would claim certain films as "the worst of all time," but I think Redneck is claiming this award. A combination of pretty horrible acting from Mark Lester and Telly Savales and a progressive conspiracy that contradicts faith. To Telly Saveles: was he drunk when he acted? He seems to be playing a frantic, laughing lunatic with no sense of conviction. Maybe he was mixing his medication with whiskey, I don't know. Mark Lester: A performance more wooden than a carpentry workshop. His cropped British tones do not belong to this film; and his conversion from a protected teenager to a gangster apprentice in 24 hours is crazy. And the strip scene with the Mosquito has no meaning at all for the plot; maybe the director likes something like that. Plot Logic: When Memphis and Mosquito raid a car in the beginning, why does Les Les not say or say anything to get her son out of the car before the loonies turn him off? He just lets them all go without saying a word! On the other hand, Redneck must be seen - you will not believe how wrong it is!
