I think the previous movie, "House," was a hit that Universal asked to draw a few more drops from a cash-cow monster. The creative team had to be in a recycle mood, starting with the introductory theme that rose from "Son of Frankenstein" and some of the track tracks scattered in the film, as one unintentionally funny piece of store where the footage of Glenn Strange as a monster is mixed with Karloff of Bride in 1935, and compared to the robotic Strange movement, Karloff seems to be moving in comparison to the cheetah. The previous film continuity is thrown out of the road regarding miraculous death. cheating abilities of Wolf Man and Dracula, but when Dr. Edelmann and Larry Talbot discover a Frankenstein monster with a skeleton representing Boris Karloff, Edward T. Lowe at least recognizes some of the past film history, although Talbot never mentioned curiously that he had met Karloff. Dr. Niemann. Given that it was the last of the horror cycles Universal, the supernatural elements of Wolf Man and Dracula (unconvincingly) turn into a medical illness. He is said to suffer from a blood disease, a very rare disease that allows him to turn into a bat or to evaporate if sunlight touches him. >: -] And Larry Talbot has little pressure on his brain. Of course, all this is carefully explained with 'much' medical jargon in many scenes around the world. This proves to be the biggest obstacle somewhere on the way makers seem to forget about the real horror or fun in favor of giving monsters states that seem treatable as influenza. As a huge fan of old universal horrors, it's rare that I feel so bored watching one. The whole thing feels like a movie that was created just because it could be, but if this mess wasn't trampled together, the monsters might never have met Abbott and Costello, so I think something good has come out of it.
