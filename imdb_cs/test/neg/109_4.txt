Ben, (Rupert Grint), is a deeply unhappy adolescent, son of his unfortunate married parents. His father (Nicholas Farrell) is a vicar and his mother (Laura Linney) is ... well, let's say he is a somewhat hypocritical soldier in Jesus' army. It's only if she takes her summer job as an assistant to the dirty, eccentric, once-famous and now forgotten actress Evie Walton (Julie Walters) that she finally finds herself in the right fashion "Harold and Maude". Of course, Evie is deeply unhappy with herself, and it is only when these two sad bags find each other that they can set aside their mutual suffering and set out on the path to happiness. Of course it is scaly and sentimental and very predictable, but it also has a heavy side, and Walters, who could sleep his way this way, if she wanted, is excellent. It's when he puts madness on one side and finds that the pathos in the character (like hitting the bottle and throwing it in the sink) is at its best. The problem is, he's the only interesting character in the movie (and it's not because of a scenario that doesn't have anyone kind). Grint, on the other hand, is not just unhappy; it is also a bit boring, while Linney's stiff bitch is one-dimensional. (She still has an English accent outside the pat). The best thing to say is that it is slightly pleasant - with an emphasis on slightly.
