I couldn't stand to watch this crap. This is your standard junk that some annoying women love - an old English era drama with lots of costumes and clichés that seem to be torn out either directly from an oliver twist or some other novel. This uses the usual clichés from the Victorian era. Some idiotic people really think that the whole emotional torture of this culture is so bloody suppressed that it is fascinating and romantic. This is a sap, pure and utter junk and boredom as she looks at the grass. As such, it is ideal for women who want an English countryside snoozer romantic drama in a Victorian setting, but for this man this film is nothing but torture and cruel and unusual punishment to watch a lot of dull boring scenes with unoriginal characters who talk miserable Forced and False English Accent.
