After his father's suicide, Charlie 'Kid' Davis (Ray `Boom Boom 'Mancini) accepts the invitation and advice of his friend Tiny (Michael Chiklis) and travels to Las Vegas to try to become a boxer. On the way they meet Gina (Jennifer Beals), who gets up and she becomes Charlie's girlfriend. Johnny Ticotin (Rod Steiger) is convinced Tiny is Charlie's couch, and the powerful agent Alex Dumas (Joe Mantegna) becomes his manager after watching him, supporting Charlie's career. This film is so boring that it really doesn't deserve to spend much time writing about it. I don't like boxing, but sometimes I watch some useful movie about this topic. But this is terrible! Predictable, full of clich√©s, with terrible leadership, pure waste of time. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Corpo e Alma" ("Body and Soul")
