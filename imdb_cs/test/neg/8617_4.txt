There is a good story well hidden and never really used! The film is short and too dependent on action and thematic photography; the character and development of stories have been forgotten. What is left is confused and superficial. Turn off your brain and watch, you'll probably find that time goes by quickly, but if you're not the one who finds the soaps deep and meaningful, you won't get any real satisfaction from this movie. <br /> <br /> Watch only if you have nothing better, and then only if someone else pays for the video rental.
