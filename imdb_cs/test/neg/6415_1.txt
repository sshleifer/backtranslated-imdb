This film has no respect for the viewer's time. It takes a 15 minute story and stretches to 95 minutes. To achieve this, they must use a very slow narrative and everyone should run around with some unlikely frantic anxiety. At the time this movie showed something interesting on the plot, I didn't care. The problem is not playing but instead of stimulating. The story is only weak. Jim Carrey is a capable actor, but his attempts to inject light humor into a serious role are simply in place. His style of humor is not general, so he meets as a watered version of himself. Number 23 is causing great grief and frustration in the story, but it is never logical to justify it. At most it is only slightly interesting. Jim Carrey has a much greater ability in a more serious role than this film reveals. Don't waste your money seeing in the theater. Rent this movie if you have trouble sleeping. If you're still awake after 10 minutes, then you liked it more than I did. I didn't like lighting or the artistic aspects of making a movie. Lots of passive visual eye feasts have been thrown at the viewer with lighting or effects, and little to reinforce the already weak story.
