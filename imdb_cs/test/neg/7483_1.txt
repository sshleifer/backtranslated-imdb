I don't think I've ever given anything 1/10 of the rating, but this one easily gets the mark. It's hard for me to sit in one of his jokes. It's not just that jokes are so bad, but they combine it with Carson Daily having zero charisma, can't set up or finish a punchline, and you have a late night comedy recipe that really turns your stomach. I've been watching the show, never in full, but still many times. I'm just creeping at Conan. I usually look at a minute or two to see if Carson is the worst talk show guest every day. In fact, if you ever see him hosting an interview with him, it's just an interview. I'm so sorry every time she has a guest and their confused smiles are trying to cover up their body language that shouts, "Get the hell away from this madness!" I recommend watching the show, not for laughter, but to think how it got into the air and what it still does. Watch as you can, I think you'll find his utter embarrassment ... interesting.
