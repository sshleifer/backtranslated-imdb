What can I say? After reading Herbert's books and loving Lynch's film version, I was very disappointed. I felt I was watching the rejected version of Buck Rogers. The sets looked like the left footage of the Star Wars TV game! I felt that acting was mostly amateur. The costumes were exaggerated and despite it made it put the '60s lightning Gordon, feeling the pulp. Worms! It's supposed to be Sand Worms. The effects in general were quite second. I won't even start with the shameful "Navigator" effect. This so-called "Dune" Frank Herbert wasn't even true to his books! It should have been called "Frank Herbert's Dune - for dummies". The key elements were omitted, the names changed and the whole "feeling" of the story was "disinfected". I didn't even know Harkonnens! In fact, most of the characters appeared as Herbert's descriptions. I'm getting pissed, I just remember what tragedy it was. I'm glad I couldn't take the second installment.
