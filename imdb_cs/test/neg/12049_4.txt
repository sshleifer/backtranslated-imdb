The empty shortening of John Irving's novel seeks courageously, but in the end it is absurd. It is an unpredictable, goofy and bittersweet string of sketches that tries to explain human growth from birth to adulthood and how it deals with the vices of lust and fanaticism that surround it. Garp was born to an extraordinary single mother, Jenny Fields, played by Glenn Close (three young actors play different stages of Garp's childhood before Robin Williams takes over when Garp reaches maturity). 'prep school, where Jenny is a school nurse, through his passion-wrestling college, writing, and sex-to-marriage with his high school sweetheart, children, marital problems and a writing career. Meanwhile, Jenny became a famous feminist and promoted unorthodox causes. The story describes a number of comic and tragicomic episodes and exotic adventures. Williams gives cherub-constant performance. This scenario was not suitable for his wildness and anarchy, so his talent was wasted. It's like a wounded bird out of control. John Lithgow's role as a father like a transsexual who gives wisdom also makes no sense. This film was able to attract some reasonable attention in 1982, due to the popularity of Robin Williams and his new entry into the movies. Williams recently cast his Mork and Mindy pursuits and focused more on stand-up comedy and movies. The audience was bewildered by this film, especially its arbitrary and inexplicable end.
