I believe Cockpuncher is the best work that has come out of the factory by Steven Seagal. This movie was the first movie I saw since I saw this movie. My opinion? It's done. Every movie is the same. Maybe he'll be good at Machete because he won't be a star. We can only hope. <br /> <br /> P.S. Thanks for the interview with UCSB when I went to college. It was a wonderful speech. You really influenced some people outside. So I have to write ten lines about this movie? Umm .... I like the smoker who killed a lot of fools. Whenever someone smells menthol's LOOK OUT. Because there could be a killer with a silent glock (and another loud one) that wants to kill you. Is it ten?
