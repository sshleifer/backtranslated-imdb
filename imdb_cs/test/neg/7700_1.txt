There's nothing good about this movie. Read the Revolution For Hell, or for His Other Writings. Abbie was often released as a clown-prince of the 1960s, but it was a man of ideas who used his cleverness, his sense of humor and pop culture, and his charming personality to pay attention to their thoughts. The media has too often focused on humans, not on ideas, and that's also a problem with this movie. He later suffered from depression in his life. But this movie is like Abbie's national version of the Enquirer. He deserves better. If you don't know Abbie or his times, this movie won't help you. This film lies. I'm giving him zero. <br /> <br />
