I've seen a minimum wage episode, but I don't intend to follow others as it may be? Morgan begins to complain theatrically about her terrible living on the minimum wage at the beginning of the episode and the complainant never stops. At all. Fortunately for the viewer, his skinny girlfriend is as annoying as Morgan (if not even more annoying). And then, to get it all started, they go to the movies and buy bottled water for 2.50. And after going to the restaurant to eat, while they naturally * drum * complain that they are poor. <br /> <br /> I don't care if other episodes may or may not be better than this. No one should be forced to watch this bullshit.
