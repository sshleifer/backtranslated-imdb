I just gave 10 for the Thieves Highway, I mention it for two reasons why I proved that I am not a git who only gives bad reviews, but 2 because the theme of the movie has the same subject, falling in love with a woman at night. We all know that a pretty woman is a chick, but you can't avoid them all, eventually they'll get you. Pretty Woman does two things for me, two terrible terrible things, first of all portraying prostitution as a career more like a dancer, knowing with great friends, foot warmers a lot of giggling, borrowing each other. You see a prostitute in the reality of a Pretty Woman and this is a street walker The prostitute we're talking about has a great life, she's happy happy with occasional whining to explain her troubles. My feeling is that this "happy Hooker" protagonist is much tastier than an almost realistic character who asks me if you make a film about a person, but he is too scared of a chicken to acquire the characteristics. knows this role, so why do it? If I make a film about a chef, but I don't want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat, then why make a film about a chef? By escaping the story and turning the hooker into a decent type of dancer, this story completely lacks a point, and as a result he never cares about any moral or social issues he might have, what a cop really is lame. Second, 'Pretty Woman' insults romance itself, Edward Lewis played Richard Gere has no idea how to seduce or romance this 'lady' who is without his plastic friend, yep will not go home without it, especially if you are moron in a suit that has no imagination. 8 out of 10 of his romantic moments includes splashing cash in one way or another, even when she first meets her, it's Lotus Esprit turbo, which does all the work, necklaces here diamonds there limousines, money cash money, where is the magic? where is charisma, don't mention the piano attempt, please. Girls who like this movie will also be girls who like shopping more than most. Boys who like this movie didn't even realize that old Eddy had less magic than a calculator because they didn't seem to notice that much. More importantly, anyone who likes this film hates the "Thieves Highway", which is an amazing story whose part is based on the same theme. I'll finish the song: <br /> <br /> Pretty hangin woman around the street Pretty woman, I love a woman Pretty woman, I don't believe you're a truth Nobody could spend as much as you mercy <br /> < Pretty woman, wont you pardon me Pretty woman, I couldn't help but see Pretty woman, and you look beautiful, how can be lack of imagination, just like me <br /> <br /> Pretty woman, shop, While Pretty Woman Talking While Pretty Woman Selling Me My Smile Pretty Woman, yeah, yeah yeah Pretty woman, look at my path Pretty woman, say you stay with me .. and I will pay you .. I will keep you right
