WARNING: I recommend to anyone who hasn't seen a movie yet to read this comment. When I first started watching this movie, I expected it to be a vampire movie that will be amazing. both Rodriguez and Tarantino helped make the film. I started in about 15 minutes and my hopes for this movie were already in the channel, which shocked me. First, the story in which it was happening was by no means so appealing and just so boring and uncomplicated that I just wanted to turn it off. I was getting more frustrated with this movie as it moved on, but I think I was hoping it would be better .... then when it eventually showed the vampires BLEW MY MIND, in a very bad way. I thought, "Okay, this movie started with some terrible story about these two criminals, then VERY slowly turned into some vampire movie that I thought it would be from the beginning, just like the last 30 minutes?" To add that, try to keep the main characters all cool and awesome and mean around the end when they're just not; Bunny would be more intimidating than these characters! This movie is a terrible piece of crap !!! From Dusk Until dawn, I was disgraced and left a terrible taste in my mouth, daunting thoughts in my head, and left my body unable to move away from the terrible shock I had just wasted 108 minutes of my life on a horrible film. I don't understand how George Clooney, Quentin Tarintino, Cheech Marin and Danny Trejo, all who are good and honest actors who are, could take part in this unnecessary filth. In my opinion, since dusk Till Dawn is one of the worst movies I've ever made and I suffered from. You don't see it, you'll do a great favor ...
