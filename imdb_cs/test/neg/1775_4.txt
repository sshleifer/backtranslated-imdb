My tolerance for the benevolent direction was impressed by some of the possibilities at this time that could have been really good, a waste of time. When "romantic" intervals were of such a nature that brought me out of the story and into "How-and-why-did-the-movie-maker-do /?" mode, you have to find out what is missing there; I think I think it's restraint and taste. Brian Brown is a capable, empathetic actor - usually. I think he doesn't like the project or the people, and it shows. I don't remember anything that guy did. You can't even take a picture of his face. On the other hand, it may not be good to be fun; Some of the vignettes and twists are fun and even sophisticated. <br /> <br /> I watched this movie ($ 2.00 on-site rental) against screenwriter advice; I understand he was tempted to remove his name from credits. I bet it's pride.
