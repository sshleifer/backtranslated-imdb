As if the world needed another Seagal movie. Add a lot of actors who ... aren't really actors, a bunch of heavy metal music compliments to rap and, of course, a hot-looking, crazy chick in the skin without the hips and preventing us from being half the past budget. . Why, why do people get involved in such films? The FBI captures two friends and sends them to "New Alcatraz", where the first prisoner of the prison to be executed has unexpected guests. > <br /> First-class acting all around, especially every scene with a tragedy for good people. Seriously, the director tried it and pulled out the best he could for the film. Whether it is too often and HALF PAST DEAD is bored too early. What else can you do when prisoners are just talking when hostages are constantly asking for what is the main bad guy motivated? A thoughtless action that equals a small, if not "a-ight."
