Anyone who has seen a smoking smelly poo on behalf of Congo understands my name. And I feel for you. This movie wasn't just bad. It was painful. The book was stupid, the script was even stupid, and the cast was terrible. Dylan Walsh? Rumor has it that Julia Roberts threw her ass off because the film was blowing so badly. Huge diamonds? Killer gorillas? Talking gorillas? Hmmm. Sounds like a hit! ACH! Tim Curry accent is so bad in this movie I'd rather be deaf! I recommend this film to bulimists who are trying to cleanse after a heavy meal or a Corkian patient who needs one more reason to die. If it's a faithful book, I'd say let's give us a good old fashion Footloose book that burns and destroys every copy. If future generations looked back and found this waste, how would we explain it? Listen to the others who hated this movie! Don't look at it! Run away! You DO NOT have this movie! If you think it is full of action or tension or cold effects, they're LACK! If you think more cock is blowing than Nicole Ritchie, you would be right. So if you keep looking at Crapo .., I think Congo, I say do it after you took 50 Tylenol PM.
