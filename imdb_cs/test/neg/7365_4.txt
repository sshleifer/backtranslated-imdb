Most of this can be forgiven in contemporary works that ask us to remember important historical events and to taste them with sufficient interest in love to keep the story going. BATTLE OF BRAVE deals with the 18th century battle for control of Quebec (all Canada) between the British and the French with side panels from New America. This is a prerequisite for a vast epic of fascination, but unfortunately in the hands of writer Pierre Billon (whose script deserves the Razzie for the worst season) and the scattered, out of focus and confusing direction of Jean Beaudin, this film - a two and a half hour boring film disorder. Even actors with good actors - pairing Noemia Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Hay as François le Gardeur, adding beautiful Bianca Gervais as Acoona, Honorable Gérard Depardieu as Le Curé Thomas Blondeau, and like Irène Jacob, Vincent Perez (ridiculous in period wigs), Tim Roth as William Pitt, Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin and Jason Isaacs as Général James Wolfe - Don't Help. Veteran actors, like these, had to crouch on the rough lines written for their characters! Cover all the mess in Patrick Doyle's elegant musical score and the result is a long film to avoid. Sad to say such bad things about an expensive project, but be warned .... Grady Harp
