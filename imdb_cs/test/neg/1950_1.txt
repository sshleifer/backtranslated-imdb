I noticed that this film was recently on Cinemax, so I decided to watch it this morning. I just finished Infiltrator, which is a great movie, and I thought it looked good. He had a cable from the description, at least. This movie was terrible. It's slow, stimulation is awful, it feels like it takes 4 hours. There is no real plot to talk about ... agh! How can anyone say something good about this movie. Rickman is good ... but he's always ... the other two characters work fine, but there's no real story to support it. After 2 hours, and you're sitting there thinking about what's happening on the ground where there is a conspiracy on Earth - that ends with a surprise that sincerely calmed me down. Don't bother with this.
