Should it be serious? I hope not. This is one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen. Since I picked him up on a shelf on "bad movies", he certainly lives on the spot in the store. What can I say, gore effects are sprayed (pun-intended) everywhere, some look quite real, some look like a teddy bear who had an accident with a bottle of tomato sauce. Music is one of the worst things I've heard, acting is one of the funniest elements ... I have to go on? Don't bother if you haven't seen every other pathetic horror in the store, and that's all that remains.
