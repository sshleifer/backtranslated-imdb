If you really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt-mirrors, eating non-ants, and conquering the world with voice-over narration, then this is the movie for you. Basically, a couple of scientists working from bio-dome communicate with highly intelligent ants (the most intelligent actors in this film) in an attempt to thwart their plans for conquest and extermination. Throughout the film, two scientists (and the girl they saved from the ants) use everything available to them (computers, green dye, and terrible action), but to no avail. I think they just couldn't afford any pesticides because the film would be too fast. <br /> <br /> The title of the movie "Phase IV" is something secret. This is not a spoiler, but "Phase I" starts after the opening credits, while "Phase IV" does not reach the end of the credits. The director apparently knew that the film would be boring to get into all the stages 1-3 in the film. As an MST3K episode, this was not very good for two reasons: 1) This is from Season 0 on KTMA when they were first starting so riffing is not as good as in later seasons; and 2) This movie is so bad that even J&TB can't make it light. There are one or two Gamera links as they have just finished riffing 5 Gamera movies. The movie has a trick / surprise finish, but I was so glad that I reached the end effect was lost to me.
