When I was younger (oh about 2), I saw Barney for the first time and I liked it. But then I didn't even have a brain. And now I look back and see what a terrible "Barney" show really is: First, everything on the show is scary. Barney, the main character, is a terrible 9-foot tall talking, purple dinosaur who teaches 13-year-olds about "imagination ..." (* shakes *) BJ (I know what you think about your name). The smaller but creepier yellow dinosaur that is put into be "supposudly" cool. But in fact it is the exact opposite. After watching a few episodes with B.J., he miserably trudged with a slightly turned back lid and made a couple of non-funny jokes, I wanted to scream. Baby Bop-oh-oh-god! (* Vomit *) oh-oh-OH-anyway Baby Bop is the worst idea about EVER. It's a green triceratops (it's a dinosaur) that carries a yellow blanket. Her remarks "hee-hee-hee" and Barney's praise of "super-deeee-doooper" cries make it difficult to sit in every episode as the seventh grader learns about shapes and ways. And that, my friend, is what makes this show really awful.
