Bad movie but with one reel that is worth enjoying. For most of the movie, jokes are bad, songs are bad, even W.C. The field is bad. Then there is a sequence with Bob Hope and his film-ex; The dialogue is funny and the song ("Thanks for the memories") is light, cynical and pleasant. Who fell in this piece? Yet it is worth it for 25 cents.
