I only saw it because I saw a few good reviews, so I was expecting at least half-hearted film. Toybox doesn't even give it. There are so many problems with this movie that I don't even know where to start, so I'll give you some major issues (again, spoiler warnings. Just read them, it will save you trouble watching this later). One, this movie starts with, and often mentions, the mythical folklore of both Celeste Noir (the witch who main character claims to be reincarnation), and the middle folker (or something like this, the evil man with the great a smile that cuts people through open hooks and sells cakes in a cake). I liked it, it was a cute concept, anything with cakes is just nice. But then you watch the movie and it's all about the idiot girl and her friend (And what was the deal with him? He was psychic? He had power? Why did he see the vision that even the so-called 'witch' didn't 'notice'), and they they meet their mad family. It's not really crazy, they just argue a lot. That's what most of this movie is, arguing, and hardly touching the supposed myth, except for a few confusing scenes that you can't make heads or tails. In one scene, Berenice (the main character related to the witch) travels away and makes some kind of ritual with the light of candles. It seemed important enough, but nothing happened after she did it, just wasting my time in vain. And who the hell was he with his dog? Do you see him walking toward the house from the very beginning of the movie with the evil red-eye dog, and then finally getting there and killing him? What the hell? Was it an intermediary? Was his dog obsessed? Did anyone kill a dog? They never showed it. Also, any scene with the Vicar was utterly useless and only served to weakly explain the lame end. It was as if they had all these interesting ideas for character and they all went nowhere! A friend who has apparently had some strength but never explains it. A grandmother who also seemed to have some witchcraft but never used them. The Vicar, who ... Well, it doesn't matter that his existence didn't make any sense. And then there was Berenice and her stupid amulet. Could it really be a spell or did she just use it to reflect light and blind people? That was a complete waste of time, and the only reason I gave him two stars at all is because a) Berenice is a little cute and b) She mentioned cakes. Save money on renting this and dear god, or think of buying it if the waste of money is a new fad.
