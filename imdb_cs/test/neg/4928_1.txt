It was this film he saw at the Fantasy Filmfest BERLIN. I'm not impressed. <br /> <br /> As for the story. Too girlfriends are returning from their vacation in Mexico. While waiting for their luggage, they recognize several boys who then take the last and, of course, bad shuttle bus to the city. There is also one other older man on board, so weird that you immediately guessed he was one of the bad guys. The other is the driver. The shuttle takes them to an industrial wasteland and then, secondly, makes a little blood, a cut of limbs, some violence, mostly playing with fear of a girl At the end of some ups and downs, heres and there, some are not too new frightening moments, everyone is dead but a driver and a girl. The girls end up in a garage where one of them is killed, after admitting to having slept with another girlfriend's girlfriend. The other girl, who is in the end, sells a left-handed kidnapper (yep, killed a killer) in some cargo box to Asia (the final picture is a cargo port). Story. Tons of gaps, questions you ask yourself, loose ends and a conclusion that is not a good revelation but a total disappointment. I don't see how such an unprofessional looser person should kidnap dozens of women (as the drawer full of driving licenses suggests ... aha) Second. Acting. Average in the best sense. Third. Scare Factor. OK. but I am BoRED tortured as a means to nothing but myself. Human trafficking could be a good reason for horror, but not used as one as well as background. <br /> <br /> Fourth, music and sound. Some nice experiments, but the sound possibilities of the industrial landscape, storage garages, and truck sounds were not explored. Music? It wouldn't be worse, but besides. Some pseudo moving synthetic string theme for emotionality when girls reach their ultimate goal. OK, I think. Verdict: AVOID IT!
