If you haven't seen the first, you must at least know someone who has and you must know that it was painful to sit. There was nothing good about it. So what is different with the other? Why bother making a sequel to a movie that was unhappy? This one is not taken too seriously. He knows he was made for television and does not try to impress a big or serious dialogue. There are times when trying to get 'serious' or 'intense', but these moments are so frantic that you have to laugh. Fortunately, there are all the elements of Uwe Boll and any hint that it comes from a video game (other than the title of course). Don't go to this movie expecting something worth mentioning to your friends if they aren't in camp, lame zombie movies, or are interested in drinking games from this movie. Take two shots when Ed Quinn's character mentions his dead brother! Take one shot when the bullet would be a better place in the zombie head instead of drawing three in the chest! etc.
