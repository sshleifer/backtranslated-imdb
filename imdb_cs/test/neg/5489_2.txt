Illuminata has extended John Turturra's mediocrity from the second actor to the third director, writer and producer. This movie was terrible. It is disjointed and moves from scene to scene with little flow or meaning relevant to the story's main line. <br /> <br /> We served with the smorgasbord fragmented scenes. The only thread that seems to go through them is that they occur in the lives of members of the same theater repertoire company. A few conspiracy-based scenes are so convoluted that you often can't tell if there is a dialogue from the story or the actors who play games in their story. If this story was human, it would be a schizophrenic with a personality disorder. She couldn't decide whether it was drama, romance, comedy, tragedy, sexual farce, or theater parody. It was closest to being bearable as a sex farce. Turturro was lifeless and expressionless like Tuccio, a supposedly complicated and passionate writer whose game gets his big chance when the currently running show has to be canceled because of the lead actor's illness. Susan Sarandon showed good performance because the aging actress is trying to seduce Tuccia into the role. Unfortunately, she found it necessary to go upstairs, which proves that the hardware of aging sexual symbols is much better than imagination. Christoher Walkin has performed a wonderful performance as a critic of theater criticism who makes passionate overtures to a cast member. Beverly D'Angelo and Ben Gazzara also had smaller roles. I gave this movie 2. Other than Walken's vignette, there's really not much to recommend her except that the puppets used in opening and closing times credits were extremely vibrant and beautiful. Avoid this movie like the plague that is. <br /> <br />
