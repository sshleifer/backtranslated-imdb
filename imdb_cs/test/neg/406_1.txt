I chose it because I spent time in the Albany area of ​​New York, I knew a few people in the movie and accidentally came across it. Comedy attempts are poor, a compulsory girl's scene is scary, the action is non-existent, acting is one of the worst I've ever seen, and it doesn't start with special effects. I realize this is a very low budget movie made by a small independent company, but if you are going to make sci-fi horror with giant bugs, don't make giant bugs absolutely incredible. People want to see huge mistakes. Here's half of the fun. And if you are going to make those huge mistakes absolutely incredible, at least force the actors to make some reference to this face ("You idiots! These aren't! Doubles!"). Be prepared to waste two hours of your life that you will never be able to return.
