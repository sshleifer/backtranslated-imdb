What is production, what is a waste of time and money. Here's what a European so-called producer thinks, scifi film. Take the former model, Alexander Kamp, pair with American c class actor and get one of the most famous producers of Harry A. Towers. The towers then find some dark Munich prod. House, Tandem Communication, Rola Bauer, and then mix it all with no scenario and get "Sumuru" - an invaluable gem among the worst movies ever made! Get live people and do something else you do, no movies please !! At the top of it, the producers went to South Africa for filming, what you see on the screen is one huge sand hole where "action" takes place, between extremely bad actors and extremely bad fx that every film student would do better.
