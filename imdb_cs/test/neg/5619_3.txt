With this film, director Roger Avery and Quentin Tarantino make the script I was sure it would be a gem. I was wrong. I hate this movie, but I don't like it in any way. I love Roger Avery because of his amazing direction in the rules of attraction and his script for pulp fiction and the quiet hill, but he did by mistake. I really have to comment on Tarantino, we all know he's a genius. this film is just around the gang that robs the bank but fails because of the stupid robbery people <br /> <Br /> I'm disappointed with Tarantino and Avery for doing this movie, but it does not change the view of how wonderful they are. everyone makes mistakes ......... 3/10 ........... j.d Seaton
