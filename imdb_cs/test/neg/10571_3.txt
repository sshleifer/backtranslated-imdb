This movie is funny if you are a gentleman who has been sitting around three rows behind me (I repeated every punchline, laughing when there were no gags on the screen and issuing "haaaa" gravel on every scene involving a computer or mobile device). <br /> <br /> It's a lively comedy for everyone else. The film strictly follows the pattern of later "Scary Movie" movies, as well as "Epic Movie" and "Meet the Spartans", though without a flood of heartless pop cultural links that made the two so annoying. Despite the fact that the world is making intellectual and peacemaking figures around the world, it is clear that the film knows its audience: people who are envious of the brain. "Superhero Movie" is especially and consistently ugly by Stephen Hawking, introducing him as a sex-starved druggie and using his disability as a vehicle for slapstick. The plot is based on "Spider-Man," with "Batman Begins" and "X-Men" thrown just to add some physical comedy. Much of the movie is slapstick, but not in any refreshing or interesting way. The longest running gag is fart joke, and soon the screenwriters seem to believe that having the main character get thrown into striking stacks of fake animal poo will automatically revive otherwise uninspired rehash spider bites scene from "Spider-Man." Perhaps the only feature of this function is the energy in it, especially absent from other recent parodies. The creators behave as if they are doing something new, and viewers can feel the way in which actors bounce on the screen. Extremely short length (about an hour and fifteen minutes) and enthusiasm for presentation make Superhero Movie more acceptable than scary.
