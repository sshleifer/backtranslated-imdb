Apparently I sail against the stream of glowing comments on this film. I haven't seen it since I was 4 or 5 years old, but there's one thing I remember clearly ... Bunyip TERRIFYING !!! The nightmare raises scary. With scary music and a little girl and a kangaroo running / leaping into their lives ... <br /> <br /> As a child, I also remember the animated Hobbit ... no worries. Leading Down? He didn't catch his eyes. Dot and Kangaroo? My dreams are still haunting me. And I have several friends of the same age who also think it was massively scary. Maybe we can get a group therapy rate. In short: One weird movie for its time.
