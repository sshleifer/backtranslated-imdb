CyberTracker takes place in Los Angeles sometime in the near future when bodyguard Eric Phillips (co-producer Don 'The Dragon' Wilson) rescues Senator Robert Dilly (John Aprea) from an assassination attempt by a group known as UHR, the Union of Human Rights on Dilly Annoyed by the annoyance of a computer court system in which CyberTrackers are sent to identify and deliver justice to the offender. Anyway, Eric will save Dilly, who is very impressed & decides to find out if he can trust Eric in his shady activities, such as the cold bloody murder of a traitor, because he's a great guy who is Eric when Dilly kills him a woman is asked to keep her calm. Eric escapes and goes down to Dilly, but Dilly has a lot of powerful friends and uses his influence to frame Eric and his CyberTrackers in his quest ... <br /> <br /> Co-produced & directed by Richard Pepin I think movies like CyberTracker give the movies a bad name, I didn't like it very much. The scenario Jacobsen Hart is quite predictable, not exciting, stealing most of his ideas and themes from other better sci-fi movies and intoxicating martial arts and sci-fi events so well. There is a couple of fighting, some car chases and a couple of shoot outs, but it's all more bland & forgettable. The film lacks imagination because the film is set in the future and deals with robots, technology and the way society is governed and, in particular, by the judiciary. When talking about the fantastic Robocop (1987) brilliantly mixing his violent action and clever social commentary, but CyberTracker doesn't even try to make any relevant social statements or try to portray a meaningful moral message about law enforcement, this scenario basically uses this concept. Robots and robots that Robocop did just as well, but also managed to incorporate a good story. There is very little in CyberTracker that I can say was fun & what movies are about what's right? Director Pepin does OK, but nothing excels, it's all forgotten, and it's not particularly exciting. Sci-fi elements are nothing but a robot of things, and as a whole the film doesn't look so futuristic. Action scenes are fine, there are some exploding cars and some shoots, but nothing spectacular. Technically, CyberTracker is average, it looks dated in the future and special effects are bad. Behavior was wrong, I wonder if Don 'The Dragon' Wilson controls the sign with this name? CyberTracker was a waste of my time, there's nothing original or exciting, and the action is instantly forgotten. Poor & that's all you have to say, not recommended.
