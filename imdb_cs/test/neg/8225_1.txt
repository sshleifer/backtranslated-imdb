The Garden State has to judge among the most sophisticated and demanding films of all time. The plot is simple, involving a young man who returns home after his mother's death and discovers love. But indeed, the plot is not important. What is important for Zach Braff - writer, director and star? is that he is able to hang from the plot all the necessary supplements of "indie" or "art" of the film. We are therefore presented with endless cute and unpredictable characters and scenes that do not exist for plot or character development, but simply give the film some artistic credibility (Ã  la Wes Anderson - or so Braff hopes). Unfortunately and somewhat incredibly, Braff not only deceived many on IMDb, but also some critics who really had to know better. Of course, Braff's unjustified use of the unpredictable does not mean that Garden State is a bad movie. What actually makes the garden state is a stinking Braff scenario. He simply does not have writing skills to carry this film away, and dialogue and characterization are useless. Braff often has to resort to dull suggestions and symbolism to achieve what he cannot achieve through writing. For example, the numbness of Braff's character shows us his indifference to the approaching plane (it cannot be incorporated into a conspiracy, so it must take place in a dream!) Later it is shown that he fights back against his circumstances shouting into the bottomless abyss gap, very clever Mr. Braff). These two scenes must be one of the most ridiculous and perfect ones he has ever seen on the cinema screen. On the plus side, acting performance is clear despite the lack of casting material that can be worked on. means scenario), and I admire Natalie Portman for her quest for love - a character so badly written and unlikely to be a little more than a mindless doll that Braff shapes into her fantasy woman. It seems that Braff took 3 years to write the script for Garden State (3 years to write the script so bad - really awkward!). Hopefully it will be some time before he makes another film.
