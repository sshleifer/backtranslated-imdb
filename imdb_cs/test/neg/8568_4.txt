I'm a huge horror fan, especially a Spanish horror fan. This film had so many possibilities to be good. It's a wonderful idea, the vigilante of the nun's spirit, like most of what came out of Jaume Balanguero's mind. The visual and sound effects were also pretty good. But everything was shamefully spoiled in the wrong direction, terrible casting, and a painfully bad scenario. Very bad. Maybe Balanguero should write and manage a remake ... <br /> <br /> Besides, I really don't understand why it had to be spoken in English by actors who can't speak English (and when they do), they do it so badly that only makes their performances even more fake). When you look at contemporary Spanish horror movies like El Orfanato or Rec, the performances are perfectly in line with this type of stylish ghost story - and that's realistic, believing as someone like us as real people, because that's the only thing the way horror reaches its goal. Unfortunately, everything failed in La Monja.
