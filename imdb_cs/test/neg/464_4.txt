the film is rare and the cage is a child. but will anyone agree with me that punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS?!?! where is the conflict? ramones? misfits? social distortion? křeče ?? sex pistol?! ANYONE?!?!?!?! music is this movie incredibly disappointing! on LEAST play medicine. plus randy's feathered hair and pleated khaki ... <br /> <br /> this definitely looks like a movie about "punks" so that a bunch of movie industry squares see punks. Although it is the '90s, SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980s. Just say it.
