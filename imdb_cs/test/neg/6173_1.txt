A really scary waste of space. Me and my friend tried to watch this movie until its conclusion, but we had to shut it down about 30 minutes from the end. And I can count the movies I turned off before the end on one side. <br /> <br /> Scenario and direction are lead and deeply uninspiring. I wouldn't be surprised if they found the scenario in a pile of postponed scenarios of 1983. For example, an irritable scream threatening a man from a house in his house. Seriously. The police would beat the door in a few minutes. Scenes and events just wash you like turds in the river. It is hard to understand the real thrust of the film. The narrative moves between characters in a seemingly random manner that breaks down pathetic attempts to build characters. And what are the "characters". The protagonist played by Rourke is terrible. He could just send cardboard and stay in bed. After 60 minutes of film, I made absolutely zero binding to this character. He is neither sympathetic nor hateful. Just a misshapen figurine from the shop window that flew through every single scene. His motivation is impossible to distinguish from his generally confused and heartless birth. He is happy? Is sad? Angry? No idea. Just the same dead eyes are staring at you from a mutilated piece of meat. And the native American theme is just awful and meaningless. Good guys are unlikely at best. The blunt stereotype of the white collar and the disturbing stereotype of the former wife. A cue archetypal wife with a shotgun is facing a bad guy, "you won't shoot me", which is both tiring unoriginal and annoying. Richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into irritating one-sided psycho character. Which contradicts the apparent intention of doing evil people in some way compassionate or at least realistically motivated. chick scenes from Jackie Brown. Do you really want me to believe that her character was attracted to Rourek? Or worse, it's just a flood that sleeps with anything that moves? Realistic Female FTW Characters! <br /> <br /> In short, a complete movie. Hopeless characterization and performance. Leaded and shabby scenario along with unfurnished direction. And finally extremely boring. It's not a bad comedy either. Laughing on Rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting in the first 15 turgid minutes of the movie.
