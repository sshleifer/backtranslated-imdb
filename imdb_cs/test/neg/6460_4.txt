Why does Guy work for Buddy? Probably because Ari wasn't in 1995. Why does Dawn want to be with Guy? For access to Buddy. Why will he stay with Guy? I'm not sure. <br /> <br /> There's a lot of things I'm not sure about on this movie. But, Kevin Spacey is an excellent, word tsunami like Buddy Ackerman? and absolutely believable because he's a great actor. Frank Whaley's Guy is certainly out of his buddy element? he wants to write and make meaningful movies, not be a gofer who is verbally abused for getting Equal instead of Sweet & Low. Dawn Michelle Forbes, who also wants to make meaningful movies, seems to be from Guy's league.
