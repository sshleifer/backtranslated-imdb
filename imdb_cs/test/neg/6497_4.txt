I have seen this "ego-centric" effort to achieve the film "epic" in the society of several native Russian family members. Five people have given 5 different responses, from the worship of Mikhalkov to my cynicism. <br /> <br /> I saw a movie that looked like Michalkov took a lot of money "Canal +", put it in his (and another). pocket and turned the project into a lot of film students. I counted at least 4 different "styles" in the movie. There is no way the same director would be responsible for these different scenes. Contrast them for yourself: <br /> <br /> · Cadets polish shoes with a dog. Train Station Scene (Farewell to Andrea). <br /> <br /> · Outdoor Panoramic Views. Ormond speaks through a keyhole. Early attempt at Grand Duke and later chase scenes to get Andrei to sing in Figaro. <br /> <br /> · Fencing Sequences <br /> <br /> Julia Ormond is faster than superman. When you hear about his transmission late, he gets to Moscow in one minute and says goodbye to Andrej. Russian natives believed that the impression of Russian life was "cartoon" and not history. They called it the "tourist postcard" of Russia. Everyone was proud that the Russian director / producer / fixer was able to break into "big time" and be able to waste more than $ 30 million on others. people's money while maybe putting a little into local pockets during filming. <br /> <br /> If you want to "think" you saw Russia go to see this movie. Drink coffee before you go.
