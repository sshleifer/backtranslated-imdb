INFERNO starts with an impressive effect for the TVM starscape effect. We are also introduced by scientists called Heller. Don't you get it? Heller, Hell-er, Inferno. So I think somebody on the production had some intelligence. However it becomes more and more obvious as TVM progresses that intelligence has been discarded throughout the story in order to appeal to the American TVM audience <br /> <br /> The story itself is overwhelmed by subplots featuring plenty of TVM character shares like hard a liberal teacher who tries to save a home boy from crime, a doctor who has lost a medical license, etc. In fact, the story focuses much more on these characters than on the impending catastrophe, that all the potential tensions and drama that the scenario might soon be to jump up, appear in smoke and be a TVM. The End <br /> <br /> There is a problem on the screen I noticed and it is always there is a blast there is a massive fireball that looks ridiculously not to mention physically impossible. Look at the scene where the National Guards are fighting the gang. A soldier fires a grenade into the tower and the whole building explodes in a fire ball. What a small grenade that contains no more than a few ounces of explosive can do it! No, it can't. There is also another scene of military engineers who throw up a plastic explosive dam and see the same fiery effect. Directors may notice that the explosive is not the same as napalm <br /> <br /> I said I found out that INFERNO is very watchable for TVM and I didn't want to turn it off at any time. It had some potential and let me repeat the special effects that are relatively good for the budget and not as bad as TVM, as some people do
