First of all, I'm sorry for the lame pun in the title. I was looking at the movies I rented the next day, and I saw it. I heard something about it so I took it and looked at my back and there was a short little review of it from John Fallon AKA Arrow in the head! At that moment I thought, "Well, if he likes it, then I like it!" So I rented it and finally got to watch it last night (college is so busy). Oh, and maybe I would like to add that I read a bit of Arrow's review and turned out to be one and a half out of 4 stars. So my expectations from this movie went from very high to iffy. Well, after watching it, I agree with Arrow again (and it turns out that the quote from the review was the only positive thing he said!) Wow, the movie stinks or what? Where to start, why was that? In my opinion, the film was so boring. Even the amazing pieces have excited me, and when the upset in the movie doesn't bother you, it's bad! Characters I hated a lot and from the beginning I could tell who dies and who doesn't. In fact, on some points, the film turned out to be bad, but the worst part is that one strange character I wanted to die wasn't! What the heck? And the chemistry between the main girl and the guy she met? I didn't feel it. Apparently he was just there to have eye candy and give her a love interest, otherwise I thought it was a waste! And as a horror fan, I should know that making a "stupid horror movie" sometimes has to happen, otherwise there would be no movie, but those who are here have checked me out! Hi? Why are you doing killer nuns in the room when you should be wary? And that was supposedly done by smarter figures. That would be okay if it weren't a billion times and I didn't have to sit over this movie to get this point! My main point: A silly film that drew me with some words of my favorite film critic. Cracks!
