It's nonsense. I studied Nazism and read many of today's manuscripts - "parallels" use most of the classic dishonored apocryphal myths of Nazism and then compare them to complete speculative generalizations about what make up 1/3 of the planet. It is created for Polly-Anna viewers who rely heavily on spoons, creepy arguments, irrational conclusions, deceptive thoughts and meaningless logic. <br /> <br /> Who hit this peace? Easily. <br /> <br /> When all is said and done; Que Bono? Is that who benefits, in the long run? <br /> <br /> Not you. You sacrifice money and rights. Not the Muslims, they'll get our bombs. Try it again. Answer it and unlock the main door.
