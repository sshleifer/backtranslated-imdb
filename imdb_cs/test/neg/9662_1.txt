What about Cal - what now? Yeah, I thought it was a stupid name. Chris Carter remains blissfully unaware of dirt in his staff writing. Begin with the usual hilarious X-Files teaser (baby getting run by train) for this episode ... well I can't say it's going downhill because being honest that never go up. Poorly written, with us we feel no pathos for any of the characters (except maybe the child at the beginning) the writer makes us hate the characters before brutally killing them, it's the worst technique ever. Should We Regret Hate Figures? Do not ask me. Not only is it boring and scary, but it's like watching really bad Omen's sequel with crowded and disgusting deadly sequences and rotten special effects (though brutally honest, that's the least of my worries ). Sara B. Charno started her X-Files career with a whimper and fortunately she ended it once. Verdict: <br /> <br /> The words of my math teacher Mr. Laverack: "Terrible, terrible ..."
