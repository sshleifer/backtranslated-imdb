I watch TON movies and enjoy the casual movie B, but this movie was terrible. In addition to the "home" quality of the film, it was very slow and it seemed meaningless. I'm just commenting on b / c for another comment I've seen that said it was great! WOW! Maybe you can watch a rainy day when nothing else is available. The characters were incoherent and did not fit any recognizable pattern of reality. The dialogue between the characters was forced and sometimes very confusing. I think if you were very much in 51, and you understood some of the other notes, it could be good - but for me - Average Joe - I don't get it!?
