This movie has a fairly decent premise - one gruesomely featured again and again in sci-fi movies, most spectacularly in "Alien" - and some decent "he-man" performances of male cast. The obsessed astronaut's wife is a weak link in the ensemble - she doesn't seem to know what to do with her face in many of her most striking scenes for which I blamed director Corman. <br /> <br /> Due to a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent game on the screen, "Blood Beast" could be pretty decent. The inherent cheapness of manufacturing design and continuity errors and gaffes undermine management. For example, every time I saw a coma astronaut, which was unloaded on an "examination table" in the width of the ironing board, I broke into a giggle, probably not the emotion the crew wanted. And the monster costume needed some serious work; Parrots cover parrots just aren't scary or persuasive. Yet the assumption was strong enough to hang up to the end just to see how the story would be solved, and the stranger's motives were ambiguous enough. at first I could think of it as a mystery. And the scene with the shot of the murdered scientist had a little blow to him, along with the development of a conspiracy where the alien claimed to have assimilated some of the dead man's personality. It's Corman. It's cheap, fast and slightly traceable if you don't think too hard or expect too much. What else is there to say?
