I've seen some Bible-based waste. This is all. To make things worse, it takes about three hours. A terrible waste of time if you don't want to match your child's biblical knowledge to countless deviations. Do yourself a favor - instead take a walk in the Sahara. Since I am obliged to give you a ten line statement on why to watch this movie, let me say it is absolutely no redeemable quality. God's conversations with Noah are ridiculous. The whole thing has a bad smell "Let the biblical account be delayed." The basic logic is that if they spent the money on the biblical film, why shouldn't it be useful? Because basic logic is not fulfilled, something is wrong. The film begins with the announcement of poetic licenses that have been accepted ... that is the understatement of the century. Poetic rape. But then the poetics would be an undeserved kindness.
