Alexandra Maria Lara: A very beautiful and appealing woman, but not a good actress. In all the movies I've seen, it seems to me that it's exactly the same character. Whether it's DOWNFALL, NACKT, VOM SUCHEN UND FINDEN DER LIEBE and now WO IST FRED! It's always (playing?) A young, kind-hearted woman who is a little naive and doesn't know how to handle her. It has a repertoire of about five different facial expressions with which it works abundantly. I personally find it hard to believe that it could play a mysterious and slightly unpleasant character because it's just not here. So it's courage as a pretty girl next door who's but again, she's not except for snuff when it comes to acting. Til Schweiger: Same! Movie: Foolishly stupid. As it was an American movie, it would be a big role for Adam Sandler, who I don't like. I wasn't offended by the fact that it was a movie with people with disabilities, I just thought the jokes that came out of it were not funny at all. I laughed two or three times, but when I was halfway, I was just bored and angry and wanted this movie to end.
