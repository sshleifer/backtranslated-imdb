... but unforgettable because it contains an actor I really recognize! James Horan is according to these standards films by Lawrence Olivier. He gives some decent performances on things like Highlander and various Star Trek, so it's a little fun, if it's slightly depressing, to watch it unfold. Okay, yeah, there's a plot. Horan's character and his wife fight, he has an affair with the film reviewer, while trying to make his "master" movie, and their guest decides to enjoy the wonders of stripping. But watching Horan is really the only pleasure here.
