The cryptozoologist captures the mythical Chupacabra on the Caribbean island. To get back to civilization, he bribes his way into the cargo compartment of a large luxury cruise ship, and I think the scenario was disastrous. <br /> <br /> Let's start with one thing I didn't really like about this movie ... The monster really looked like a guy in a rubber suit. CGI scenes looked like another movie. OK, it's from my chest now for all the nice bits about this movie B. <br /> <br /> The best thing was John Rhys-Davies (his daughter eye candy close to second.) John was occasionally funny and amazing And no matter what the writers said of him, he said well. Good work given what he had to work with. The cyptozoologist was on top and having fun to watch too, had some funny bits. Make a good cannon feed for the monster as well as some of the crew and guests.There are a few pretty funny lines in this movie, and quite a fun partial plot involving thieves. Special effects are generally low on honey and I swear they re-used the same blood spray on the mural scene in four different parts of the movie. I really liked that this film was ungodly. Since this movie wasn't terrifying at all, I feel a little more gore, which would improve in watching the film's capabilities. <br /> <br /> Everyone in All If you like monsters B, it's worth a visit.
