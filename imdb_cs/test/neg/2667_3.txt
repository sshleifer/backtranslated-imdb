OK, just what does HELL mean? It is undoubtedly the strictest movie in the series (and what I have heard when I see that the original "producers" don't hear that doing things somewhat confused than the "official" release. What a mess. This is not really a bad movie, as some have said, it has its scary scenes and some somewhat intense moments - it just doesn't use SENSE! Don't tell me Michael was "engineering" from the beginning to be bad and kill and destroy It was bad enough when Michael turned to Jamie Lee Curtis's brother (just to have an excuse to keep her in the second movie) - that's too much. it's another case of filmmakers trying to be "too clever" by coming up with a new premise that shocks us and impresses all of us. Bad move, guys. We're not looking for an explanation for why Michael is killing us, please don't try to n show me how Michael is threatening and killing a lot of people, show me Dr. Loomis how he tried to track him down and as always comes short. Don't waste (what turned out to be) Donald Pleasance's last performance when you tell me (in the most ridiculous way) that Michael was "created" by a cult of hell and that his "seed" will be passed on to another and ... oh, brother. Halloween 6 has its moments, don't get me wrong and we all know that there were FAR worse than this (Hellraiser, anyone?) what you can get out of it (scene to the end of the movie with Michael down The deep red corridor is especially effective) and try to ignore the plot. Hopefully one day we will see all the "producer cuts," and maybe we'll get a chance to feel a little more of it. Until then, he'll have to do it ... <br /> <br /> -FTM
