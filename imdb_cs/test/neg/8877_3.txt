I will recommend that this one in the "skip" pile as well. I was slightly excited about the concept when the fiancé rented it, and a little more excited when I saw Milos Forman driving it. Ah, well ..... <br /> <br /> Costumes were nice, sure, but they were typical. There was nothing about them to say they were from anywhere, except for the separation of the period costume of any major Hollywood studio. There was no difference between Spanish, British and French - all dressed up as if they were in Versailles. The kits somehow did not create the setting - the prison did not feel like a prison, the houses did not feel like houses, and the outer scenes seemed to be filmed on their backs. they were probably practical places. <br /> <br /> The score was significantly lower than it could be. I have been a fan of film scores since my youth, I have noticed, appreciated and collected them. My fiancée is a professional film composer, a prize winner who has worked at Lincoln Center and a rising star in the industry. At the beginning of the movie we had great hopes for it and it really started pretty well. This quickly deteriorated, and in several places - including the prisoners' release scene - it actually reached the level of annoyance. Actually, I have made the remote control lower the volume. The score has never been more than the most obvious choice for scoring a particular scene tone, and has not integrated into the "soul" of the movie (I think of the music in Babel and you have an idea of ​​what I mean). She never reached the magnificence he wanted, but then the movie. Javier Bardem, as talented as he was, was terrible. For the first part of the film, his mannerisms are so distracting that he takes over his performance. During the second half, everything that was his character in the first half is gone, replaced by a completely different set of annoying mannerisms, and he looked like a love-Keith Richards baby and Stuart Townshend's Lestat. I never got the idea that he cared for the role (that is, he cared for the character for his life and actions), or for the writers to consider it more than an opportunist who, for whatever reason, changed his mind and he decides to stick to his principles at the end. Natalie Portman was very good, although her performance lacked the shades of increasing madness between her release from prison and the acceptance of Lorenzo's hand at the end. that I need to call it a really effective performance. Alice's character has never been defined enough to be truly recognizable, and if it were not for perfect makeup on her eyes and faces, someone who would see the beginning of the movie and its end would not know that it was not the same character. Prosthetic teeth were terrible, artificial and distracting, but there was no knocking on Mrs. Portman. Stellan Skarsgård was like Goya right. Not Oscar-worthy, but practical and generally believable. I don't know much about Goya's life or his deafness, but he seemed to be attached to the film as a requirement for biographical information, rather than what was used in the film. I'm sure this has affected Goya's life a lot more than just the need for an interpreter, but you never knew he'd watch it. For recording, words and sounds can be correctly interpreted about 30% of the time by reading lips. Don't let me start with Randy Quaid. At least he was a smaller figure. The script is written as one of the books "Choose your own adventure" that I read as a child: at several moments through the film, several outcomes are possible, and none of the actions that precede them lead with confidence how the film actually plays. Ironically, the film is also predictable, especially its humble attempts to mood with small pieces of humor. Hand Joke? Maybe it's because he painted (not good) as a hobby and I know what PITA's hands are supposed to draw / paint, but I saw a joke coming a mile away, as well as a repeat in the second half. Was it a child for any other reason than Ines accepted him? It could also be a series of breadcrumbs. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> (note: this review is a copy of the answer I posted on the thread in the forum)
