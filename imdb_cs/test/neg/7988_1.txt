This vicious little movie is horrible. My low ranking comes for two main reasons. The first is that it is an animal snuff film, and I consider the whole concept so disgusting that it turns my stomach. Filmed over a century ago, I can only hope that we have evolved into something a little more humane and compassionate. This film is a total and utter exploitation that is spent on cash on the sensational aspects of film and theme. Historical interest aside, this is something to watch only if you find yourself in a morbid fascination. <br /> <br /> Reason number two? See how the camera is set up. It is positioned in the best possible position to fully capture the full effect: a long walk from the elephant, a perfect view of the electric platform and a cold and clinically scattered view of an elephant with smoke coming out of it before finally collapsing. Thomas Edison has done many things for civilization and his talents and intelligence are in no doubt. No one is perfect, but when you realize that this film has provided A) an opportunity for him to trump early film competitors with the sensational elephant movie, which is electroslaged, and B) filmed an execution to demonstrate greater DC efficiency unlike AC, you can't help but wondering if the scientist in it was a little TOO dispassionate and cold. Some crazy scientist Peter Cushing would be proud. The rest of us should be ashamed and rebellious.
