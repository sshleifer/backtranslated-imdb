This film fails on many levels. The script is the first failure, and as I understand, if the script stinks, there is nothing that could fix it. The story is boring, after the first 45 minutes, I look at the DVD counter and say to myself, "How long longer?" Cinematography is pretty awful. I'm not sure how bad it was on DVD, but it looked like a copy of VHS. Also the sound was bad. I realize that it will not be remixed for 5.1, but yikes, it didn't sound like it was in Dolby Stereo, which was about a decade ago when they cut this movie. Slipstream was too similar to Mad Max and Blade Runner for convenience. Because of the lack of decent special effects and high quality dialogue, it is extremely disappointing. As I recall, the scene of the indicator has taken place in the last 20 minutes, usually in the first 20 minutes. Most people will be totally confused about what the hell is going on in the last 20 minutes. <br /> <Br /> The music of the film was partly excellent and completely unsuitable in others. Elmer Bernstien has scored, but it sounds like someone else's hand is holding on to other things because it doesn't match the overall good orchestral score (with some synthesizer music). They were great cast casters, Bob Peck, Mark Hamill, Ben Kingsley, Bill Paxton. And they did a great job of bringing their little life to their characters. (Well, Paxton's character was pretty stupid, and the whole movie was focused on him. I'm not sure if the heroic stagna is a good choice for the main character who carries the movie.) Again, the main mistake with the script. Br /> <br /> Thank God, I saw it from a mail order DVD, not from the theater. Overall, the main disappointment for Sci-fi fans, or Paxton fans, or Hamill. 90 minutes of your life, you never come back.
