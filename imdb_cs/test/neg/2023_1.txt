Given that they wanted to make a film about a vampire in space, I thought, "Well, it's probably pretty shabby, but at least as interesting to see another genre." Oops. I don't care what kind of movies you like; even if you are the biggest vampire, horror, thriller or imitation fan in the world, or adversely if you have never seen a horror movie and would expect your first to be impressive in any way ... it's wrong. I don't think I've ever seen a "bad thing for a TV movie" or after school. I've never seen a television pilot think it was wrong. I've never seen shots of animals that sleep or shitting that it's as bad as this. This is by far the single biggest loss of hours you might otherwise spend thinking about the importance of wipes and their impact on your life. I'd rather be trapped in the bathroom for a few weeks so I wouldn't consume anything but my own urine and feces rather than watch one clip of this movie again. Watching this made me wish for the fate that the characters fell instead of being aware of the knowledge that I paid the money to watch. But it was like a train wreck: so bad you couldn't help but look, hoping something good would happen. No. Please, for love of God, if you or your friends - even if you use illegal substances when you do - even think about watching this movie, choose a competition instead to see who can shoot a snot-rocket rocket. It will bring you much more enjoyment and fun.
