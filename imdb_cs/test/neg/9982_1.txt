As a semi-film enthusiast, I've heard about this infamous movie long ago. I heard it was basically a $ 15 million film about the tyrannical government of the Roman Emperor Caligula, accompanied by hard pornography. What I was thinking was that it was a porn movie, but it had big thespians like Peter O'Toole, John Geilgud, Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it !! A week ago, I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History Channel, and this movie came back to my head and finally my curiosity got me the best, I rented a DVD stupidly and watched him stupidly. During the first 30 minutes I saw sexual and especially violent acts that would bring the NC-17 even to today's standards. It was really necessary to have a scene of a man who had his urinary tract closed, and then liters of wine were poured into it, and then his belly was cut with his sword (all in a very graphic detail). And a scene in which a person gets his d *** cut off and fed for dogs (again in very graphic detail) .... and it just scratches the surface. The argument for this film from those who like it seems to be the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and is an excess. When in fact what this film really is is total exploitation. From beginning to end, you see nothing but endless torture and decapitation, and all kinds of violence and gross behavior that can be imagined (sadomasochism, rape, necropolis, never stopped). There is no view on Caligula that could make him mad, a terrible childhood that has formed him into a sadist as an adult. It's not a historical movie, it's a sleaze. Even porn stinks in this movie, and so many times, when I didn't shake, I was incredibly bored. When I was finished, I was depressed, I didn't feel like eating and this film makes it impossible, in fact it can deter sex. <br /> <br /> What these great actors thought when they got into it. I read that the porn segments were filmed after the main movie was finished (which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so bad). But still and all these actors had to know what they got into. Right at the opening titles he says "Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents". And the scenes on which the famous actors are really involved are in themselves utterly disgusting. Director Tinto Brass seems to have wanted his name completely removed, just like the screenwriter (Gore Vidal of all people). Even John Geilgud and Peter O'toole begged people not to see it when they opened at the Cannes Film Festival. <br /> <br /> For the amount of money the producers have made, the quality of the film is terrible. Everything is backlit and murky, as if the film was dropped into the swamp before it was developed, and that is when you're lucky enough to see a scene that is actually in focus. The sound is badly dubbed, much of the music is awkward, and the cut is god terrible. Anyway, I brought this movie to myself. My advice ... do not look at it, do not look at it, do not look at it ...... like me tomorrow night I will watch something lighter ... like DAWN DEAD!
