If you're a fan of the original series, you don't see this movie. I should have been skeptical of the previews when Aeon expresses her motives for murder. He had no family in Aeon, and no motive for her adventure saved selfish interests. Apparently the chimpanzee-scorer in the fee felt the film needed to procure a "bad grrl" demographic by being deadly in character but having a good reason to kill people. You wouldn't think the movie is two-dimensional than film. All characters are shown inherently good with a certain conflict of interest that will eventually be resolved. All dogs go to heaven, and the same for every character who dies in this movie. Selfish, twisted, perverse, dominating Aeon and Trevor are nowhere to be seen. Finally, it literally develops into cutesy ala Annie Hall. The only figure that remained faithful to the show was the Relicle, a floating machine in the sky. I think if you ever thought "gee, I like Aeon Flux, but I wish it was more like any other anonymous, good-in-evil Hollywood sci-fi that smells there". They didn't even have the right look. I suppose black metal bikinis were too much in demand, but the setting was bad. 400 years into the future certainly looks like 30 years into the past. Instead of a distinctive urban post-apocalyptic world, the viewer's eyes are offended by the frutopia of a 70-year-old prayer room of egg-shaped furniture, wood-paneled walls, earth tones and lots of plants. Bregna was dystopia, not utopia. Speaking of Bregna, this is the only film-based city in the world. The show is clear that there are two cities, Bregna and Monica, which used to be one. In the movie, "Monicans" are just Hollywood story freedom-fighters. They also have as much technology as Bregnans, which is not the case from the show. The only possible conclusion is that the real writer for this film was a high school child, and that he wrote it the day before it was due to studio execs, and he never saw the entire Aeon Flux all the way through . The overwhelming amount of dissonance with the cartoon is confusing. In addition to using certain names such as Aeon Flux, Trevor Goodchild and Bregna, the film is nothing like a show. The real size of the film seems to be trying to blend the colorful plot of soy loan green, the runner blade, Logan's run, and the grave robber who came out of a dim brown mess.
