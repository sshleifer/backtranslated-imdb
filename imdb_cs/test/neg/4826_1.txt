I don't know how people can observe it - the only people who look at it are those who have no feelings and emotions and like to watch people die, houses burn, car accidents, children die and kill members every week. . It's the most ridiculous thing on TV and I still don't know how it pulls into the ratings. It's so depressing. I can imagine writers sitting and saying - "So who will kill next week" or "whose house will we march in months of time?" <br /> <br /> It's the most depressing, absurd and most stupid thing on TV At the moment, and I can't understand the people's motives for watching this depressing pile of crap anymore
