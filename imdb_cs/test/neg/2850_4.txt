It was not a complete waste. Armand was in the film as usual very good, the whole turk vs german thing was a bit weird because I remember seeing Bulgaria at the beginning of the movie ... bothered to come back and check ... the main topic is about serial killing with the whole gang war loosely woven inside. I have never seen a movie where the characters looked Italian, had to be a Turk, with English (American accent and euphemisms) with German words. The top was the most interesting part, and its parts didn't make sense to me. Anyway, if you have nothing better, you can watch this movie ..
