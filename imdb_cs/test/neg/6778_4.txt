This film describes a really horrible event to be sure. But it all falls from the bad performance of the entire cast. It is impossible to feel the emotions of almost any character because all the emotional scenes seem like parodies of themselves. For example, a character is shot at the beginning of the movie, and you get clichés desperately, "I'll do it, Sergeant?", "Yeah It's Nothing", but it plays like a sketch from a war movie) or something that Leslie Nielsen plays. Sergeant Sean Penn reminds me of Al Bundy of Married With Children, while Fox is the biggest self-disgusting cliché of good guys you can imagine ... Thank God he's cursing and smoking. <br /> <br /> His emotional "NOOOO !!!" is definitely more suitable for comedy like Back To The Future than so-called serious movies like this. <br /> <br /> To their credits, some of the "main" scenes ... (without going too far, where they actually do some terrible deeds) ... are well done and make us serious. But this is despite not acting.
