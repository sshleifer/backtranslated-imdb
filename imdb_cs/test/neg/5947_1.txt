Tom Selleck plays absent son to senile "pop" Don Ameche and tired mom Anne Jackson, making his indiscretions (one assumes) and taking them after Ameche burned his mobile home; Meanwhile, Selleck's work is defeated by F.B.I, his property is frozen, his wife and children leave him, and his unpleasant sister and her brats came to stay. The brightly painted comedy-sick is just as in contact with reality as Ameche avoids the old coot. Perhaps a serious first draft (with scenes like Ameche walking into traffic with two toddlers) was incorporated into the sillier of the second or third version (with Selleck getting stuck, bumped, irritated, and ultimately losing his finger and testicles!). Either way, it is a painful experience, and Selleck's sudden devotion to his father makes little sense; He circles around and howls with pain, but keeps the heart of the porridge. This film is porridge. * of ****
