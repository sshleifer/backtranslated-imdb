Making a film based on a true story, especially one as incredible and scary as the 1972 crash of the Andean aircraft, is hard for even the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans will not even try this forgotten and cheap exploitation! The real names of both survivors and victims of the Uruguayan Air Force crash have been changed, the accident itself is clearly arranged in a very slippery manner, and the aspect of cannibalism has been unnecessarily and playfully played. Shockingly, he made a ton of money on both sides of the border. Fortunately, he thought, he was mercifully forgotten. But the same people would later give us the same rebellious GUYANU: CULTURAL DAMAGE! This cheap horror exploitation film required ALIV to be produced about fifteen years later. The film was a masterpiece. SURVIVE!
