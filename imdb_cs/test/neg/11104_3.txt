It's all my fault. Everyone told me I should avoid this movie because I'm a huge fan of the old TV series. They were right. While the production values ​​are good and the actors themselves (including "don't look now"), Julie Christie is not so bad, the whole film shows indifference and self-confidence that is clearly without any justification. A comparison between Karloff "Mummy" and "The Mummy Returns 2000" comes into my mind. In fact, Belphegore 2000 owes much more to the new Mummy movies than the old series. But then scripting is horrible, there is no speed, and sometimes the film is full of unintentional jokes (The first scene in the tomb looks stupid), while cats are thrown clearly when they have to jump (landing with their rear flanks). Belphegore moves like a sculpture on wheels, neither impressive nor frightening and psychological drama that has appeared in an old TV series when the heroine had to know she was completely neglected. This film is so WASTE (a waste of money, a waste of actors, an unnecessary plan) that hurts. It's a below average mummy-rip off that is just good for some laughs, but has nothing to do with Greco classic (It has a small role in this movie - in the cemetery).
