This is not a good movie at all. I can't believe that after fifty years, this film will receive the National Prize when such Marathi jewelry was systematically ignored. This is a very overrated movie that got very, very happy. It was given the National Prize, a harvested popular opinion and now will represent India before an international audience. Anyone who has a marginal understanding of good, quality film will know very well that it will not even be nominated for an Oscar. <br /> <br /> I don't know where to start. There are only so many things that are bad and missing in this movie that is amazing to have even got a national award. Being awarded this year as the best film to be released this year is an example of the biased judgment of the people who hold the reins of Indian film and the tiny understanding of people who blindly appreciate the film. <br /> <br /> The theme is great. Is it important that these films are made? but only people who can handle them. Sandeep Sawant measures up to the task ?? not even close. His direction is nervous, confused. There is no clear thought process. He is trying, but not able to explore the depth of the characters, especially the grandfather. He is unable to show the initial horror, anxiety and then hopeless courage, yet the unbeatable courage of his grandfather. He loses our time in the hospital when we have to show that they spend time together. They try to stuff everything without any priorities. He doesn't understand his topic correctly and it really counts against him. However, Sawant does not help. Worst work ??? Amruta Shubash. He's a terrible actor and a terrible choice for this or any reasonable acting job. How did she get 'Tee Phulrani'? Extremely lucky and / or extremely influential and / or extremely pitiful cast. She said she goes out of her way to do even more terrible work in this movie. Her act MSW should go to a more responsible actor? Sonali Kulkarni. Amruta Subhash didn't understand. MSW works under constant emotional stress, yet it is important for them to design a calm, strong exterior because it is reassuring for patients. Asawari Amruta Subhash seems even more frightened and needs support than the people she works for. <br /> <br /> Worst second ??? Arun Nalawade. I've never seen a more wooden face in the Marathi film industry (that's plentiful and everywhere in today's Hindu film). He is a producer, so he chose himself; no second thought, no consideration. Any good actor would jump to play this role, even if he had to pay the producer to do it, but Arun Nalawade wouldn't let anyone else do that. More than ambitious and dull, it contributes to making the film more than everyone else. His acting lacks research and even basic acting skills. My choice for this role would be Vikram Gokhale. <br /> <br /> Music is not inspired. The film is technically missing. It could be work on the FTII project. <br /> <br /> Top; great performance Ashwin Chitale. It's amazing that such a young boy could provide such a decent performance. Many of today's actors have shamed. Unintentionally possible, but he brought his own innocence to his character and it made it an unforgettable feat. Also, Sandeep Kulkarni really gave a very believable performance. Indeed, it is all in his efforts and shows. The script is also well written. 'Shoestring budget' cannot be a valid argument for praising this film. Lack of funds dogs all Marathi movies. Cricket and Hindu movies mushrooms all the money and the rest are left to fight for scraps. It is a regret of the state, but there is not enough reason to praise any immature film that comes out. 'Doghi' was a great movie and it was also on the cord budget. 'Doghi' also lacked technically, but it was well researched and well done. It was abundant in detail and backed by beautiful performances by everyone, making it a rich cinema. Why didn't he get the award he deserved? ?? it merely proves my opinion of biased judgment. The lack of research and not the means is what makes 'Shwaas' such a bad movie.
