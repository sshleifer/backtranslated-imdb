This movie was so terrible that I don't even know where to start ... The only positive thing I can say about this is that Luke Perry did a good job. The whole film was everywhere, there was no explanation about the causes (only theories) of eruptions, or a rational solution to their solution, or why it would work. It was ridiculous! All the characters and relationships between them were so cheesy, you just want to laugh! None of them had any background. It seems that the "love" relationship has been added to the script, it was so embarrassing. There's a soldier in there; a big black general with a permanent cigar in his mouth, with "AaarrrGH! I'm a man!" attitude, such a poor evil guy. Two sidekicks who are supposed to be geniuses behave like two sixteen year old frat boys. And then create an action that decides to drop someone's rock and cough for the rest of the movie, as if dying of pneumonia or something ... and then playing a hero (the holiest scene of all !!) to help with the plan he has do who knows what ... his never good sign when you find yourself laughing out loud amid a dramatic scene ... in a nutshell; Don't waste your time!
