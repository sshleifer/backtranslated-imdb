James Cagney plays Richard Gargan (nicknamed "Patsy"!), A former gangster who now oversees the brutal boys as the new superintendent of a state-run reform school. The genre entry of Tepid where Cagney's entire show; he controls the image, but only because nothing else happens. Jimmy only gives what is expected of his hard-built personality, which can be satisfying if you're going to a quick fix. The direction (Archie Mayo, though Michael Curtiz was said to help) is direct without being particularly clenched, though the story slips in the second half, cutting the film to a chaotic conclusion (with even Cagney's Patsy lost in shuffle). Rebuilt in 1938 as "Crime School" and again in 1939 as "Hell's Kitchen". ** of ****
