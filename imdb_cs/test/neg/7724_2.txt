When Uwe Boll, the cinema con man extraordinaire, released the first House Of The Dead adaptation on a fully deserved taunt, it was generally agreed between fans of the source video game that one would have to be incredibly moronic to think about continuing. The Hollywood per capita ratio must be really high, because not only do we have a sequel, it has been distributed in Sony antipodes, a company that is not usually known for its taste in expensive depreciation. Relaxing directly into television in America, the sequel improves on the original in most respects, but in it does, it becomes indistinct rather than interesting. The range of scenarios is widespread, with actions taking place in an abandoned city that is just surrounding the university, where there are experiments in the virus that can revive the dead. This event is particularly widespread throughout the university, where the first infected residents are located. To put it simply, the film differs from the original by actually occurring in the house where the dead people are. On the other hand, casting is a real step backwards. Emmanuelle Vaugier was specially designed to resemble the low-rent Angelina Jolie, while the rest of the cast never reaches the slumming-it level of JÃ¼rgen Prochnow. The only name that stands out in this cast is Sticky Fingaz, who probably didn't want to be easily recognized by the people he faces at home. Simply put, these people could not convincingly order the pizza on the big screen, even under the best direction. Tell me what you are about Boll, but at least inspire actors like She Grauer to fight his incompetence. This means that the people who were here seem to be aware that their film is angry and that they can also have fun with it. The big part of the original problem was that the director thought he was making some misunderstood masterpiece, and he took himself seriously. Unfortunately, with actors who fail to take their characters or troubles seriously, what little dramatic tension could be undermined there. A large part of the plot deals with the search for a generation-zero victim. whatever causes the dead to rise. Or translate into more practical terms, trying to find someone who was infected just after the virus mutated into a form that threatened people. How it would help when it is usually necessary to create an unmutated strain to create a vaccine, but it is the way this task is stimulated. A plot-to-to-go-back device is used to disable runtime, but the current extra quest timing is also problematic. We are told in one place that the city will be destroyed by Cruise missiles within ten minutes, but the heroes will return to university, search for the sample they are looking for, and play enough zombies to eat the Chinese army. time. Filmmakers take note: it is only true that it is time-specific when it can serve rather than dramatic tension. The special effects used in House of the Dead 2 leave the original in the dust. Where Uwe Boll simulated the characters' deaths using idiotic rotary camera tricks, Michael Hurst uses all the graphic details that the budget allows him instead. The necks are bitten, the arms are cut off, the heads are shot. All this makes a much more persuasive throughput, but it also makes ridicule the obvious fraud. Shooting is also much better. As DVD Crypt wrote it, the fact that it is in focus makes it an improvement on the original, but it also deprives us of something that should laugh at the expense. Writing is also an improvement and failure. Throughout the script, references to other horror and horror survival games, most obvious to be run as hell, are offered. They work the first few times because they offer smart ways to work with titles in everyday dialogue. However, after eighth time, they get nervous because they remind players of things they would rather do with their time. Interestingly, House of the Dead 2 costs just six million to bring TV screens across America. Since Tom Savini in itself will cost more than working on a film today, I must say that I am impressed by the visual results. Unlike what's very spoiled, zombies look more like real zombies than bad makeup that has been badly shot. In further contrast to the original, the actors seem to have no idea what they're doing. The conclusion is that in addition to some real zingers scattered around the world, characters speak like real people. But the story is nothing we have never seen a thousand times before. When the aliens, the true Dawn Of The Dead, or The Evil Dead were released to worship, this greeting came from the fact that these films either did something we hadn't seen before or had done so well that we really didn't mind. House Of The Dead 2 is competent enough not to show it, but it doesn't bring anything new or particularly brilliant to the table, so we don't really care. For this reason and many others, I gave the House of the Dead 2 and two out of ten. It's too good to be bad, but too bad to be good. If you're not in sucky movies just like me, it's best to avoid it.
