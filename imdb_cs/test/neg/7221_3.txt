Spoilery !! I hate this, but it's better than others after this, just getting worse. I hope Gibson is smart to stay away from the next. Much the same with humor, that is, toilet, children, etc. How far we can follow their development. Drugs, Bad Boys, Why South Africa! I found that an incredible, maybe South American, country in the Golden Triangle would make the script better. It seems that in the late 1980s, blonde bad guys, Die Hard, the mighty ducks, played Ice Land Gary Busey in the last weapon, etc. Hollywood repeats itself. The one with a similar story must go over the top. The offensive police, the beach housing scene, and the fight at the end and the way through the top of Gibson's girlfriend killed by the copper attack were too many. Like many parts 2 they deteriorate and 3 or 4 in this series raise the speed downhill. 3/10
