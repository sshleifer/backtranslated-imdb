I saw one of the worst films in the 1990s. I have often used it as a benchmark for watching other films; "At least it wasn't as bad as Caro Diario." Three totally useless segments, all that the director himself plays - and not so interesting. The whole segment of this hypochondriac goes to the doctor. Another one that characterizes his ride on the countryside on a scooter. Three interesting minutes and another fifteen torturous. The only buying factor was that the scooter scene was built at a concert by Kithn Jarrett in Cologne. He asked me to go home and rediscover this amazing album. The best thing you can say about the director / actor / egoist is that he has a great taste in music.
