(Attention: a few spoilers) Once, somewhere, there will be a post-apocalyptic movie that won't smell. Unfortunately, POSTMAN is not the movie, even though I must give him credit for the attempt. Kevin Costner plays someone who is only credited as a "postman". It is not actually a postman, just a rogue with a mule in the wilderness of West America ravaged by some unspecified catastrophe. It trades with isolated villages by performing Shakespeare. Suddenly a group of bandits called Holnists, the self-proclaimed warriors of the West, descend to the village Costner visits, and their evil leader, Gen. Nativity Scene (Will Patton) Designs Costner. After a great deal of suffering and a lot of efforts to break Costner's spirit, he escapes, and so the long part of the film that could be said better in a three-minute flashback ends. Finally, we get to the main movie presumption: The escaped Costner finds an abandoned truck and delivers letters to the nearest town and hopes to get some food for pretending to be a postman. A number of village people led by young Ford (Larenz Tate) want to get into this postal act that does not fit well with Bethlehem and his bandits, and Costner finds himself unwitting and unwilling leader of a group of postmen in the war. with holnists. The idea of ​​The Postmen vs. The Bad Guys is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Holnists depend on their living on the fact that the villages they prey to be isolated from one another; Holnists can destroy any village, but they could not oppose all their associated victims. To unite, villages must communicate with each other, and a working mail system would be a big step towards putting Holnists out of business. So it really makes a lot of sense that Bethlehem would become medieval on our heroic postmans. Unfortunately, Bethlehem's eventual defeat is not the result of villages unifying against him, but instead your old emergency clichés, one battle between him and Costner. Similarly, there is no real attempt by communities to use mail to solve their problems; Everything seems to be the standard "Hello, Aunt Debbie", what's being played for maximum sentimental value. POSTMAN is one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen. Now I'm not deliberately trying to destroy movies for myself by trying to figure out what happens next. But here we are talking about a kind of predictability that requires no effort; I knew what would happen next, no matter what I wanted to know. After the lion is prominently exposed to eating people, Holnist bandit looking for escaped Costner goes to the bushes after the noise, and we are then "shocked" when the lion dreamed him. A bunch of clumsy villagers is rounded and fired by a firing squad, and one of the villagers sings several famous recent words just before they are shot, to my vast lack of surprise. The hidden sculpture is revealed to show exactly what everyone knew would be there: Costner bends to pick up the letter from the cutesy kid we saw earlier in the movie. The man tells Bethlehem not, sir, you can't just take my wife; Bethlehem runs an unsuspecting asshole, though he is the only person in the theater who has no idea. It's a rank cloning sentiment that really denounces POSTMAN. Olivia Williams, playing Costner's lover Abby, is the worst. It pours out the heart and gives it the best effort to make it sound natural and honest. He's trying so hard, it's heart-breaking. But no one has ever made the lines "I have a gift for you, a postman ... You give hope, as it is in sweets in your pocket," sounds like anything except syrups that are. Another example is the scene in which he mounted Costner around a little boy and ignored his handover, just to turn around, staring at him for what seemed like five minutes, and then returning to pick up the letter. Why didn't Costner pick it up for the first time? No real reason; it is only the sophistication that attempts and fails to give us a sense of enthusiasm by rushing to the child's hopes and then restoring them. Schmaltz and predictability will unite at the end when the Postman statue is unveiled. I sat and wondered, "Please don't tell me they're going to show the statue and then go back to the scene with cutesy boy. Of course it's too much saccharin, too obvious for this movie." Then, unfortunately, the music spread and we really cut ourselves into the dreaded little boy who smiled as his letter pulled his girl away, and I held my head in my hands and thought, "Someone shot me." It felt like thirty pounds of apple pie had knocked me down my neck. Gen. Bethlehem is a more humanized villain than usual. Your post-apocalyptic villain in standard is the strictest, toughest S.O.B. in a valley. Bethlehem is shown to be a little of a person inside who is trying to make him feel important by defeating others. Although a threat is sacrificed, Bethlehem is trusted in the way most villains are not. Unfortunately, Will Patton overcomes. And although we were soon told that Bethlehem completely destroyed his last opponent in five seconds of hand-to-hand fighting, Bethlehem's actual combat skills shown at the end of the film are totally ridiculous. otherwise it is pretty good. Costner did better, but his Razzie was an overreaction. As mentioned, Olivia Williams is very impressive. Larenz Tate as Ford does a sincere and credible job. James Newton Howard's score is competent, though short of epic standards the film went for. But that is not enough to save this movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: * 1/2 of ****.
