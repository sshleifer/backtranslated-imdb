The production company for this film is called Nott Entertainment and this is a surprisingly apt name. This is very "Nott" fun from start to finish, which is a shame because a mixture of zombie film and western could be interesting. Every time a low budget zombie movie is released, it will tend to be "for fans of the fans". I actually consider myself a fan of zombie movies, but too much more like this, and I re-evaluate my opinion! It seems the film is shabby half of a decent Aussie zombie flick 'Undead', expecting instead to have a cowboy hat in front; everyone is wearing; but it doesn't make much sense because the film is probably set in modern times. Credits at the beginning of the movie will fool us into believing that we will be in the atmosphere of atmospheric film, but when the movie starts correctly; it soon becomes obvious what we are actually for for. Of course, there is a lot of gore there and it's actually quite well done, though the good things I have to say about the movie are pretty much over there. There is a twist in the half that could be interesting if the rest of the movie was. Overall, it's just another zombie movie in the world with too many zombie movies. I do not recommend it.
