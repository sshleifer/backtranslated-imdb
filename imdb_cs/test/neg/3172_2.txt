Stephen Gyllenhaal (director) in an attempt to make a somewhat comedic but serious film about the art of marijuana cultivation fell a few bong rips short of a good movie. While the cast is nothing less than amazing, this movie is extremely difficult to sit on. The behavior of Billy Bob Thornton, Ryan Phillipe, Jon Bon Jovi, Hank Azaria and Kelly Lynch could not save the film from failure. It would be wiser to flush three separate dollar bills to the toilet and check this movie in a local video store. <br /> <br />
