This is perhaps the worst and coolest movie I've ever seen. I spent four years at two universities and I knew there must be a good movie about this experience. That's not it. "Acting" is a terrible god, and there is no storyline. <br /> <br /> Here are some incidents from my college year. 1) A wonderful boy who unknowingly performed a transvestite. 2) Best friend of pairing two girls - one with huge breasts and one with nickname "brick". 3) A pair that is too loud. 4) The Boy Who Gets All the Girls 5) A guy from Northern Ireland who is very hard to understand. 6) McDonalds in bed 7) Curry every night for 8 weeks) Students attacked, a few of my friends ended up in the hospital 9) Discarded joint that lit the fire. 10) Flood 11) A boy who wakes up to the floor to find out that every piece of furniture is removed from his room. And if I can come up with this list in 5 minutes and from Real Life, I'm sure a few screenwriters can do better, much better. And for a movie named after the Sleeper song, where is the Britpop soundtrack?
