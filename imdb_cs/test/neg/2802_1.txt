I was in Blockbuster and I saw a movie called "Dark Harvest". The envelope looked great, the conspiracy wasn't so bad, and the slogan (You reaped what you sowed) made the movie looking pretty good. But that day I was stupid because I did something I never had to do. I rented "Straight To Video Independent Horror Film" I came out with my much better rent, I went home, Dark Harvest appeared in the DVD player and started it. I thought I'd watch the trailer after the movie was finished (BAD IDEA), but I was watching it anyway. Now for review. * POSSIBLE SPOILERS * First, acting "kids" sucks, and the scene when 2 (main characters) speaks, lighting sucks, and buildings even look fake! Now they go to this house where Sean Connel is (I think it's the main character, I don't care). All of a sudden they all start killing ... (gasp) KILLER SCARECROW !!!! AHHH !!!!! The Scarecrow is obviously a definition of a low budget and a scene where the scarecrow is computerized, so fake it is cheerful. Makes dinosaur sounds and everything! And then at the end ... they shoot a scarecrow with a gun (which is red for God and looks like it was bought for a local family dollar) and stops for a while and then ..... (gasping) BLOWS UP !!! !!! Save time, I'm telling you this movie is upset. If you need to pass an hour and a half, look at the wall because looking at the wall is A + fun compared to this disaster. It's pretty funny, though. <br /> <br /> Total score: F If something was lower ** F - ** Before I put it.
