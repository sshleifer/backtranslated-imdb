GOOD MONUMENT MEMORY in the form of Kim Edwards' novel was a very successful bestseller and probably appeared in more reading groups than any other novel during its circulation. What happened when the novel became a film made for television? Maybe it is a sub-average (oops!, Teleplay!) Scenario of John Pielmeier, who consistently gallums together in an uncomfortable fashion for pedestrians, removing all the credibility of the story. Maybe it's cut and pasting the Mick Jackson direction that lacks stimulation and delimitation. Maybe he has an unrecognized source of cinematography or Daniel Licht's "liquid tears" music score. For any of these (or all of these) reasons, this film survives because it makes a good case for educating the public about the abilities of people born with Down syndrome. And for that it deserves attention. Dr. <br /> <br /> David Henry (Dermot Mulroney), a successful orthopedic physician, is married to beautiful Norah (Gretchen Mol) and their lives are changing by their pregnancy. On a stormy winter night in Kentucky, Norah goes to work and Henry rushes to a nearby clinic where David supplies his wife (the doctor is caught in a snowstorm) with the help of his old friend, sister Caroline Gill (Emily Watson). After delivering the perfect boy (Paul) Norah is still at work and (surprisingly ...) brings the unexpected (!) Twin. David and Caroline immediately recognize that a little girl (Phoebe) is a 'mongoloid' (that's before using the term Down's Syndrome) and David, who has a history of nurse loss due to birth defects, decides to send Phoebe asylum for the mentally handicapped: Caroline is, Make delivery and Norah is said that the other twin died at birth. Caroline follows the instructions, sees the conditions of "home" where Phoebe is to be stored, shrinks in horror and decides to keep the child. With the help of a friendly trucker, Caroline changes her lonely existence and mothers Phoebe to find a new life in Pittsburgh. Norah insists on Phoebe's formal funeral - a fact that deeply disturbs David's psyche, and Henry's life continues with only one child, Paul, leaving submerged pains about Phoebe's lack of presence. Presents Norah David with the camera ("the lives of people are like a camera, that's where they live - at the moment of the captured room") and David is obsessed with photography. Norah mourns, drinks and loses David's attention, while David watches Phoebe's existence with Caroline - sends money and letters to Pittsburgh. Paul (Tyler Stentiford, Jamie Spilchuk) is growing up, discovering his mother's infidelity and being angry at his father's lack of communication and understanding and deciding to fulfill his goal of becoming a musician and going to Juilliard where he goes. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Krystal Hope Nausbaum) matured on a very tailored young girl and the way Henry's broken marriage was made, and the healing environment of Phoebe and Paul's lives along with the courage that supported Caroline Gill's desire. world adoption for those born with Down's syndrome is the end of the film. The cast of well-known actors is trying hard, but only Emily Watson is able to revive a trusted character from this shriveled scenario. Jamie Spilchuk testifies to a young actor with a great promise. Dermot Mulroney and Gretchen find it difficult to create empathic figures to supply them. The film is a mess, but the news of accepting children and adults with Down syndrome is important.
