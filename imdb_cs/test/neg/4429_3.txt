I watched part of the first part of this movie and tiny pieces of other parts. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think this film is worth watching. Strange characters and events are interesting and interesting, but there are bad things and some rough things. The magical and mythical side has turned me off and for most Christians this film would not be very suitable or would be worth watching.
