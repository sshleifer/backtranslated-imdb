BLACK EYE (2 outta 5 stars) Unimaginatively-filmed '70s action movie looks like it was made for TV ... just an occasional cuss word and a subplot about lesbianism you tip you that the movie was actually showing up in theaters. Fred Williamson plays the tough guy of a former cop who becomes a tough guy with a private eye. He encounters a few murders and attempted a murder associated with a mysterious stick. There are some fistfights, a Bullit-inspired car chase, a pretty original elevator scene and even a time for Williamson to confront a rich, lesbian lover of his girlfriend (Teresa Graves). There is also a scene with Williamson bullying a poor old man by tearing up some valuable unpaid old photographs in his memorabilia store. Yeah, a way to go, a tough boy ... maybe you can find a cripple who would later defeat? Obviously, this was meant to mean the cash for the "Shaft" success (this and about six thousand more movies), this film doesn't have enough edges or enough originality to impress.
