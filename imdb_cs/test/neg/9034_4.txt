Marked for Death (1990) spends more time on action sequences than focusing on his characters. After his first two impressive endeavors, above the law (1988) and hard to kill (1989), this third image of Steven Seagal gives a clear idea: anyone who is against him should look like a fool; Bad guys are there just to look good. Seagal has consistently built an audience that seemed to be a little bigger than those that follow the kick-to-up-antiquity of Chuck Norris or Jean Claude Van Damme. <br /> <br /> In Death for Death, Seagal throws aside any pretense in style and head full of gas into exploitation. This film contains a lot of graphic violence, gore and nudity, which seem to be unreasonably different than to please viewers who are unable to distinguish between action pictures that tell a story and those that simply pour out on excitement without rhyme or reason. . And he deserves some real blame for this loss of appetite as producer "Marked for Death". Seagal plays John Hatcher, a former DEA agent returning to Chicago where his family is attacked. A Jamaican street gang who attacks his sister's house, and the film proves he's not stupid when Hatcher's niece (Danielle Harris) is shot at crossfire. Hatcher gets angry and decides to contact his old friend Max (Keith David), school gym teacher, and Charles (Tom Wright), a Jamaican cop. Hatcher declares that the war for the main evil guy, a horribly locked Jamaican voodoo priest named Screwface (Basil Wallace), a nickname that seems to mean "outrageous overclocking". And it is almost unbelievable that Seagal chooses different gang members: he crushes one guy's eyeballs, breaks a man's back and breaks numerous hands and limbs. <br /> <Br /> All the logic of this film is thrown out of the window - through the glass, that is. Why aren't Hatcher and friends accused of all the damage to property they cause or the number of bodies that accumulate? And how did they get into the automatic weapons cache from Illinois to Jamaica without being detected? Seagal has Clint Eastwood's stinism that fans once enjoyed him, and despite three different characters he has played in so many films, everyone dresses in oriental black robes and wears a ponytail. One of the problems I have with some of Seagal's movies is that the main characters never seem to be seriously threatened, and because of course it's a star, nobody can put a glove on it except the bad guy. Seagal's heroes are all interchangeable, as are most graphs and action sequences. Regardless of whether it's a camouflage like a ship's cook, a firefighter, or a L.A cop carrying love beads, Seagal is always Seagal, which is what his fans want. In fact, the sameness of these movies is that if I wanted to, I could take an old review, change names and have a reasonably accurate new movie. Not that I ever did ...
