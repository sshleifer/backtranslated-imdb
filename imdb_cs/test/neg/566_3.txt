I loved the first 15 minutes and loved some of the dialogues in the tribunal - which proved to be the best example for the director's technique of acting - but this film ultimately failed. Even though it is perceived purely as a metaphor for oppressive / oppressed dynamics that has been and is prevalent in the relationship between the US government and its "disobedient" citizens, it still lacks strike and credibility and eventually left me looking at the watch, would it be happened. And for the record: despite the uncontrollable rumors that this film has never been banned in the US (I can't comment on rumors of censorship in the UK, but is suspicious). Hollywood refused to give him away after his opening film festival, and I am more than willing to believe that the Nixon government has had any influence on this decision; However, the fact that she has never appeared on American television is merely a reflection of a somewhat cautious and promoted fashion business. In the present, you can have your own copy of the DVD delivered to your door via Amazon within a few days.
