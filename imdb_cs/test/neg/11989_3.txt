I am deeply concerned about some of the posts I read on the bulletin board for this movie, people say it's a good movie! Just because this movie is the best Uwe Boll is to date it's not a good movie at all, no way in hell! Far Cry is a cliché of disorder full of bad acting, wrong direction, and an uninspired story with an awkward scenario. This is Boll's first clean action movie and new people, action movies aren't too hard to do, because the basic action moves you need are explosives and combat weapons scattered after a fragile plot and hey, Mr. Boll will succeed that makes. The House of the Dead, alone in the dark, and Bloodrayne, all the horror games adapted to the Boll movies are far worse than this (they have no redeeming qualities). Far Cry boasts two things that make it the best: two good leads and a few well-executed action sequences. Til Schweiger is quite good as Jack Carver and Emmanuelle Vaugier is a strong female lead. Usually great Udo Kier is passable, because cliché villain and support cast are damn bad. Towards the end of the movie is a surprisingly tense chase sequence that came as a shock to consider Boll was behind the camera. Unfortunately, the rest of the film has an incredibly cheap feel to it, with bad CGI, lame one-liners and clichés around every corner. And the worst leads to the sex scene. Not only did the two know each other for only six hours, it was enough to say that he had been warm in the army when he was lying to his soldiers. He'd already got her to take off her clothes just to tell her. Then he took it and climbed to bed because he was afraid of hypothermia. Anyway, summarize, this is a bad movie. It's a mindless action movie that can kill 80 minutes if you're completely bored. It might seem worse than finding it and watching it, but I would personally say watch a classic action movie like Die Hard or Predator and stay away from this derivative. <br /> <br />
