Christophe Lambert once said that he still makes movies just to make good and easy money. When I see his latest version, I can believe that. Beowulf is, in all, in the "good" part of crap movies: there are some good exciting scenes, really. The actors themselves are not too bad. But the plot is stupid, the music "Mortal Kombat" has nothing in common, the end is really with **** y ... they could laugh at how uninteresting it was. I even wish I could make money for something else. <br /> <br />
