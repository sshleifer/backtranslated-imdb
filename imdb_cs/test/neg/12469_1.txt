Basic Story Structure: Start, Medium, End. Sometimes it is played with this structure and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story plays back. Sometimes it just isn't linear, la Pulp Fiction. Regardless, they all have a beginning, a middle and an end. This is the first movie I've ever seen and has no end. <br /> <br /> Top: Best Girlfriend <br /> <br /> Middle: A girl has to cope without a best friend. <br /> <br /> End: No. Not that the end saved this movie, but at least it would be complete. It's an apathy exercise; we get party-mix characters, and everyone turns out to be duds. Boring, vain, vapid and plastic imitations of people. And here's the action in this movie: NIC HAPPENS. Nothing will happen. Mischa Barton tries to talk to the plummy English accent, Dominique Swain does a great deal and Brad Renfro gets a blow from some old guy. End of film. By the time the credits were rolling, I had a terrible feeling that many prisoners had to feel: the times, the precious minutes of our lives, had just been wasted. The only waypoint (and that's very emphatic) is Brad Renfro. She behaves well. Lacey Chabert I have a slope I like but no luck here. Because of the good work in other films, I forgive Misch Barton for this cheerfulness, but I hope all members have been hit in the face for their commitment. Please, please, please. Avoid. Don't be deceived when you think I think. My sister told me to never see it, and I ignored her, I wanted to create my own mind. That was a bad decision. I've never hated the movie. There are many things I don't like, but I've never hated the movie. Until I saw it.
