This show is pathetic. I can't even imagine someone with an IQ larger than a pea soup pot that expired after its expiration date could be willing to sit over that waste for half an hour. It's one of those rare shows that is so awful in every respect that you can honestly say you're less intelligent than watching it. I did a study and found that the average person loses 10 IQ points for every fifteen seconds they watch this show. This is second place to the next Comedy Network abortion, Popcultured (19,863,221 IQ points per second lost) and largely tie with Girls Will Be Girls. He owes each of us the keys to a VIP apology. Whenever I look at this show's merriment, I feel sad for society. How is it allowed to continue?
