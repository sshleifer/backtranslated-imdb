I love Das Boot. I was hoping for something like that - a realistic war film that depicts soliders and civilians on both sides as real people, with joy and pain in battle. Unfortunately, Stalingrad seems to be written by a third grader and driven by a fifth grade student. The main pieces of the movie just seem missing, leaving it completely incoherent. The dialogue in translation is ridiculous, but it does not seem to be better in the native language; you just have to watch the actors' faces during the bad moments of dialogue to realize how bad this movie is.
