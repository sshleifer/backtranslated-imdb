This is one movie that presents everything that is bad in movie business. The actors are pathetic and the script is terrible. Special effects, if any, are so poorly made that it would be better to do it with a cartoon instead. Besides, it's great! I think the filmmakers had the humor, but the only time I laughed was when I saw Patrick S. with long hair and colorful costumes everybody had. The scenes at the end were good, but they weren't part of the movie. Finally, you ask yourself, "Why did I waste my time and money with the bullshit when I watched the plants grow or move clouds". I don't think I'm a critic or anything, but this is a really lame movie! DO NOT LOOK! DANGER OF STUPIDITY ACCEPTANCE!
