Opie, Tom Gilson, he was my brother, so I went to the movie and never looked at him all these years. Excuse me! it was bad. I was told I had to write 10 lines, so I'll give a little bit of detail. Tom and Tuesday Weld were supposed to be "introduced" in this picture and Tom was told to go to the premiere, but Tom said he didn't go with Joan Collins, and he did and because he did only Weld was introduced. I found it very funny and I still do it. The film, while the concept was funny, and the actors in it were impressive, but some as it just didn't get funny. Continuity was abstract, at best it was like watching 2 different movies at once. time, everyone runs into the other. Sorry, Bob Gilson
