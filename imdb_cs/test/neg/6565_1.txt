I am aware that there are some fans who might like this movie. I am aware that the idea of ​​"seeking God" may seem interesting to someone, but it is really boring. The movie is just boring. If it's a little interesting, it's stupid. Come ... Kirk fights God and wins? How low can we get? The only good part of the movie is camping in the first 5 minutes, which is really great, but then the film becomes boring, irritating, with nothing but good music. Thank you God we have Star Trek VI. (Oops, Kirk beat him).
