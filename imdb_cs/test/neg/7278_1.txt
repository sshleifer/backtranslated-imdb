Tagline: The happy ones died ... before they watched. I've never seen a Bulgarian film from the 1920s, so I can't say it's the worst movie ever made, but it's definitely the worst movie I've ever watched. I can't almost remember it. The only thing I can remember is a family of stupid people who don't do anything. Their car has one wheel of four stranded in the sand, so they decide that there is nothing to do and prepare for life there. Then there is an old man who is aware that there is a group of cannibals in his place of residence, but he has never considered the idea of ​​reporting this to the police. And when we talk about the police ... if these madmen lived there for many years, many people had to disappear ... how come the sheriff has no idea? But after the first five minutes I gave up the questions or something. The rest is boring. Hallucinations, incredible holes. I'll be merciful and not talk about dialogue. And acting. And the effects. I will only mention the last scene where a little girl removes a snake (snakes! Finally, what the hell they have with the story?) with a sharp stone throw that demonstrates full disdain for Mr. Craven for reality and for things that happen on planet Earth in general. <br /> <br /> I think there was a riot in the movie. The first edition was released in 1977. Even cannibal eating would not be a fair punishment for the director for this attack on intelligence.
