I bought a DVD from a big $ 4.99 basket and I thought I was lucky in some documentary pearl that would actually show the vast footage of the Karakoram Mountains and especially K2. Moving fast in the movie I reached the top scene in which climbers catch their first glance ---- Mount Waddington, towering at all 13,260 ft, in the Canadian Coastal Range. At least one of the few bozos that climb K2 has no clear idea of ​​what the real mountain looks like - it must be reassured by its friend and climbing partner that this partner would not bring him to the ugly mountain. Since one of the movie spaces is that 27 or so people have lost their lives on K2, you might think that the jerk that was involved could take a minute or two to take a few basic facts, but The clown thinks so. that preparations on this scale, even though they are good enough to please Reinhold Messner, are under him. To be honest, I didn't see the whole thing. What I saw makes me cringe. They say you get what you pay for. For $ 4.99 I was ripped off.
