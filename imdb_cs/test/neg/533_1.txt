As a science-fiction and occasional Angelina Jolie fan, I thought this apparently low-budget movie was worth a look ... maybe he had a couple of scenes or stories to replace all his other mistakes. In addition, it might be interesting to watch Angelina go on her stellar career. Oh, how bad I was. One thing I learned - at 18, Angelina Jolie couldn't act. So, to make her comfortable, producers cast this whole film with people who couldn't act. When Jack Palance (who can actually act), he decided to overlook. Watching 10 minutes of this squeeze is enough to burn your eyes. <br /> <br /> Add horrible scenario, insipid dialogue, cinematography at the bottom of the barrel to terrible acting and overclocking ... in fact, add everything at the bottom of the header. The story presents Angelina as a cyborg programmed by her corporate rulers as a killer. With the help of his combat instructor escapes from the corporate headquarters. The corporation sends them a bounty hunter. Stupid things happen. End. I'd tell you more, but I didn't want to waste my life looking at this. <br /> <br /> I beg you - it's not worth it. Its not even worth thinking about watching. Save your pain and keep going.
