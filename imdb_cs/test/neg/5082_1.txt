I sincerely wonder that this film is getting quite good reviews. I will be absolutely honest and say that the only reason I went through that is just Ryan Phillippe, and not for reasons that are particularly connected with his actor abilities, though I think he has worked well in recent years. A better actor than his first major role in the late 1990s is mentioned. <br /> <br /> When it comes to action / tension movies going, this movie will fail in almost every respect. I think playing is fine, but the script is absolutely horrible, and it makes little sense, which filmmakers try to hide by adding absurd references to Chaos theory, as if they convinced someone that the film is actually clever "- but then again, judging by others reviews, some were. Don't be fooled: the script is boring, derived disorder, and no other element of the film fills it. Wesley Snipes has probably never had a less interesting role in the film and Statham is a thoroughly boring actor. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
