Close but no cigar! - This is my opinion on this movie! TAG PURVIS wrote and directed this script, which was to go through the reps before filming. Occasionally, ridiculously, because it's an insidious scenario, Dan Mongomery Jr and the director of photography are the shining star of this film. Both of these talents are careful in the future. My recommendation is to wait for your local cable station to hit the classics and use the rental money!
