It is fascinating how the average viewer managed to slip this title as something new and revolutionary (quoting some comments). Murali K. Thalluri had to think for himself: "Oh, great! Elephant ... What a fantastic movie! I'm trying to do exactly the same movie and see if anyone notices it!" his nasty idea. The film turns out to be unsuccessful. Considering that he is trying to catch the brilliance of Gus Van Sants "Elephant", it looks even more ridiculous - the most embarrassing faux pas for the film director. The film begins with a student suicide in a bathroom school. This scene already shows the incredible acting skills of each of them involved in this scene. You are not buying a single word that they say. In continuing, interrupted by short interviews in the style of interviews with children who "live from their marriage lives," each bit is somewhat anxious in its simple stupidity based on every worthless monologue. Thalluri means to introduce the characters in this way to look into their hearts as quickly as they could see their hearts ... and fail again. Not five minutes later, Thalluri finally screams to the audience "Yes, people! I stole this movie and for some special reason I'm proud of it!" taking Gus Van Sants the most unmistakable story style from "Elephant": He shot scenes twice to let the viewer follow each character involved in the scene on his particular way and role in the school situation. Um, doesn't it look very familiar? For me, this certain level of very tolerant tolerance was violated where I couldn't stand this horrible film. Shame, Murali K. Thalluri, I say! I am particularly surprised that "2:37" has made the official selections in Cannes since 2006, while everyone has remembered a few years ago "Elephant" (2003) at the same film festival! So, how did the most shameful rip-off appear in the Lord's name? This mistake seems to be completely confused. Directors like Thalluri use the ignorance of the audience who (and can't be fully aware of) every independent movie out there. As Elephant has little to do with mainstream cinema (though it is undoubtedly a masterpiece), few people notice that the story, as told in "2:37", has been said before! As it is at the film festival as important as Cannes, I cannot say. It is sad and shameful that such things are being passed on and no one can see a real scam in them. 2:37 is in all respects exclusively commercial, worthless as an independent film and (at a certain level) rather a false parody of his overt idol, "elephant".
