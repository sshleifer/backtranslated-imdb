This film is notable only in its banality and the use of clich√©s. Sadly, it was obvious to the end. But don't be wrong if we think it ended up strongly. Just a little unexpected, though nothing worth watching the thing for. From the silent and broken hero to the Germanic baddy to the expendable team, the characters were completely wooden and obvious. Two FBI agents Smith and Wesson (geddit?) Gave some hope for humor, but that didn't mean anything. I'm a big sci-fi fan, but it's hard to find any redeemable quality in this movie. . Turkey! <br /> <br />
