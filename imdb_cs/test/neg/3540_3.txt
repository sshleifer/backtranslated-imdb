I was really disappointed with this film, which I had great hopes for. It appears to have been rushed out to take advantage of the screwball success by comedy at the time (including MGM's own "Libeled Lady", which featured two of the same stars) and the success of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Three years into their mating, they were still appealing to watch and filled with fire in their scenes together, but the weak script and rushed premise destroys any chance that it is a great sequel to the previous year "Libeled Lady" and two "Thin Man" movies, "Double Wedding" tells the story of a clothing store maker Myrna Loy, who intends to control the life of her sister (Florence Rice), future brother-in-law (John Beale) and her servants (including Sidney), Toler and Mary Gordon. Independent lively William Powell enters into his life, scattering Rice and Beal from Loy's constant control, Loy completes his match, sounds so good, right, yeah, an interesting premise is short, sad to say, because Loy's character is so dimensional that it's hard, just like she, to fall in love with Powell, which we know will soon be. On, who has a career in mind, has changed her views on her life, what Hollywood has often done during her golden age. When Loy says he has no time to run his business, he has in his life a man, his creator. Fortunately, besides Powell, wild Jessie Ralph is aboard. A salty rich elderly woman who has helped Loy start her business, has a familiarity with Powell, and immediately sees through Loy's cold claims that he hates him. Rice and Beal are a boring couple, and Powell's premise between them is meaningless. Then the ex-wife of Powell's show, which is really unnecessary at this late point in the story, will appear, and the final wedding scene (where a crowd of people tries to get into a small Powell trailer) is a weak attempt to bring a farce. (It's funny that Powell still keeps the hit items that Loy hit to hit Edgar Kennedy; those laughs are very welcome because there are so few.) Powell and Loy would do better in two later comedies, "I Love You Again "and" Love Crazy ", which are sophisticated, funny and fun, this film tries to be all three but ends in a sophisticated bore.
