I appreciate the directors' efforts for the story of Moses and the departure of Israel, and that the film helps viewers enter Moses' shoes and gain an understanding of the intense burden placed on Moses' shoulders. As excited as I saw this movie, I was very disappointed in the script. (Out of videography, special effects, and artistic skills in this review.) What is most disappointing is the historical inaccuracy of this film and how far it is from historical biblical accounts. One of the main principles of the Bible is that * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Not only did he give this promise, but he led his people in the pillar of the cloud by day, and the pillar of fire at night . He never left them; The Israelis were always visible. But the film depicts God who is silent throughout the desert. This film has changed the essence and theme of the biblical text and instead describes God as a silent, cruel, disciplinary release. Besides, the depiction of Moses was just as bad. Moses was known as a man of faith (why else he would be such a father built by Israel throughout the Old and New Testaments, even though Moses is known as a man of great faith). However, the film depicts him as a pragmatic, angry, insecure loner who despises the vocation that God has placed on his life. OK, I will allow creators the freedom of creative freedom in the Exodus story ... but that's beyond creativity - it's heresy.
