In "Red Letters", Coyote is at the faith as a college professor who writes to a female prison prisoner and gets more than he negotiated for. There are two reasons to watch this movie ... Kinski is one and Piven the other, though it is difficult for their sparks to shine in such a complete overhead catastrophe. Everything is wrong with "Red Letters" ... an intricate, miserable script, camera, editing and, above all, acting that is subordinate to Coyote, etc. Battersby has taken a story with potential and turned it into a seriously wrong and amateur film is not worth the time.
