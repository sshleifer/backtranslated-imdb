Disney Studios' remake of their own 1965 classic slapstick touches the clever lead F.B.I. agent kidnapped woman. Christina Ricci acts as a cat owner who boasts of actress performance, and feeds Doug E. Doug, embarrassingly over him, like a human caricature. A pair of rich neurotics (Dyan Cannon and the original "Cat" cast member of Dean Jones) are funny and formula-fence still has a little juice in it, but the manipulation is so heavy and lugubrious, and the cat is so lifeless that it's strictly DOA < br /> <br /> * from ****
