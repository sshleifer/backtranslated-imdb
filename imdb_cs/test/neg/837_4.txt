The film starts with a dandy shootout, where three bandits are quickly shot by a hunter-hunter who carries more than just superficial to a man with no name from the Clint Eastwood trilogy (FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE AND GOOD BAD AND UGLY). Immediately after this you will see this man in a gold train filled with Union soldiers. Of course, the shipment is attacked and the soldiers fight as blind so they are quickly neutralized. However, in a twist, one of the bandits cheats the gang leader (Gilbert Roland) and drives off with gold. Soon Roland gets caught up and is about to find out where the gold is hidden. But just then, the army rises and kills the traitor. But a husband with no name thinks Roland knows about the treasure, and the key is perhaps the medallion that Roland gave traitors. The strange banker is also thrown into the mix. All three want gold and all three seem pretty macho. Overall, it's not a very different Western. Much of it is a conspiracy, some of it is that George Hilton (Uruguayan through the American sounding name) is not as interesting as Eastwood or some other leading western spaghetti but most of it is because the soundtrack simply sucks. So often music does not come close to acting and seems to be almost randomly added. Plus, it's just not very good. This is clearly not the work of Ennio Morricone - the music master of the Spaghetti genre.
