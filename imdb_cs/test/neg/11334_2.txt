!!! Spoiler alert !!! But the point is, I didn't think this movie was over to get spoiled ... I just started watching him in the middle, after Matt got into Sarah's body, but then I he was fascinated by the bizarre of this plot, even for the movie Channel 5 ... and I couldn't see how Matt ended up happy. What about his fianc√©e? At one stage, it looked as though he had gotten with his best friend, certainly icky and wrong ... and then the whole thing "oggi oggi oggi" NOT USED as a moving friend, acting like a friend, is just ridiculous ... so was to go surely he can't just go back to life? and how can she live like a woman? and then the movie just ended by quitting and not explaining anything !!!!! What is it? I was so cross, I wasted an hour of life without reason !!! :) but it was one of the most fun movies I've ever seen, so swings and roundabouts
