Okay, sure, this movie will never win oskara. Civil cane is not this movie ... But why must every film be explored? when was the last time you saw a movie that was fun because it was good but because it was goofy? does anyone remember Roger Corman, the king of exploitation? Well, I was having fun. I like cheese. Just go in not waiting to think and prepare to throw popcorn on the screen.
