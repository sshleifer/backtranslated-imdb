Slayer is a mindless vampire film with a few twists on an ancient plot. A special team of ops is sent to South America to seek blood suckers. Their leader is a real old man who has grown well. There are ecological twist as vampires attack villages because their rainforest and old wildlife diet disappear due to greedy corporations and farmers. Loss of fighting and so much blood never bothered to wash the film. Looks like they were sleeping in bloody clothes and clogging blood. While every cast member has brought his own talent, it doesn't really all click like a movie. The effects were fine except for the vampires hanging from the buildings on the wires. If you're looking for a lot of blood and violence, it's for you.
