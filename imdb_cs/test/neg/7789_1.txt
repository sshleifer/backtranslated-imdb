That was just the second version of Charles Dickens' classic story I saw, and unfortunately it turned out to be one of the worst. The film begins with a quick live action song, where Simon Callow as Charles Dickens begins the Christmas Carol story, and of course goes into the animated story itself. You probably already know it, Ebenezer Scrooge is an annoying cold-blooded businessman who refuses charity and hates Christmas. He is visited by Jacob Marley (Nicolas Cage) who warns him of visits to other three ghosts of Christmas past (Jane Horrocks), a gift (Sir Michael Gambon) and a silent future / still to come. Of course, after all, he is aware of the true magic of Christmas and promises to be nicer in the future. The only changes I noticed in the story were Scrooge with mice as friends (a stupid thought), Scrooge's ex-love Belle (Kate Winslet), who needed to see him to help the orphanage, Ghost of Christmas Present, and showed both children. I want "and" ignorance ", Scrooge keeps chasing after turning nicely, and he is afraid he can't keep his promise to stay nice. Also play Rhys Ifans like Bob Cratchit, Juliet Stevenson as Mrs. Cratchit, Iain Jones as Scrooge nephew Fred and Colin McFarlane as Fezziwig The animation is not very good, the actors are wasting their voices for a worthless piece of waste, the only good thing that comes from this movie is the good voice of Kate Winslet, singing the final song "What if", just like the others, it's just very bad!
