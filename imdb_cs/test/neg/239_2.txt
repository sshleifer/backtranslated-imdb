Oh, man, they certainly knew how to go back. Hollywood has forgotten the basic ingredients of bad movie making: cardboard steel and god scared scientist action hero! <br /> <br /> This film was so close to the masterpiece, unfortunately it wasn't, because it was not possible to imagine beam weapons and invaders from the moon. The MST3K version tried to fix it by adding a pilot show called Captain Cody, where a man with a rocket-powered jacket fights against the bad make-up of the Moon, but that couldn't be summed up. Also the comments of the guys in the theater were not as fun as I expected. All in all, great disappointment.
