Frank Tashlin's "censored" is such a private short film that aims to teach Censor to prevent the escape of military secrets. Snafu is trying to get to his girlfriend to be located in the South Pacific, but Censor foil every attempt to send a letter. These early scenes are best, with the invisible Censor jerking the letter from the sky with long mechanical shoulders, nets and even a specially employed eagle! The other half of the cartoon, in which Snafu manages to send a letter with the help of Technical Fairy, the first class (who actually teaches him a lesson), is less entertaining and culminated with an unsatisfactory finale of only dreams. The main point of interest in this part of the cartoon is the appearance of the very incredibly crafted friend of Snafu, who is even seen with her bare breasts, though with strategically placed limbs all the time! Army-focused Snafu shorts were often characterized by increased vigilance, but these scenes, crowded as they may be, are by far the most erotic I have encountered in any of these shorts. Despite all this, I prefer Snafu shorts, which go a little more at jugular, usually the result of the death of the main character. For great examples of this, looking for Tashlin's 'Goldbrick' or Chuck Jones's 'Spies'. "Censored" is relatively weak compared to that.
