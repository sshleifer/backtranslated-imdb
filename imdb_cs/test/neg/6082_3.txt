The film was terrible. A manufacturing company should be obliged to pay a fine for wasting electricity that carries this nonsense. There were too many holes on the plot. Why would DOJ send a murderer to murder the world leader? If they weren't DOJs, why would they send someone they thought they wouldn't do? Quoting Butch Cassidy: "Who are these guys?" Apparently the director doesn't even know because he never told us. The characters were incredible. They have not done in any way they think fit. Except for the physician, none of the characters were particularly convincing or likeable. <br /> <br /> Feel free to waste your money on watching this movie. Otherwise, run in the opposite direction.
