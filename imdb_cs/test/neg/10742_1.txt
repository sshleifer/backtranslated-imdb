--------- SPOILER ALERT ---------------------------- <br /> <br /> This was the worst from the series, it is horror disguised as a political satire and is as gentle as a hammer, not too frightening and not too bright. Did Michael Moore have anything to do with this piece of Garbage? I'm really sick of Hollywood who uses entertainment as a political campaign against George Bush and keeps repeating the same talking points over and over again. This movie wants to be DeathDream, but unlike the movie that gently annoys the problems of soldiers who have returned from Vietnam in a clever way when the main character returns as a zombie and longs for blood and slowly builds on this topic: it was a real horror movie The movie was also a good social commentary because it didn't get sanctifying, exploitave, and preaching. I think Joe Dante thought he was trying to make a horror to frighten Republicans, Conservatives and Libertarians and I was the last in this list found this movie to be totally ridiculous, manipulative and exploitave all at the same time and I don't mean a good kind of exploitation that you often find in drive-in movies, I mean exploitation in the most abominable and ugly way: using our soldiers' deaths as a manipulative political statement disguised as a horror movie. This film assumes that all the soldiers who died in Iraq would vote against the conservative president if they returned to life as zombies, which is a false assumption, as I recall for the most part and according to the rules George Romer; Zombies are thoughtless, body creatures, acting on a pure impulse, and although Zombie Andy in DeathDream was able to talk, he couldn't really talk and was driven by his addiction to human blood. Well, zombies are soulless beings driven by impulse and not by reason, and obviously dead, so why would dead people be able to vote first? My interpretation of this film is that the only war a liberal democrat could win is that it would be mindless, dead people vote. Zombies are actually those who make intellectual decisions. Oh yeah. The dawn of the dead resolved this idea much better, but the user imagined the idea of ​​mindless consumerism. This film is not Dawn of the Dead any imagined imagination. The film solves this problem while soldiers are alive, that most of them voted for Bush as president, but after they died they would vote for a liberal anti-war democrat after they are zombies who are normally considered brain dead creatures and ridiculously has them destroyed after they vote. <br /> <br /> if you want to make a zombie movie Mr. Dante and invoke the name of George Romer, you should have mindless zombies who like to tear people and eat their intestines, not zombies that vote. I also like how zombies simply go "bad" conservatives who support war. <br /> <br /> If you want a good movie with social commentary, skip this poorly made, sermon piece of waste and watch DeathDream instead. /> <br /> The worst of the horror series will succeed.
