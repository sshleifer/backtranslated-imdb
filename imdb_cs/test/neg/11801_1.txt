St. The Francisville Experiment says this is no walk in the woods, a direct slap in the face of Blair's witch. Where Blair Witch emerged as a film that revised the viewer's imagination with a simple design, St. The Francisville Experiement overcomes the viewer's patience. It has to be said that it is destined to be a classic camp. The film is a "paranormal consultant" Troy Taylor talked about the movie. If anyone wants to see this movie without knowing what the information is, stop reading here. For those of you who can't resist, read to my friends and everything will be said. Mr. Taylor, the writer of somewhat uninteresting ghost stories he claims to be true, informed viewers of the video that The Francisville Experiment was not documentary. Shock! Amazing! As if we didn't know ... He informed us that all the frightening discoveries created by the participants were organized and prepared by the film's producers. In fact, he informed us that the last 15 minutes were not filmed in Louisiana, but rather in California. All four participants were real actors (note that I didn't say well ...). One of the participants is actually a special effects technique on ER. What makes me angry about this movie is that it declares everything true. He is trying to overcome Blair's witch project by claiming it is true while Blair Witch was a scam. The amazing thing is that no one could trust this movie for a moment. Filled with terrible acting and cheerful lines such as "surround with white light" and "I love spirits", St. The Francisville Experiment belongs to movies everywhere at midnight, so the crowd can twist, boo, jeer and sing properly â€œI love ghosts! "<br /> <br /> Talk about fake advertising. True stories are not filmed with staged special effects that look like the neighborhood scout troops have established a haunted house. From the bugs in the sandwich (ooh ... scary ...) to the grumpy Madison, from the "seance", which is nothing more than four to play aboard the Oujia to bring both mice under the bed. Francisville Experiement is one embarrassing scam of the movie. The Lion Gate would be wise to release this thing to the nearest garbage compactor, or to promote it as it should be: "St. Francisville Experiment: A Comic Look at Not Making a Movie".
