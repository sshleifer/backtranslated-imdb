Hungary can't do any good movies. Reality. This is a great example of this. Especially the term "conspiracy" does not exist in this film. It's really weak. Even so many people would argue with me. Sure, it's about taboo, but that's about it. There are endless possibilities that could be really great if they were used, but they almost skip everything. I think the whole movie is just an excuse to show pictures that are the only decent things in this whole pile of horror. Acting is simply simple. There are not many lines, so you think actors have big facial expressions or imitating abilities, but not. In fact, 86% of the time they suck. And that's when they say nothing. If they say a single word, you start to lean your head and say, "That's damn unrealistic". But again it is partly a typing error. There are also no emotions in most dialogues. <br /> <br /> Editing is sometimes fine, but it is mostly illogical and only makes the picture worse. It could give emotional pressure, but editing here seems to be about how to cut one after another. Somebody please explain to me why critics say this film is a masterpiece. Calling "Art" doesn't do it better. Sorry Mundruczo, but you failed. Live with him. Even you will probably not worry about my or other boys' frightening your "baby".
