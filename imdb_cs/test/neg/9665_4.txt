We chose it as part of the Brentwood set called "Broken Skull". Filmed directly on video, with very different sound quality and lighting, the film ends with hyperactive quality that can inspire the viewer to feel nervous, confused and irritable - and not in a good way "Evil Dead". Br /> <br /> Without going to the spoiler, what seems to be the first seems to be a simple story of revenge that becomes increasingly complex and bizarre. While there are some interesting ideas, the overall effect is likely to leave you scraping your head and saying "hunh?" This is a very, very cruel movie. Gore effects range all the way from the full bloody head of the appliance to the silly Video Toaster effect, which must be frozen-framed to be (dis) believed. The "Fangoria" level of gross effects in this movie is really amazing and should please gore-hounds and at the same time someone on a weak constitution would feel a little on the unpleasant side. The broken skull is also a very noisy movie. It is characterized not only by ambient sounds (captured by mikes and not replaced by mail), but there is also a lot of shouting. No, no, I mean LOT. A lot, a lot! Characters scream, scream, scream, scream, chitter and laugh maniacally. Lower the volume if you value eardrums and nerves! However, you cannot reject the cast for your enthusiasm, they really eat in the backdrop and sometimes it's rather fun. Especially an actress playing a Vietnamese immigrant delivers all the above things with a remarkable amount of gusto. In fact, very few actors were wooden. Some of them may have somewhat overworked (oh, just a little smidgen!), But most of them are definitely fun when you're looking to go away. The cast is ethnically diverse and the way it is for filmmakers. However, two middle-aged white women are two of the most modest, irritated characters since the trader in the MST3k classic "Brute Man". Just watch all the other characters, it's fun! <br /> <br /> When closing, the Headcrusher does not have to become a horror icon on the same level as Jason Voorhees, Michael Myers or Freddy Kruger (or even Leprechaun), but we can definitely say it was a movie.
