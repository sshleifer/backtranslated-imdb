There's only one thing I'm going to say about a cat in a hat ... like a KIDS movie and a good comedy movie that sucks ... I've lost track of how many horrible jokes in a movie he not only sucked but not. t exactly baby fit. And by the way, the way the cat spoke in the hat was unpleasant ... in terms of the plot I had completely forgotten. Who cares, anyway. I'm not sure why Mike Myers joined in, but I think the writers were trying to make it sound like Austin without talking a swinger and it was too successful - but that was uncomfortable. I don't see it - belongs to the bottom 100 .............................. jokes are so harsh, it's funny
