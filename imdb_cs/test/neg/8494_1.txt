What the hell is that about? Well, if I didn't know the "son of the mask" is classified as a comedy, I'd never know! Comedy? Tragedy is the right genre for this yet another - the so-called sequel. Yes, I was watching "Dumb and Dumber", but I never believed that anyone would ever make a title in Hollywood. . Yes, you're looking at "Son of Mask" and you think .. 5 minutes - Dumb ... 10 minutes - Dumber ... 15 - minutes Dumbest ... And then, after 16 minutes there is only one thing: / I'm out. .. <br /> <br /> Sorry, my Comedy Crap 2005 candidate.
