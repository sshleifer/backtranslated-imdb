Acting is embarrassing and fearsome, and not in a good way ... at all. Writing, dialogue and chemistry among actors are terrible. Nothing makes sense and every detail of an actor's reaction or reaction takes 3 or 4 seconds too long, so it looks like a Mexican soap opera (telenovela). Everything about writing is unrealistic and all actors involved make it much worse with their interpretation of the script. Am I the only one who sees it ??? To use the word cheese to describe this Canadian catastrophe would be an underestimation of the century. Did the director even look at the final cut before being put into the air ???
