This is a very interesting acquaintance! "Two fisted stories" contains three stupid and childish episodes - the genre is not actually a horror or action, but rather something in between. Where is the suspicion? Where is the fun? Where is common sense? Definitely not here, but if you don't expect to get it, you don't have to miss it. <br /> <br /> The first segment is called "Showdown". It's a violent, absurd west. I didn't understand the whole idea. "Road King" is a stupid story starring Brad Pitt. At the time of "two-finger stories" there was only a pretty face that still didn't know how to behave. Fortunately, he learned the skill later and now he is a fantastic, talented actor - one of the greatest young generations. The story is almost all right in all his stupidity. The final episode "Yellow" is the only segment that is almost entirely successful. It's stupid, but funny. We have to thank Kirk Douglas for that. <br /> <br /> This movie is something you can watch while sitting in a chair and eating popcorn. (I should know this is what I did.) If you loved "Stories from the Crypt", you'll love "stories with two fists" because it's basically the same. I understand that these three episodes are actually a very rare "work of art" and very difficult to find anywhere. I have the entire VHS package, but I don't think it's a great privilege. You'll have to be a fanatical fan of Brad Pitt looking for him. Otherwise, don't bother, it's not worth the effort. Stupid stupid.
