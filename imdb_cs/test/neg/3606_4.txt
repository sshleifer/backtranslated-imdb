EMPEROR's journalist returns for Disney Pictures, but this time he focuses on The Chronicle (expressed by Patrick Warburton), who is no longer a Yzma supporter (Eartha Kitt). Kronk started a new life and is very pleased with his role as chef of his own restaurant. Things go cheerfully until Kronk gets the word that his papi (John Mahoney) is coming to visit. Chronicle is afraid because he knows that his life on his papi won't impress. One thing he always wanted and never got is his father's "thumb up". The sharp noise and huge explosion of cheese in the restaurant leaves our sympathetic hero deep in trouble and anxiety. To save the day, a little help from his friends. More voices: Tracey Ullman, David Spade, John Goodman, Wendie Malick, April Winchell and Gatlin Green.
