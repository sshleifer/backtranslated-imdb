A stupid and violent thriller that is rip-off 'Deliverance' but without any magic and intelligence. The storyline is ridiculous and the cast seems tired and anxious to get rid of this unpleasant entry. This film is a solid example of a bad conspiracy and a very, very bad idea. It is a pity to see good actors like Thomerson and James who live in such a mess.
