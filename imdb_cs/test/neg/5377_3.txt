I'm pretty crazy for those ghost hunter shows. From Cheesy mockumentaries to Discovery Channel, "Haunting" to Scooby Doo Reality shows as "Ghost Hunters". When I saw the promos for "Paranormal State" A & E, I knew I'd watch. Especially when "Paranormal State" was built against a weak Monday night football. By the end of the pilot "Paranormal State", where the main "character" in this reality macaroon gives Creepy Kid a Bottle of Max Von Sydow Holy Waters and reassures him by telling this boy that he also had an unspecified bad experience as a child with things that "came out of the closet" and the (catholic) church gave him holy water to repel things coming from the closet I knew I should shoot another shot on Monday Night Football. Shtick for "Paranormal State" is a group of Penn State students who all gathered and started their own. Ghost Hunters Club. Or Company. Or Super Adventure Club. And they're running around Pennsylvania, where they're exploring the most horrible, creepy and lost plot of M. Night Shymalan. <br /> <br /> "They" is a kind of misnomer. Indeed Paranormal State revolves around the Nittany Lion named Ryan Buell who would probably run the Penn State's annual Anime Convention if it was not for this show. He is often accompanied by "investigations" by hot co-eds and some other people have seen in credits but rarely caught on camera. Hey, are they ghosts, too? This is Ryan Buell's show. Paranormal State is his "vehicle" as we want to say in Biz. And what is a dull ride in a vehicle that can be. I mentioned Ryan, who tells the whole episode of Paranormal State in the "director's logo" without the star's voice? Almost immediately it is annoying because the obvious intention is to give Ryan a spirit to hunt some gravity, but his filtered monoton does nothing but provoke and laugh. Seriously, every serious intonation sounds like a radio interview from the Call of Duty video game. "Investigation" - a plot that every episode turns around - is interesting on the surface. No Spooky Inns or Restaurants are located in "Paranormal State". This is a show of fear of the unknown, like a good Catholic boy, and a God who gives you fear. Little children are being persecuted, things appear in the dark, voices encourage life to kill, and Aleister Crowely rubs his hands in me. Of the two episodes I watched, everyone turned around the violent, ugly ghosts that were tied to violent, ugly deaths. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Maybe not. Everything in "Paranormal State" is shortsighted within half an hour, "Dog the Bounty - er, Ghost Hunter" blocks. Every time there is an interesting, verifiable proof of evidence - the murder of a family on a farm in the 1800s - evidence is waved in front of the viewer as an artist trying to convince you of a pile of papers that are currently under your nose is proof that ten million comes from nigeria and then yanked off before you get a good gander. <br /> <br /> At least with the "Ghost Hunters" Sci-Fi Channel, it's a little too exhausting to rip all the evidence and pass it on to the viewer. EVPs who could be rat prophets, cold spots in drafts and "plowing" that Ghost Hunters themselves have discounted as dust. This is a kind of Scooby Doo approach that makes "Ghost Hunters" ... almost believable. While "Paranormal State" claims to have an EVP, it gives the viewer ten seconds of video from a wave file in the Garage Band without sound. Yeah, you see, EVP, right? People claim to see dark figures in the basement ... Well, let's go and see you ... while leaving the night vision on a fascinating stationary living room picture. Ryan, the intrepid leader of this Penn State Graduates package, claims to see the "vision" of the demon name he knows, and that it could be involved in a paranormal haunted ... because ... He can't. You never say the name of a demon out loud, Ryan informs the wide-eyed Co-Ed who dares to ask. Well, how very convenient it is for you. Especially because it's a TV show where viewers can't read your mind. <br /> <br /> "Paranormal State" is all Turn and No Prestige. Viewers learn what is supposed to happen, but you will never see evidence that the creepy guy saw Dead People. Even a grainy video from a chair moving between prison cells. Nothing. You just said what happened to Ryan in another mechanical voice. <br /> <br /> If you try to try and dress me, dress it up a bit. If you're trying to swing me, show me the orb or blob and leave that fat chick working at Hot Topic, why is this black ball really the spirit of an ax murderer. And if you want me to watch the ghost hunting show me something except trotting out Lorraine Warren in the second episode. "Paranormal State" is a weak sauce. It's not really worth watching if you're hard on TV time or just that slim DVD collection. Or if you don't want to know what happened to Holy Water in that closet.
