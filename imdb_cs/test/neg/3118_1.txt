The film contains a very short scene Deneuve in the bath. She looks absolutely stunning for a lady at the age of 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. Otherwise, he has a mindless, unmotivated scenario, and the main actress has no Deneuv challenge. The director apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway movies, and Pola X met with an imitation of Greenaway's style, without his inspiration.
