Of all the movies in the history of movies, I can't imagine anyone sitting around saying that I want to spend X amount of dollars (or pounds sterling) on ​​a remake of this wrong classic movie called "Breeders." Lots of stories turned into films about meteors coming to Earth with something sinister lurking inside. Why not put your money into a spectacular 3D remake of "It Came From Space" instead? Why look for a flick of boring boredom that only existed to show off a rubber set of monsters and some naked coeds? Was the 1986 "breeders" scenario so inspiring that these manufacturers felt it had to be done again and this time it did right? When you find out, the only reason this movie exists is to show off the British cutie pie Samantha Janus. But if you want the horse to move and exploit Sam Janus in it, you should rather have it more naked than naked and naked more than if you want to succeed. Meteor Land. .. monster escapes ... coeds duff their clothes ... monster eats people ... and more "what if?" The end follows. Frankly, I never thought I'd ever recommend the original "Breeders" to any other movie, but that would be the one to come to second place.
