If this is the best in Finnish cinema at the moment, I would say that the big tax euros that were spent on promoting "culture" have disappeared terribly. Paha maa is the worst example of trying to make a Finnish "European film" for the big audience. I'm sure they want it to be all modern, clever and at the same time touching. The result is crap. <br /> <br /> To make it short: - The story is challenging, naive and not trusted. The same is true for characters. I can imagine that brainstorming would be that "everything as if it turned to *** the people would be hurt and feel, you know, really bad inside because Finnish people are so notoriously depressed, too, and their own - that is so bad ", which brings us to that ... <br /> <br /> - The film is loaded with clichés, mostly about the" Finnish mentality ". The way he deals with human problems and their causes could be from a regular female magazine or a cheap book about bull psychologists and self-help. ("We feel so bad inside!") I'm sure they've also been watching some Kaurismäki to find out what it's about his movies that people love, completely misunderstood him, and came up with a boring, depressing story about people going through all kinds of s ** t for no other artistic purpose than possible social pornography. It's a weeping shame they threw in Tolstoy. It's just a sign of trying to be smart. And not to be. - I think the worst mistake is the total lack of vision and depth. The film is very unoriginal. It is also frustrating to watch endless annoying and suffering without any real revelation brought on it. I can go through this kind of mind if the movie is funny or it ends up being a complicated joke, or better yet, something amazing like eg von Trier is Breaking the Waves. There was nothing like that in Paha maa. In fact, however, at some point I started to laugh because the turn of events was again too predictable, above average and incredible. <br /> <br /> Who the hell is he doing? And who likes it? I hope they pretend.
