I can't believe the number of reviewers who praise it as realistic. I am a million miles away from being an expert, and I will never climb the mountain again; but even the basic knowledge we got from reading to Thin Air and watching Everest Beyond The Limit and some other Everest documentaries meant that this movie was getting more and more ridiculous as it went on. There are some good climbing shots at the start; and when the billionaire mission commander asks early in "How Many Experiences Have Over 8000 Meters?", I was encouraged to hope that it could be a bold and accurate human odyssey against nature. Instead, you have a lot of climbers who increase the mountain without acclimatization; climbing with glasses in full sun, and they are scarcely ever out of breath to perform miraculous performances of endurance. Only close to the top is the little fatigue suggested to dramatically emphasize the physical performance of climbing such a monstrous peak, almost like an additional idea. If you have no knowledge of mountaineering, look at it: be prepared for some cliché of heroes (though not more clichés than a hundred others who move obliquely) and clichés. I developed a little fascination with high mountains and looked forward to K2; but apart from the extraordinarily beautiful scenery, it was desolate because it was so far from reality. I can imagine that some experts would be employed in making this film, but then they would be appropriately ignored in the pursuit of heroic and, unfortunately, fantastic stories. You'd also sound like a little tit if you said "welcome to the death zone" at 200,000 feet.
