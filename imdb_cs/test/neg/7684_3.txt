Well, I'll come clean and admit that I was forced as part of my history study to watch this movie, and then write a short film review as part of my class. Nevertheless, even though I watched the movie myself, I found it very boring and absurd. The style is dated for its years, and acting is farcical. Instead of dialogue, they exchange views of themselves or sometimes into the air. For me, such superior acting does not mean more emotion, and after seeing an extreme close up of Ivan's face for the 100th time, I prayed for the film to end. how bad Ivan's character is. This man was ugly, murdering his bodyguard thieves and his character cowardly. The film was nothing but Stalin's propaganda, inaccurate and boring.
