Just a few words: it's a good thing that George A Romero is still among us if he were dead he would be forced to get out of the grave to vote against the people who created this "political satire". I actually agree with the feelings of these people. Yeah, there are zombies and they have a good reason to go back from the grave: vote. And one of them completes the Voyager Startrek Doctor. That's as scary as it will be, people. If you're looking for a horror movie, I suggest you keep looking. And if you're looking for a funny political satire, you're also in the wrong place and not just because the series is called Masters of Horror. But don't let me back: maybe you see something I miss. While there is a chance that you will waste time with it, just like me. Let's say I prefer my Zombie movie with zombies standing in the camera.
