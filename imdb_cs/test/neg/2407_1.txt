Simply put, the only thrill of this movie is the setting, costumes and OK punk concert. As H.R.Giger must feel his cyborg frame on the cover of this movie, I wouldn't want to know. I could just make sardonic comments on the protagonists of the movies, hoping they would be "mad" in this movie in a cruel way. I feel SPOILERS coming! I wonder if this movie in the spirit of the first 20 minutes. should he be as humorously half-baked as the rest? Exploring all the obvious political shouts (the police are trying to rape a "madman", a discussion of superficiality between a "madman" and a frat boy and a punk concert w / female singer) and using slow motion in combat sequences (which shouts "martial arts coordinator") I just I don't know. The character named "Steve" bothered me because he was trying to fight street people (he should be buried and raped) and looks bad when he broke the guy's neck to the end (you want me to show you how to do it) to say if they would develop more characters than they did "Splatter", it could have been somewhere. If it was 0 to make this movie, it would be, but unfortunately it's 1.
