JP3 lacks Spielberg's touch. It is a total attack on the dinosaur-sensing senses. Watching this movie was a bit like a rollercoaster ride from hell. <br /> <br /> The script is lame; at the same time he asks and leaves too many questions unanswered. We also don't really appreciate the people in the movie for everything that is worth it. For example, William H. Macy is too big a talent to compete with dino-thugs for our attention. And Laura Dern was particularly likeable in JP1; there is hardly a fluctuation on the radar screen in this movie. <br /> <br /> The whole JP3 experience was fine. Too much noise, too many surprises, too many characters die, too predictable, gratuitous violence. Word to the Wise: Vote for yourself from this island. <br /> <br /> (I rated it 3 for special effects, I took another 7 points for absolutely no originality.)
