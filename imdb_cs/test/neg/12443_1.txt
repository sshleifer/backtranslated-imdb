My mom brought me this movie on DVD. The guy in the rental office recommended it. But in reality it can be the worst movie I've ever seen. I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but it wasn't a good story, it wasn't even funny and it was meaningless. I was looking forward to Christine Lakin in this movie because I loved step by step. She too was disappointing. The story was totally unreal. One of the party's dead (in fact he wasn't dead, he later woke up), the house looks like a bomb has exploded and there are two guys who have 3 hours to handle everything. But then comes a homosexual, a policeman ... There's a total mess going to the end and the guys have managed to run and everything in 15 minutes ??? Come on, be realistic at least. Lost money. Really...
