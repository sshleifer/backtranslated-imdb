"The Fate Riders" was the first of several Western Wayne made for Lone Star Arm Monogram paintings between 1933 and 1935. In this record, the producers are trying to make the Duke into a cowboy sing called "Singin" Sandy Saunders with cheerful results to carry a tune, if his life depended on it, his voice was apparently dubbed Smith Ballew, whose deep baritone sounds nothing like Wayne; As far as the film itself is concerned, it includes the standard "B" West Plot of Water Rights Between a criminal (Forrest Taylor) and a local Duke, of course, playing a hero who has not yet developed his character on the screen and still looked like a cowboy with a lot of poverty. Also in the film was George (pre-Gabby) Hayes as a heroine father, Cecilia Parker as a heroine and Yakima Canutt as "one of the boys" who performs his "falling racing horses under the car" stunt while doubles Wayne. As Canutt so Hayes would go on to appear with Wayne in most other records in the series. Canutt, in particular, would have a profound influence on Wayne's future development to teach him, among other things, how to move, fight and look comfortable on horseback. t too bad, however, I have to give it a failure grade because of "singing".
