This movie is too long. I lost interest in the story in an hour. Saratoga Trunk tells the story of Ingrid Bergman, who is the child of a prominent New Orleans man and his mistress. After her mother dies in Paris, Bergman returns to New Orleans to scandalize his father's "legitimate" family and blackmail them. She meets Gary Cooper, who also tries to avenge the train magnates who cheated their father from their country in Texas. He draws it into his programs and the film culminates in Saratoga. Long and boring but worth watching if you are a Bergman or Cooper fan. Cupidon Wrestler provides the only clear place in this meandering story.
