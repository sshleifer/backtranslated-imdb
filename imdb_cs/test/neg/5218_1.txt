Looking at the creation of this DVD - telling you what you are trying to do here - telling the story of the Bible about good versus evil and trying to preach it to the main audience. In a modern society like ours, the film will fail. There are too many sheep in this movie. People are too empowered for this type of preaching today. <br /> <br /> They're fine with gaming, overhead and technical features. In fact, Chuck Norris is fine as an angel, because the unpredictable look of Norris as an angel is no more absurd than Tommy Smothers in the 1960s.
