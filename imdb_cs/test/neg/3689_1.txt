There are good movies, and there are bad movies, and then there is Moscow Zero, the film so utterly bad that it makes spending a month in lonely with an insurance vendor an attractive alternative of entertainment. With an incomprehensible plot about the gates of hell opening in the labyrinth of tunnels beneath Moscow, the film is a mess of repetitive and pointless shots of a little girl walking through tunnels, red lights floating around, and strange wall shadows, none of which serve fear . or tension, but instead causes a reaction "here they go with the girl (or lights)" from the viewer. Directed by María Lidón, who for reasons I can only shame, was billed as Luna, the star movie of Vince Gallo as Owen, an American priest who travels to Moscow in search of Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), a friend and colleague who left missing in the tunnels. He helps with the help of a number of locals who, with the exception of Oksana Akinshina, are all portrayed by Spanish actors trying to limit Russian accents. Along the way, they go through the paths with members of some kind of underground skin-coated religious mafia going portals Val Kilmer, whose career seems to be in such a free fall that he has resorted to appearing in such a trick, and a follower of Sage Stallone (Sly's son), who seems to have been cast only so that the name Stallone could be included in the film's awning. <br /> <br /> In addition to watching the group, they try to navigate through the tunnels using a comic-drawn map and repetitive shots. Or avoiding the pale face of a young girl, not much else goes on throughout. Dialogue commonly passes between English and Russian, with actors often changing in each language, and the whole conversation is pronounced in half at one-and-a-half with the only apparent reason why they felt as if adding a frustrating dimension to the viewer. and above, trying to figure out a crazy tiled story together. However, the only thing Moscow Zero gets right is its name, which could make a more accurate description of this film if the word Moscow were left out.
