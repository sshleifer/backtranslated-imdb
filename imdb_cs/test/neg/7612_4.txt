I found this movie very disturbing. Treadwell is vicious and disturbed, to the point that he probably suffers from mental illness. The record shown is him and not the actor, but still shows the behavior that ended in death. Is it appropriate to show actual shots of suicide? Don't play words. The film shows footage of behaviors that directly led to his death. For those who think Treadwell is a hero, think again. The shots he shot are about him and not about bears and foxes he claimed to be helping. He made no meaningful research on their habits or figures and did nothing to protect them. All he did was run around the bushes and make sure he was better than everyone else. The fact is, by helping to desensitize animals to humans, they put them at great risk. His self-confident behavior did not cause his own death, but the death of his companion Amy plus exposed his beloved bears and foxes to more damage. But I am also concerned about Werner Herzog's actions in making this film the way he did it. Friend and I had a long argument about this movie that loved this movie. He believes that seriously disturbed people are doing interesting things, and as an example, the film Fallen. But in Downfall they use actors. We didn't see that the real Madga Goebells put the cyanide capsule into her own children's mouth. In Grizzly Manu, there was something about using real shots that reminded me of the terrible tragedy of a football stadium where people were. Crushed to death and photographers who could help who decided to simply record horror. Herzog's film shows us that Treadwell's records are more about Treadwell. But Herzog did the same. His own personality and opinions are broadcast in this document, which is allegedly about someone else. Scenes such as where they listen to tape are not necessary. We already knew what was on the tape because the coroner told us. We didn't need Herzog to tear off one of Treadwell's former girlfriends. The movie didn't add it. The film showed us that Treadwell is very benevolent, but he also showed us that Herzog is also.
