I rated this one better than terrible because I liked to see Jonathon from Buffy in something again - though it was the same role. <br /> <br /> First, the concept is a little cute for a short but not a whole movie. Writing was forced and fictional. I feel the movie suffered the most during editing. Second, Amanda Bynes always seems to have her eyes crossed - even if she doesn't. It's just not funny. She always plays a disgruntled girl who triumphs by being herself - irony, because Amanda always seems to be a cartoon. Actually, I'd like to see her in something serious. I really want to give her a chance, but she's always occupied in these trite roles, where she wiggles and makes faces and somehow it's a good thing? Finally, the whole "I'm Dork" segment was ripped off from the Revenge of the Nerds. There was nothing unpredictable in this movie. Shame, shame, shame.
