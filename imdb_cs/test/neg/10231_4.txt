I had to rent a few movies for my little cousin on New Year's Day and she chose The Swan Princess: Mystery of Enchanted Kingdom and The Little Mermaid 2 and we watched both movies while she was sleeping. a few comments in. :) Although it's very kitschy cartoon, it really wasn't that bad. You have to admit that for children these conspiracies are new to them and could be a great introduction to these stories. Odette finds Derek secretly holding Rosthoe's magical secrets and tells Derek to destroy them immediately, but he's a man, usually he won't, and tells her that magic can't do without his help. When a witch named Zelda gets on them, she discovers that Derek has torn the last words of the spell he wants to use to destroy everything, and kidnaps Odette to retrieve this information. Swan Princess: The secret of the magic kingdom is stupid and predictable, but for children I would honestly say it's a way. It's so rare that we have these clean cartoon cartoons now days, so I'm going to shorten the movie. It was just weird when I saw all the voices suddenly changed, I grew up with the first, so I think it was just in the head. <br/> <br/> 4/10
