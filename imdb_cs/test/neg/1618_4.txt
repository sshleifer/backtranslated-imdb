Thanks to the stupid horror movies of the "Troll" type and the indescribably scary cult favorite "Troll 2", it has now become virtually impossible to make films with cobbles, elves and various other kinds of green shavings. Only recently have I watched a 70s movie made for "Don't Be Straid of the Dark", which is basically a pretty scary and seriously toned movie about small domestic goblin monsters, yet I couldn't think of laughter-provoking potato heads dressed in garbage bags running in "Troll 2". Now it happened to me. Just as I was trying to go to "inhabited" with a clear way of thinking, I subconsciously compared allegedly scary and menacing garden fairies with poorly carved Nilbog Orcs! Nevertheless, without all prejudices, "inhabited" is remotely entertaining, though unmemorable straight-to-horror video swing. It is a cheese, soft and politically correct pastiche of the Northern European drama and mythology. Annoying and murderous creatures in this film are not your simple average elves; they are "Huldre": mean little Norwegian demons who live underground and attempt to chase happy families out of their houses through influencing the youngest children. It overcomes the Russell family when they move into a home of clutches in a remote small town. Cherub blond daughter MILF-actress Megan Gallagher begins to behave strangely when she hangs in a cute house in the back of the garden. She claims her friends are fairies, and while a sinister handyman warns of strange events in the past, Gina's parents just think the girl has trouble adjusting to her new surroundings. When they talk about beliefs, they make an appointment with a respected psychologist, Dr. Werner, while "The Huldre" slowly emerges from a botanical shelter. It's not too strange to mention here. The tempo is acceptable and attempts to build up the tensions are pretty cute. You understand that it is a family friendly horror movie, so no bloody murders are graphically displayed. Damn, even a cat's body corpse is held off screen. This is a pointless horror in which Malcolm McDowell appears and almost always depicts an unreliable, greedy and self-centered authority figure.
