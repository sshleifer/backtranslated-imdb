I don't care what anyone says, the movie was stupid. All I could do was work with the camera, which was very good. As for the dialogue I have heard so many people, it was ... it was. Yes, it was a sincere and true life, but so what, can I hear someone talking this way on the street or in a common fast food. The dialogue was good in movies like Pulp Fiction and Gosford Park, that's the fact that it's WRITTEN. Another thing was that the director did not get into the picture. I believe the male character could have been much stronger, but instead looked weak. In fact, the film seemed to revolve around a male character, and then disappear completely in the last twenty minutes. I found the girl in the film totally repulsive, not in appearance, but in her needed paths. He says he's in love with a guy and is jealous of what the bullshit is for him the next day. The ultimate thing: the sound was terrible, and I hope it was just something that bothered my theater instead of actually being on the last film cut. There was a constant buzzing sound in several scenes, and in fact it reflected from speaking. One more good thing was the work of Blood as RP, but the actress who played the main girlfriend did a very good job. These two things could not save the ultimate horrible movie that I refuse to call the movie. <br /> <br /> 2/10
