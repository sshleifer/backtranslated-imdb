Infamous for being "brought to you by a team of digital effects for Independence Day," Coronado is even more spectacular failure only from being side by side with ID4. This ridiculous clutter of the film begins with a thoughtless premise and from there it goes completely down. Rich, soon to be married to Beverly Hills are the subjects of this idiotic story. Claire's fiancée took off on a business trip just around Christmas, so she decided to spontaneously fly to Switzerland to spend their holidays together. In particular, I like her initial reason for wanting to go was because he left home some documents she thought he would need. She grabbed them and screamed after him as he drove away and concluded that her best bet would be to fly the other side of the planet rather than call a cell phone. I refuse to believe that a couple living in a cave mansion like the one who doesn't realize the existence of cell phones. Until this point, the movie is incredibly bad, but look at it, it's also where it gets bad! He gets to Switzerland and if he doesn't find his husband, he gets a cake and calls his friend to whine as unfair. This woman is not an action hero and she is DEFINITELY not a German Indiana Jones because she is loudly calling. She is an overgrown cheerleader, a pampered girlfriend whose outdoor experience is apparently limited to kicking the heel off the ground when she's drunk enough to roam the lawn during wine and cheese on the cliffs. He gets a tip that her fiancée is in South America, so she, like her, is flying there. Once there, he would think that he would go into the jungle, cleanse the enemy base and save his poor helpless friend. He mocks the comment about the danger of going there and then gets angry because he finds out that battles are happening. "You never said anything about the battle!" There is one point where Claire and some journalist have met with driving this huge truck over a bridge that is hundreds of meters tall and hundreds of meters across and two by four. Literally. There are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied with string, and these morons choose to ride. Not only does it fall under the weight of a truck, but Claire manages to fall, dropping hundreds of meters and landing on her back in the shallow river below. Later he recalls this event, laughing as if it were only a hundred. At the very least, she wasn't spinning her chewing gum on her fingers. What's really sad about this disastrously bad movie is that they even managed to scare the terrible performance of John Rhys-Davies, a talented talented REAL Indiana Jones veteran. At the end of the film, there is a lot of nonsense about the uprising where we meet the leader of an extremist insurgent who, when we first meet him, has such a strong accent that he throws his r, as if he thought he was at Ruffles, Later he talks like a guy who left Venice Beach. Incredibly. <br /> <br /> Special effects are negligible. The team that brought you Independence Day by joining it with ID4, just going through the moves, throwing some matte and blue screenshots, I have to believe because they just had nothing better. The story is incredibly bad and Kristin Dattilo, who lists many other IMDb users as the only reason to see the film, does not lead to the least effort. Perhaps she thought that a team of digital effects for Independence Day might have some meaning in this mess. And, considering how far they had fallen, they might have thought they could do that, too. They could at least try.
