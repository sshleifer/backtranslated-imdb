This movie starts the way every movie should begin, with lots of hot babes in dorm walks in their undies and / or topless. Some have showers. I like it! Unfortunately, we encounter the main characters. They just aren't particularly sympathetic. Usually in these movies, the actresses are not really playing, they give very "natural" performances, and they are quite sympathetic, fun and sympathetic. Not here. They don't have much personality and I didn't care much about them. Some girls go on a school trip. On the way they stop at the gas station and meet the biker group. The biker gang should really be left out of the movie - it was before, but now it's just stupid. Biker head looks like a middle aged man dressed as John Bon Jovi for Halloween. The girls go to the forest and later they are followed by a biker gang. I don't really know what the hell is going on. There are a lot of things about how the world ends because it is the end of the millennium, then some cyclists kill a mysterious Indian dude who is still disappearing. Someone eat something like a Ness Monster cheese lock when swimming across a lake. Some guy in stupid make-up is probably a Druid and has to sacrifice some girls to prevent the end of the world. Or maybe cause the end of the world, I'm afraid I didn't pay much attention. First she puts her little girls in animal skin underwear. It could have been a really fun cheesy video, but the biker gang kind of ruined atmosphere and conspiracy was so distracted that it even couldn't live up to my class Z anticipating schlock. They really should remove half of the fence elements and focus on one or two things. Instead, it's everywhere. Overall, if you are looking for a late '80 schlock, I think you could do worse. If you tried really hard. There is a lot of nudity in the beginning, but the characters are kind of crazy and the plot is too nonsense to be even a little satisfying.
