I think I was watching a very modified version because it wasn't nearly as graphic as I expected - based on other reviews I heard. Other than 1. written by the same person who wrote "Emmanuelle" (1974), Emmanuelle Arsan, 2. the leading figure who is a sexually free spirit, and 3. is built in the exotic environment of Asia, " Laure "does not have the same talent as his predecessor. Br /> <br /> I just found this movie, which is too fake with philosophical themes that I really don't care about, ie, a veuristic, open relationship between Laura and Nick, "I'm just happy with what brings her joy". something along the lines I can't relate to this mentality, and the movie / characters really don't release any light. The second half of finding the Mara tribe looked like it was a totally different movie. At that time I was just hoping it would turn into porn, so it would at least keep my interest. <br /> <br /> Maybe I didn't get it. .
