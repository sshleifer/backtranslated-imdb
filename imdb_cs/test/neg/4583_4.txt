But like the Disney movie two generations ago, this movie will fail in the accuracy department. But at least Disney used Skye Terrier. Is the real story mundane for movie producers? I do not think so. There is sufficient documentation that accurately depicts their true story instead of the fictitious accounts that we had to suffer. Some day, the film will correctly portray Bobby's owner, John Gray, as Edinburgh policeman that he was, and correctly portray Bobby's license, which is paid by Lord Provost. When that happens, I'll be at the theaters.
