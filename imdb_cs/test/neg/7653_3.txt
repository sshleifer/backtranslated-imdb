I watched this movie with a bunch of friends at a Halloween party. I must say that sarcastic comments have never ended and I have to say they deserved it. Although I felt that the direction was done well, the madness in their dialogue is just a little too much cheese. I think I got around an hour before I realized what it was like trying to go home. You catch yourself pretty fast that this whole family is pretty unpredictable and something's gone, it's just a little slow. This movie could be about 45 minutes and was much better. The only thing that made it bearable was the two bottles of wine I shot down during the movies. Bring people to slasher movies because at least I know what to expect from them. It wasn't my business, too dark humor, and the subject of cannibalism was a bit explicit and rude. I have to say that Randy Quaid played the role as well as it could be, and I will give him the props because I normally see him as a drunk goofball or a flooded fighter pilot who likes to kill aliens. In conclusion, I give this horror movie a very generous 3 out of 10.
