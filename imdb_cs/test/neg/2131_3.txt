I wish I had something more positive about the devil's fish, but it honestly doesn't seem to come to me. I can't even come up with many of those "so bad, it's a good" kind of moments. Devil Fish is just old bad. The story is completely derived (Jaws, Anyone?), Acting is wooden, characters are uninteresting, special effects are bad and the score is unpleasant. Add to this the seemingly incompetent direction of Lamberto Bava and you have one smelly film. However, I think that the biggest sin of the film is the lack of budget. Bava doesn't seem to have a lot of work to do. In 1984, the Italian film industry was in full decline ??? especially when it comes to genre films. Bava funding was most likely very poor. A film like Devil Fish, which relies on special effects, has never had a chance to be good. It is not the only Italian film that this fate suffers. In the mid-1980s, several Italian films were created whose ideas and concepts significantly exceeded what they could realistically expect due to budget constraints. However, when I said it all and I noticed many of the weaknesses of the movie, I can't afford to rate a devilish fish less than 3/10. I even thought it was higher, but not because I realize how bad the film is. Why don't I rate it lower? It's hard to explain. Despite the many problems in the movie, there's something about Devil Fish that I used inexplicably. It could be as simple as my love for low-budget, Syrian, Italian movies. Maybe my taste in the movies is terribly distorted, but I enjoy what I like. I rate Devil Fish 4/5 on my MST3K rating scale. Boys are doing a great job of noticing a lot of bugs. One very attentive observation comes very soon in the comment when Tom Servo notes, "Just because you can edit doesn't mean you should"? emphasizing one more of the many weaknesses that can be found in Devil Fish.
