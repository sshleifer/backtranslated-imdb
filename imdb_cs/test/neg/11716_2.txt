It must be one of the greatest horror movies. The Charles Band made the best 96 'movie in this little jewel. David Fincher's highly realistic and incredibly styled visual talent is envious, it's not hard to see why the Band continued to do classics like 'Killjoy 2: Deliverance From Evil', 'The Regina Pierce Affair', 'Virgins of Sherwood Forest' and 'Timegate: Stories of Saddle Trams'. <br /> <br /> Thanks to a highly sophisticated story - a small body with a big head is dominated by a family of weirdoes who conduct experiments with naked women. to be a little bit for the younger audience and is only for the poorest viewers, but for those who see it, the band is able to communicate through their masterpieces the subtle news of the human state. The head is symbolic of lost love and the desire for the inner self, which we all have to face in one place or another, and so I could deal with this film on a deeply personal level. Although many earlier critics compared Band's film to Re-animator and other minor works, this stands head and heels above the rest. It's a gorier, but not unnecessarily. Gore in this movie is well crafted and serves to strengthen the story, rather than just getting a cheap scream out of the audience. Also, the special effects in this movie are absolutely top-notch, the best horror movie work from ... well ... sometimes! Work in this film makes Savini's effects seem blind work, limbless hobo. The only problem I have with this film is the abundance of full frontal nudity that was ultimately useless in reaching the composer's goal - to create a timeless epic that would fit into history forever as perhaps the greatest movie of all time. . If it weren't for this little problem, I'd give this movie a perfect 10.
