Tyrone Power was cast in the lead as Solomon. However, a partial-tour through the film he died abruptly. The studio decided to occupy Yul Brynner in the lead and re-shoot the scenes that Power did. In retrospect, considering how awful this movie was, she was very lucky - because it would be a terrible way to end her beautiful film career !!! Of all the biblical epics I have seen, this is by far the worst - and it says a lot, because Hollywood has done a lot of boring biblical stories - you ask so much whether it is creating these movies were atheistic conspiracies! In fact, the film was so boring that it deservedly was included in the brilliant Harry Medved book "Fifty Worst Films of All Time". There are so many reasons to hate the movie, but the worst thing is how incredibly cumbersome the whole thing was! Certainly, casting people with Italian, Eastern European, Scottish and English accents into Egypt and Israelis was bad enough - but at least it made the movie oddly funny. Gin Lollobrigida's bomomie playing the role of a woman who was said to have come from around Ethiopia was also terrible, but at least she was beautiful, though she couldn't act. Being overweight and post-middle aged George Sanders playing such a young role was also quite bad, but at least he had a nice voice. Creating an orgy scene that was choreographically and shockingly boring was pretty bad, but at least you need to see in the credits a mention of a person as a "choreographer"! No, the worse thing about this movie is that almost two and a half hours, it seemed to be nine, it was so badly walked and shamelessly! Since the only mention of this queen of Sheba and Solomon is in only a few sensible verses in the Old Testament, it is amazing that the film went on and on. BIGGEST STORY EVER TOLD was a little longer, but the film was based on four gospels - not dozens of verses! The bottom line is that the film is virtually wrong (except for Gina's neckline). Even for devout Christians and Jews, it is a film that has to be avoided because it plays so fast and relaxed with truth, just as it injects an amazing amount of sex into biblical film !!! Terrible in almost every direction, it is really a blessing for Tyrone Power that he is not remembered to play in this bloated Turkey.
