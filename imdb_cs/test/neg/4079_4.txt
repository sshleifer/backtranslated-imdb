EVAN ALMIGHTY (2007) ** Steve Carell, Morgan Freeman, Lauren Graham, Johnny Simmons, Jimmy Bennett, John Goodman, John Michael Higgins, Jon Helthon, John Helwon, John Stewart as alone) Tense 'sequel' to "BRUCE ALMIGHTY" with Carell's jerk Anchorman Evan Baxter leaves TV to begin his stint as Congress freshman has his hands full when God (Freeman reprises his holy role; to build an ark such as Noah, and the subsequent merriment (or should). Godforsaken Screenplay-Screenplay by Steve Oedekerk, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow is absolutely lame and only Carell's friendly persona goes beyond his futile Evan into something similar to a human being. The end result is plenty of bird gags and total spots (reportedly worth $ 175 million for CGI F / X). Sykes steals the show as Evan's sarcastic assistant. Sacrilegiously ununny. (Dir: Tom Shadyac)
