What a terrible movie. This film was so out of order and so hard to follow. It was so hard to follow and it was just confusing. All the while I watched, I wished it would end! I felt like I was left for 2 hours of life that I would never return. Save your money and don't borrow this movie. I see why Sarah Michelle Gellar was barely in the movie. The first movie was great, but this was just licked. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. Save your money and watch the trailer because that's the only thing worth seeing with this movie. This film had no real story. I'm still wondering what I was watching.
