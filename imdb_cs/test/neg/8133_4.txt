Julien Hernandez is certainly attractive and likeable on screen personality. In fact, his character largely carries this entire movie or whatever it is worth. The problem is, with the exception of his gal pal (played by Marisa Petroro) and Paul Lekakis (as a trick / date / friend for some characters) no one else is coming. Hernandez plays a 30-year-old Cuban heritage director and unknown sexuality who comes to L.A. In the process of meeting with a group of homosexuals in search of subjects, he comes out ... but very s l o w l y. Even after 88 minutes, the film was clearly stretched and padded with various film school facilities, most of which ultimately unnecessarily interrupt narration (which is not very beginning) or point to the overall amateur character of filmmaking. What a shame, because there is a love story somewhere and the last three minutes, when Hernandez's Sebastien clicks with a rich West Hollywood party - a thrower (conquered by Lonnie Henderson) and share some sexy soulful kisses works this despite everything that came earlier. But we don't care about any other character or their situation: Why would a handsome Dante have Eurotrash priss for a friend? No. And I'm not even beginning to say that Sebastien's friend Paulie's "rules" for dating - no homosexual I know, damn no sensible person, period, would be such a limitation to himself or to others. And please tell me how Sebastien gets a peeled banana (which is normally quite shmushy, right?), Shoved his butt and must go to the doctor to remove him? I have noticed that Hernandez has won the prize for this film as "short" - it should probably stay that way. This all said - I was looking forward to seeing Hernandez again on the screen, in a better comedy scene with more confidence.
