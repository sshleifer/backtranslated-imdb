Yet another cookie-cutter film about a stiff adult who meets an adorable, street-clever child (Cop and 1/2, Gloria, etc.). And once again, it is not funny or interesting for everyone to watch - children or adults. I'm sure some people might find this movie fun, but I have no earthly idea why. Once again, I apologize for the poor children who were forced to work in this film, so everyone else and their parents could make some money at the price of cheese cheese film.
