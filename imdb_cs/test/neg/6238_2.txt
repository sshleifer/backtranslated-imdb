It's been a long time since I was lame and boring in the movie. One thing is the slow pace at which characters develop in a progressive way, or some aspect of the film is clearly reinforced by such stimulation (eg, "Lost in Translation"). and absolutely stagnant, as happened in this matter, I think that from the look of Helena Mirren's face she had to be upset by the disappearance of her husband! Surprise, surprise! (sarcasm) And what a great way the whole story broke up at the end.
