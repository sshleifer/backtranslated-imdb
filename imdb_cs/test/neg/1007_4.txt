I was disappointed with the third movie in "Death of Wish" and I wouldn't recommend it if you're really into Bronson. It's his usual self in this, maybe a little lighter than in others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching the movie of the week on TV - the whole movie has the production value of the bad episode A-Team and I like the escapism fun show like A-Team, but not on the big screen, even though it's an action movie that it does not claim to be something sophisticated. The film takes a while to get and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. The storyline is something from the "Highway to Heaven" episode, and Bronson looks like a fish of water with most of the senior cast and the gun of the game is so out of control that you won't even get any satisfaction from Bronson's revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and continue on the 4th installment I highly recommend.
