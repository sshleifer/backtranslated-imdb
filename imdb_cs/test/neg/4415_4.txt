There are a number of movies I have been talking about. Most of the time, these are the stone works of the 1950s that appeared on television for late shows. That was one of our favorites. The fallen native soul was brought to life in a stump with a scowl on her face. My friends have now said that if you looked carefully, you can see that the thing has shoes. I have never seen that. Most notable to me is that the natives looked like white men with black greasy paint on their faces; some looked like Italian. They also spoke with the strangest coloring that seemed not to match their situation. Like mummy movies, the mobility of this thing does not seem to offer a great threat. Confrontation needs only to be done quickly; I think it's an old element of surprise. If you see it, don't take it too seriously. Be happy to have a battery of old horror movies that made us happy.
