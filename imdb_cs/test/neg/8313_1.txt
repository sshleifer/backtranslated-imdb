What is a huge pile of stinking rites! Ye Gods, where else to start with this? Well, mix crap acting (including one bloody infuriating woman who talks like she's either a) chewing painfully on some ice cubes or b) she just woke up after having undergone some extensive root canal surgery), an editing that would seem to donate that celluloid was cut and linked through the use of an angle grinder, any really hopelessly choreographic martial arts 'action', a script that is supposed to be. he wrote two years old and some of the most outrageous and distracting loud background music ever committed to any movie and hey you have Death Machines aka The Ninja Murders (though note that surprise, there is actually no ninja anywhere in this sodding travesty!) <br /> <br /> In short, if ever a film equivalent of a particularly severe dysentery, then it must be! Avoid at all costs!
