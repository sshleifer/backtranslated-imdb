This film was a Mexican horror film from the late 1960s. It's not so good, but not so bad. There's a lot of Schlock and it's stuffed pretty hard with nudity and violence, but it has a conspiracy, and at least it was trying to keep it (though the plot was the same damn Frankenstein's work "don't touch God's domain" b - movement fare). There was some cushioning mixed with a female match, but it was made in Mexico and the contest seems to be popular in Mexico. The reason is that the doctor wants to save his son who is dying from leukemia. Other doctors have not hoped for a poor boy, but Dad has the idea that he should keep his gorilla heart so his son can save his life (I don't know, I'm a lawyer and not a doctor). The transplant works, but the sonny-boy ends up being a human-monkey that terrorizes naked women and kills anyone who gets in his way. There is also a subplot involving a cop and his girlfriend who is a wrestler (this did not really add too much, but if they wanted to throw in some masked female wrestlers here is a good reason to do so). The film was cheap but not too bad for the b-film of the day. The story was basically just recycled, and there were a few things that weren't bound in that well. However, this film is in a way fun (I don't know why, maybe because it's a Mexican horror movie and is sticking to my normal bad movie diet). I think it may be because it's a mix and mash of some very strange things. Watch if you like cheese foreign movies, nudity and female wrestlers.
