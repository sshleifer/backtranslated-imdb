This movie is a stupid and very little funny movie. The unhappy 'eastern people' are not happy to be out in the west; so they hire a drunk master (John Candy) to lead them back east. The visual gags weren't just funny to carry. And Richard Lewis gets on your nerves very quickly; But then I honestly don't like him for anything he does. Ed Lauter is cheerful as a dull villain. The film was dedicated to Candy. He died a massive heart attack ten days before the film was finished. The stand and digital enhancements allowed Candy to be visible in the final scenes. Candy was a very good comedian and gave us some real good knee, his belly laughing in his career. This film was not only his best result. Also in the movie you will know: William Sanderson, Gailard Sartain, Ethan Phillips, Ellen Greene and Rodney A. Grant.
