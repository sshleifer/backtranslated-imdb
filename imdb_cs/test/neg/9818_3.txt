Basically an indistinguishable B-film that mysteriously directs one of the greatest talents of the golden era, Fritz Lang. Even with the star names Lang, Walter Pidgeon, Joan Bennett and George Sanders, are ready for a ridiculous story, bad acting, distinctly fake files and miscasting. To be transparent, I must admit that I am a passionate admirer of Walter Pidgeon, who was fortunate to find a niche in the MGM artificial dream factory and somehow worked in supporting roles, supporting Greer Garson and others. He is wildly mistaken, it is a wood chips, '30s-Ray Milland Madcap Comedy Tone, in the role where his life is in danger, and he is in hiding. Joan Bennett's cockney accent is excessive, but her lacquered hair, perfect make-up and sleek belies street-wise Cockney slum-girl. George Sanders is unable to play badly but disappears after the absurd opening finds that Pidgeon somehow pretends to shoot Adolf Hitler. The surprise for Fritz Lang is the uneven tone. I have found that the film fluctuates restlessly between occasional moments of tension-thriller surrounded by cheerful comedy. Hitchcock totally reversed the ratio, using comic relief to occasionally release tension. There is a reason why this film is unknown. She has neither served nor offered a career or reputation to anyone and has forgotten it because it is a surprisingly bad film from such a group.
