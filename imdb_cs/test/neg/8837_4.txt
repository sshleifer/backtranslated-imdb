It is sad to say that this is one of John Wayne's stronger series of poor westerns for Lone Star Productions. Here he is the United States Marshal on the trail of a bandit known only to me, I am not like you, like Shadow. No, it's not Lamont Cranston, it's some dude who gives orders through an open wall so his men don't see who he is. But the voice is unmistakable, you'll know within 10 minutes of the movie. And another reviewer here is pretty bad, no whining or moaning from the audience would be because Gabby Hayes still plays different roles and is clean shaved here. He still did not find his niche as a dear oldtimer sidekick of various movie cowboy heroes like Duke. Later he leads his men quite openly at the top, so I'm not sure what the original wall shirts are safe with. I don't think those who wrote it know. Wayne gets Yakim Canutt as an Indian sidekick and the relationship is almost the same as the revealed Lone Ranger and Tonto. <br /> <br /> If you ask me, it's pretty stupid.
