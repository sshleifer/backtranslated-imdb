Wow, what's a bad movie. Least scary and hardly understandable. The plot is not at all, and acting is absolutely scary. What is the line from the famous critic? "Leads an emotional gamut from A to B." Yeah. This is it. Nor is it good for the value of the camp! I didn't expect Oscar material, but this? And gosh, her boyfriend is a ghost? You would have to have an IQ of particularly silly molluscs so they don't see one coming. This film (and I use the word freely) is an insult to the film public. If only someone who would be involved with him knew how to tell a story together! It gets 1 out of 10, simply because there's nothing lower. On the bright side - at least it's not two hours full.
