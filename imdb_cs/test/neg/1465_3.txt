I found it on the shelf and fainted with pleasure !! I danced on the counter, knocked out the money and ran home! You know what?! I fell asleep less than half way! He tried again the next day ... YAWN !! What the heck !?!! I couldn't watch it! I like all the other things he did (I haven't seen the monster yet). What does he give? It's me? Or him? So sad. Boo hoo. P.S, I like working with a camera.
