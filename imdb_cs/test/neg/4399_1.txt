National Lampoon's Dorm Daze is the worst movie I've ever seen and I saw the Kazaam movie. Anyone who reads this, who thinks this movie was in any case good, shape or form, has no idea what a good movie is and should not look at another movie again because they are so stupid. <br /> <br /> Name everything wrong with this movie. First, the plot is everywhere and cannot follow all the multiple "misunderstandings". Behavior is at least terrible, and the whole thing is wrong. Everyone and everyone who has worked on this film should not be a boy in another movie. Once again! It is too hard to summarize this film in one paragraph or two because it is so bad, but for anyone who reads it, DO NOT FIND THIS FILM !! If you want to watch a good movie, turn something else on TV. Even the US has better films than this. <br /> <br /> _friend.
