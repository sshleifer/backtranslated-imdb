Certainly I could not believe that the level of this inaction was exposed to this production. I honestly thought homosexuals had a better taste than this. I know you do. Most of the blame isn't on the cast, but we'll keep them out of the way ... The only one with real talent was Joe Souza (plus he) had the best casting point. He had a nice, clear voice in a theatrical style. Okay, and Jaymes Hodges' voice was so-so, but he had a blank expression in every number. The rest couldn't keep a note in the bucket, though the music was apparently dubbed after it was. It must have been really terrible to hear them live. They were all girls, except for three. If I wanted to see naked women on stage, I could go to titty bars. Not sure why anyone would decide to shoot L.A. Place New York. I would like to imagine that NY has a more easily available singing talent, though one would think it was in L.A. would be able to find better people. Apparently not. But I turn ... the real fault lies with the creators and producers. This score was the most banal, unsuspected audacity I've ever heard. It sounded like some theatrical queens took all their music CDs, threw them into a blender and poured goo on the page. Unfortunately, I'm sure there are many people who can't tell the difference between good theater writing and what it is. I really laughed my ass over the whole thing, but not lame jokes. I think the morbid "my lover-died-of-AIDS-song" titled "Kris, Look What You Missed" was the most hysterical thing in the show. Genius writing ... Kris / Missed ... wow ... they're just a rhyme ... must be a good lyric. And Jesus ... THE END OF THIS SONG ... "Oh Kris, Ohhh Kris, OHHHH Kris ..." BEFORE AND OVER! My next favorite was "You Must Be a Junkie Boy Pump to Be a Humpy Hunkie Boy" ... WTF ??? The whole show was full of JUST BECAUSE's most distinctive lyrics because they rhymed. Where did these people learn to write songs? Apparently they listened to Sondheim and said, "He's not that big, I can do it ...", as the retarded legacy of Bobby, Bobby, Bobby from one company. Another irk: why is 20 something that sings about Robert Mitchum and Tab Hunter? Apparently from the lyrics of the lyricists and not the actors ... again the bad writing. If you love torture and pain and know that many of you strange fetishists do it, go ahead and watch it. But you were warned.
