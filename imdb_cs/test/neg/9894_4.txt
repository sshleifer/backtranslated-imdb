The Texas Revolution of 1835 to 1836, including the period preceding and immediately following, is depicted in this average 3-hour made-for-television film, whose only redeeming value brings light and homage to Stephen F. Austin, a so-called "Father of Texas" whose The life story has long been overshadowed by the legendary Sam Houston. The rest of the film is simply the usual "Santa Anna's tyrant" story and with a weak attempt to show a Mexican perspective with a fictional Hispanic character portraying the stereotypical Latin machismo. Combined with short low-budget battle scenes such as Alamao and San Jacinto, this film is only recommended for true history lovers who do not come from Mexico. To his appreciation, Mexican uniforms look accurate and romantic subplot (another love triangle) doesn't take too much screen time. Overall, this film captures the violent detachment of the Texas Anglo-Saxon racial minority movement for a positive and righteous revolution against Mexican tyranny, embodied by General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, the so-called "Napoleon of the West".
