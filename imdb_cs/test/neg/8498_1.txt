This film is a gay love story disguised as a story of graffiti and friendship. No ONE review described this movie as a gay romance film, and it's the weight of the conspiracy. I don't know if this was the way people who wouldn't be interested in seeing it could meet and expect the film to be on the market. Negotiation is pointless. Yeah, graffiti too. This movie was a clever way to hide the agenda of displaying young boys to get gay. All you have to do is look at the rest of the films the director has involved, all with the same subject. Boring as hell, not what I expected.
