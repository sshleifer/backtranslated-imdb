SPOILERS <br /> <br /> I love movies. I've seen a lot of movies. I didn't think I'd ever see a movie I hated. Mask's son destroyed it. The son of the mask is so bad that I won't even make a detailed comment as usual. I don't actually write much. I think you should all know that this movie is terribly awful. And poor Jamie Kennedy. He was amazing in Scream, but now the movie! Also, this film takes the SMO-CAN film and turns it into this goofy baby movie that even kids won't like. This film also consists of very rough humor. Like a woman's nose. She has a nose on her head and white things explode from her nose as she sneezes. There is also a parody of Exorcist. Yes, a film for children has an adult parody. Maybe they thought the adults wanted it. Frankly, it made the film even more curly and coarser. Here is a basic, stupid plot. Tim Avery dog ​​gets an amazing Loki mask and turns into a dog cartoon. When Tim pays more attention to a child with special abilities, the dog's cartoon becomes Wiley Coyote ripoff. Then Loki takes a child with amazing abilities and Tim and Loki have a tremendous animated fight. Tim has a mask. It all happens. Too bad this movie is terrible. Overall, the original mask was a fantastic film by Jim Carrey. It's basically not. Please rent, buy or download this movie. I made a terrible mistake to rent it. I don't want you to make the same mistake. I feel terrible that I could not write a detailed commentary, but really, what is there to comment on it? <br /> <br /> 2/10 I'd give it, but come on, it's basically a boy. Recommended movies: Mask.
