* THIS OVERVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ... OR MAYBE NOT. WARNING IS ALSO FOR ALL * <br /> <br /> Dang it. Just when I thought SCIFI Channel used all of his ridiculous movie ideas, they give us THIS. Actually, the storyline itself is nothing we haven't seen in movies like Snakes On A Plane, Deep Blue Sea, etc. That means a monster / animal / threat of some kind threatens a lot of people in the near environment. people. In this case, the alien on the train. Wow. I must say that when I first saw this thing on the cable, I couldn't stop laughing. No SCIFI movie prepared me for that; it was so incredibly pathetic that I couldn't believe it! All actors are a lot of stereotypical genre characters. But since they are not so famous (at least), I have not expected many of them. Except Diamond Phillips. No comments, but I think the guy was looking desperately for work. The problem was something called "special effects", terrible even for SCIFI Channel standards. This model / toy that made us believe it was a real train (not to mention toy / toy model, bigger than train car), meteor coming HORIZONTAL from space, "baby" alien (sock puppet and iin 't kiddin') ), regular aliens who looked ugly ... while they were static; when they started to "move", it was horrible, explosions (the terrorist blew up LITERAL! And what about the exploding helicopter! How many gas kegs did that thing?), crazy math (they couldn't even solve the school problem!) ... And the ending I do not talk about the doomsday, until then I did not know whether to laugh or start crying. If I remember correctly, I did both. <br /> <br /> It's the perfect movie to laugh at, alone or with friends. But be warned; it's so ridiculous at SO MANY levels ... and you need a heck of a lot of mistrust ...
