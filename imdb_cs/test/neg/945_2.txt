this movie was absolutely terrible. most of the comedy scenes seem outdated and banal, and perhaps the funniest scene in the movie has already been dealt in previews. The whole premise of the film is so incredible and ridiculous that we really get into it. the actors themselves portray unrealistic characters. It's not just the fact that movies get so hard to swallow, but as it keeps forcing you down your neck to expect you to dumb down and take it. the storyline itself is so shallow and easily predictable. the boy refuses in any way from every school he asked for (I suppose he forgot to attend a community school) and decided to create his own school for colleagues. everything lasts well until its school is questioned. All the time the Dorky character manages to woo his beautiful neighbor into a fall for him with his witty sarcasm, which apparently is a skill he only has. then comes the final struggle with the students in some way to unite and fight for the survival of the school. the main character then convinces the public school to allow his school to stay alive by some "inspiring" expression. This movie would be more enjoyable to watch if I was under 16 and still unaware of all college issues and issues.
