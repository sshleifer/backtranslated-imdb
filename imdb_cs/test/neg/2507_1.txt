The opening was stolen from the movie "Eight Years Freaks", which is a film that is not all. Words that apply - along with others that can't be repeated! Drifter type returns to your home (?), Meets old friends etc ... the usual annoying child, single mother, local loud and so on .. Bad special effects, alien ship, atmospheric disturbances, (hey, didn Director see "Close Meeting"?). Good deeds? A good story? Good camera angle? Good cutting? Not here! Do not rent if you do not share the cost and have plenty of beer at hand. Don't be watching TV, go and drink a lot of beer instead - you'll get it more!
