I know that Jesse Franco is responsible for a wide range of movies, and I mainly go to his horror movies, as badly as they are at times. I think it was a morbid curiosity that appealed to me, and I wasn't so curious to finish it. Maybe it was better to finish, but if you're on lesbian sex scenes (of which there are plenty) then you might want to go through it. So what exactly can you say about a movie that includes a woman who pees in a bowl on the kitchen counter (when getting up)? You never mind what is used for later periods, you probably won't want to know. If this sounds interesting to you, then it's your problem, but then you might like this movie. I myself am not a prime, I have seen a lot of disgusting movies in my day, but at least they have done it, and it is not. Sometimes there is too much. Bleah.
