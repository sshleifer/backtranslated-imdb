My paraphrase over the slogan on the back of the DVD box sums it up: this movie was much more horrifying than scary. This is the worst movie I've ever seen as long as I remember. My wife inadvertently rented it and thought it was a version of Tom Cruise. The sad coarse special effects on the menu screen should turn us off. Gratuitous nudity has made us more suspicious in the opening scene. But as we wore the movie, we were impressed by the clumsy action - both excessive and inadequate - without continuity in directing and editing, writing text and gross special effects. We gave up after half an hour or less; it couldn't be better after a bad start. <br /> <br /> As I despise reviews that produce a product without specifics, here are some examples of especially unpleasant moments in the movie, even though they are spoilers. : <br /> <br /> - Lead farewell to his young old son, because he is going to go with his mother, the other is prickly because it's their wedding anniversary, but the leadership doesn't go out of business as a result. The son asks, she's afraid, "will I ever see you again?" Maybe it has to look like a premonition, but instead comes as a rambling behavior for the child in that situation in this situation. - A huge alien spacecraft hit the ground and sits in a huge crater. Nearby, there is a crowd of people looking at it restlessly, but otherwise look careless. One woman finally says "it's gi-normous!" - After this craft tossed the village and its inhabitants, lead and viewer, now alone at their homes and trying to load their cars to escape, have something similar, in a quiet confused tone: < br /> <br /> "What was it?" "I don't know ..." <br /> <br /> - A crowd trying to evacuate across a bridge is blocked by the military because part of the bridge is destroyed. When an alien ship fires an explosive at her, the crowd begins to run, seemingly just because the director said it, not because he is afraid, or in any real danger, let alone unusual circumstances. And so on ... writing about a film lacks the experience of actually seeing it. Please, please, please save your harassment, even if your morbid curiosity is overwhelmed! The film is so bad that we can't even enjoy it as unintentional humor (versus, say, King Vidor "Solomon & Sheeba" in the lead role with Yul Brynner wearing a wig). Life is too short for waste to follow such nonsense. There must be something more productive and fun, like walking a dog or cleaning a cage.
