A sudden gangster movie that doesn't want you to be treated much less cruelly. I would think the story of creating Las Vegas would be interesting, but it would be almost impossible. Performance by Warren Beatty as a stupid and unlikely Bugsy Seigel doesn't want you to look at someone else. It flashes once or twice with a fog of power to add an interesting scene, but you simply don't care about it most of the time. Annette Benning gives a skilful turn as her untrustworthy lover, but even she is only slightly more spicy than he is. I really wouldn't bother with this turgid drama if you weren't Benning's devotee.
