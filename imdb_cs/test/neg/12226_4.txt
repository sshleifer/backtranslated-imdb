In 2002, when Matthew Lawrence did The Hot Chick, I also saw Drumline that day. Drumline wins by default! If Comebcaks were released in March (as planned) at the same time TMNT was released, TMNT would win by default! Matthew Lawrence has done a great job of seeing the quarterback. He didn't have to resort to harassing dirty words, which is a plus. But when he started playing with his private parts as well as with other football players and touching the girl's breasts, they were minuses. The biggest minus that has discouraged me is that every football player has to take part in a fake music video, except for Matthew Lawrence (insert The Price Is Right is a loss of horns)! Another fake musical opportunity for him just because he is shy to make music. In the past, Matt has many times disappointed me (Super Human Samurai Syber Squad), where he came so close to the musical moment, but ended up unsuccessfully. Sure, Joey had a singing career with two albums on his belt, and Andrew begins his own musical career. But it is very rare to find Matt's musical moment. The two who excelled would be at Brotherly Love, where he played guitar and sang "Pigeon On Your Car" (Art Atrack), which he wrote by the way, and the romantic Boy Meets World the moment he sang "This Dame" As Time Passes. Matt, you played too long. Why not make a musical comeback. You have a good voice and I miss your music page.
