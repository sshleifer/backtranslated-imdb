Unfortunately, this movie is not very good. But is it really important? We all know the basics of the story, and it has nothing new. But I like low budget horror and sci fic camp classics ... so I forgive this. What someone remembers from this movie is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it. <br /> <br /> He did OK. The part didn't ask for great acting skills, and the direction never seemed to give him any chance of giving him somehow ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... and so was the girl. The movie is fun if you like the horror movie & sci fic camp classics and have experience in watching them.
