I became a rare copy of this early Almodian film with high expectations - Almodovar is a prolific contemporary director, I enjoyed his film "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" of 1988 and I read one or two very positive film reviews. I had to completely omit the humor that the reviewers saw in this movie. I found it to be incoherent, tasteless and boring. Yes, there are plenty of allusions, people in tension and gross sexual situations, and yes, these elements could shock viewers in 1982 (which was almost certainly Almod√≥v's intention), but much of the shock value over the years probably eroded, leaving a flaccid story. Besides, the whole movie seemed to be very messy, none of the characters were particularly likable, and for the "comedy" - even the dark one - I didn't find the movie funny. I think it is possible that there is a very selected audience for such a movie, but I'm not part of this audience and I'm not sure I want to be.
