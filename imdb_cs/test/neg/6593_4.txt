This is based on Michael's life from 1983/4 to 2004. Flex Alexander did a good job but didn't look like Michael. I feel that Michael has been portrayed as a stupid man who I don't believe he was (though he sometimes believed in the wrong people). I thought Flex Alexander looked Chinese when they made Michael White. I think Latoya should be portrayed in this, she was always introduced with her brother in the 1980s. I never thought any of the support actors would look like their counterparts. There were some things that were inaccurate son Lisa-Marie Presley looked about 4 on the wedding scene, though he wasn't yet 2 when Lisa and Michael married. Also, when Michael tells her mother Katherine that he thinks he and Debbie should get married, if she carried her baby, it was Katherine's idea to get married.
