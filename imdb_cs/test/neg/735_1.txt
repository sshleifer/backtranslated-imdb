Terrible, terrible, terrible. The actors are bad, the music is ridiculous and the film's pathetics. I rented a DVD and had to get myself to watch it to the end. My advice: Read the book, it's much better and you won't have to endure all these silly pictures and ridiculous dreams Catherine has. I think I've never seen such a bad movie.
