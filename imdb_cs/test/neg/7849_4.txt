Maybe the director tried another PIRATE (Good Garland and Kelly Musical) - but this poor musical epoch falls. Sinatra and Kathryn Graysons do not mix well - and their chemistry doesn't have a spark. Sinatra's assumption as a sweet guy trying to impersonate his late "bandit" father is fine, but he seems to be clumsy in this role. It's amazing and amazing that Sinatra can have a somewhat awkward song and seem strange - his phrasing and eloquence as a singer want to hear you again. When Grayson sings the same songs, it's hard to believe he's not singing something completely different and not so interesting. She has her big moment with "Love is where you find it", which perfectly suits her and shows off her skills. The photo is lucrative and both stars look attractive as well as costumes and sets. Co-founders Mildred Natwick and J. Carroll Nash gave a lot of energy to stop working. In addition to Sinatry's singing, there is a strange geeky dance with Ricardo Montalban, Cyd Charisse and Ann Miller. It's fascinating and special. Montalban and Charisse were a wonderful dance team and this number is really special.
