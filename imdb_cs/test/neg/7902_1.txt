Wow it really is a stereotypical, terrible garbage. I'm sorry for anyone who can waste money to see it. I'm pretty sure I wasn't allowed to laugh once during this whole movie, I just can't believe it was such a horrible movie. br /> <br /> I'll be more careful now when I'm watching movies late at night. This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I'm not saying it's the worst movie in existence (though it might be), but I don't think I've seen anything so stupid and rude that it's my life. it makes the Scary movie series look intelligent. <br /> <br /> 1/10 I would give 0 if they left me
