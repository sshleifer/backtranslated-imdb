This movie is just downright horrible, the movie was just an hour long and about 25 minutes of the movie was just wasted by random snowboarding clips that didn't even join the movie. The storyline is completely "retarted", my 5 year old cousin might have written a better script. I don't understand how anyone could finance the production of such a film ... terrible. This is definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire existence. I think casting the director just took some random kids out of the street to be in this movie. Directing, playing, creating and writing this film are really bad. I feel bad for people who have wasted money on financing this waste. She couldn't pay me to see the bullshit again.
