I had to lower my rating of this movie to 4 because of the terrible soundtrack. I'm sure it wasn't a problem with me or the tape, because some actors and the soundtrack sounded great. But most of the actors' voices were distorted or garbled beyond recognition, especially for non-British. There are a lot of cute little twists that would make this fun movie a pleasure - ending up in Bosnia's great mistake - but a lot of humor was lost in the sound.
