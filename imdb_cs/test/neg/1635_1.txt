I actually owned this movie, which is an MST3K version called "Cave Dwellers", which is really the only way anyone could really watch a movie like this. If it weren't for Joel, Crow, and Tom Servo who were constantly doing wisdom, it wouldn't be possible to sit in that piece of crap. You have a hero named Ator who looks a lot like Jeff Spigoli in the Ridgemont High's Fast Times and seems to be a little more intelligent without being stoned. He Takes Cave Residents (Cave Residents) Invisible Guys, Giant Snake (with a bunch of anal retention snakes who like to line up all the skulls face the same way), inventes a hang glider that suspiciously looks like modern aluminum one with some cheap vineyards wrapped around it , and then fights with the evil John Saxon-looking guy. Then he rides his horse through traces of tires, where somebody is riding quads. Yes, most of it is from MST3K, which, as I said, is the only way to look at this Turkey. film. If it wasn't, it would get zero stars.
