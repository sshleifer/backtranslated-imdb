I went to see "Quitting" with high hopes, because the director's "Shower" impressed me. Despite several fluctuations in youth, "Shower Room" ranks high on my list of all-time favorite movies for his penetrating insight into family relationships and his generally excellent acting and direction. And I saw it at least three times. But "Quitting" fell, in my estimation. It seemed useless exercise and I was quickly tired of the main character's unbearable personality that I wanted to end the movie. I admit I slept six or seven times, but it was just a few seconds at a time, so I think it's still okay to write this comment. I admired my parents and sister. The device using all the real characters in the movie is nice that I've never seen before. Disappointing, I will still try to see any movie bearing the name Yang Zhang, simply on the basis of a beautiful "shower".
