Um ... okay, that's really very bad if it's compared to the first movie, so very critically acclaimed Rosemary Baby. In fact, it's a pretty bad movie in general. Yes, there are several redeeming features, but later I can get it. Well, since the last movie it was quite a while, in fact it was quite a bit of a belief. Rosemary is still trying to escape with her child and influence him in a good way, rather than letting him succumb to the evil future coven (or "tribe" as stated here) has set for him. When he runs with him with an empty bus and picks it up, leaves his child with a hooker, the hooker lifts him up until he gets older, where Satan tries to own him, because he seems to reject his evil inheritance in every course. as planned, and then the end that I would feel seriously ashamed of not seeing it coming since I heard it was a sequel to "Rosemary's Child"! I witness the Rosemary's Baby masterpiece and then read the sequel to the book, thinking that this movie was an adaptation, I watched this movie and got it ... I was right about it? A true fan of this "series" and I can say that I saw the sequel, and I have an idea what will happen after the events in the first film (about both this film and "Son of Rosemary", own movie sequel Ira Levina, which is still were not adapted to the film). <br /> <br /> Ruth Gordon, that in the first film played Minnie, is in the film several times indicated. but why-oh-why is it so different? The Rosemary knife has fallen into the first film and can be seen protruding from the ground, but Minnie pulled it out! Coven is now called a tribe (as I said before). Now they go around in hooded raincoats that sing "Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ... Hail Satan ... Hail Adrian ..." and so on and so on. The Gothic building is now like a two-storey house on the lawn in the middle of nowhere, it looks like a nice house in the suburbs or something! And the child itself is quite normal looking, with eyes that only spread, and kills someone or something in vain. When it comes to acting, it's pretty bad on all parts, except for Stephen McHattie, who plays a very adult Adrian. Pattie Duke Astin, who has replaced Mia Farrow as Rosemary, must have one of the worst performances ever recorded on the film! It's so bad it's not nearly funny ... when "OH MY GOD!" and crying like the fifteenth time in the movie, you are just like "Okay, it's not funny anymore," and then when it's gone and the movie is only for twenty minutes, you're like THANK THE LOVE TO WATCH YOU: "MY GOD" ANY LONG! ! SHEESH! Ultimately, this film has very, very, very few redemptive qualities, enough to get at least four stars. But if you look at it as a serious sequel to the first movie, it's almost non-existent.
