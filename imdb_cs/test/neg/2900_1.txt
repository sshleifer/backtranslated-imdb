I saw this movie a few years ago, and a man who never want to play golf. I think the ninjas obviously have no respect for the golf game or its development. And I am not talking about "victims" like scorecard fittings. No no- Based on what I saw here, they blatantly massacre policemen and golfers on the sacred grounds of the clubs. Judge Smailes would be spinning in his grave. And does he repent for sins? No no, based on what I saw here, the typical answer is to take over the body of a crazy female repairman and seek revenge. I consider it morally reprehensible and no need to say that after overlooking this nonsense I have not only stopped playing golf and spoken on the phone, but I also decided to stop feeding homeless.
