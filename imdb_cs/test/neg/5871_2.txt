This is one of those movies you will find when you stay too late and only have a base cable. It's hard to believe that this film was made in '95 because it looks like something from the late 1980s. Regimental young men with various domestic problems face a demented ice cream that is on a mission to make the best taste: Soylent Cream !!! This film is very demented and is just scary in how scary and utterly ridiculous it is. Actually, a really scary thing about this movie is the nature of the problems these kids face at home. The fact that these children have no escape from their silent suburban suffering makes any random wild loons in the neighborhood look like a walk in the park. The most ridiculous part of this movie is the fact that the stereotypical "fat boy" is so obviously a thin pre-teen with a mountain padding under his bag sweatshirts. I think either a) they didn't invent a fat suit, b) a casting director was too lazy to find a poodle baby star, or c) we sincerely believe that this baby is starving and has a tremendously stretched belly. So if you're at 2 am and need some ridiculous and disgusting rip with your annoyed friends, go ahead and look. Personally, I'd rather sleep.
