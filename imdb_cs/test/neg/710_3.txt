Why did that have to end? The latest movie, Laurel and Hardy, from the cruelly cuckoo theme (with Hal Roach's mistake) to the final "Nice Mess" / "I couldn't help it" schtick, that's a duo like a grotesque parody of myself. Meanwhile, their relationship is now created only from insecure action, Asinin dialogue and half-hearted slapstick. The people slate King of New York, but Chaplin's last hiding place was nowhere near as dignified as this. What really someone who loves Laurel and Hardy is the look of two comedians. The cover of the video I hold shows that it is in their first-class form, all the boy's smiles and glowing skin, with the back of it: "The photos on this sleeve are for illustrative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the content of the film. "Essentially? It's not even close. The real movie sees them at least fifteen years older than the photos that decorate the sleeve, with Ollie anxiously overweight. It's not funny or comical, fat as it would normally appear, but bad looking and on the verge of obesity After a series of moves, he would be dead after seven years, while the tent is suffering from a prostate problem and dysentery, looking precious and drastically declining whenever something bad happens to him, such as getting between a lifeboat and a table. Even worried about his life, even Ollie, who gave him a traditional slap, scares you for being killed, and after completing this film, he would last another fifteen years and eventually die of a heart attack in 1965. \ t revered artists who age and die painful deaths, and it is an unpleasant tracking of their deterioration, both in health and performance, on screen. Almost everyone else, he remembers Laurel and Hardy, I think at Way Out West, busy bodies and our relationships. Vision in such physically ill health situations and routine habits at the end of their careers is mold on my happy memories of them. Warning Signs are clear from introductory credits, whose list is not only four writers, but also someone who comes up with the concept, and recognition for "gags". So if Monty Collins wrote "gags" then what were the other four writing? And in that case, why did Monty Collins pay the fee, given that there is no proof of "gag" in the whole movie? More than 40% of the film is dedicated to traveling to the island of the same name, during which we experience some of the most painfully indecent scenes the boys have been involved in. When I saw the bat scene, I wanted to turn up and die, so big was his childish incompetence. What kills the movie stone dead is that all cast support are dubbed, unable to speak English. Not only does it make the film discontinuous, but it also seriously depletes Stan and Ollie's reaction to their co-stars. This is totally at odds with the scary movie tracks and absolutely cruel cuts. Frankly, it looks terrible, and while the DVD release can clear the picture, the sound and image quality is much worse than any Hal Roach work. Stan and Ollie's friends, Giovani and Antoine are bored with no charisma that stand out very well against the outdated repertoire of Laurel and Hardy. This is another big problem with the film, in that none of the supporting characters is funny or the key to the innocent mentality of boys. The dubbed cruelty shown by L & H ("you - the fat") makes them stand out as isolated social misfits, rather than loving sub-anarchists. There is evidence of some darker political satire - though Duck Soup is nothing - and the island's concept without rules is an interesting subject. Perhaps now more relevant than ever, a film that deals with immigration and the US Constitution suddenly becomes the most recent in 2003. Unfortunately, in addition to the fun scene where Stan is chosen to be "people," it is not really going anywhere. . And this somewhat black humor has its rough edges - or is it Laurel and Hardy, where rape is directly implicated and Stan threatens a man with a bottle, just to accidentally have a glass of someone in the face, your idea of ​​a good time? After all these years, when Stan and Ollie shared the bed, we also get a clear reference when Stan accidentally kissed him - Ollie rubs her kiss in disgust. Also worrying is the implication that Stan and Ollie's illegal immigrant friend Antoine end their lives by dreaming him. Remember, I never thought I'd see Laurel and Hardy where they should be hanged. The need for intrusive and unfair narration is another indication of how the whole thing is messy, with the American version (the same version available on video) hacking 16 minutes in a futile attempt to improve it. Almost absolutely unnoticeable, this terribly frightening, tirelessly unreal movie serves only to defile the reputation of Stan and Ollie - to avoid at all costs.
