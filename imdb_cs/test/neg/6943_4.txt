A sadly predictable, clich√© story about a woman who was no better than she should have been. It is also sad that the screenplay is one great experimental writer, John Dos Passos, from the original French exotic potter Pierre Louys. This time Marlene Dietrich is Concha, a manipulative, cold-blooded Spanish beauty. Don Pasqual (Lionel Atwill) picks her up from the cigarette factory, but she throws it away. He warns his tall young friend Antonio (Cesar Romero) against her, but to no avail. Duel follows, Concha reproaches Pasqualit for trying to kill the only man she cared for, so she won't: pointing at the gun, but Antonio shoots him. But instead of going to Paris with a young winner, she returns to the man who would die for her. With an unexpected bit of Edward Everett Horton as a Spanish governor. Dietrich plays the role of a Spanish woman by constantly moving, turning at the waist and holding her hand and then turning, twisting, throwing her head and so on. And she makes faces and has a curl in the middle of her forehead. Photography is strangely overcrowded: no outdoor scene can be filmed except for a tangle of bare trees, no interior scene can be filmed without so many busy details that it's almost impossible to watch people moving around the room, no successive scene of Dietrich can be shot without a big changing the wardrobe. Carnival scenes are so full of confetti and streaming that it's almost like an underwater scene in the Sargasso Sea.
