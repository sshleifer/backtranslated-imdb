*** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> One of the worst movies I've ever seen in the past years "The Village". Insulting anyone from any intelligence. Poorly written and incredibly fictional. Nobody, especially in Los Angeles, says how they do these characters. None gently at all. If the purpose of this film is to say that "we all have a bit of bigotry in us," it does a terrible job of saying it is obvious. Not only was his point clear, but every character in this film was amazingly STUPID. The car scene almost came out with me, along with the rescue and oh forgot about the WHITE off DUTY Rookie COP, which lifted the black thief hitchhiker and ... I could go on and on. Terrible, just terrible.
