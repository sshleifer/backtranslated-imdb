I hated the movie. Simply put, this film is so bad that I almost want to ignore what I have ever watched and never mention it. But on the other hand, I can't resist a good assault. And if there is one thing that Evan Almighty does for the audience, it is that it brings the best criticism. <br /> <br /> The film (continuing the much more entertaining Bruce Almighty) begins with the re-introduction of the audience to Evan Baxter, the mere promotion of the best character in the original film. That is right. This movie shows no Jim Carrey or Jennifer Anisten. Not a small look. You know your movie is bad when the guy who agreed to Ace Venture: When Nature Calls doesn't even have a short role. But somehow they manage to keep Morgan Freeman as God. While I'm sitting in a nearby empty theater, I'm bored of my mind in the lack of comedy, I couldn't help but wonder how much money it took to get Freeman this movie. Then it hit me an hour ago. It's just a role that takes all 20 minutes in a 100 minute movie. God just appears amongst the scenes to tell Evan to build an ark. I know that Morgan Freeman will not be watching this movie over the year and I think it's as good as his role in The Shawshank Redemption and Million Dollar Baby, but it's easy money. <br /> <br /> Where was I? Oh yes, conspiracy. Sometimes it is so hard to concentrate on a conspiracy when you realize that you are thinking about plotting more than a script writer. Evan (Steve Carell) apparently left his job as a news moderator to work as a congressman. Yeah ... there's no transition in between. He never turns to his wife and says, "I think I want to be a congressman." It only happens in the first five minutes and you are forced to deal with the big transition. As a congressman, he is a partner for a bill proposed by John Goodman when God suddenly seems to tell Evan to build an ark. No "Hey, how are you doing? How's the weather?" bit. "I want you to build an ark." Evidence of Bad Writing: Evan discovers that God gives him clues to building an ark after noticing that a fan is holding Genesis 6:14 as he passes his son watching a baseball TV game. This is basically a conspiracy of Evan Almighty. There are some random support cast members who make their best at making comedy, but don't do too well because they're not showing almost any screen time. It's just your basic run of a family of mills who build sheet film. And there is also a compulsory scene where the father has to cancel his tourist plans with his children and his wife because he is busy working. They leave disappointed, but they understand, like all the other times in the movie it happened. Just once I'd like to see the youngest boy turn to his father and kick him in the chin and say, "You're a real bastard to cancel your plans with us. I'll be emo now." There is also the drama you would expect from your father and family when he realizes (wife, actually ... three children have no problem helping their father build an ark), he is crazy and claims that God wants him to build a big ship. But don't worry. His family decides to stick to him. Oops, I just screwed up the drama. Another problem with this movie is that there is hardly any good comedy. I know the decision was made to make it a PG movie to get a bigger crowd response, but I don't think I'm in a minority when I think family humor is more than just guys getting kicked in nuts and animals collapsing. Maybe I'm wrong and that's what the quality of family humor is limited to. And if that's the case, please bring me more adult comedies, so I don't have to sit in this stupid thing anymore (pun not determined). The end is extra cheesy. The film suddenly takes on a dramatic CGI that bothers me when I think it's a terrible CGI waste. I bet it was also expensive. Finally, after all we expected, we were told why God wanted Evan to build an ark. And boy, boy, I hated why. I will save the details, but it was as if I was watching or reading mysterious murders, and the murderer turned out to be the person behind the main character in a second and had no lines. Then there is a nice touch at the very end. The song "Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now)" plays over credits and we are then subjected to "dance" cast. I do not get it. He spends 100 minutes of unsuccessful comedy and then wraps it with a thriller. I swear I wasn't so scared I was watching Steve Carell dance from ... well never. There you have people. Evan Almighty is the most frightening movie of all time. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought it was an unnecessary experience. I'm confused with all the talented actors (Carella, Freeman and Goodman) who appear at this gala evening next to Lauren Graham, a Gilmore Girls woman who has not shown me that she can get out of the paper bag. Most of all, I am surprised by the strength that I can really sit in the whole movie without going out. <br /> <br /> Rating: * out ****
