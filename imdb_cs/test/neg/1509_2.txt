Really awful garbage waste. This movie does everything wrong, except that runtime is less than one hour. Gore FX defies gravity and logic. There are no fears. Acting is boundless because everyone who seems to read their lines. There's a surprising ending that is just stupid when we find that the things we've seen have not happened. Boy I hate the end of it! They do this with long stretched shots of people doing nothing interesting (like doing makeup or speaking for what seems to be forever). Do they have to turn off the movie that is under an hour? Ridiculous. The story itself is pretty crazy. I think it's just a variation of APRIL FOOL DAY if I remember the movie correctly and the movie wasn't that great. The only good thing I can say is that she seems to have been shot well. Too bad nothing is happening, it's very exciting.
