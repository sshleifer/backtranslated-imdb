I haven't seen a lot of "Family Guy" episodes and it's a pretty safe bet that I won't see too much in the future. Some people say that comparing this show with "The Simpsons" is unfair. I absolutely think that this show wouldn't exist if "The Simpsons" didn't come first and I think they want so much to be "The Simpsons". I don't understand what's so funny about this show. In the episodes I watched, I understood where they wanted to laugh at me, I understand that someone thinks the joke was just said, but the joke isn't funny. The whole show seems lazy to me: title, "jokes", a complete lack of inspiration around the world. <br /> <br /> The best TV shows (drawn or not) are created as follows: the script is written, goes through several transcripts, things that don't work, are removed, inspiration is set on fire, good stuff is added, more is overwritten and then it's filmed. <br /> <br /> I picture The Family Guy episode will be created as follows: the script is written and is filmed.
