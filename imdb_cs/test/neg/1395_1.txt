... so where is my trophy? I was really expecting the banner and confetti to fall from my ceiling to watch the full 30 minutes of that stupid thing. Recently, the Central comedy Central has dropped the ball and is trying to fill the void left by Chappelle for several seasons of a retarded man pretending to be a retarded man. Dah duh nah !! If you pay attention to the show, you will notice that when Mencia is not stuttering and laughing at her own parodies, she only makes exaggerated observations that apparently lack a sense of humor. Have you noticed how slow people are in Buick's drive? It's like Dah duh nah! Even the dwarfs and half-naked hot chicks cannot distract from the significant lack of Mencia's talent. In addition, Mencia is not even a "wetland" as she constantly and adamantly claims to be, which makes him a hoax on top of it all. If something good could be said about Menci, it's his endeavor. The man obviously has no talent, but as an injured antelope in the mouth of a hungry alligator, God knows he is trying.
