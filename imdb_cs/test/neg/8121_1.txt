Seriously ... I'm impressed with all the good responses this show has here. All we have in this show are two stupid kids doing annoying laughs and making OCCASIONAL funny things just like ... 2 of the gigs, while most of the others sucked in ... and then commenting on music videos I can't face myself when they love or love. In most episodes there are the only things you hear, they are repetitive "let's score with some chicks", or "kick your ass", or better and usually used "that was cool" quote, and especially their unpleasant laughter. <br /> <br /> If you want a good animated show, try Simpsons, Ren and Stimpy, South Park, this show just isn't worth the time or energy you need to watch this terrible MTV series truthfully.
