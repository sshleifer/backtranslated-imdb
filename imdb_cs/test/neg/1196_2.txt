This movie was fine, but like most TV series it would be better if it was just for TV. The best and most popular characters had only five-minute roles, while the three average characters were throughout the film. Unlike most British TV-based movies, this movie is up and it seems to be the winner, but the pace suddenly stops when the three average characters are in the real world and waiting to capture three comedians. The film then goes nowhere when Hillary in a room with captured Steve, Lipp fancy dress as Steve, and Geoff somehow wrote himself into medieval times. Which made me think she was? How come he doesn't need a key to enter this world, unlike Royston Vasey? The medieval scene was fine, but Monty Python did it much better, and of course, more fun, with portraits from Peter Kay and Simon Pegg, they both said nothing funny, Kay had a line and Pegg just sat on the wall. Br /> <br /> What also gripped me was that they forgot what happened in previous episodes, such as Hillary escaped to the Caribbean on TV in Series 2, but in a movie that escaped from prison and also Lipp is a pedophile vampire who has not been mentioned in the film at all, which was also quite disturbing when he left to take care of the children alone. There was a lot of hole and unexplained plot conspiracies like Geoff and Dark One escaping from medieval times back to Royston Vasey? Like Series 3, it started well, but as the film progressed, it slowly went downhill and had a very weak predictable end. They would be better doing what Monty Python did and remake all of his best classic sketches from 1-3 series and Christmas specials, and that he made into a movie that would re-introduce characters to the whole a new audience who can't be asked to watch the show or firmly buy a DVD. <br /> <br /> The best advice is to save money and wait for it to be on TV ..... Where it belongs.
