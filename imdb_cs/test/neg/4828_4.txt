I watched this movie about thirty years ago and it still got caught up in my mind. When I came across a DVD, I didn't hesitate too long, even more, because I had a fondness for the early beginnings of Belmond. But what a bad surprise! Some films should be allowed to resign from public exposures, retain a certain memory, and not shock the audience. Widely celebrated as one of Chabrol's rare cynic works, the only lasting impression I got from re-observing is ... boredom. In fact, some films do not have old age. But what about movies that have no sense of style at all? Scenario bugs, uninspired gameplay - probably due to lack of direction - a sort of production design that doesn't have its name, less than average photography and, last but not least, the worst editing work I've ever seen at age to make it really hard to stand. <br /> <br /> My impression was that there were a lot of people with too much money and equipment, but of course, no idea or skills. It is really a surprise that this Chabrol's career did not come suddenly. Don't blame it for the total bad taste of the 70s, this is your own crap and a good candidate for useless waste of celluloid.
