I'd like to know who entrusted the producers of this film to pay for his production. Somehow, this film took me about two-thirds until I realized that it wasn't going anywhere. I think she managed to make something happen, but nothing really was. It wasn't scary. The dialogue was wrongly written. The first 90 minutes should be covered in about 15 minutes. That would be a slightly acceptable Twilight Zone or Outer Limits episode. <br /> <br /> At this point, I'm just insane that I'm unnecessarily useless. That's a couple of hours I'll never come back. I hope these comments will save someone from losing their dinner. Instead, take a nap or press the gym. Or if you want to be scared, turn on the cable news channel.
