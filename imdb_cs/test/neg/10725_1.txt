Satire about greed and money, huh? The intentions behind this fiasco are more greed than any of the themes that embody. Jim Carrey's government was definitely short. It's an unbearable presence on the screen. The infinity of his depiction is nothing less than a scary one. He made it, this "masterpiece" also, so he can't blame anyone. "Comedy number one in America" ​​screams desperate television. Sure, Jim Carrey was supposed to guarantee full houses, but the game is over. If it sounds angry, it's because I'm. I spent a sunny afternoon in California, plus, between tickets, parking, flat cakes, etc., Almost $ 45 on this thing, playing and producing Mr. Carry. Not anymore, do you hear? No longer.
