Rather like Paul Newman and Steve McQueen with their racing car movies, it all looks like a jollies project for Robert Redford when he goes downhill in the alpine sun. The story is as light as the powder snow with the little city boy Redford David Chappellet (what kind of leader's name is that?), who, with his eyes on winning Olympic glory, gets up in the nose, in no way, his coach , father and teammates. Women are merely a side show in their island world, as evidenced by the rather disgusting pick-up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown, and then his selfish abominable pursuit, the heavens above, the free thinking, the independent woman played by Camilla Sparv. Ski sequences are fine with good stunts, which include numerous bumps and scratches on the piste, but their effectiveness is diminished by our subsequent familiarity with the top-notch of ski events today. Moreover, I'm not convinced that the Winter Olympics have the same mass identification with the general public as summer games, so when Redford finally wins his gold medal in the last reel, I couldn't be so excited about him in one way or the other. <br /> <br /> From actors, Redford, the best forward profile, doesn't have to do much and really not, while Gene Hackman does better with equally lean material. Mrs. Sparva behaves well as the chief female candidate who treats Redford the way she treats every other woman in her chauvinistic way. In fact, however, there is no dramatic tension for which the action sequences are. Don't fully compensate and don't care about fig for any of the leading characters. One of those movies where the actors were looking forward to seeing him more than the audience.
