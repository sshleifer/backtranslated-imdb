Having had more than a few friends I suggest checking out Rise of the Footsoldier out, eventually I got it last night. Undoubtedly the story of Colton Leach is to say (and did so in his autobiography) is a compelling story of one mans output from Terry's boy introducing himself into the attached underworld villain. Unfortunately, this film compromised in quality by misinterpretation, frightening accents, and pitiful action. Ricci Harnett, in the lead role of Leach, does a reasonable job of moving from criminals to serious criminals, but his accent is everywhere. As his voice provides storytelling, it is something that drove me after ten minutes. Terry Stone as Tony Tucker provided an unintentional comedy with a badly fitting wig (or the worst Barnett) dialogue that was so exhausted that he bordered him on minors and on top of things in the delivery line, reducing Tucker's parody. the film was that the events leading to filming in Rettenden, Essex, and the formative years of Leach are really interesting for fans of criminals and football hooligan fans, to make this story torn down by a lack of credible accents and acting to leave me feeling that an opportunity has been missed. Roland Manookian and Frank Harper only give movies a source of authenticity. On the positive side, some of the stimulation and construction films flowed well and kept their attention. The violence was well choreographic and, in addition to excessive reliance on projectile red syrup for blood spraying, it was quite realistic. If you enjoyed the film, then it's worth a look at Essex Boys, which tells a similar story from a fictional point of view, as well as Billy Murray.
