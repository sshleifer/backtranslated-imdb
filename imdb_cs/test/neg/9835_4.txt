The girl in Lane lovers is one weird little low budget movie. On its surface, the film tells the story of a hard drifter named Bix (Brett Halsey) who spends his time looking out for a young guy named Danny (Lowell Brown) and a girl, Carrie (Joyce Meadows), that Bix meets whom he likes to be on I watch him. Nothing too interesting will happen (Bix comes out with Carrie, Bix gets Danny out of trouble, Carrie's father drinks a lot, etc.) Up to about 10 minutes for Carrie to come in the movie. Her father accuses Bix, pulls him out of the prison cell and just beats him to death. Their roles are reversed and Danny must save Bix. As long as I didn't read the IMDb reviews, I thought maybe it was just that I was reading more about Bix and Danny than he was actually there, but now I see I'm not alone . It was clear to me that Bix and Danny had more relationships than usual in the 1959 movie. The homosexual nature of their relationship, though never openly expressed, is still quite obvious. Their living and sleeping arrangements, Bix's reaction to finding Danny in bed with a prostitute, Bix's inability to commit to Carrie, and the phone call at the end, when Danny tells her parents that "bring a friend home, is a few examples of moments that lead to the inescapable conclusion that their relationship is much more than initially meets. I'm sure they exist, but I can't think of any movies that I've seen from the fifties that shout gay as loud as this. As for the movie, I don't know any other way to give it? it's boring. As I wrote before, nothing much happens for 90% of the running time and the actors aren't good enough to give The Girl in Lovers Lane a lot sparks, lonely exception is Jack Elam, his mad Jesse is one character that is interesting enough to be able to watch, the biggest problem I had with the film was motivation and da Bix logic is immediately ob And what about the crazy Jesse who Carrie's been chasing for a lifetime? Anyone who thinks he'll ask Jesse where he was that night? Her father saw him bothering Carrie in the dining room, but never thought that flattering Jesse could have anything to do with his daughter's death? There is not much logic. What about Jesse's confession? Danny catches Jesse by the lapel and that's all it takes to make Jesse confess? A really tough guy, huh? Why would he confess so easily? And after admitting, no one thinks he would catch him? It's pretty nice Jesse just to stay calm and not run away. In any other reality, he would never spill his gut and run like a rabbit if he were fingers for murder. The fact that a girl in Love Lane asks me to accept these ridiculous actions by the characters is something I don't want to do. Overall I give The Girl in Lovers Lane 4/10.
