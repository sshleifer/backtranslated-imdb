"Book II" is not a movie, it is a sermon. This nausea, nausea, and almost excruciatingly tedious omission of ignition probably works as a religious propaganda, but it has no fun value beyond several of George Burns's wisecracks. Louanne plays a little girl who is (ahem) asked to create an advertising campaign to get people to trust him again. No, that's the story. It is a lead load of old shoemakers who has too many self-justifiable, "explanatory" religious waffles, but hardly any dignified dialogue, and certainly the utter absence of everything that comes close to magic or magic. "Miracle On 34. Street" this is not. Suzanne Pleshette breathes a bit of life into this rancid puddle of fast-setting concrete, but the pudding scenario and the garbage that brave Louanne has shown him quickly send him to the fiery depths that know you.
