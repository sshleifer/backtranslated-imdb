To start, I love Steven Seagal, the man is a genius. But recent movies let me wonder, are they trying? His latest films show that Seagal has hardly any effort. It is too obvious in Out of Reach that his lines are nicknamed. . What Seagal does in this movie is not just a slap on the face of his fans, but even more Jean-Claude Van Damme and his fans. In the second scene, or so, as he prepares a zip-line for a penthouse with drug dealers to steal jewelry and money, he shows him how he has set up his weapon and hung it on a neon sign. You might say, "Yeah, what does this have to do with Van Damme?" Well, the scene was stolen from Jean-Claude Van Damme's movie called The Order. Rent both, watch both, compare both and lose respect to Seagal. Not only did you die of rubbish today, but it was, I dare say, insult. Seagal's Aikido moves are still good, but why not doing great movies like tagged for death or over the law, hes still got the moves and attitude, I just left wondering 'Why Seagal, why?'. His newer films have such idiotic scenes that have nothing to do with the story and such idiotic storylines. I hope that the upcoming Black Dawn movie will be the next Exit Wounds or Beyond Justice, because I really wondered if this last movie chain, especially Today You Die, has other great action movies like Double Team. Please don't watch this movie if you hate Seagal, if you like his movies, don't look at it, it will challenge his future in the action film genre.
