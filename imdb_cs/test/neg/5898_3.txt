I rented a DVD in a video store as an alternative to reading the news. But it's pretty much more terror. While the movie may present some information from the report in drama, you take the word producers - there's no reference to the commission report anywhere in the movie. Not one. Playing, all around, is pretty bad - largely all the stereotypes of "hot" obscured foul, government agents, everyone thinks they know more than everyone else. There may be some truth, but in fact it has a bad Hollywood stereotype. <br /> <br /> IMDb users' ratings and comments tend to be more accurate than bad, and I started looking at pre-rent ratings whenever I can. I wish I had this.
