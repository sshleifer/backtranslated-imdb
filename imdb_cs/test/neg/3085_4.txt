I saw the movie in the middle as I walked through the track. It was about 3 in the morning and I fought fast food insomnia. It wasn't that bad at the time, but every time I tried to watch it, I can't get into it the way I did that night. At that time I thought it was cute and I loved the variety of characters, though in my opinion they could have been better than Goran V. But one thing that followed me was the character Heather and her sad "Commitment" to a husband who didn't want her anymore, which made me feel sorry for her and rooted her. (Since I was in a similar situation at the time, maybe that's why I liked it so much.) It's not a bad movie, but to a large extent you have to be close to the character to appreciate it, and I hope that you won't be.
