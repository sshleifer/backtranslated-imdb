Without them we would see nothing but Spielberg Farrelly's brothers and movies based on old sitcoms. They are the people who risk. They reap rewards of success and suffer from failure. Max and Grace are definitely a failure. Credits Michael Parness deserves to get there and do his first feature film, which he thought caused him to bankrupt. It might be better to stick to the stage if this film suggests what to expect in the future. Even though everyone warned me, I went to see Max and Grace, I hope I could find something not. It's getting pretty good, Max's party at his parent's house, shot in a warm dim light, the camera floats into interesting angles. As soon as we see Max hanging up, Harold and Maude apparently ripped open, the whole thing going into the tank. How could he have done it unnoticed in the middle of a birthday party? How could two mentally ill and committed psychiatric patients decide to marry and do it with the blessing of all stakeholders? In Q&A after the film, David Krumholtz designed the whole story of a surrealistic dream about his character Max. This story is so badly written commentary sounded more like an apology. The film doesn't look like it was made on a string, the more I was so disappointed with the results. What is meant to be funny is not, but instead it is bad. Continuity is sloppy, lighting is terrible and effects look cheap and forced. BPH sat under three hundred and was surprisingly full, but in the first half hour I saw at least thirty or forty walkouts. At one point, Grace, played by Natasha Lyonne, laments her inability to die. I found myself thinking the same thing, because I never get out of credits. If Krumholtz thinks it's "one of the best scenarios," he read it as if he needed to catch up with his reading. The terrible waste of talent and resources is the worst independence I've seen from Bubba-Ho-tep.
