This movie has become crazy. I believe that the original of this film "Mask" was an amazing movie worth buying and watching. I firmly believed they should continue, but when I saw it, I thought again. This film spoiled the whole idea of ​​'The Mask'. Mask mode? The child flies in the room? My little brother, who is seven, was not even laughing and into these childish movies, but that was worse. Plousta blbosti !! I'm telling you, please don't look at this movie, it's a waste of money and a waste of time. Instead, you could have fun! Look at the mask, but no, repeat, no, watch this piece of waste. Thank you.
