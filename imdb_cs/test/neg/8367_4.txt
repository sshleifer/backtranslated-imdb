At least if you are a Disney fan (well, from a variety that loves their live action movies as well as animated things) if you're a baby if you're a baby in the heart to the point that you barely realize you're an adult if you love absolutely any movie that presents animals, especially when doing tricks, or if you're not too demanding, Air Bud: World Pup is somewhat nice to watch. I'm a Disney fanatic. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I like to see it again. But the boy has a lot of problems. The main error is a combination of too many characters, too many conspiracy threads, and there is not enough time to take care of them. Within 82 minutes, we are adults getting married, teens falling in love and trying not to worry about it, teenage competition for love and jealousy, preteens playing spy games, dogs falling in love, dogs playing football, dogs having puppies, manipulative parents who do anything to win their children so that their children learn a lesson, a housewife dilemma, and crooks who cook and execute elaborate plots. I'm probably forgetting something, but that's the 10 big issues that need to be addressed, less than 10 minutes to thread to deal with them, and you're probably weaving them into a coherent whole that's not too complicated - these are kids. the film - after all - and it is also funny and pleasing. Not surprisingly, director Bill Bannerman, who was completely in charge of the first move (he has a lot of previous experience from the second unit), was not enough for the task. I'm sure it didn't help that at least three screenwriters and probably dictators were present. The end result is that Air Bud: World Pup is extremely jerky. Events occur with little justification and worse, often little explanation. People invent and do things primarily because they need - and quickly - to get everything to where it needs to arrive in less than 90 minutes. From one cut to the other, time could jump six months ahead. We have both adults who seem to be mentally disabled and children who simply intuitively find out what the dog is thinking and rushing to an unexpected action. Some topics should be removed simply because it is difficult to deal with the film too much, as soon as you introduce yourself to an idea, it has already passed. <br /> <br /> You're not helping either. The fact that one of the threads is basically a rip-off of One and a hundred Dalmatians (1961), minus the Cruella De Vil character. And another problem is that, as the film is being edited, I have to assume that the dog, Air Bud, probably didn't do much with the soccer ball. Unlike the first two, there is a dog who plays sports, almost after seeing him, and when we see him, it's in very fast flashes; Once in a while, these snippets seem even supported by computer animation. Yet, for someone like me, there is the kitschy charm of Air Bud: World Pup. Scenarios and performances often meet between ridiculous, hockey and a little clich√©. I like this combination. It makes the movie a bit predictable and gently bizarre. And occasionally, like the end when the film completely leaves the consistency and basically becomes an advertisement for the US football team, Air Bud: World Pup is so kind that you can't help but love it.
