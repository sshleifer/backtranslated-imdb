I suppose I should be fair and point out that I don't believe in ghosts. This means I am very interested in the topic and I like the scary story as well as the next one. I am a fan of ghost hunters because they are at least trying to make their investigations scientific. Even the early episodes of Most Haunted had a camping fun factor to them. The paranormal state has none of these qualities. The cases themselves have the potential to be interesting, but like so many "reality TVs" these days they suffer from overproduction, bad acting and silly scenarios. The creators of the show admit that writers "guide" stories. I have heard that they even go to a shoe cabinet in a romantic subplot to reach young female demographic groups. The show has many other flaws too. As others have said, narration quickly becomes like nails on a blackboard. Despite the visual and sound effects, they quickly become equally irritating. I'm willing to suspend some distrust for fun, but this whole "vendetta demon" is just ridiculous. Since the show's producers are also responsible for brain dead feed, such as Laguna Beach and Newport Harbor, I don't think it's really any surprise. If you're a fan of Ed and Lorraine Warren or a big "reality" show of junkie, I think you'll find Paranormal State that you like it. For the rest of us ... I recommend that you avoid.
