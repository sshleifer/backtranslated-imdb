I bought this movie on a DVD for Â£ 4, but it was a waste, the movie is very bad. The storyline is your average monster movie, where it kills a few people, the mayor / boss does not believe it and fights with it at the end. On the plus side is the quality of the movie Very Good and the setting of New York is impressive for the movie budget - unlike the small coastal town. Acting is also reasonable. However, special effects, the mainstage in the monster movie, are ridiculous and adding a random bus load to children on the plot half way just gets weird. The end is just bad. <br /> <br /> In short, whenever you have a chance to see it, no - there will be something better. RTC "Real Horror Movies Don't Have PG Rating"
