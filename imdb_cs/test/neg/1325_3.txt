I don't know, maybe I wasn't in the mood for this kind of movie, but it was full of trite melodrama. It was too long and seemed to be at least slightly discontinuous (granted, not paying full attention ...). For a more enjoyable view of the Battle of Stalingrad, see Enemy At The Gates. It is true that some arrogant people will mock because it is a Hollywood movie, and does not mention the "daring reality of war", such as this "amazing foreign movie", but it has a better flow and is just fun to watch around. Besides, there are quite a few "brave" war movies, and this seemed to be amateurish. But hey, maybe you like it, so go straight; it just wasn't for me.
