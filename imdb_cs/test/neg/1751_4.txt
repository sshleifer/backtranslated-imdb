I recently saw Shame directed by Ingmar Bergman. The film was interesting and very unique. I liked how it was in Swedish with English subtitles and that it was also in black and white. These functions have allowed me to better relate to characters, time periods and their stories. I didn't like the way the movie was very slow at the beginning and how you didn't know what was going on. At first, it was primarily the story of Eva and John. The film also ended on a very depressing note, because nothing good came from all the conflicts and changes in the whole movie. I would probably never meet Shame again, but it was a very sophisticated experience.
