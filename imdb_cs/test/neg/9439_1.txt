This movie was terrible. Stupid assumption and terrible behavior of all. Whoever wrote this waste should be hanged. It reminds me of a student film hack, but WORSE. Whoever made this one should give up now. I know that opinions are subjective and all, and some may think that "fantastic" as some think "Dune (1984)" was fantastic, get off the horse and watch some real movies. OK, the negotiations were tolerable and with a better direction could have been much better, but that was not enough. I don't know how much more I can say about this film waste than to completely destroy it. Anyway, it was terrible and I recommend to avoid it as a plague, if you come near "Dreamland", rent a movie next to it.
