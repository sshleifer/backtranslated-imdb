Watched a few months ago on Netflix Instant and left a review there. <br /> <br /> Let me say that most other reviews are very accurate. This movie was bad writing, bad playing and bad direction. I also liked Russell and Pare "back in the old days" and was very hopeful for them. In my Netflix review I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and continued to wash the dishes and made a sandwich, but I was still watching the movie from the kitchen. When I got back to the living room, I was very confused about how the last 5 minutes of the movie had developed. I even rewound it to make sure I missed it. This movie is totally thrown up on how to make a "twist" end. I think the idea sounded good, maybe it was an interesting scenario, but the budget was so nonexistent that the files were really missing. And yes, I suppose all the "bad files" were trying to give the viewer a clue. Everything that told me it was "low budget". Anyway, the reason I came here was because over the weekend I saw a review of Shutter Island and what the reviewers said, or didn't say, Lead me to believe that Shutter Island is the same store , only with a budget of 50 to 60 times more! (Actually, I have no idea how much the dark world costs, but I hope they haven't spent more than 1 million!) <br /> <br /> So, as I said, I thought if somebody redesigned the bit, they got a bigger budget for a better "look" (whether it meant a better stage designer or a better post coloring, just someone with a vision), they could transform Dark World into a product that would be able to pass. Now it sounds like Shutter Island did it. Looks like they have visions all right, but scripting can still be gone. Money can't buy everything, but it should be in Hollywood! PS My 2 star rating is for Russell and Pare.
