Oh, my. That's a really bad movie. The game is absolutely cruel, the script is god-terrible, and the photo is just awful. What makes this movie stand out, however, is that it never once cares about one soul-- a good guy or a bad guy, living, dying or dead-- for 87 minutes. "Oh, he died? Huh ... He thought it would" be the best response I could collect after every murder. "Characters are so black or white that you can still find out who is who with the volume turned off. While cast voices have a special monotonous quality throughout their text, their faces seem to be looking at an old silent movie with plenty of eyebrows, exaggerated frown and "a thoughtful look." Each character is humorless, a passionate, one-dimensional one-piece pony; once he has fulfilled any of his special roles in this fiasco, they have asked to be created, they are totally rejected. Psycho "and a little scattered along the way. This is not a particularly horrible movie; a cool, passionate cast. It is not an insulting film; the director is so safe that no one can find him. just a bad movie after all <br /> <br /> Avoid, we were not so happy and we paid to watch this bomb on Pay-per-View. As part of my repentance, I write this review. <br /> <br /> Enough.
