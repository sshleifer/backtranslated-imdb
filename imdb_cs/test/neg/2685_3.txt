Unfortunately, this film was horrible. Clich√©d, hackneed, stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unnoticeable. The feel-good final is ridiculously lame. There is a reason why Reinhold's career has disappeared. If you don't live in New York and you're not Jewish, a few jokes will be unpredictable. I also found it necessary to have an unconfirmed lesbian daughter quite offensive at the end. I just can't understand how this film was so popular at film festivals. It's undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
