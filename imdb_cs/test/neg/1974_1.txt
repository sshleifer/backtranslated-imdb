This cozy Mediterranean sitcom has become a major hatred of a new breed of talented comedians in the 1980s, such as Ben Elton. Do they deserve such anger? Terry and June were never smart, it was never a well-written story with different threads that intersect at the end. It was a show that your mother and father watched and probably grandparents. They laughed rather than laughed, but they were never likely to be offended by the show, so the fact that they never thought is insignificant. Be just another Terry and June. A few days after Terry Scott's death, the episode was broadcast on terrestrial TV, and it was her last trip. There were a few show repeats on any television channel. Fortunately, TV Comedy progressed from Terry and June. It's Hard to Find Words for Him - Terry Scott used weak scripts.
