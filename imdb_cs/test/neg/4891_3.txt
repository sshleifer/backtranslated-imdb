Looking and sounding like cheap porn without sex, it's the first of an impressive series of stinking producers (or in this case director) Geoffrey Reeve. And it's a doozy. Laughter at almost every level. Some government agents (I think) in Amsterdam are "professionally murdered" and considerably less than Interpol's charismatic wood blocking agent (who assures you) is not named Louis Salinger) is sent to the investigation by going a lot, to ensure that taxpayers get their money for tickets so they can shoot on the spot. They want hard-hitting drug attitudes and the depiction of prostitution had to look sadly outdated before the celluloid was dried, but the scenario is at least very willing to explain exactly what's happening regularly in a horribly devised diregion ("Did you watch him? No one outside of Washington knows you're here!", yet the story remains confusing. At a time when the sinister Vladimir Putin looks for Priest (not less than Kronsteen from Russia with love), your pulpit to deliver a sermon that your brain will turn off, which is unfortunate because we miss our hero - clipped to the land during the fight - trying to reach the wooden board just to later realize that he is actually sitting on a charged pistol, and shouted, "You bastaaaarde!" at his murdered dead boyfriend and leather, moustachioed go-go boys, morris dance and merry torture sequences - all that provide plenty of laughter. only reindeer climactic boat chase. It's an exciting, well-directed sequence that really has no place in this film. Such a glaring anomaly is explained when credits roll - Reeve had nothing to do with this sequence! Fortunately, everything goes back to the store as usual for a ridiculous, spit-out-your-drink twist and warehouse shootout. If such horrible things as Geoffrey Reeve complete exist - and you are one of them - I wouldn't bother with this instantly forgotten nonsense.
