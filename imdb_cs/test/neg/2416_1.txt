There are good bad movies and bad movies and nice bad movies ... it's not one of them. This is a movie that doesn't realize how bad it is. I've seen it at a screening on November 14, 2006 at the New Beverly Theater in Los Angeles as part of the "Grindhouse Cinema" program this theater is building every month. Hopefully moderators Eric Caiden & co. He will think twice before letting writer / director Lawrenece Foldes anywhere in the neighborhood again. What a man. The guy got up to talk in front of the movie - you think it was Orson Welles who talks about "Touch of Evil" or some other lost classic. Hardly. It's nice to have 20 minutes of viewer time with its discontinuous ranting. "Young Warriors" has been described as a cross between "animal house" and "deadly wish", but if you expect something in the spirit of imitation as "revenge of fools" or "exterminator" "you will be in one sad disappointment . The script has no meaning. The direction is so bad that the actors looked embarrassed and what can you say when the best thing about the movie is to watch the car blow up? Poor Richard "Shaft" Roundtree. In this film, he plays another character with the first name "John", but this is probably the only similarity his character has to the above-mentioned classic. I hope this movie allowed him to pay the rent for another month. Other actors who seemed to wish they were anywhere else, including Ernest Borgnine and Lindy Day George. This is a complete waste of time. Even the audience did not appear (except for one spazz-boy seated in the back who was shouting "whoa" every five minutes and his girlfriend who giggled with the zeal of the lobotomized talking Barbie every time he opened his mouth). <br /> <br /> For real vigilance movies, I would recommend the following: <br /> <br /> I wish I, II, III, Exterminator I, Vigilante Force, Ms. 45, Rolling Thunder, No-Mercy Man (the second is a few of the films presented at this theater a few years ago - probably the same budget as "young warriors", but both were a million times better!)
