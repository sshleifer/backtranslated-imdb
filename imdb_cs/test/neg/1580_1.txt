I watched this movie a while ago and the only thing I remember about the movie is how utterly awfully bad it was in my 5 worst films I've ever seen. And I think I had to convince my friends to get this movie on the video store, my reputation was shot, because my friends will trust me again - I doubt they always say they don't judge their cover, they were right when I saw a cover on skins / gang boys I thought wow it looks great as it had a load of head skin on the front running riots with metal bars.Don 't WATCH THIS FILM.i can't think of anything else to say it's that bad behavior The story is bad.
