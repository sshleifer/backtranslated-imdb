About Your Horrible Beethoven Copy Movie. As a professional musician, it is my duty to watch every film about a composer and Beethoven is one of my favorites. When Hungarians and Americans meet, it is a terrible combination of void over the highest emotions combined with the worst possible taste. You did it in your terrible b-movie. The only thing that carries the film is music. Of course, you didn't bother to look beyond the good, but in my taste it was the performance of the Tackacs quartet, but OK I must admit that the performances are at least of the quality, unlike the movie you did. It starts with the dying DEAF Beethoven, who perfectly understands Anna, who just whispers. Beethoven's hearing during the film is one minute better, but it must be due to some vague divine matter. Then there is a pretty impossible semi pornographic "eyes closed" double lead scene that is absolutely above the summit with seductive Anna and the weeping nephew at the end (which also cries in erased scenes with constant red eyes, my God what performance). And as the climax of the rip-off from Amadeus, with Beethoven dictating Anna's music is not in the notes but in sheer nonsense she understands perfectly, but no one else in your audience or trained professional musicians will understand. Of course, your reaction will be that the negative reaction is at least the answer, but I can assure you that Beethoven is turning in his grave because of his worthless creation and reason. This so-called homage is blasphemy and I'm sorry to rent one of the worst movies I've ever made, even if it's my favorite subject. Ed Harris and others can't understand Beethoven's size in your wildest dreams and certainly not after a few lessons in conducting and playing the violin. This is a problem with you Americans: you think you can understand everything, even if it takes a lifetime of hard work. Yeah, we can do it anyway! Remember that a good product comes with hard work, talent, dedication and professionalism. All these Beethoven copy makers are missing. See you in kindergarten.
