Paul Naschy's unparalleled horror movie icon gives Spain his talent for this fun, if not scattered, film. What starts as an action movie ends with a horror story. All I can say is just sit back and enjoy the ride. Paul Naschy plays a cold-blooded hit-man hired by some shady Japanese diamond hunters (one of whom is his flame carrying his baby) throwing away a jewel of diamonds from a Belgian businessman. When it comes to deed, the appeal of diamonds is too tempting for Paul to reject, so he kills his Japanese cohorts. His girlfriend, whose brother Paul killed, promises revenge and chases Paul through the woods, shoots him and leaves him dead. However, Paul is found egghead with two horny daughters and brought to his estate to recover. At the estate, two daughters, Silvia Aguilar and Azucena Hernandez, fight for Paul in his weakened state, with busts of Silvio Aguilar deciding not to get lost on the sweet and primitive Azucena. But Mr. Naschy is getting furry things that begin to see the daughter's daughter's ghost on the property. A couple with a Japanese bitch who wants to finish Paul's killing job and gets on two sides. STORY: $$ (The story goes in a number of ways and not entirely satisfying.) The scenario builds a fight for Paul among daughters, but Silvia, whose character seems assertive and unstable, simply lets Azucen win in tournaments Paul Naschy without fighting. Japanese Woman) <br /> <br /> VIOLENCE: $ (You get a weapon, a blown baby and pigs that live a poor schmuck. Gore hounds are not bouncing with this sudden movement of Nascha). >> (Nas Nas, as always, is fun to watch, but spends a little more time in bed, recovering from wounds. Playing with him again, they are seductive Silvia Aguilar and beautiful Azucena Hernandez, who has teamed up with Mr. Naschy in the small "The Craving" gemstone. NUDITY: $$$ (You get a very short look at both Aguilar and Hernandez, but are strategically placed to avoid any bits.) Two less attractive actresses add full nudity: Japanese woman chasing Paula and the African maid who works for Silvia and Azucen).
