Geesh, I never thought I'd write the four words above. But in fact, this is the pinnacle of this little movie. <br /> <br /> As the film was packed when I rented it, it's probably a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesn't have her medication that keeps her stable. It sounded like a cute concept. For years we've ever seen Spelling, Donna Martin was in 90210 and an endless show of dull, lifeless TV movies. It sounded like a chance to reach out a bit, and since she couldn't have had any financial reason to do with her television success and her rich dad, I realized she was taking it because it must be low. budget gem. <br /> <br /> Bad. Instead, Spelling is part is small, and a little bit about the mentally unbalanced victim is just one of several things. When not on the screen, the film goes so badly, I could swear it was longer than 85 minutes that were put on the tape. That would work much better if he spelled Spelling's story and turned into a romantic comedy with her and Phil, the least irritating kidnapper.
