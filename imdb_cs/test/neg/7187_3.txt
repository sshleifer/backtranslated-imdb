There is not much to say at the end. You could expect much more from a director who made better films in the past. It looks like he did it without really worrying about them. The actors do their job (though Belmondo is far from amazing), but you just don't get hooked. In a word, it's boring. This is even more disappointing because I have heard several times that this film can be considered a reaction to all the big American blockbusters, which for the French exception are regarded as a threat to those who simply cannot admit they should turn to another. work. I'm telling you, if it's the best reaction to get, boy, I'll be really depressed ...
