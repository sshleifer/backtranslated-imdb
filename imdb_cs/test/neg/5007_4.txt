What's wrong with CURACAO (also known as DEADLY CURRENTS, although the reason for changing the name is that I have no idea) may be summed up where a woman says to her lover: <br /> <br /> baby, I'm trying to sleep It is not a dialogue that is a problem, nor is the way it is published is the fact that the actress has a Central European accent. There's nothing wrong with this until her character from Philidelphia in the United States is revealed! What I was watching about this thriller while watching - The way accents don't match their characters. In addition to Philly, a German accent, we see a South African with an English accent, a local police boss who sounds like he is an Irishman who sets himself up as a Gestapo officer and the worst of all that George C Scott has played for someone who is either Dutch or British , with accent. it sounds like it might be an American-colored South Africa. Soon you give up what's on the screen, and finally focus on what kind of nationality a character might be caused by the strange way he speaks. It is interesting to note that this site did not give this film the country of origin. With so many different actors from different countries you feel that it was created by the United Nations <br /> <br /> Even if you are not curious about accents or dialects, you will have to give up this action as well because CURACAO is a smaller graph. Things happen like a ship that explodes, and the hostage situation and the hero is recruited as an intelligence agent in South Africa, but you've left a scraping head wondering what the hell it all leads.
