Last sequel to "airport". This has Alain Delon and George Kennedy (who was in all airport movies) as pilots; David Warner (!!!) as a radio engineer; Susan Blakely as a death journalist; Robert Wagner as a great scientist (stop laughing!); Eddie Albert as President of Airlines; Charo in a terrible "comic" piece; John Davidson as a journalist (like how his hair stays in place even after the plane turns upside down!); poor Martha Ray is humiliated; Cicely Tyson plays a mother who flies the heart for her dying son (stop your eyes!); Jimmie Walker as a clarinet player (what did I say we're not laughing?); Mercedes McCambridge as a coach of Russian gymnastics (OK you can laugh at); Bibi Andresson as a hooker and Sylvia Kristel and Sybil Danning as love interests. Just pathetic. Full of stupid conspiracy and dialogue that will yell at you - watch Davidson come to an end on the plane! Concorde takes all these people to Russia. They are attacked by missiles, escape, land safely in France and turn OFF the next day !!!! Don't you think the flight was canceled or something? Most Acting Is Awful - McCambridge is a look that looks at a red ghost wig and horrible false accents. The only good performance is from Kennedy and Delon (looking fantastic), which gives a very engaging performance. This is not enough to sit in this drive. Too long and lousy special effects. This was a mega-bomb and (fortunately) stopped Universal from doing anymore.
