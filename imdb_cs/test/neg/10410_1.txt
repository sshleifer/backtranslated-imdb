Are you kidding me? The music was on this SO LOUD show, which I could often not even hear. And the music was nothing big. Anyone who knows what Jake's mother said when he walked into the door ??? And the mushroom cloud looked pretty close to have such little immediate devastation. Anyone who examines the effects of nuclear fallout before this writes.

He was bored to tears and just woke up as the excited scream of an exaggerated path to loud music awoke.
