Ken Harrison, a young sculptor in his thirties, is seriously injured in a traffic accident. End of the story. <br /> <br /> "The End of the Story", meaning "the end of any physical action". Not in the sense of "ending the movie". Ken's life is saved, but he is paralyzed from his neck. When he finds it unlikely to ever use his limbs again, he decides he wants to die and asks the doctor to stop the treatment that keeps him alive. The rest of the film is basically one long debate about the rights and wickedness of euthanasia and the right to die. The main protagonist of Ken in this debate is his doctor Michael Emerson. Although the case against euthanasia is often presented for religious reasons, it is presented here purely secular. If Dr. Emerson has some profound religious beliefs, never expressed in the film. He believes passionately, however, that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a physician to fight; enabling the patient to effectively take his or her own life would be to surrender to that enemy and neglect this duty. Therefore, Ken found himself in a "Catch-22" situation. He must be able to prove that he is reasonable and rational enough to decide to end his life. But Emerson believes that the desire to die is in itself a proof of madness and irrationality. Ken's dilemma can only be resolved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospital. Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes, as Dr. Emerson, deftly and sincerely stood over his respective opinions, but that can't hide the fact that "Whose life is it?" it just doesn't work like a movie. At one time the filmed versions of theatrical plays were made in a similar way to theatrical productions, but by the 1970s and 1980s this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between these two media. When the games were filmed, the general tendency was to "open them" by filming on the spot, as well as on the studio scene, by making the freedom with the playwright text, often making significant changes to the plot and even adding more characters. Br /> <br /> I never saw Brian Clark's play, but I think it's a story that works better in theater than in a movie theater. There is very little physical action; Most of the actions lie in lengthy hospital bed discussions where the main character is paralyzed. Such a plot does not fit in with the "opening" device and the resulting film is very static, dominated by speaking at the expense of action. While it's well written and there are some good performances, I'm surprised that the movie was made of such an unforeseen theme. 4/10
