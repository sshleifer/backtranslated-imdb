One of the more prominent / popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. The red woman falls for Khan (instead of falling dead - for a change) and then continues to betray Kirk and Enterprise as if there were no ship loyalty. You are wondering what type of psychological tests this great fleet is supposed to use to test people for reception. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in "Wink Of An Eye" when a man in a red shirt takes an enemy side just because he falls in love! As in the SS. (However, in that episode betrayal plays a small part in the overall plot.) This is very stupid because it makes Kirk's crew again, as if it is a lot of soft, easily moving demons who - once they fall in love with the enemy - they are able to do anything. The fact that McGivers is returning to the Kirk side is not conducive to the illogic. Lord McGiveth and Mr. McTaketh ... <br /> <br /> Why is Khan being kept behind ordinary doors when he knows he has great strength? This is one of several devices that undermine Kirk's intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy's throat? If Khan is such an excellent intelligence, then he would be expected to be more willing in his own way. And what is playing with Sikha with the Latin accent? Montalban was to be equipped with a voice trainer. I was half expecting to hear "plaaain! Plaaaain!" in backround. Why the hell could Kirk (or any ship captain) use the ship's library without limitations about the innermost technical details of an enterprise for ANY? Is the Starfleet institution entirely composed of idiots? The SS is a very cartoon, stupid episode, so it's no wonder the Trekkies love it. It doesn't have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what Trekkies hates most. Also, the data the ST franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second film, so pleasing to the angry Trekkies, who were so disappointed with the first film that - as you guessed - had too much science fiction for average trifles. Trekkie brain.
