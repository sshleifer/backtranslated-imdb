Honestly, it's a very funny movie if you're looking for bad gaming (Heather Graham could never live like this ... has three titles because of - to protect guilt!), Beautifully Bad Dialogue ("Do you like ... ribs?" ), and a conspiracy just a mother could approve, this is your Friday night fun! My roommate rented it under the name "Scared" because Heather Graham liked it, but what we felt after the final credits was terrified. Not because the movie is scary, but because someone actually paid the money to make this turd on the film reel. Terrible movie. There are several no-name actors that provide some unintentional comedy, but nothing worth seeing. The dramatic climax of Heather Graham was also one of the most astonishing and busiest things I've ever seen. This film has no meaning, and God has mercy on his soul.
