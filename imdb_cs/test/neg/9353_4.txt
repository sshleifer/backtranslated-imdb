I saw this movie in 1956 and again on Cable a few days ago. The film has not improved with age. On the contrary, the opposite. It's a real spaghetti epic. Trojan horses are heroic and sympathetic; The Greeks are ugly, petty and insidious. So what if Paris ran away with the king's wife? Hey ... love is love.
