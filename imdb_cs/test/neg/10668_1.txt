If you feel Reshammiya as a singer is too much pain to watch on TV, try watching it in the movie for 2 hours straight. His face is dull throughout the film and is very comical to see him act challenging and intense scenes. This is far from a real love story (Get Spelling the Truth, Reshammiya - It's Not Luv or Reeal), and is complete with him doing Mithun da dance, auto rickshaw fighting scene, Himesh getting jailed, Himesh accused of murder, fleeing prison etc If you want a good laugh, there's nothing like that, especially where the howling in Mehbooba is. If you despise nasal bursts and want to learn from curiosity what two hours Reshammiyy can do for you, then don't miss this movie. <br /> <br /> I couldn't stop laughing from start to finish ending. The only saving mercy this film has is cinematography, location, and a few songs. Even then, until you are a strong Reshammiya fan, avoid this movie at all costs.
