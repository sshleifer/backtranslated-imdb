Tamara Anderson and her family are moving again because her traveling painter is haunting her next country. Fifteen years is in a rebellious phase. Her anger is already angry with her father for her frequent relocation when her mother suddenly confines herself to a tuberculosis sanatorium. The absence of her mother causes Tamara to break away from her father and seek relief in religion, next to the boy, Rusty, as well as the spirit of a dead teenager who was in her rented house. <br /> <br /> The story is modest to error. It is strangely stimulated, and even during its emotional scenes there is no tension. Actors showing parents are fine. Alberta Watson is incredibly charismatic as a sick mother and Maria Ricossa is especially effective as a mother who is a blame-ridden mother of a dead teenager. But Katie Boland, like Tamara, is too amateur to carry a movie. Dialogue is very natural and Boland can't pull it out completely. He has his moments, and when he hits them, he may be good, but he has been many times when she has been embarrassed. One can see her thinking 'ok, that's what my line is, and that's the face I should have done' rather than actually responding to other actors. It's not the only one, Kevin Zegers as Rusty and Megan Park, because his sister Brenda also suffers from a stuck birth, but at least they're in fewer scenes. <br /> <br /> If done correctly, the script could do it. influencing film. And it has moments, but many of them are involved with amateur performance and overhead.
