I had no chance to see the previous film, but from what I read on other posts, it was allegedly worse than this, even though I doubt it. I am a huge fan of the "Zombie" genre and I am fascinated by the psychological aspects of observing creatures that are for all human purposes and purposes, like the cruelty that is only worth shooting in the head. That means HOTD 2 takes "Zombie" to a whole new minimum. <br /> <br /> Without any big spoilers (which I should do just because you don't bother wasting your time watching this movie). ) I would like to express my utter disdain for how the writers of this film portray our countries of Special Forces. Gomer Pile might have survived longer than "Spec Ops" in this movie. For loud calls, they should instead call them special pedagogical forces. If you are going to write a script in which to send an elite team to deal with a zombie outbreak, at least the soldiers must be smarter than dead corpses. I understand you have to kill some or most of the team, but you can find better ways to do it than to have their machine guns and go for something to float. and further in the corner of the dark haunted basement. In fact, writers are trying to take the whole zombie thing to a higher level because it is a virus that is looking for a vaccine, and the idea has merit if it has not caught itself in the middle of such a ridiculous expression of gradual filming. I think to come, zombie movies aren't exactly "high art", and the viewer expects some tongue-in-cheek kits along with gore and excitement, but HOTD 2 is the type of cheese that makes the channel in disgust and horror of sheer stupidity characters. If you are a zombie movie fan like me, please do yourself a favor and stay away from this.
