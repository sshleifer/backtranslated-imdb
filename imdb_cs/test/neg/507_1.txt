See you. What worried me the most? An extremely long dance scene in the beginning watched people turn so much that I was dizzy ... Without showing where the music came from ... All of the college studies that had nothing to do with the rest of the movie . Or maybe it was the fact that every scene lasted fifteen minutes longer than they had to. What move is the movie. And the most unpleasant aspect is that the militants are so bad, so obviously horrible that it seems like the director did this film for the other graders. "These people are bad ... These people are good". Whenever the movie has its program on my sleeve, I'm side by side. There's a scene in a slippery ice rink that seems to be absolutely in place. Long stretched love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute who looks more like a rock star and his sexy band. John Hurt's character, who is part of a long scene, drinks and disagrees with remake of the bad guys. His deadly scene could be the dumbest in history. And I hear that everyone, even the hatred of this film, talks about how beautiful cinema is. I think it looks faded. Watch "Days of Heaven" if you want to see beautiful backyards. This film is even worse than anti-hype. It's useless. The epilogue, showing the main character on the yacht, was almost as stupid as the prologue. Battle scenes are tiring and dizzy. This movie is really bad. Avoid if you don't love bad movies because it's king.
