This must be Steven Segal's worst movie I've ever watched (even worse than eco-piffle like On Deadly Ground & Fire Down below). I'll start with good points ... It's a stylish direction for the DTV movie and has a wonderful scene ... That's it! The story is not really anywhere, it's just a series of well-staged pieces just so seagal go shoot bad guys (the number of bodies can easily match Tarantino at his bloodiest!). The storyline is unnecessarily complicated and confusing when you forget who they are good and evil. Negotiations (I use this term freely) is, at best, average, sea-going ONE constipation expression and wooden play that I can take, but others, especially the British, were all right terrible. <br /> <br /> What's in the package? Why are they after that? Is seagal set? <br /> <br /> WHO ARE AS ***! <br /> <br /> When I rented this movie on a local blockbuster (as soon as I paid), the assistant laughed at me and said it was the worst movie in the store I could pick up! (I felt like I hit him when my hand dulled) <br /> <br /> Anyway, I haven't seen Half Past Dead or Out for killing and I dare not go back to the next humiliation in my store, but they can't be anyworse than this turkey <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is supposed to be young and hips - that just gave me a suuden urge to half a dozen asprins. <br /> <br /> All in all this is Seagal's WORST! Whoever has gained about 100 pounds and looks good around him, he is a man who simply does not have when he is to stop, he should retire neatly NOW! and go to the camera or become a martial arts teacher or something. <br /> <br /> My 2/10 rating (1 point for scenery)
