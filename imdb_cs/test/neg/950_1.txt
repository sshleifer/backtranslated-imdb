I saw this movie a while ago and I was looking forward to it. My biggest problem was seeing the trailer I was expecting a very stylish marshal art movie with plenty of action and maybe a little conspiracy to think about the trip. I was very disappointed because it would seem that once you have seen the trailer, nothing else is worth watching (if what you expect is as described above). My girlfriend surrendered halfway along the way, and while I continued to watch the hope that something interesting might happen ... nothing. I found no connection or real interest in any character. I'd say don't bother if you don't have a few hours of your life that you really don't care about the loss.
