A woman who is so rich that she is insecure has a history of alcoholism and a nervous breakdown, which has undoubtedly helped the spoken gigola spouse openly cheating on her. Nobody naturally believes her when she claims he was circumcised by a giant man who stepped out of a giant satellite. Much to her husband's joy, this may be an incident that eventually puts her away for good. Since the opening of the scene, with its ridiculous news and ridiculous satellite meeting, you'll probably believe that the only value of this movie is that it's so bad that it's funny. Although it's not too far from the brand, it's definitely not true. Unlike most of the genre's films, it is neither a sci-fi nor a horror movie, but a serious drama that intelligently includes a science fiction scenario. It's not a good or even average drama, but it will exceed your expectations if you do not expect any legitimate drama at all. The action is surprisingly good for such a low budget effort, and most importantly, it is well edited and excellently stimulated. They are never bored and they can create more than little interest in what comes next. However, it is still a film strictly for those who cannot pass the chance to see a film from the fifties with a title like "Attack of 50 Feet Woman"!
