This film was a complete boredom from start to finish. Okay, so I greet Boorman for arousing worldwide recognition of Burma events, but that's all he can do. About 10 minutes into the movie I thought, "Oh no, here we go again", and I could tell you exactly what will happen in the next 80 minutes or so. Patricia Arquette was in such a role beyond her depth and her actions were wooden and unconvincing. Keep in mind that you are saddled with so much conventional scenario, maybe boredom, and it reflected on the screen. A lot of the movie was just ridiculous. In one stage Arquette's older companion is shot and he is a prostate on the ground. In the next scene he sprints through the forest, apparently trying to break the world record of 100 meters! - Or maybe he's trying to escape from Boorman. If you find it hard to sleep one night, then play Beyond Yangon on the VCR and you'll be snoring in no time. Very rarely do I criticize a film as strongly as it does in this case, but in this case it is quite justified.
