what happened to Mathew Modine ??? I still remember when he was considered a list of actors ... <br /> <br /> it was a sharp island last nail in the coffin of a once-promising career ??? wow, this guy really has to hate Renny Harlin's courage ... <br /> <br /> This movie wants to be a comedy, but it can't laugh, characters are cartoons and badly built on this ... but still what makes me the most worried about seeing Mr. Modin, who takes on this kind of role, alongside actors so far from his caliber, I think at a time when he made films like BIRDIE, he could never have imagined in the worst nightmares that he would act in the movies with hick, who has a cow that just had her anus closed, and maybe the worst, next to Elizabeth Berkley !!!
