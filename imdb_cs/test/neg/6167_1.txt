The most predictable movie I've ever seen ... very boring, I feel like I've seen a hundred movies with the same story as this one. The deal is at best, there is no action and no excitement. Capable actors with a terrible scenario, I think it could be written better by a 10th grader. I felt more than looking at it because I was hoping that there would be something in this movie that would separate it from all the other trash, but right on the heap. The whole movie I was waiting for, but never came. I never rate movies and never rate movies, but this movie was so bad that I had to sign up here and send a review to try to save a few poor souls from losing time (and / or money) with this movie. I was pirating it and I wish I never lost my hard drive space. If I spent $ 10 to see it in theaters, I'd kill myself.
