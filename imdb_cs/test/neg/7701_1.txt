Want a great recipe for failure? Take a lousy, left-wing political story, add some weak and undeveloped characters, and then throw in the worst sequences the movie has ever known. Leave the soul for a week (the amount of time spent on this waste). The result is Steal This Movie, a cinematic experience that takes bad movies to dangerous and exotic low places that have never been introduced. . This movie totally threw the pieces on his face for the duration of his run. Words can't tell how painful it was to watch. This is not one of those bad movies that you and your friends can sit and make fun of. This is not "Plan 9 of Space". It's a long, boring and sad waste of time. 'Steal This Movie' is the greatest waste of energy and talent I've ever seen. It depresses me when I realized that people * actually * took the time out of their lives to act in this class if you can call it “acting”. But then again, when you are wrong, wrong writing, bad EVERYTHING - "playing" is the last thing you criticize. This film is like a huge, disgusting disgust that you want to quickly flush out of existence, fear that a friend or loved one can see it somehow. I really wish I could somehow destroy every copy of this film so that it doesn't pollute the minds of the beginning filmmakers. Thank you, Robert Greenwald, for giving me a new respect for every other movie I've ever seen. You showed me what's really awful and why I should appreciate all the movies that are just lousy and / or boring.
