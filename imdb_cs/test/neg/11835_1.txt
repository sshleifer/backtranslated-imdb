Why is this film not 100? The Raptor is undoubtedly the worst movie I've seen in all my fifteen years of life. I've never witnessed such a catastrophic disaster. Absolutely everything that is on it is embarrassing and cheap. Nobody in the cast gives a decent performance. The dialogue is totally incoherent and humor is nothing but funny. Corbin Bernsen was the most painful part of the whole thing. I can't help thinking of some of his lines, like "In or out? You're worse than a cat!" and "Your friend is not a very good poker player. She just exposed her hand." Predators are a joke. I could even make more realistic dinosaur effects than these filmmakers had done blatantly. It's an insult to real velociraptors or any dinosaur. Not only that, but the killing scenes are too terrible for me. I don't think these animals would tear their sacrifice and scatter pieces around the country to make everything look worse. In addition, blood and intestines are useless when you see deaths coming from miles and miles away. I'm a big fan of Jurassic Park and dinosaur movies. Perhaps the filmmakers did not anticipate anyone with a bit of intelligence or sense to ignore the bad movie making to hit HBO late at night, like me. If I could say one thing to anyone who participated in this film, I would have to quote Dr. Alan Grant of the first Jurassic Park ... <br /> <br /> "Just try to show some respect."
