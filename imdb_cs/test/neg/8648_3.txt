A special unit of four police detectives issues justice in its own unique way in the 1950s in Los Angeles. Nick Nolte stars as Max Hoover, Head of Unit and his partners play Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. They also play Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich. Pretty impressive list of names. Unfortunately, this is the only thing that is impressive on this film and remotely. Our story begins when Connelly, a young Allison Pond, appears dead in a remote area of ​​the city currently under development. Our group of four detectives is called and it is immediately clear that Nolte's Max Hoover will have a very personal interest in this case. We will soon discover that Allison, apart from knowing well about Hoover, has also been involved in some important military and governmental types who have reason to want her dead. But who exactly was that and why would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead? Hoover and the crew decided to find out. It sounds like an interesting assumption, but unfortunately it does not go anywhere. Despite the impressive array of names, acting here leaves much to be desired. Nolte is exaggerated, Madsen seems incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich are leaving as cartoons, Penn hardly has anything to do and Griffith is as boring as he can be. By far the best performance is Connelly in all the fleeting flashback sequences. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. The sense of drama you would expect from a secret of this type is missing completely. Nothing dramatic really happens. In fact, there seems to be nothing going on for most of the picture. Instead, we only slog towards a rather ridiculous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the "mystery" is resolved, you may say, "Come on, is it all there?" But it is worse because after solving the mystery we get an absolutely absurd and absolutely incredible action sequence. And yet, in the end, we suffered, because another terrible, bad act, a totally useless scene, is at the end. And then it is mercifully over. And not too soon.
