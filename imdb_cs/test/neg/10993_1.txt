One of the worst movies I've ever seen in 2009: The Tale Is Between a Stupid Thriller or a Silly Comedy. As it happens, emptiness is full of long, boring dialogues that don't make sense! The cast is famous, but it doesn't bring any emotions except for a fast forward! And that's what happens in a luxurious seaside hotel that looks really grim. Compared to that "Shining" is a funfair! NB: Many users think they are on the French Riviera! They are wrong! It's not southern France (Nice, Cannes), but absolutely the opposite: Cabourg and Normandy, which are plain D-Day beaches! Therefore, the sea is as gray as the sky and not the sun!
