... this just isn't worth the movie ticket. What these creators have done cannot be properly called filmmaking; rather, they only chose sixteen students of any variety (though not quite the diversity as reviews suggested) and set them free. The results are to be brutally honest, much more boring, confident, overworked, and shyly grainy than really sharp. Of course there are moments of recognizing and identifying the species only possible in documentary film, but overall there is not much more truth than in "Bully" or in this case a decent TV document of the same kind. Although the film is full of sex and sexual diversity and racism, it does not bring anything to the table that could be useful to anyone who has thought of any of these problems with any seriousness. And while some segments do not serve any purpose other than injecting a little (certainly welcome) comic relief, most often the five-minute limit keeps pace with becoming emotionally involved in any of the students. An interesting idea but thumbs down for CHAIN ​​CAMERA.
