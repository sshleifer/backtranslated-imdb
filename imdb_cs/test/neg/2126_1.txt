What could go wrong with a movie that contains a lot of Italians who pretend to be Flords, and some vague lava-octopus-crustacean-like hell-induced devil-devil-fish?!?! Everything is what goes wrong I'll tell you! This is a very good episode of MST3K, because hail on the ball, which without error is easy to do, because this film is a piece of junk with a miserable and boring plot. <br /> <br /> 9/10 for MSTied. 1/10 for un-MSTied version. <br /> <br />
