Yes, we all know the strange little fascination of Dan Schneider when we make shows with young children and iCarly is no exception. Look at young girls who shook their toes and stuck their tongue out on the camera and wore modest clothes and bikinis. Yes, you are wondering if these shows were made for teens or for some older degenerate crowd. Either way, the show is not so good compared to other Dan Schneiders shows, such as the far better Amanda Show & Drake and Josh. The show is that brother and sister (Carly and Spencer) live alone and have to get alone when their father is in the army and their mother is strangely absent from their lives. Carly has an average temperament friend named Sam and makes a very well-made, award-winning iCarly show with her little Freddie school friend. Episodes deal with their lives in and around the web show and their hi jinx in school. Carly Shay is young, everyone knows web personality / business woman / producer played by Miranda Cosgrove, a young actress who relies on speaking very loudly and quickly getting her point across and making strange faces. Her brother Spencer is a somewhat temperamental, stupid and eccentric artist playing Jerry Trainor, who is struggling to be like Jim Carrey and whose comedy style seems to be aimed at a young male audience who wants it. humor type Joey Gladstone. Then there is Sam Puckett, unlikable, meaning a small, lying thief fratra who needs to adjust the attitude played by Jeanette McCurdy, who clearly wears hair extensions, as you can see when they disappear and reappear from the scene to the scene. And finally, Freddie Benson is on the web, showing a stupid cameraman and a technical adviser who has a big buzz on Carly, but apparently won't get anywhere with who plays Nathan Kress. Other secondary characters come and go such as Freddies's mother, Carly's grandfather, harassing teachers and many of their annoying little school friends to round off the cast. Most comedy is spirited spirits like tossing Lewbert Doorman as a gag, throwing a water balloon to the teacher and knocking on the table young scouts girls sell cookies. All adults look like complete idiots, while children are aware, and some main characters have absolutely no morals. Lying, cheating, theft and violence are acceptable in this children's show created and written by Dan Schneider, Yes ... it's a children's show! What more could young viewers want? Well, with Dan Schneider, we can expect young girls to dress in tight dresses and bikinis and do some weird things like pulling the camera out for the camera and eating bananas. Shows like a young crowd likes him and I think it's no worse than any other waste that shovels at a young crowd. There are always fans who find something to be seen on TV, at least a little better than most of the things Nick saw as the horrible Naked Brothers.
