I really wanted to see this movie - I thought the story was really unique and interesting. A cop (Andy Garcia) has a son who dies and needs bone marrow replacement to live. The only match is a convicted serial killer who escapes from prison. To save his son, he must track down the killer. Michael Keaton plays a condemned in one of the many unsatisfactory aspects of the film. Keaton is sometimes a great actor, but here he is pretty boring. It's over-the-top to the point where you just stop worrying. Garcia is better but trying too hard on a movie that's not up to par. Barbet Schroeder (suddenly such a promising director with films such as "Barfly", who had almost nothing on the US market) directs well - I honestly thought the script was the culprit ... it's just a big mess. Br /> <br /> The film wastes a lot of good stuff, good actors and a good director - all because of the wrong scenario. What was supposed to be tense and provocative is just a Hollywood action bagpipe.
