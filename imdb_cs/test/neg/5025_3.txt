Rossini once described the work of composer Wagner as "a wonderful moment ... and some terrible quarter-hour". Inuyasha seems to be described in this way as well. It has many great episodes, but among them are countless fill episodes. The whole series consists of about 175 episodes, of which I would say that at least 125 is a fill or some kind of subplot (I didn't bother to count and I wouldn't be surprised if this number was actually higher, though) Some of these filler episodes are actually quite enjoyable, though many of them are quite silly or boring. However, constant digressions begin to wear thin after the first few seasons as plots end up advancing at laborious passing for most of the series. Also, character development is slowing down considerably, and in later periods casting becomes immutable, resulting in increasingly outdated jokes (especially those involving the monk, whose ironic features are beginning to be slightly funny, but when they are related jokes) grow tedious) to repeat). However, all this does not mean that Inuyasha is a bad series. It just is not a great series, such as the Neon Genesis Evangelion, is generally considered. As something you look at at the end of a hard day, it's nice, but it's never to be confused with high art.
