That could be a good movie if more things were explained. Too many plot holes to find it nice. In particular, the end is outside the left field. SPOILER ALERT: How did the kidnapper return to Dundee so fast and Dundee appeared in the house in two minutes? Here's the way out. How did Anna get the money? No explanation at all. If Pete knew that Lancaster was in danger of not having a hospital hospital. This and many other questions remain. Too bad because there was an assumption, just bad writing and execution. <br /> <br /> Good casting is useless here. DeCarlo goes from bad to good to bad? Lancaster's character lacks development and Dureya is just like a "bad man". This could be done with a coherent story and better writing. Of course it would be much more violent with lots of gratuitous sex and everything. The cut would also be jerky, I think, so let's go well enough alone.
