This film has to go down in the history of bad movies as the worst I've ever seen. It wasn't even a bad b movie ... I'd rate him as z. Special effects were ridiculous ... to err if you could call them special effects. I think the reviewer before the nail hit ... it was the box that the movie sold, while the cover was great and the synopsis fascinating (which is why I rented it) was a waste of not only time but also money. I didn't last long. I took it back to the store and turned it off for another movie that I think the local video store took from the shelf because they had many complaints about this horrible movie. My 6 year old could do a better job shooting it / writing a script!
