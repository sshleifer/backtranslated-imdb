Oh my God! It could be a very interesting movie and it really is. I'd like to give him 5, but I give 2 for my voice. Why? I saw it in the theater! Check out this movie on DVD or TV! Shooting is really great !!!!! All the time she is constantly shaking, in a completely tasteless framing! It's really painful to see this very interesting movie in the cinema. You've got a fast sea sickness, and you have to make a huge effort to keep your neighbor down! It's really a shame because the story is being modified in a non-linear way, which is very rare for the documentary (and a very good idea!). Watch it at home!
