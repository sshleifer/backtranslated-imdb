I've never seen a movie so bad that I went crazy. It was a huge waste of time to see this crappy movie. There's a lot of things I hate about this movie: The songs are so horrible (even a little catchy) that I hit my head on the wall (especially from the song 'Grandpa will sue pants from Santa' which I hit 10 times * shrugs *) , character design, and that evil, greedy, and Bitchy cousin Mel. I can't stand it for one second, she must be one of the toughest people i 've seen. Even though I'm a bit like her southern voice. The only clear side is that Austin Bucks plays a person who is the voice of a liquid snake from Metal Gear Solid. <br /> <br /> I do not recommend people watch for holidays because it was a huge shame for x-mas.
