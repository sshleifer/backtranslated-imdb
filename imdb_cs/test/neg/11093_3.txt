With all the potential for a good film in its beautiful environment, cast and cinematography, this insignificant film script, lead pace, and wooden performance have produced only great disappointment. With a decent direction, editing, and musical score it could have been a good movie, maybe a dark version of Blake Edward '10 ', instead of the lewd version of' Splash 'by Ron Howard.
