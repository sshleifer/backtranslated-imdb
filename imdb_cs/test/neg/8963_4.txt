**** MILD SPOILERS _ KNOW PLOT **** <br /> <br /> A woman is raped and decides to take anger at all mankind. Did I mention that the rape victim was muted? That's a problem with MS 45, Thana's rape victim decides to kill a man, but some logical explanation? Surely the whole movie would have been better if we had Than to comment on why a man he encountered would explode? There's just not enough development on this land <br /> <br /> As you would expect from a Ferrara movie, it's not a complete waste of time. It's much better than I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and the pseudo intellectuals will have a field day pointing out the irony of a woman holding a knife like a penis when Thana kills in the end. But the scenario is somewhat stupid and underdeveloped and prevents any serious commentary that the film could make
