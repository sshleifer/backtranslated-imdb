The action scenes were pretty good. But the plot of the movie, I would have to give him a score of 1 out of 10. Does it seem that the producers and director of this movie didn't think about it carefully? It's not true • giving viewers many values ​​and values ​​except violence. The whole story was about revenge. A boy witnessing rape and murder. I would even recommend that it be banned. Those who watched you lost some money. If you're thinking about watching it, watch something else. If I was in the movies, I'd ask for a refund. So for you guys and girls out there reading this article. Don't waste your time.
