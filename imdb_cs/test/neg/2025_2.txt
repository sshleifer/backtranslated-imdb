Sophomore's effort by screenwriter Steve Tesich (to follow the wildly crowded BREAKING AWAY) is a collection of clich√©s, coincidence and dour melodrama. Maybe some of it lived; if so, I am sorry to say that he was inexplicably unable to dramatize any of it convincingly. Arthur Penn, a talented director who has done remarkable work in the past (BONNIE AND CLYDE, LITTLE BIG MAN), has not been able to bring any energy or verisimility into Tesich's narrative. The cast fights as best they can, but they are saddled with weak motivation and dialogue. Especially, Craig Wasson, whose annoying performance marks the impending rapid loss of his male career leader, as well as the embarrassingly unbound Jodi Thelen, who is poorly portrayed as an extremely improbable "femme fatale", should be sympathetic. Everything looks longer than it is, and all points are heavy and clear. See Arthur Penn on an earlier theme on the 60's, droll and elegance ALICE'S RESTAURANT; that's all this isn't.
