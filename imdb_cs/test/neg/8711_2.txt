The only reason I give the other star is for the first half of the movie. That was a good storytelling. I enjoy seeing a few fictional characters added to add some color to a well-known story. But the other half was terrible !!! Yes, there were violent aspects in this story. But the writers of this film have decided to include only violence and forget the good things God has done for the Israelites. Towards the end of the film, Scott looked as though he was receiving news from a large giant head instead of speaking and hearing from God. This rendition had some tremendous problems with font deviation. And a big surprise, no favorable deviations! Their portrayal of Moses as this screaming naked madman who has done all this against his will is absolutely false. It showed Moses who had to scream to talk to him. WRONG Scripture says that God spoke to Moses all the time and not just after excitement. They got people who complained, but they didn't show that God spoke to Moses in Sinai with an audible voice that the followers heard and believed (Chapter 19). They also forgot the fire pillar and the cloud that led them day and night. What was the whole thing of Joshua? A just peace loving a Jew who will not fight until Moses threatens him? WRONG (He was known as a great warrior) What did the great speech Moses gave the army to tell them that God had helped them and now they were alone? WRONG (They only won by God's help, as shown in their own scenes with Moses who picked up his staff) And what was the sorry looking Ark of the Covenant? Instead of overlapping with gold, this movie was on a solid budget and attached small gold tokens to it! Yeah, it was a "molten calf", not straw on which small pieces were attached. Someone forgot that they came from Egypt with a huge amount of gold tribute from the Egyptians. You wouldn't know of this sorry looking bunch. By the way, a part of them killing Israelites after the golden calf incident says "men" and doesn't mention women and children who film the audience. Oh yeah - Manna wasn't the only thing sent from heaven - don't forget the birds for meat. The Bible also mentions Jethro, who brought Moses to his wife and children, and then says that Jethro has returned to his country. It does not say that Moses gave up his family. Well, if you don't know anything about the real story, read the Exodus for yourself. If you know the real story, you will hate this version.
