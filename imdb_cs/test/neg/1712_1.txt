First, I would like to apologize for my rating of "1" ... The only reason I gave this movie such a high rating is that I can't dive into negative whole numbers. All "This is a spoof" musings aside, and when I definitely tried to give proper attention, he left me with some idea, namely; "This is perhaps the worst movie ever made." At any level and in any plausible quantification of qualitative measurement ... Seriously, I tried, as in every indie-born-for-cult-video-distribution movie as another buff but seriously, this movie sucked rhino balls ... Honestly, if I were to direct this "movie", I would see it as a legitimate cause of suicide.
