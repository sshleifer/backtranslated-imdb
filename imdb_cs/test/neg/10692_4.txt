I was looking forward to looking at the documentary self-destruction of the master behind Boondock Saints, one of the most attractive and pointless films I've ever seen. But the creators of "Overnight" - friends (ex?) Of the concerned master - must also learn how to make a film. Various harsh remarks, screaming obscenity on the phone and using his alcohol really make Mr. Duffy a putz. But it doesn't shed any insight into why this guy got a contract first, what his creative process or vision is - what is Boondock Saints at all? How hard is it to meet Patrick Swayze? What are these strange institutional machinations in which our disgusting heroes are caught? Since the film does not try to answer these questions in any comprehensive way, it does not mean that dippity-doo should also be talking about what it says about Hollywood. Who takes care?
