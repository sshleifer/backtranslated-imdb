Honestly, after the Cotton Club and Unfaithful it was a bit embarrassing to watch Lane and Gere in this movie because it's BAD. The negotiations were bad, the dialogues were extremely shallow and insincere. It was well shot, but then it's a big movie budget. It was too predictable, even for a chick. I even knew from the beginning that she would eventually die, all I didn't know was how. Too politically correct. Great disappointment. The only thing worth watching was the scenery and the house because it's beautiful. But if you want, follow national geography. I love Lane, but I've never seen her in a movie so miserable. As for Gere, he's a good actor, but he has such movies, so I'm not surprised. I wish I could bring you back for an hour and a half.
