In the 1940s, Veronica Lake made a meteoric rise to the movie Star, thanks to her sensual beauty and her highly exploited "peekaboo" hairstyle. She played against big names such as Alan Ladd and Fredric March, who have seen screen successes in films like "This Gun For Hire" and "I Married A Witch". She owned it with female stars and surprised her critics with her performance as a bitter navy sister in "So proudly we are a hail." But the changing times and its own failures caught up with it and ended its heyday by the end of the decade. With two unsuccessful marriages behind her (and the other two in her future), Veronica went to New York, where she sometimes appeared in front of the television and summer events before she was completely out of sight. It was a brief message when it was found as a bartender in the second hotel in the early 1960s. Now her longtime alcoholism and years of hard life have robbed her of her appearance. Without them, the public interest soon disappeared. She returned to the scene in a variety of vehicles, but her success was minimal. Eventually she moved to Miami, Florida, where she lived in relative confusion. In 1966 she went to Canada for a part in a dark movie called "Steps in the Snow" which had no American release. The following year, she was discovered by some industrial filmmakers who have long wanted to produce a commercial feature. They asked her to play in her movie "Time Is Terror" and convince her to invest in the project. As one author said: "If the movie queen ever suffered a terminal comedy, it was". Surrounded by amateur artists and pathetic production values, in Miami, Florida, she even died to a minimum. Poor Veronica, looking ordinary in long shots, and incredibly aging in close-ups, didn't do as much as a walk through her parts. As a frightened doctor who has hit a successful recipe for youth renewal, he used the magic of red fir meat, looks like a bored and confused, farewell to the moment he is forced to ad-lib while struggling with games to make rubber gloves. There is no help at all, only a conspiracy to speak to death. Director Brad Grinter apparently required the actors to move only when the camera was pointing at them, there was no need to remind them of fun (it is true that one unintentionally cheerful scene includes a private detective / sister and a carriage in front of a '') Bernie 's nearly 20 years.) According to Veronica, the film itself was postponed for three years because no footage was shot. But in the 1970s, the manufacturing company scratched it together, changed the name to "Flesh Feast", and delivered it to cash for just published Lake Biography. And because former leading ladies like Bette Davis, Joan Crawford and Olivia De Havilland unexpectedly revived their horror movie career, this travesty was promoted as Veronik's "comeback film". However, film directors may find themselves in a strange way because it is unlikely that a (young) audience will know who Veronica Lake is for this horror movie. As expected, it did nothing for Veronica's career, and died in poverty three years later. The previous reviewer cites a scene in which a female detective secret nurse as a nurse in a doctor's lab (overseeing the theft of a nearby mortuary) allows a gifted chauffeur to help cut up body parts. "Poor Mrs. Lustig," she sighs, "I hope she doesn't mind letting her body go to science." "Try not to think about it," he advises the chauffeur and leaves. "I think you're right, Hans." concludes the detective / sister: "What's going on is done." What a sad end to the career of still lovingly remembered stars.
