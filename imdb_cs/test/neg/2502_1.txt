Joe D'Amato may have made other notable films in his very long and very fruitful career-fruitful, of course, by turning making very cheap Z-grade movies in Italy a great boom exploitation in the late 1970s in the early 70s, but Porn Holocaust is not one of them, or at least should not be. It is true that I should not expect much of a movie with such a title, but I thought that given the back of the box description, it could have some fun horror scenes with "horny, mutant, cannibal zombies". The zombies turned out not to appear until more than half way into the movie, and on each turn we get instead of imagining how hard the hardcore scene is like hardcore. Which is fine. But it's not very enjoyable except for "what is *** *** it's a BS" way. There is a ridiculous dialogue that includes lobsters costing more from mail order Japan than in Paris, hot, slim women playing biologists and zoologists who have a special sexual hang-up (letting the door be unlocked to be raped, and a bi-polar type of fun out to get a gang -bouchl). It all goes all the way to the island, where the "main attraction" is a man who just initially spends completely pathetic (forget the ridiculous) a lot of time staring at newcomers to the radioactive wasteland of the Caribbean and once revealed He has a face like one of the guards in Jabba's Palace and has sweet potatoes for the main genitals. But much more stupid than anything before it is a "relationship" that develops between a monster and a dark lady who has a myriad of time to run, but just sits there, without a face, as the monster brings gifts and what must be racially motivated exploitation on the part of creators that the monster ONLY rapes and kills white women and not her. And of course it ends with a "happy" end. I use quotations, of course, from some shock that it could have any legitimate end at all. Bottom line, this is not what you might expect, as perhaps a bloody horror movie with lots of cheap but cold-looking Italian monster-zombies who eat the human body. If there is something that is violence in the film, it is done on a string; The log hit in the face is instantly cut to bloody aftermath, which as a result of a tomato hitting someone. So indeed, the last part of the title is intended for the market. Nevertheless, even as a porn movie it has little going on except as a reason for cast and crew to get paid vacation to the Caribbean (as the interview with George Eastman suggests, this was only one of the few express trains made while on the island). His work bought on camera and similar actors, filled with genitals about 3/4 of all time and with poor lip sync and music like Nino Rota forced on a rifle to do something in the broth, and it's a STILL piece of celluloid manure all the same; All of this could be an immense guilt of pleasure, but it is not so.
