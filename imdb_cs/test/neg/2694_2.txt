I saw this movie as a mysterious preview before opening Venice at the Telluride Film Festival. Your reaction to this will largely depend on your attitude towards respect for Shakespeare's text. On the plus side: Pacino gives very good performance as Shylock; Lynn Collins is great Portia; and the film has a luxurious look. Negatives are predictable. "The Merchant of Venice" is probably the hardest of all Shakespeare games on stage today, mainly because we look at him through the distorting lens of 20th century history. The romantic land with Bassania and Portia is no problem. Shylock does the character because we lack the original reference frame of the Elizabethan audience. At the same time, Shylock is a human character with human qualities and motivations and abstraction of the ruthless quality of the Old Testament. When he says, "Has not the eyes of the Jews?" it is a character; when he says "I will have my bond!" it is abstraction. The long passage of music and cosmic harmony in the final scene (here moved and cut into ribbons) is the key to the game, in that it restores universal harmony after destructive and evil forces (Shylock trial scenes). out. It is possible to make a psychological sense for Shylock by showing his gradual insanity and turning into a monomaniac at a time when the trial scene is rolling - the key is that the moment he must stop being compassionate. Pacina's performance almost does, but not quite. The film cannot think of its mind - on the one hand, there is a proper movement in Shylock's character, and on the other hand there is a large number of strange images of Jews being abused and Venetian whores with rough nipples (undoubtedly show decadence Antonio et al). Shakespeare did not write Ibsen-like social drama; he wrote a comedy based on the classic pattern of disruption of social order and the restoration of the social order symbolized by marriage, with the theme of love versus law in the center of the Shylock conspiracy. The point is that the film is travesty - Radford's operation on the game and direction almost compels us from what the game really means. (Given the beginning of the final scene, we cut most of it and move it to the test scene, it's the most extreme example.) There are other serious problems. Jeremy Irons, a great actor, plays Antonio as if he was an overdose of sedatives. Joseph Fiennes is handsome but shallow as Bassanio. Most actors, with the exception of Collins, Pacino and the actor playing Duke in the rehearsal scene, mutter their dialogue. <br /> <br /> Final verdict? Nice movie with some decent shows. It's not Shakespeare, it's a bad interpretation. It's not really worth your time or money - though Lynn Collins as Portia almost redeems it.
