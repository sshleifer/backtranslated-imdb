There are many questions about the creation of this film. The first is: Why make a film that is little more than a freakish female fantasy? One thing is to let the audience have problems discussing the film's intent, it's completely different than going into a script writing process that fails to adequately address real human issues before they are displayed on the screen. Why blatantly melodramatic and often comic soundtrack? Why excessive and often clunky dialogue? Why is the lead character of a girlfriend one of the kidnapper hoods? What is the purpose of getting the leader to rid himself of kidnapping by completing his "mission"? (This is the classic moment of Little Aussie Film. Resort for unpredictable comedy at the right moment.) Why so many scenes where nothing happens? (This corresponds to approximately 15 minutes of film, which is at least 30 minutes too long.) Why, if a person is imprisoned for so many days, doesn't he try to escape? The director who wrote the screenplay failed in many ways to give a satisfying story. Dave Garver, Australia.
