I bought this DVD just because it was cheap and it was interesting in its special way ("special" meaning "retarded"). The film turned out to be quite uninteresting - boring camera work, nothing really drives the story and of course acting is terrible. It wasn't even "bad" in the camp - it was just bad. In fact, there are several large lines of dialogue, but for the most part it is embarrassing and weak. The only thing I could think of was that it could be a good movie if the screenplay made a major overhaul (if someone who really understands the drug culture wrote it) and if decent actors were cast. I wouldn't recommend "Weekend with Babysitter" if you plan on a career in the movie and want to learn what to do in the movie.
