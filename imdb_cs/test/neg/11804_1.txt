The characters are annoying, immature and scaly ... Madison is the most annoying. OOH ... cool place! Such a terrible threat! Some ghost in that house would run away in self-defense! If you want a long story short, this movie is boring. Seeing a chair flying across a room can be scary, but it's as interesting as it goes. I watched it once, and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again, I was tempted to take a baseball bat to the television before I watched this waste. If you want a good horror movie or even a comedy that's bearable, it's not so! The only good part of the whole thing was the "cockroach scene" and you ended up sorry for the cockroach until the end of the movie!
