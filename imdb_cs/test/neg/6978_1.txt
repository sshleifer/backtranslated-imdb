This film is an abomination to everything worthy of film. The leading actor will surprise his audience by not actually acting at all. We have to watch for almost two hours of his bleak mindless face. The jokes are all lame that I was never allowed to be when it was Saturday night, there were 5 of us with beer laughing and then we got it and you felt the warmth and color go out of the room. The film ended and the mood was destroyed, so we all went on our way, destroying the night! OK, so the pros and cons. Pros beautiful surroundings in Hawaii, looks good on blur. Disadvantages of worst behavior at all; you can say that everyone interested is just thinking about paycheck. Predictable Bad Chart. Zero Character Development. Forced jokes that fall straight. Many shots of penis boys to be fair work better than him and have more charisma. May all filmmakers hang their heads in shame and keep their flabby men cheap.
