I saw the movie after checking its rating on IMDb. At that time it was 8.0 and I thought "wow! That must be good". I was wrong. The beginning of the film actually holds what the plot promises, but then it goes exponentially down under its cellar. I think that without Richie Nix's character, it might have been okay - though that's why the story is based on the course he does. The character is too extreme for my hobbies and hard to endure. Also, the main character's journey lasts from the beginning of the story until his "climax" in the end is partly irrelevant and could be easily omitted - the alternative is that I didn't understand the movie. Although I have to admit that it is "easy to follow" and I had no problems with sitting around the film, when I was done, I was somewhat fearless to the end. All in all, rather average.
