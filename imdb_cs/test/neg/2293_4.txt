Swedish film splatter? Is it a world crazy? Probably not, but these days there is still no common view of Swedish gore flicks, it seems that the b-film business in Sweden is having trouble these days, long gone. golden days "Rymdinvasion i lappland". And it seems that this movie has its own problems: it's too many words, still getting a little funny mainly for good FX, which is great for b-movie. The script and most of the acting is still pretty bad, but it doesn't really matter, it should be a flick and nothing more, that's a little bad for some reason. There's not enough blood to fill the void. Anyone who knows about Gert Fylking will laugh at his role as sgt. although. I almost laughed. It's really so bad. <br /> <br /> In addition to the good parts I have mentioned, there is nothing else to suggest here unless you are hungry for Swedish B-movies. <br/> <br/> 4/10
