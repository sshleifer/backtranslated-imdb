Man, I went to this movie because of the big preview. It seemed to have a great story and nice special effects. The boy was wrong. I wanted to go out of the theater because of the terrible special effects. A cartoon dino, card board would do an even better job than that. The story was fine if a big film producer took him. Who would throw in some extra money to make the effect more life. The only thing I liked about this film is where plants appear everywhere. Worse still, when cars, in a scene, 2 characters walk down the street. If you look at those cars, you will see the following: Taxi, car, motorcycle, tri-pod, big bus. And about four times in a row! And then there is the "death of the butterflies" that would shift the whole "developmental development". If this guy didn't climb the butterfly, another dino would have eaten him anyway! So this is an absolute bull. If you change something in the past, the future will be different. Not in the "time waves" they created. But hey, if the future changed in a fraction of a second, the film would be worse, but more realistic. That's just one of those movies you should see when you want to have a big laugh. I spend a lot of money on this movie in the theater. And then they told me that this movie had a budget of $ 80 million. WHERE ALL THAT ARE MONEY?
