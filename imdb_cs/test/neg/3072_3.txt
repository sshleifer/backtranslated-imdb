Grapes. There's no way to get around him. A scenario at the level of one of the Mexican soap operas, the selection and use of filming sites that make the film a labyrinth and at the same time repeated and monotonous, with catastrophic performances of almost the entire cast. Links to Tarantino's work, so poorly done, are more insulting than anything else. I think it wasn't for the shameless and conspiracy unrelated to the exploitation of Matad's generous curves, no one would have to try to watch this movie in any theater. These are the films that make me no desire to watch Portuguese cinematography.
