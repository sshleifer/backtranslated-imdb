Oh my God!!!! This was the first movie Broken Lizard made as a group (although it was recently came to video), and I have never been more disappointed in my whole life !!! I'll tell you what if I saw this movie before I saw Super Troopers (which by the way is A $$ !!!) I would never see it !! I read a few reviews online, as well as on the DVD cover that burned it like being the "funniest movie Broken Lizard!" If they were talking about Super Troopers as their funniest movie, I'd agree with nonstop, but not with this one. Talk about drought. It took the film 45 minutes to even get it, and then I was so out of mood to watch it wasn't worth it. Maybe you have to be tall to make it really funny? I don't know. I love those guys, really, but the movie is by far the worst they've done. Club Dread was a pretty good movie, but this one, just wow. I highly recommend Super Troopers if you want a good laugh, but if you want more romance, drama, with some fun places, I'd say go with Puddle Cruiser. Just my opinion, everyone has the right to their own! :)
