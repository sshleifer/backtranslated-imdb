I'll write more because it's necessary. However, the summary I mentioned above is too complex for what this film was. You know who's from the beginning. Despite attempts to conspire and turn - an active "talent" that tries to look shocked and shocked when it happens, you never have to wonder "whodunit" in this "mystery". <br /> <The more I write, the more I feel bad, I have to write so much to write a comment, but the rules are rules. I really feel bad when I say it, but this is the lowest I've ever rated a movie ... I think. That interests me what I save voices 1 and 2 for. But I thought this film deserves 3 because I believe there was some talent in the movie. Johanna Watts (or Watson) did a pretty good job. She cried and excited in one part, and I thought it was a good emotion. The man who played the character who was a "drummer" also did well for his short part. Many actors have done "ok" work. But the main actor, David - forget his last name (terrible with names) - was bad enough. I think he had to think he was doing drama for "Young and Restless" or "Days of Our Lives". If you try, you can imagine it in a white lab coat and play with a doctor with several personalities at the "General Hospital". It doesn't help that the film is even shot as a daily soap. Although I'm sure I could make the same movie with a video camera; though without obvious and soapy sound adjustments. <br /> <br /> For the first time, I thought the money to rent this movie was useless. Although I wouldn't look at it again, if I didn't get a big amount of money.
