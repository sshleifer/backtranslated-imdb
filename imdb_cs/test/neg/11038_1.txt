Let me out of the way before I make this movie: I love Park Chan-Wook work as a director. While I do not agree with the masses that say it is the best director working in our day, I cannot deny that they understand how to use the camera very effectively. I really liked one of his other films, Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance. The only thing that allowed me to take this film seriously was playing Min-sik Choi. . . for 1/5 runtime, ie <br /> <br /> Now it's wrong: The storyline is simply the oldest cliché used in cinema / literature. I will never understand how critics can throw a Hollywood blockbuster for being a cliché, then a hail of movies like Oldboy, which are just as original and cliché, if not even more. Regardless, Oldboy is one of the most generic, non-original films ever made. * Spoilers * Man is held captive, man tries to avenge, man finds he had sex with a family member, man's life ended. * Spoilers * Simply put, this plot line has been used in everything from Greek games to modern melodramatic soap operas and countless movies / books between them. It is so melodramatic and unoriginal, when it becomes the main revelation, I laughed loudly. Does that mean I am an insensitive madman with no emotion because some reviews of this movie say people like me? No. What that means is that people laughed. Scary Movie testimony proved it, and Oldboy did it. Why can't people think of something that is really disturbing instead of just spewing out a tried-and-tested cliche masked by a fantastic camera and classical music? This raises the problem of blood / gore. Simply put, it's not there. The director is too shy to point the camera at the screen when something "cruel" happens, as if we were watching a movie for kids or something. Maybe we were. By the way, I heard Oldboya, who called "the most brutal movie of all time" and "the worst movie ever", but when I saw it, I couldn't see anything that was remotely bloody or disturbing. All "gore" are off screen, and even then the level of violence is nothing you haven't seen in PG-13 movies like The Dark Knight or Casino Royale before. Why it even has an R-rating, wrong me, much less "the most brutal movie of all time". Seriously, I've seen movies that just make Oldboy look cute at every level when it comes to violence / gore. Another huge glaring, kitschy bug is the main villain. Most of his screen time that shows his naked ass off for an audience in the American comedy Pie-style, but do I think he's oh-so-evil? When he wears clothes, his hair is smooth back like a bad Asian mix of cheesiest James Bond villain mixed with something from Austin Powers. He talks like a dead teenager who is recovering from an acid overdose, and his dialogue is so bad that I laughed again. Seriously, Oldboy smiled more than comedy this year. . . Finally, Oldboy is for those of you who drink good wine, have no sense of humor and talk about how boring your party lives are. It is for those people who are so stuck in their own ego that they have forgotten how unoriginal they are, and then forgot how unoriginal and boring "movies" (never "movies") they enjoy. Those people I can say are: I like "movies" and also "movies". I like sophisticated dramas that actually say something about the human state, and I also like nonsensical action movies that excite me into a coma. But the thing is that for me as "movies" and "movies" must be original. There must be something I haven't seen so many times that I've lost the number of times the land has been used. When something is not original, it is useless. If it does exactly what everyone else is doing, it's memorable and boring. Before you give Oldboy another perfect rating because he "touched you", maybe you should think about something: the film wouldn't touch anyway, but would the original think more of you? I wish someone other than me to understand. <br /> <br /> Overall: Oldboy is forgotten and cheesy. <br /> <br /> 1/10
