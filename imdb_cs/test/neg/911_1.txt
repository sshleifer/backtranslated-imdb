Rob Lowe had to eat the whole budget, but I can't blame him for running money. Although he would have to agree, there was nothing good about this movie. Shooting, editing, directing, dialogue, sets, make-up, writing, casting (especially a young girl and a child psychiatrist with a cheater), and all that was worst. I've never seen such a horrible movie. Pass this one for any other rental selection, or you will find yourself screaming ugly comments on your TV. Dead Silent should be silenced all the time.
