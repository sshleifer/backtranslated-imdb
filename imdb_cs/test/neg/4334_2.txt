The evil bikie gang in this film was called Savages, hence the title, but Minor Nuisances would be a better name for this excused crowd of weak actors trying to look dangerous. Whenever they wanted to kill someone, they went very slowly on their bikes, so that their victim could easily avoid them or push them off the wheels. Their leader had a bad limp, but he still thought he could take the hero and win. As for Karen Black, she doesn't seem to know where she is for most of the movie.
