When I went home after work, I bought movies for four-year-old twins. I bought this movie that my kids would enjoy. I watched it with my children. My 10 and 17 years old were about to vomit. In this movie, Dad acts like a tard. My little ones would watch it every day. One day they threw away all our movies. I'm selling Omosis Jones on Ebay. My Grade: F ++++++++++++++++ I prefer to see the worst list of clothes. My kids now hate this stupid movie. If it gives the idea that bacteria can talk to each other. I wonder how the silent movie sounds in Japenes. I split the CD in half when I was irritated to see it again and again. No offense, but Brandy & Elena was the best
