'Bland' is a word I would use to try to describe this film. I only saw it because he had a good rating here and I was let go. The film is basically about racism in America after 9/11 and the director went with it with a hammer. ! There was no subtlety in the film, and it seemed as if they were trying to achieve a film that would have been such a sensation for Magnolia - which was never a good idea because the movie was three hours of confusion and just to start raining frogs at the end. .. <br /> <br /> All in all a huge disappointment.
