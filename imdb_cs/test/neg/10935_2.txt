Amazing that something like this could find a way for the public to see. I knew it was Uwe Boll, and I found it in a shop for a $ 2 deal (still steep, considering), but morbid curiosity led me to see it, and: <br /> <br /> 1). I'm pretty sure it's about rip-off Seven, Silence of the Lambs, and American Psycho, all in one, with a dialogue that preteens may have written. <br /> <br /> 2). Casper Van Dien plays the main character and is so totally bizarre and fearsome that only anyone could know he must be a crazy serial killer. <br /> <br /> 3). Jennifer Rubin plays a "good cop" who invites a serial killer to her apartment for a home cooked dinner and what she gets for her trouble? I'll let you guess. <br /> <br /> 4). Michael Pare plays an "intense" cop who drives the VW Bug, a new style, a siren. The VW Bug ... that will beat fear into criminal hearts when they see it coming. <br /> <br /> 5). Van Dien breaks down with her fianc√©, but she still has an "unsecured" side, complemented by "no wedding cake". Imagine everyone is surprised to see him (he was, of course, invited) and everyone was shot. <br /> <br /> 6). In fact it was supposed to be # 1, really. The killer in this is known as "Monkey Maker". This is, without a doubt, the stupidest name of a murderer who could be invented in a million years. Probably it has something to do with "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil", he says with the monkeys. It is possible that even monkeys had something to do with the script. <br /> <br /> 7). Yeah, and there's a club that Van Dien visits near the beginning of the movie. Is there a bad disco music, I mean really bad, and a chain fenced cage with, uh, gang members beating the baseball bats? That's what it looked like. And of course it's just the tip of the iceberg, really cool stuff (?!) They continue in the basement, where some doubtful "actor" talks about a woman to sign a confession before she gets shot. , snuff film? Not quite sure how it fits into the rest of the film, and Boll apparently wasn't one, so if I'm not afraid, then I'm not afraid. An incredible piece of non-gaining that you feel you are watching something from the parallel universe. Our parallel parallel universe, but where things happen where they don't seem right. You have entered "The Boll Zone". Quit as quickly as possible and look back. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
