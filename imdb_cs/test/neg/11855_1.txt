The only reason the question mark is in parentheses is not because I haven't seen any movie released in 2001. It's because this movie was made by PARTLY in 2001. The rest was stolen from Roger Corman's OTHER Dinosaurs, Carnosaur 1- 3. <br /> <br /> I have a confession. "Carnosaur 2" is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. He borrows so much from "Aliens" by James Cameron that it's not funny either. But I love it. I can't explain exactly why. It's just work for me. I liked the files, I liked cinematography, I liked how they borrowed from "strangers". It's just a little ironic that Cameron in one place was in Corman's understanding, with movies like "Battle Beyond the Stars" (1980). I own a Carnosaur DVD trilogy and I can say most about the first part that it has moments. The most I can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it observable. <br /> <br /> We now have a "Raptor" that doesn't continue this series. Instead, he borrows the WHOLE scenes from the Carnosaur Trilogy and BUILD a film around her. So Roger Corman was able to get Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen. Now I'm not saying that Roberts or Bernsen are on a high level. However, both were at one point what could be called RESPECTABLE actors. Not here. Sure, the actors react to the effects they won't see during filming. Here, however, they respond to inadequate footage of films that are five to eight years old. There is also a sherrif whose costume was modeled right after the character in "Carnosaur 1." Apparently it made too much sense for the original person to come back. <br /> <br /> When "Raptor" was announced, I was a little excited. But I was disappointed when Corman said they would use the old dinosaur models from "Carnosaur". Apparently Corman decided after this conversation that he wouldn't do it. And it's not that he can't find the FX crew. The script for this was clearly written to remember that the story had to be built on pre-existing footage. Compare it to Ed Wood. Ed did better. At least he used the footage of Bela once, in one movie. There are ways to incorporate footage into a movie, and "Raptor" takes this cloud technique to a new minimum. Although you liked "Carnosaur 3: Primal Species", stay away from "Raptor".
