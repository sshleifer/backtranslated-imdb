Scary, shallow, materialistic nonsense. How are women (and homosexuals?) Looking forward to this waste, it's over. No one who respects oneself would ever want to be with one of these neurotic gold diggers. It is even more concerned that so many reviewers say they concern women at the show. If it is the future of women, the Lord will help us all. Showing your independence and respect as equality with men should not be about spreading your legs every three seconds with another man. I think it humiliates women and doesn't do justice to them. But this revision is not commendable against women. Fans of this show say it's "merry" and "riveting", but every time I watched this show, I tried to stay awake. Despite the reporter's narration, there is nothing in this show that could be considered rational thinking. So it's not fun and it's not informative, so why would you look at it? One in ten stars.
