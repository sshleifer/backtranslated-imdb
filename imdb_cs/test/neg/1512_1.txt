As a Christian, I thought this film was completely embarrassing. The actors sucked in, sucked in the script, the cinema blazed and the story so typical. I couldn't say it was a great tool because I would be too embarrassed to show one of my unsaved friends. Hollywood has much better things to do, because they invest the best in it. Christians have done a job and think it's okay because "it's for the Lord". In the Old Testament, people spent a huge amount of money to offer sacrifices to God. David (or Saul ... I don't remember) spent what would amount to about $ 50 billion in today's money to build a temple for God. But these days, spending that seems to be about $ 30,000 peaks on making a movie "witness" for people with is just pathetic. He is the man, not the product that influences someone. Don't waste your time trying to transform your friends with this waste for an hour and a half. If you want to positively influence people, show them movies like The Matrix, American Beauty, Braveheart, etc. Movies that have something to say and actually take on.
