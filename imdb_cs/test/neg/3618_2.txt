I usually like movies about animals or reptiles that turn against old people who threaten their environment, but I have to say that Snake Island was a long delay. The assumption is interesting, a group of people, including a numbly writer played by William Katt, goes to an island called, duh, you guessed it "snake island", and quizzing what the island lives up to its name. This is one thing I will give this movie, there are snakes, LOTS and LOTS snakes of all sizes and species. So that part of the movie in righteousness lives up to its name, but writing, playing and directing is SOOOOOOOO lame it's almost painful to sit. The characters are so unlikely that I begged for snakes to finish these horrible people away to keep us all out of our misery. There are several scenes that are so unreal and ridiculous that they are believed to be believers - snakes crouching on a really horrible disco while 2 women dancing a seminar together and a snake scene that leads some unbreakable dialogue with one of the actors. . I think the writer was trying to be funny, but this just looked like some strange trip to LSD ... <br /> <br /> I remember William Katt years ago when he played in "Carrie" what a piece it was .. not that he is always the main star, but that he should be limited to this waste, I feel for him. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie, like the plague, if you're not really in movies that have a lot of snakes and really horrible people.
