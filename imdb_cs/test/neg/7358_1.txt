If you've seen resentment, another average ghost movie, then you should know what to expect, even worse, much worse. This time instead of being in Japan with all the English-speaking people, we are in Spain with all English-speaking people. Interestingly, neither film of this film actually looks like Spain and could have been shot in the studio. Oh and a place with swings because there is a good 5 minutes of footage swings with nobody on them, oooohhh how creepy. This one is terrible in every way you can imagine. Mom and Dad's lameinator tasks won't help. Anna Paquin is the only person who brings a decent performance in the movie, but I hate Anna Paquin, so you can imagine my own private hell watching this movie. But there is one good moment in the movie, but when a villain tries to explain the intricate plot of Anna Paquin's character and doesn't understand any of them and asks a lot of silly questions and says, "You IDIOT, you didn't understand anything!" lol. Well I understand this movie is a piece of waste. 0 stars.
