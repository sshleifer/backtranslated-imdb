If it wasn't for Colin Firth, the movie would be ready for the garbage! So predictable, so stupid and so wrong! Only Colin Firth, as always, shines through this mess as the only light at the end of the tunnel !! The worst was actress Jennifer Rubin, for sure! Maybe it was because of this scenario (they had actually written one or it was just "on the way" ???). <br /> <br /> To shorten a long story that is too short: <br /> <br /> It's MUST HAVE SEARCH only for Colin Firth Fanatics (like me) because it's incredibly sexy and good acting (fights hard against this "mentally challenged" scenario). These minutes Colin-Screen-Time makes up a lot of this movie. But don't spend too much money on it. Try to see it or get as cheap as possible (auction or something like that) and then stick to the scenes of Colin Firth. The rest of the movie can be dangerous to mental health.
