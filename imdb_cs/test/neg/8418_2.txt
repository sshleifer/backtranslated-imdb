What kind of bird is that? Maltsk√Ω sokol. The only thing that is far from this film is Michael Caines. Which has more depth and character than the man below. <br /> <br /> The setting in Malta is as dry and barren as dialogue. Greetings to Raymond Chandler and Humphrey Bogart and crime fiction, etc. They seem dull and simple stupid without the salvation of any humor or pertinency. The reason this film has no "longevity" and almost forgotten is that it's so messy, an hour and a half of unnecessary time spent in the company of actors and filmmakers of the second year.
