This film seems to be well done and more efforts should be made to promote women's films. In addition, this film is also deeply disturbing in that it justifies the manipulative and psychotic machinations of a character that is deeply disturbed. If you have seen any of the promotional materials, you may think that this is an annoying film about the relationship that has reached its end, but none of this suggests how the central assumption is actually being canceled: <br /> <br /> A woman threatens suicide unless he soon agrees to relive the most precious memories of their relationship here. When she said how unfairly (at least) that such a threat was, Tessa (the supposed protagonist) suggests that "life is not just." <br /> <br /> Huh ??? This character also uses tears to manipulate her former lover to stay, and coaxially him into sexually oriented behavior (which she initially denies as a motive) all while assuring him "this is not sex." <br /> <br /> Reverse sex, have The leader plays Tracey Gold and Brian Austin-Green and it might air in the feature length on Lifetime called as "hostage to obsession." There is no medically accepted definition of sound psychic and emotional stability that would include Tess's behavior in this film. Promotes Kristen Thomson to play borderline psychotic, manipulative ex and T, perhaps too well because there is no well-groomed person, man or woman who can observe it and should not shake up.
