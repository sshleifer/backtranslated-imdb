This is by far the worst adaptation of Hemingway. Rock Hudson was badly miscast and absolutely incredible as a stubborn soldier / adventurer drawn into the war. Jennifer Jones was too old for her part, and Vittorio de Sica seemed to think she had acted in some other film. They tried to make the equalizer a romantic novel on a large scale and the result is terrible. As if it was not enough, the whole thing is so slow, long and dated that it is virtually incapable. Rock had to kick to turn down on "Sayonara" and "Ben Hur" to make it scary crap. <br/> <br /> 0/10. Avoid it.
