Like another reviewer, my wife bought this film as part of the 20 Family Film Package. I think you could say that it was a decent movie made for the 1980s, but it's super-predictable and acting, with the exception of Robert Conrad, is generally par. Football scenes are nothing special and seem to work mainly as a film filler. The movie is very old, but a good remake would probably do it in a good movie. But is it really necessary? I mean, how much "Sports team for pitchers working together for movies with undefeated boys" do we really need? This is probably a good movie for your younger kids if you find it in the store, but a sports movie enthusiast finds it missing.
