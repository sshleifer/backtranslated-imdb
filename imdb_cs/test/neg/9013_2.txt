For those viewers who thought that the 1979 "Alien" movie, the first to portray a male Earthman impregnated with a malevolent alien, "Night of the Beast", made 21 years ago, may come as something of a surprise. In this film, the first American man in space hits Earth and is considered dead after examination. Later he comes again, with only half a dozen strange sea horses growing in his belly. Mum (?) The alien will also appear to frighten a small group of scientists watching our gravid hero, and he seems to have the body of a bear and the head of Yarnak, the rock creature of 1969 "The Star". Trek episode. However, with a short time of 62 minutes, a small group of scientists and a cheap monster, this film does not propose anything less than a Z-class warm-up for the "outer border" (which would be premiered four years later), but without the gentle typing that the show usually boasted . Despite the clear name, this movie is definitely science fiction, not horror, and offers no fears, no smudges, little tension, and little food for thought. It looks like it costs around $ 100 to make (but probably costs twice as much), and its music score often seems to have no relation to what's going on (I'm not going to use the word "action") on the screen. There are many questions left at the end of the film: What was our hero who born these animals? Why do aliens have to get rid of people to learn our language? (To justify this title, no doubt!) Why can't space aliens land on our planet, instead of having to ride our ships? How was our hero started? These are all things that this little left cannot bother. It's really just for the 1950s sci-fi completists.
