The Dakota incident must be one of the strangest westerns I've ever seen. It's not good, but weird. Driverless driver rides into Christian Flats with all passengers. It is planned to go on, but very little for obvious reasons wants to risk Cheyennes on the war road out there. But Linda Darnell, Regis Toomey, John Lund, Whit Bissell and Ward Bond have their reasons for continuing. And Dale Robertson, who killed John Doucette in the Doucette shootout and Skip Homeier shot and left him dead in the desert, is so eager to go that he is willing to drive the team. Of course Cheyennes attack an intrepid group of passengers when forced to wash in the dryer to cover. Who will live and who will die is the rest of the film. Dakota Incident arrived at the very end of Republic Pictures before Herbert J. Yates pulled the plug on his small studio. The Westerns were their specialty, but normally Roy Rogers did that kind. That wouldn't be a Rogers product. In fact, it's out of faith. The characters are not grounded in any reality. Whit Bissell takes ore samples from his claim, but Robertson discovers they are iron pyrites, a fool's gold. Toomey is a cynic guitar that is crazy about thirst. Darnell is a cheating manager, but he doesn't know what to do if he finds him. Lund is trying to bring Robertson, who has committed a crime for which he took rap, but must bring him to life. He would need help for that, but he doesn't. But the worst is Ward Bond, who is the United States Senator on his own peacekeeping mission in Cheyennes. In real life, Bond was the most likely individual, and I'm not sure it is not a cartoon of what he sees as liberal. He's really crazy, but I think he might be interested. I tried to get to the Dakota Incident, but I couldn't. And the end was at least a bizarre fantasy. Give her three stars for the cast.
