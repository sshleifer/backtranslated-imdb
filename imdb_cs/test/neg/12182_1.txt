I can't believe I was sitting over this waste. Palm Trees in D.C. (already mentioned), dummy-dead-dead-body a little so obviously artificial that I thought it was SUPPORT to make dummies ... until he left bloody spots ... angry dialogue, ridiculous conspiracy. I think it's a shame that Jill Ireland's last movie before her death was this stinking one. Don't waste your time - I wish I didn't. The only saving grace is that it was on the cable, so I didn't waste money on everything.
