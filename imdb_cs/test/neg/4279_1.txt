Here is another low quality movie from "Disney". There is no more Disney spirit. The story is boring. All emotions are false. It's not cute or moving. Disney was a kind of magical company at the time that gave children dreams. Now it's all about making money. Shame on people who use Disney's name for their personal benefit. It's a fall of the empire. And by the way, Pixar is NOT Disney!
