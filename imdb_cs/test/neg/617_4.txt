'Felony' is a B-movie. No doubt. Of course, if you look at a set of games, you can have great hopes for your entertainment potential. This movie is filled with all the wonderful actors you grew up with, those you recognize immediately, even though you probably don't know their names. It's amazing that filmmakers were able to bring all these people together into one project, almost as if they were going to make a meeting of a B-film actor. The cast even includes some really first-class actors: David Warner, who most people know from the movie "Titanic" (although Jack Ripper's favorite in Time After Time) and Lance Henriksen, many of whom will remember as bishop in 'aliens'. These two actors did an excellent job in their long career and made some high quality films. However, how impressive this collection of actors is, their talent will never be fully reflected on the screen. Writers 'Felony' spent a lot of money to put together a dream team and then lost their unique opportunity for one important factor, the common denominator of all B-films: a silly script. We'll start with a stupid premise. Evil boys are caught on tape committing a terrible murder and tirelessly chase the film crew to get a videotape and destroy the evidence. But honestly, why bother? At a time when film crews need to be monitored, a thousand copies of this tape can be produced and distributed to all law enforcement and media authorities. It seems that criminals do not realize how unnecessary their efforts are, and speak as if stealing and destroying one original videotape has solved the problem. Stupid ... but I suppose if the parachutes were so logical there would be no movie. Then there is dialogue. This is sometimes silly, sometimes clich√©, and sometimes incredible ... all you expected from a B-movie. Of course, I always believed that strong performances can overcome many weaknesses in the material. This cast includes actors who are definitely capable of strong performances, and although the number of cast members is not a good actor at all and has reached the status of a B film that is deserved, there might still be hope that the stronger part of the cast will be in its parts. However, it is disappointing to see that few actors in this film really take the film so seriously that it gives them the best chance. There is not much inspiration in these shows, but then it is again an uninteresting scenario. I admit that some of the more colorful cast actors can add a certain amount of pizzas to their lines, but frankly, even the very good actors I mentioned earlier seem mostly uninteresting and uninterested. story. Speaking of the story ... though the acting was high enough that the dialogue seemed a little less cheesy, it would still not use 'Felony' from the fact that its writer commits a perfect faux passport script low budget: conspiracy with as many holes as a block of Swiss cheese. You can watch this movie a hundred times and you still won't figure out how it all increases. In an effort to create tension and always keep the viewer guessing, the writer throws up all sorts of surprises and unexpected twists into his script and ends up with puzzles, but when you get to the end you'll find there a lot of pieces that just don't fit anywhere and others that are missing. I admire a good thriller that keeps me guessing, but creating plots that only exist to confuse you and that are not in line with the rest of the story is amateurish. There was so much that it was never explained that I felt extremely frustrated at the end. If you decide to watch it, be prepared to be confused. I didn't even mention this movie about all the other stupid things, but I won't bother. The funny thing is, despite all I said, I have to admit I can't give 'Felony' 1/10 stars. Although I can't exactly put my finger on why I actually found this movie to be a little sympathetic. Silliness can actually be fun at times if you're in the mood for it. Plus, I like some of these actors, and although their performances are somewhat bland due to their talent, I still saw them seeing them. Now I realize that I rated the movie from a serious viewer perspective. It's entirely possible that I missed a point completely. It could be that the intention of the filmmakers was to create a B-film. Maybe stupidity is completely intentional. If that were the case, and if I evaluated it under these conditions, I must say that "Felony" is a classic in the genre of action moves on the tongue. B-movie fans will love to see all their favorite actors together in one movie, get some laughter from the script, and will enjoy the healthy benefits of weapons, blasts and chases.
