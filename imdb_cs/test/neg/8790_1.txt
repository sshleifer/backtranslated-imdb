This film was obscenely obvious and predictable. The scenes were poorly written and made worse. Following the terrible scenes was a horrible script full of nonsensical and ill-considered lines. I would never suggest this film to anyone who would make sense to watch decent movies. This film was not only with the same ideas as the show Bachelor and Bachelorette but also included many parts in which you would know what the next move and the line were to be without ever having to watch the movie before. Casting was fine, but the actors played characters with a more horrible drama that should then be used, and they said it wanted to change the channel quickly. Please do not take this movie as a note.
