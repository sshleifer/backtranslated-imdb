It could have been better. In fact, maybe so much that if the filmmaker didn't try as hard as he did, it could have been better. Lighting was fine. But almost everything else was missing. Working camera work. (Yeah, yeah, I know, that's the style now.) Poorly recorded sound. And adjustments that seemed to see too many Ulli Lommel movies (some of the worst edited movies). Put them in false slavery and grope while you say "menacing" things.
