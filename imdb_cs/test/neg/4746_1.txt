If I read Alex Sander's review (sic), instead of looking at a rating of over 6 years from the selection of ignorant viewers, I wouldn't see this desecration. Alien was a fantastic, dramatic and well executed horror / science fiction. Predator was a great science fiction / action mess. I'm really just blamed for seeing 'Alien vs. Predator'. It also has an average rating of over 6 stars from film experts who frequent this site. STOP READ THESE IF YOU HAVE ANY SUCH AS ALSO ALSO ALSO SUCH AS A SUSPENSE RIDDEN PLOT TO BE RUINED FOR YOU. This film was ridiculous right from the start. No explanation was offered for crossing the Predator / not crossed foreigners. Okay, so maybe they threw aliens on Earth again to hunt them, and something went wrong, but how did this result in the Alien / Predator hybrids and why the rest of the crew didn't realize even before they did great technology? The beginning was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had an idea of ​​who was who or what and why. Since then it's really ridiculous. I always leave my mistrust hung strictly above the screen door before entering and collecting on the way out. I couldn't be here. Father and son fishing in the woods. The damaged ship lands on (from a viewpoint) I count at least 10 odd miles away through dense forests. The man and the boy go there alone and find a boat and embrace the face. Even at this point you feel very little for them, mainly because the faces are almost comical in their movements and actions, rather than scary, and the father looks like such an irresponsible, stupid nerd. Irritated, The thriller scenario is introduced with an ex-con return to the city near the crash site, which meets its somewhat heartless, boring bus friend. When I say the Superior, I mean the weak bullshit and no feeling. The Slasher / Horror element is then introduced with the sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or some undesirable cute guy who gets defeated over the protective, crazy, ugly Jock type (American sportsman is not a Scottish man). By the way, cute / not cute boy is a former brother. Yes, they are clever these director brothers, whose name I will examine to avoid any other shit they have reissued. Then a modern role to reverse the oh so boring attempt on a PC, Ripley's credentials type character comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child. <br /> <br /> Guess what happens next? I'm not going to tell you much more about the real (sadly smiles to myself about the extinction of narration in the vast majority of recent movies) conspiracy only if you got so far and you're not the brightest star in space in a foreign country. . The predator is stupid for the reasons given in the previous poster, whose post I read too late. Foreigners are boring. Predator-Alien is ridiculous. This action is sometimes exploitative, gratuitous and disgusting nonsense. Hospital scene with pregnant mothers?!?! I was okay in shock. Shocked how little some people will go to get what? Fear? Any shock? To titrate perverse? What? If you really wanted to shock, titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting a father or who do not have a soul, why not just have Alien / Predator shagging oucy women and teen girls rather than killing them? Characters have no depth or graph. It's filmed and wrong. It's an act of impartial people, not that I can blame them. It further defiles two rather interesting and good science fiction sets. This movie was a waste and if you enjoyed it, I really have to worry about you. If you haven't seen it well, please make your own decision. I even mentioned the way in which all trained soldiers are killed in about 20 seconds, while amateur civilians survive all their lives?
