Sadly, they are chasing film festivals these days. I had to sit over twenty minutes of this bleak short, which wasn't fun at all, to get a good spot for the feature film I wanted to see at the local film festival. The festival planners have paired this terrible thing with a great feature. I'm just glad this feature was good, otherwise I wouldn't be a very happy camper! It wasn't allowed for a comedy short film. The name says everything.
