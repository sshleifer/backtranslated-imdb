Oh my God, WHY, did I lose my precious time on this movie? It's pathetic, waaaay OTT and unrealistic and one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Yes, my life. I'm embarrassed for the Yash Raj movies, the poor guys have to live with the terrible news that they did, they produced this horrible movie. This is by far the most, kitschy, sexual, eyebrow-lifting movie I've ever seen in Yash Raj movies. I'm crouching for them, really. Along with the terrible acting (or acting) of Uday Chopra, combined with the lack of "Look At My Boobs" Tanisha, Neal 'n' Nikki has nothing good about it. Even the music is not at the level left by the YRF. Director Arjun Sablok was doing awkwardly bad work here. Frankly, I was expecting more. Much, much more.
