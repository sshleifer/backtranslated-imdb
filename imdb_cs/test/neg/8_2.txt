I am not a big fan of musicals, although technically it may not be musical. But I thought I'd give it a chance because I love war movies. At best, it was average. Hudson seems to be completely out of this role in this role. It just didn't work for me. Apparently, Julie Andrews played her role as best she could, but I hardly buy it as a fraudulent, fraudulent spy. I'm sorry, I know it's a classic stereotype. But I have to say that I think this is Julie in her most beautiful and feminine form. I always thought it was more matric, but then it's definitely the result of her roles in Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. No doubt they were trying desperately to get her out of this job in this role. She was quite charming in appearance here, but I haven't bought her like a spy yet. I couldn't concentrate on the whole movie and found myself tuning in and out - and conversation with those in my room (which I usually never do - I always try to get everyone) So it tells you how little I was interested. Don't waste your time!
