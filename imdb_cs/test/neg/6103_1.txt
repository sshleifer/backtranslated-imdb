This film is best enjoyed in the middle of a big audience with giggles. Very often, the characters in KADOSH are clearly sighted with nothing. Very intense unhappy faces, very pensive, very serious. During these moments, there is very serious sounding music to convince the viewer that the scene being watched is not about entertainment and games. <br /> <br /> The more entertaining parts of this film are staring among many thoughtful. We realize that KADOSH women have two responsibilities. One is to breed as many males as possible for their husbands. The second goal is to stay busy to free their husbands from work. What do these men do with their free time? Pray. And we learn that at home they pray aloud: "Thank you for not making me a woman." And in their place of worship they pray to thank them for having functional male genitals. Along with prayer, there are many scenes of frantic opposites, screams and endless jerks of the head and body that swing back and forth, and mixed with everything is a lot of complex and bizarre (or simple but equally special) ritual activities. An unintentional comedy cream comes from sex. The pictures of a hot and annoyed man actively exchanging body fluids with his wife in bed and trying to keep his beanie from falling out are unforgettable! Every sex scene is fun, but the one that stands out is when a man rubs his face against the feet of his beautiful wife (YaÃ«l Abecassis). Oh yes, we are finally entering the land of sensuality ... but NO! The stopwatch stops before something happens, and the husband begins his autistic looking head, swaying and swinging on the body until the scene is over! Technically, there are several interesting images and a pleasant use of light and colors by the director. <br /> <br /> For a more credible, educational and entertaining treatment of an uncomfortable woman who is not worthy of holding a book in a world where reverence is measured by the speed a person can quote a phrase from ancient writings, I suggest Barent Streisand YENTL. <br /> <br />
