I saw this movie on a stunt shelf and I thought it looked cool. So many great actors offered the DVD case and thought, "Why didn't I ever hear about this movie?" Then I turned the case and saw the director, Lee Tamahori, explaining the answer. First of all, I want to defeat the idea that a great cast equals a great movie, but more importantly, I think I should explain why this film is so terrible. Well, the script is terrible and full of one-way characters. That's the worst part I've ever seen Chazz Palminteri and I'm surprised he would do something so ridiculous. However, underestimating, but talented actors must make money. Palminteri plays one dimensional police detective who comes about as silly as a C-film crowd. He, along with a lead detective (poorly directed by Nolte), a great but simple Michael Madsen, and the last Chris Penn (whose role with Madsen has been totally discarded) are the elite team of LA detectives who are about to get rid of the city. mobsters sometimes in the late 30s or 40s. The film presents this team as cops who break every law to make sure that those who think they are above the law do not work in their city. At the beginning of the movie, the cops accumulated a local restaurant, caught an alleged gangster (William Peterson) and took him to a place they called Mulholland Falls. He throws him off one of the cliffs at Mullholland Drive and it is supposed to show how seriously these guys are about depriving the city of crime. It does not matter. This was nothing but cheap apologies for using a crappy title that is designed to make you think LA and its famous places. Somewhere later, Jennifer Connelly finds the dead body and the story begins. <br /> <br /> A direction that was nothing less than amateur and WEAK! In addition to being B-movie characters, the exaggeration of those such as Treat Williams, the Chief of Police, and the scary Daniel Baldwin are just a few of the highlights that seemed to be Lee Tamhori's first film . There is not one good performance in the film, except maybe Melanie Griffith, who could argue that she is the worst in the film (she won Razzie for this film). In the end, it was her character that wasn't that big and she had little to do with it. As with other bad movies, everything starts with writing and this script was no jewel. The fence is formulated simply by setting the next scene and never takes into account the motivation of the characters. The way the characters behaved was incredible. Cops who take the law into their own hands are believable under the right circumstances (see LA CONFIDENTIAL), but in this case it seemed that these guys could get rid of anything, including murder, and never dare to purify themselves. I think we as an audience suppose that no one has seen anything and that people will not ask. Everything about the story is predictable and the spoon is fed so well that we understand everything that happens when characters become good. However, that does not mean that we felt clever, but rather angry with us how stupid a hero is, despite the fact that there are no heroes in this movie. Finally, the best part of the film was David Grusin's great score. From the beginning he referred to CHINATOWN, who quickly faded when I realized how incredible everything was in the movie. I wasn't surprised to learn that it was an incredible eleven million at the box office. What I say is that this movie is worth watching a few laughs. Nick Nolte's meeting is like an unsuccessfully domesticated junkyard and I laughed every time he tried to be serious. I also almost fell to the floor with each of the slow shots used in the movie (I think they're three with one during the main battle scene). If you have to use slow motion in the heat of a dramatic moment, you obviously have some problems. So, even with my negative criticism, I recommend this film for the sake of appealing laughter, that is, if you appreciate good movies like LA CONFIDENTIAL.
