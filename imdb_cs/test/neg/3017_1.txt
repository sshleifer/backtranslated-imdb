yeah .. thats what the stations post ads for this show "some scenes can be distracting for some viewers". <br /> <br /> It's out of interference. The validation of the entire ego display framing and chauvinism is in fact that it is on the COMEDY channel. Yes .. comedy true and true. JOKE. To see these 'playas' go through their rigid charade really explains what's wrong with the company. Especially the mass market scene. Both sides, male and female, are as weak and desperate to mix in this superficial atmosphere. The club is apparently one of those corporations sponsored by plastic coke scenes. These people have a choice, and that's what makes it even more joke. <br /> <br /> These slippery ricks try too hard. They shine with their own grease. It's alright. It's a videotape lesson for a new generation of how to focus on the potential interest of the heart. Hopefully this facade will fall apart with Bush / Harper's administration. The problem is who stood up after these characters disappeared? Bastard Kids One Night Stand?
