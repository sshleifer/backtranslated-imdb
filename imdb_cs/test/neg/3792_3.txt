This is a film with an excellent concept for the story, but it has gotten aside, but a large number of sub-plot clich√©s, hackneyed and unrealistic portrayed characterization and performances, and some honestly unlikely (and highly random and, not to mention, comfortable as plot points to move to a relentless goal). The lack of everything that would mark leadership as truly gay, other than some random references to Crow Bar or being gay, was worrying. It wouldn't hurt to actually show him something to do, even though it was just a meeting with a friend for drinks. It is worth looking at and it has merit. Not many, even a few years after the film was released, in the form of films that contain both lead and gay, or a significant gay plot line, and that is also about African Americans. After that, it's worth a try. I wouldn't look too hard for it, and I wouldn't want to waste my time looking for it. This is a rental and not a premium rental on it.
