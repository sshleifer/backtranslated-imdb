How did this movie get in the name of decency? It is believed that the headlines only say "terrible" on every single shot of this truly desperate effort. The horrible act, the pitiful dialogue, and the lack of talent of all involved, the nightmare is in an incredible 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> Overall Impression? A bunch of exciting drama students was lucky with a lottery grant and went on to become one of the most painful movies ever made. Thanks to this, the Hammer Horror TV shows look like Oscar material. And for a while, you don't think it falls into the category "so bad is it good." It's not so bad. But fart lighting scene is probably worth another look.
