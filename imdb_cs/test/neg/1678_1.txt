Well, I can sit in almost all the movies and I tend to get a real kick off of Sci Fi Originals, but in this movie it was a big mistake that made me turn off half an hour. > <br /> After serving in the US Army, there are some expectations in the film, including the army. At least some semblance of attention to proper military status, uniform and terminology is essential if you expect the viewer to truly enjoy the experience. "Bats: Human Harvest" had characters wearing a position that faced the wrong direction on the lapel, and later in the movie, the time was listed as 11:00 pm, but it was full of darkness outside. Even if the screenplay was perfectly executed, and the dialogue would be spectacular, and the acting Oscar worthy if the filmmakers didn't care about a film that would bother looking for the right way to display military time, why would anyone bother to watch it?
