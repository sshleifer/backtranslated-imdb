I'm not bothered by lean hosts, nor have I bothered to cynically, self-righteous attitude the creators of this crap take. What I bothered about is that the vast majority of episodes are fake. I wouldn't even be surprised if all the episodes were staged. That's why it's not a show reality, but something much worse than Oprah: a zero-point television garbage zero appeal. Just like a daily TV soap opera, but with more action and fighting and less conspiracy. The assumption would prove great - if it were executed without cheating the viewer. If this thought were free from all the legal complications / traps that would surely arise from what would happen to real people and what eventually aired. The only way to make this "" realistic show "was to get some somewhat desperate actors and make them improvised (and what is pitiful and unconvincing improvisation most of the time!). Shouldn't it be obvious to anyone who has finished primary school? Most of the reviews I read here don't even mention that it was fake, let alone that it might be. Wish or just boundless naivety? Actors hired in this pathetic show are the kind of most dangerous unemployed actors who are unhappily waiting for the tables and eagerly awaiting a talk show (or this crap), which is when they finally get a chance to make hundreds of dollars . I even met one actress (in the role of "cheater"), which I saw years ago in "The Jerry Springer Show". And I saw only 6-7 episodes of "cheaters". How many more of these wrecked actors appeared in Springer and "Cheaters" I don't even know about? However, to compare "Cheaters" with Springer is not fair to those. The Springer Show is not false; most episodes are unstaged - hence often very entertaining. There is no value that could be found in "crooks" unless you are a fighting actor and want to get tips on how to act in front of the camera. Manufacturers use various (very cheap), transparent) tricks to create the illusion of reality, give their shots that elusive documentary feel. But it's all in the veins. In the end, there is a smarter viewer looking for a train, in ruins. "Professional wrestling" has more credibility than this.
