Travolta, Thurman, The Rock, Vaughn, Keitel and so on. One should think that this stellar show of great actors can really warm up this movie, but not. Again, Travolta takes on the role of Chili Palmer, but this time we've already seen a gangster trying to be lucky in the hard world of making a movie, it's no longer funny. This is typically a problem in Hollywood, thinks that if the first was good, the second would be twice as good, NO, the first was original, the second could not be, Hey Hollywood trying to understand originality could not be duplicated, you need to give us a new twist, no only the same movie did again with a bigger budget. I have always found my self I barely laughed when I watched this movie, but I still have a lot of great actors like Harvey Keitel, James Woods, Vince Vaughn and The Rock, and that's it! <br/> <br/> 4/10
