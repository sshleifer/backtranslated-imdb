It's a joke, right?! Lynch couldn't make it as a TV show. He was out of money, so what to do? Well, somehow he received some dollars and "finished" the pilot and created this mess by mixing everything together ... How can anyone see a TV pilot who failed as a movie masterpiece?! And now everyone is guessing a deeper meaning! Well, wake up, there's nothing! How was that Lynch TV show, what was the name? The same process. Build a mystery and then come with nothing. I think Lynch repeats this concept until people realize that the emperor has no clothes. Comedian Harpe Kerkerling is in Germany. He dressed as an opera singer and "played" some new "artistic songs". Nonsense singing like this: "Wolf. Lamb. In the meadow. Hurrz!" <br /> <br /> It's a classic now. Anyway, then he discussed it with the audience. And they were serious about the deeper meaning of the wolf / lamb relationship. <br /> <br /> You can be one of those who give this movie a 8.0 on imdb.com. So let's put it all together: "Hurrz!"
