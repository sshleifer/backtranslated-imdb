I'm from Australia and I love the show, I didn't expect much from the American version of Kath and Kim, but I thought I'd look at the first episode to see if it was really that bad. <br /> <br /> What to say. Slama Blair is fine because Kim and she had some good lines, but Molly Shannon isn't good Kath. The good thing about Kath Jane Turner is that when she talks to all her witty accents (like Yumor or Noice), it sounds like his natural way of talking, but when Shannon has his accent, it's clear he is acting and trying to be the same as Turner. And the show really lacks Sharon or someone else to make us laugh because the characters of Kal and Craig in this version are really not funny. So far, only the first episode has aired and this is clearly not in line with Aussie's version, although it would be a separate TV show with a different name that would not be compared to the Aussie version; a little better. But if there is nothing else on Sunday night (or Thursday night in America), then you can't hurt a lot while watching.
