I started to be a little interested in film. It seemed to be a serious drama dealing with death, sorrow and healing, with some realistic human conflict. Unfortunately, it didn't. <br /> <br /> I need a movie with somewhat consistent and credible characters. Too many characters in this film have been portrayed as extremely trusting and inconsistent. Look, I know it shouldn't be Shakespeare, but come on, I need some quality in the script and characterization. Acting was fine, writing not so much. At one point, James Brolin's character is gifted for appearing at a picnic under his clothes. He says his ordering around will not work. His new wife says that when he returns home and changes, he tears his clothes later. That's howling. This film had several unintentionally humorous lines. It was hard to worry about Jamin Brolin's character. When he so easily gave his first wife things to his new wife, even allowing his daughter to be snorted, I lost most of my sympathy. Who really cares what happens to him. I have to admit I didn't finish the movie. If he made 180 in the last 45 minutes, let me know. It was just annoying to watch and so predictably that I felt it was not necessary to finish.
