This film is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and tension-thriller conventions, none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating. The script was perfect. Acting, ditto. Spooky FX was mostly laughing, except for one wonderful moment that frightened me, even though I saw it was a mile away. Now explain to me why you would need spirits, black magic and mysterious ritual objects, and Count Crapula CG boogeymen, psychic investigators and family curse, and Irish superstitions, and bowls of milk left out for supernatural beings. And obsessed with dollies, all in the same movie? With everything you'd expect more than one good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.
