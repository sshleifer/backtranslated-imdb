This film is pleasing if you like a range of poverty, public domain movies from the first half of the 20th century, or are a fan of amateur filmmaking. The film puts together public domain thrillers along with newly filmed scenes in which "actors" (with the exception of Redfield doing close to dead on Lugosi's ripple, all "artists" are just terrible!) Try to communicate with footage. "New" shots are covered with digitally added film scratches, as well as some of the already inconvenient old tracks (?? !!). As close as I can find out that the plot has something to do with a lot of strangers who come to the island to read (?) This movie, while boasting a creative premise of ala 'Dead Men Don't Wea Plaid is a technical and creative wreck. In one terribly long sequence, a wounded sailor on the ship describes a relentless trip to 'Fog Island', whatever it is! "Flashback" then intertwines old footage from completely different periods and totally different film quality. Unrelated Scenes from "The Lost World" (1925), The Most Dangerous Game (1932), White Zombie (1932), Bela Lugosi Meets the Brooklyn Gorilla (1952) and some other productions in poverty. This is done through an incredibly bad voice that seems to have too much room echo, as if the sound had been recorded on a cheap home video camera. "Filmmakers" seem to think they pay tribute to the great actors of ancient times by giving the characters the names of famous actors (Carradine, Zucco, Ouspenskaya, etc..etc ..). This tactic was done cleverly as well as inconspicuously in the 'Final Destination' here it's just annoying! Bizarre and painfully indecent, jokes about Spiderman, Dracula and Superman are plentiful. Even old as the dirt 'Dewey, Cheetam and Howe' legacy link is used here - it was old and tired when The Three Stooges used it in the 1930s. A movie store and sound, not a match scene on the scene, and dozens of different sources are used for Lugosi. The final effect is that it seems older, younger, older, thinner, heavier, younger and older again a minute by minute. Especially the film did not use it as a comedy and rocked a good chance for comedy. The truth was said, it was fun watching it late at night in bed. Maybe that's what they wanted to happen!
