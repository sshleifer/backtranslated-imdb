This is a perfect example of why many people say that 90 years is being sucked when it comes to horror movies. Boring voodoo-on-campus horror story to play once so promising Corey Feldman (STAND BY ME, lost boys, etc.). There might be just enough things to do to keep you from falling asleep and it doesn't look too cheap, but it's still a horror-focused audience that has been in their early teens in the 90s. Maybe I was part of the viewer, but I still looked as good as watching. And nowadays, teenage people are used to much more and better, and I can't imagine any of them knowing who Corey Feldman is. Or, "is," in fact, as dude is still making movies. The only thing that still links him to his days of fame is the sequel to LOST BOYS 2: THE TRIBE that has happened recently. And I don't think anybody will encourage anyone to look for VOODOO. Just another movie that was lost in the 1990s for obvious reasons.
