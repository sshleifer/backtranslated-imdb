Sequels, there are many reasons to do it, but what went through Irwin Allen thinks that coming up with such a boring idea is beyond all logical issues. There are many open answers to this movie that it is ridiculous ... like Poseidon, who is a monster ship with drifting passengers at sea and just Michael Caine with his miniboat and evil Telly Savalas discover the ship ... well, at the beginning of the French marine circling over a wreck with your helicopter, but as a sinking cruise is an everyday thing to just fly away ... What am I trying to say ??? Hmmm, Michael Caine goes aboard with Sally Field and can pick up everything he sees (diamonds) if Telly Savalas is not looking for weapons on the ship ... my God, why am I wasting words here? It's ridiculous and knew that both Field and Caine were involved, you think what went through their minds when reading scripts ... certainly not diamonds.
