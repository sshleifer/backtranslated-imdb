I usually like Casper in his movies, the real credit for STARSHIP TROOPERS. But the cover on this SSOOOOO mi-sleds video to landlords. On my local video, people rent it and await Borg as a vampire and instead get a bad reprise of Lon Chaney. It had great potential and fell very flat. I really think I could write a better story and screen. Why is it in every science fiction movie, they (the cast) constantly refer to the solar system as a galaxy? Didn't any of these screenwriters or authors stay in the science class? It's a pet, but the solar system is the only star with planets, the galaxy is WHOLE band of solar systems. It's like referring to a can of coke as a total of six packs. Sounds even stupid.
