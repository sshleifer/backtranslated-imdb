Riotously kitschy madness about lava spews out of La Brea rain pits in Los Angeles. Even if you try to suspend distrust by ignoring this ridiculous premise, you will still shout with laughter in the Danish dialogue, the senseless conspiracy disputes, and the wildly unscrupulous scientific holes that pass through the screen. <br /> <br /> I have a theory: every successful actor is doomed to appear in at least one bad movie at some point in his career. This was Tommy Lee Jones. Although making a decent effort, the scenario is just pathetic, even if it goes down to the flames (oops, sorry for that). Most support casts are also choked by hackney writing; several actors simply phone in their roles. Anne Heche deserves a special recognition of the Hall of Shame for her embarrassing view of the scientist. She is probably as persuasive in this role as Pee Wee Herman, and at least he would do better acting. <br /> <br /> Since the scientific holes are too large to be listed, instead I suggest you play the movie with your friends and play "Find scientific absurdities." The loser might be forced to listen to the tapes from the streaked lines of the movie as "They all look the same" over and over. Here's an example of what kind of nonsense you can expect: a plan to blow up a building is designed, constructed, and a set of dynamites exploded in 20 minutes. Let's not forget the obligatory clich√©s of disaster movies: divorced dads, scientists who are all ignored, unpleasant cops, hard kids on the street, teenage brothers, greedy investors, etc.; they are all present and abundant. The film will also charm you with its tireless fire of political correctness. <br /> <br /> Only for cheers and foolish fans. All other viewers: be careful.
