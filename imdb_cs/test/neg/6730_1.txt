I have to say I really liked SIMPLE SIEGE and HARD TO KILL. he watched Seagal make his humorous martial art on people. I have always enjoyed Seagal-Movies and unfortunately I was disappointed for the first time with GLIMMER MAN, which I found really wrong. FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagals ever played. Terribly boring, poorly edited, the worst soundtrack and so on! Dear Reader, Do yourself a favor and avoid it! <br /> <br /> Honestly: Stay away!
