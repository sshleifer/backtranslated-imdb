I'm trying to see the point of this movie. It's supposed to be a comedy, but once I wasn't allowed to laugh. The story is one that might be interesting in a well-shot movie, but because it's a comic, the result is absolutely incredible (how comedies should be). The series of the series was very hit and missed, even with episodes, and it is fair to say that all the people involved did bigger things. One to avoid. I also found that comments must be 10 lines long. The whole point of these comments is to give information on whether the film is worth watching: don't write an essay about it, or share it. If you like: Seinfeld, Larry Sanders, Young Ones, Alan Partridge, Arrested Development, Curb, Red Dwarf, then you'd like to pass it on. On the other hand, if you like lame jokes like you can find in Friends and Dodgeball, enjoy watching this!
