The Randolph Scott Standards of the 1950s, this is a disappointment and a cumbersome stellar western. Two or three characters could be dropped while two or three other characters could be more highlighted. (For example, humor must be completely rewritten.) De Toth behaves well - as always - but his understanding of the overall story is weak.
