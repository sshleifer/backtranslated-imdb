Once a month I invite some friends to "Retarded Movie Night". We look forward to movies that are either so bad they're funny or movies that know they don't have a plot and just show a lot of chests. Unfortunately, last night, we were unfortunate enough to have the planet Zombie as one of our films. Cinematography is on par with what we're used to, but acting was a different story. The main role is played by Johnny Depp / Rob Zombie, who couldn't play a role in high school play, let alone the horror movie LOW-BUDGET. Our indecisive hero, who couldn't tell if he wanted to be a bad ass of this scene or a whimpering coward, was one of the reasons why it was the first 30-year movie I ever had to stop during a retarded movie. Film night. It had the option of size with a GREAT twist on a standard zombie infection, but they took it a completely different direction based on Johnny Zombie. Personally, I wouldn't recommend it to any of my friends. However, it is unfortunate that I have invited a few yesterday evening to suffer over 80% of this film with me.
