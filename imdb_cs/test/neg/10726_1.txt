My lord, what they were thinking about. Not only is he frantically unfair, but worse, a very good original was thrown into negotiation. Jane Fonda, believe it or not, has actually changed into the performance of her life. Even better than where he plays a bitch in another so-called show of his life. Maybe he's just as good as a cheater. Otherwise, wow, what a waste of time. But she and Segal will be beautifully connected, so if you have spotted anything funny in this child at a distance, grab the anvil on which she was defeated. that one will stay to these horrors. Nothing in this child is remotely funny except for a few moments when Dick and Jane are bulging like lepers and cant kiss ..... and uhh ........ oh my lord, is that it? Looks like it. It's really such a bad movie.
