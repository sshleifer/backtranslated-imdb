I was only fourteen when I first saw Alien movies and immediately got to them. Original, scary and classic. Sigourney Weaver was the perfect choice for a female hero and she deserves a statuette for her act. In 1979, something eternal was born before the immortal series continued with an equally legendary film than the first. Alien3 was a different point of view, but I think this part was the most stressful and unique of all, it was my favorite. Unfortunately, the last one was a failure in many ways. It was tense, illogical and full of meaningless massacres. I didn't like it at all, but I never thought it would ever make a worse part in the future. As it turned out in 2004, I was wrong. Alien vs. The Predator was a bad pause and should have been driven by a more talented director or never created. But when I saw Aliena vs Predator Requiem, I was totally shocked in addition. When I sat down and decided to watch it with full doubt, I never thought that such a bad movie could arise. Without a script, without a director and without actors, I don't understand how a movie can be made. Because this film lacks these three terms. What you get is a nice massacre show without a story, but with many unpleasant and boring dialogues. Waste of money and waste of time. This film is more audacious than the honor of the fans of both sides (Alien / Predator). Shame!
