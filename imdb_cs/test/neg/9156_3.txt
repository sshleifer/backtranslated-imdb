This was the first Chan film made by Monogram. What is the value and norm of Fox! I was shocked when I saw my first Monogram after I saw great Fox movies. This is boring and uninspired with wild music as Chan walks down the street. Chan now works more for the US Secret Service than for the Honolulu Police Department. He is assisted by Benson Fong, who plays No. 3 Son Tommy for the first time. She also has a daughter, Iris Chan, played by Marianne Quon. Mantan Moreland also debuts as Birmingham Brown. He is a taxi driver in Washington, DC, here, rather than a later chauffeur to Chan in later movies.
