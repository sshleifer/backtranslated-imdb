I looked at it as a child, but when I wasn't very much a fan of Jerry Lewis, I completely forgot it (not that it was unforgettable in any case). The film revolves around impersonation (which seems to be in every comic star's warp!) - in this case a German officer - and although it's not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims (giving him a BOMB rating), it's not a classic thing either - definitely crawls behind Chaplin's GREEN DICTATOR (1940), although comparatively narcissistic! Ironically, the scenes that preceded the creation of a bureaucratic general offer more foolishness than somewhat forced humor for Nazi costs! The film was truly Lewis's last breath during his heyday; in fact, this proved to be his last vehicle to be released for 10 years (it is painfully obvious here that his particular mark of folly would not pass muster in the age of Mel Brooks and Woody Allen)!
