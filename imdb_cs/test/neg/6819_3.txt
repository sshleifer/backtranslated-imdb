Certainly this movie may have its funny moments with the sat question people and I know that the movie doesn't have to be a totally believable movie made it too outrageous for example a girl like it never in a million years to go out a joke as a guy like that people in the movie there they had a faint performance that was so bad. Also, a conspiracy plot that could bring better work on the script at least, and focus more on comedy, was also a bit dry, and after the first few jokes it was really boring, it was like 10mins laughter, then the old one when it's over He started digging down the bottom line if u want aa bland acting mixed with silly plot and romance to continue and watch this movie.
