This movie has changed my life! Hogan's performance was nothing less than incredible, and I haven't recovered from his exclusion from the 1990 Oscar nominations. layers of success in film. If you haven't seen this movie, drop what you're doing right now and get a copy. I guarantee that it will blow your mind. And if you don't like it, then I only have one question for you .... Watcha does it when you run 24 inch pythons and Hulkamania!
