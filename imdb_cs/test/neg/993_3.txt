Monkees "Head" is one of those strange phenomena I have noticed - when something makes no sense, people will try to read things into it and give it great deep meanings that its creator never intended. This is the case here. The film is the spectacle of The Monkees, which is floating in various sketches, outages, sets, etc., Just like in a TV show. . But when the TV show was played for laughter, it does not seem to be played for anything but a deep, trippy, pseudo-intellectual state that this brand of psychedelia imposes. All in all, it is The Monkees who do the same schtick, but now it's "raising awareness" because the laughing route is removed. There is no humor or sense of the whole thing; It just drones on with colored lights. Music in "Head" should prove to anyone, beyond the shadow of doubt, that Monkees had no scrap of ability. The melodies are mostly garbage; The only one who is even listening is the "Porpoise Song", which opens and closes the film. But the thing is, it was Gerry Goffin-Carole King's song, and while it's above average for Monkees, it's a below average Goffin and King standard. It's like hearing one of Peter Gordon's old songs, written by Paul McCartney: maybe you think it's a pretty good song, but then you'll find out who folded it and you realize it's the way to go. Mike Nesmith's song may be clear, the rest is worthless. Davy Jones has, I think, what the filmmakers imagined as a "big number" in the picture, because it's the only song presented by As Show Biz and uncut to the film cut or dream sequence. because the song is not good. <br /> <br /> I have to admit I always liked it so the movie is really disappointing. Sure, they were kitsch, but they were so happy about it. They knew they were kitsch and were fine. But then they were ambitious. In "Head", they actually joke about being made a pop product, but the truth is they wanted something more. They wanted to be great musicians and taken seriously as artists. Maybe not like the Beatles, but something that was approaching. "Head" proves that they have failed in all numbers. 1 * of 4
