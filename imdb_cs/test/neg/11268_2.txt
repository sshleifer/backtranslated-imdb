If you're in the mood for really bad porn without good porn combined with a really bad horror movie, this movie is perfect for you. However, if you breathe air, make sure you spend time watching anything other than this. Negotiations are miserable. "Story" is lousy. He's trying too hard, and I've been waiting all the time for one good redeeming scene worth watching a movie. No way. Stick to the mixed cable.
