If Corky St. Claire ordered Blaine in a horror movie with comic undertones in FOR GUFFMAN'S WAITING, the result would be like MILPITAS MONSTER. To be generous, it was the longest hour and twenty minutes of film I've ever seen. To call the glacial pace to be kind. Almost no one who has joined this project has ever made another film with the exception of Ben Burtt, who has made a really admirable (with a budget) special effect. He went on to make sound for movies like MICHICH and several other major budget projects. The story is that it is a veteran voice actor, Paul Frees, who probably donated his efforts. When you watch the opening titles and see that Milpitas Unified School District is listed as one of the producers you know We go for a long, strange journey. Pollution at the landfill site in Milpitas, California becomes so toxic that it creates a monster. Remember that this is 1975 and ecology was a hot topic. Just a few years before, viewers were treated for GODZILLA VS. SMOG MONSTER. <br /> <br /> So far so good. A monster is a winged creature at least fifty meters tall and has the ability to tear the city apart. Instead, he steals garbage. The central prerequisite is the idea that this monster can walk through a small town and leave eight feet long behind, but no one has noticed them. There is a pretty conceived scene where they walk in the middle of the carnival at night, but no one will notice it. The only person who sees the monster until the final scenes is George, the drunken city. I hoped for the whole time, hoping, hoping George would be torn to pieces for the camera, but that didn't happen. Wire. In fact, no one is killed. George is reportedly sacrificing himself to save Priscilla (being tied to a helicopter to lure creatures - George smells worse than rubbish, and the monster is drawn to smell). students. There's a nice Priscilla and her unknown boy and some "bad" guys who (surprise, surprise) whip into shape to help defeat the monster in the final scenes. . He attacks the Browning-Ferris bin and leaves it next to the highway, but nobody notices. He goes through the carnival, again unnoticed. He tears the building (nice miniature work) and nobody sees it, but George. Then he attacks high school during the dance and grabs Priscilla and takes her as well as a very high monkey several times, most recently in the last winter. There are conspiracy ideas that come out of nowhere and are not dropped. Local citizens demonstrating at City Hall because they want to put their garbage cans back. A sophisticated secret monster weapon is flown by private plane, examined and forgotten. So why did I watch the whole thing? Because these people were so damn fun. I had the impression that firefighters were firefighters, entrepreneurs were filmed in their own offices, Priscilla could live well in this suburban house and people's yard scenes could be in their own shipyards. They don't have to be great actors, but they are real people. Nobody's amazingly good. In fact, I guess four out of five adults on the screen wear glasses. Since it is the mid-1970s, we see some really bad clothes and some men have terribly bad hair. One officer we met before meeting at Ciry Hall has such a loud tie and sportcoat that you think he's on the way to playing Marcellus in MUSIC MANUAL. Zero for the story. Two points for sometimes decent special effects. And two points that people in the community really got together and did it. They can actually say that they have been featured in the film; Despite lots of field experiences and backstage work on live TV, I can't say that and I'm happy for them. Do you remember these old movies with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland? At some point someone would say, "Let's go to the show! Aunt Edna has all the old dress in the attic, and we can use Uncle Ned's barn!" Then they would make 'neighborhood shows' with sets and costumes that would cost well on seven characters if they were duplicated today. This is the spirit that the good people of Milpitas had for this project, and bless them.
