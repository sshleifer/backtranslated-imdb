I watched this movie last night, I'm a huge book fan, and I was quite pleased with the version in which Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon played. But this is just awful. Oh my God, I don't understand how they dared to tear this classic story and put the characters in a completely different way, starting with the transition of Beth, the younger sister, and making Amy the third. Yeah, interpreting, terrible, Jo was a feminist, intelligent and a little angry young lady and actress who acted like Jo in this movie, acting like a foolish and very annoying girl. And what about Laurie going to war? I'm fine with the fact that when a book is made in a movie, some changes must be made, but not the whole story. very bad.
