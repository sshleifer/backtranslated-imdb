"Stories of Crapper" are bloody, disgusting, tasteless, offensive, lowbrow and scatological. But that's okay, I was ready for all of my previous Troma experiences. What I wasn't ready for is that it's also helpless, indecent and boring. Very little of the true anarchist spirit of movies as "Nuke'em High" remained intact; in his place we get the ENDLESS joke jokes (until you start to wonder if Lloyd Kaufman goes senile when he thinks adults will find a loud fart so damn cheerful!) and a cynical, blatant exploitation of the viewer who is basically investing time money to see "movie" that even Kaufman himself seems to have never been released in the first place. Oh yes, there is a lot of female nudity on display, but let's face it: the average porn movie is likely to offer a better story, higher production values, more fun humor, and above all more ANSWER for its intended viewer than this atrocity. Kelly Powers AKA Suzi Lorraine (blonde lesbian student in "How to Make Your Own Movie") is one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen.
