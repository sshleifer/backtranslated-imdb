GOLD RAIDERS (1951) <br /> <br /> A blunt western / comedy with The Three Stooges (including Shemp Howard, which I always enjoyed as the "third Stooge"), which makes its usual schtick, and directed by the normally reliable Edward Bernds who has also done some of his most beautiful classic shorts - so you have to wonder what's wrong this time around? The most likely answer is that what worked quite well as a 15-minute two-reel comes as too much for a 55-minute feature film. Unlike many of their classic shorts, the GOLD RAIDERS are not worth it to reappear. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of ****
