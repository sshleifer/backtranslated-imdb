I hated this. I just couldn't adapt to the story. it really didn't catch me. Michael Mann is a very good director, but I have to disagree. I'm also a fan of Daniel Lewis. some of the projects in which they are are nice rubbish, but his performances are great. My Favorite Movies Daniel Day Lewis are There Will Be Blood and Gangs of New York. <br /> <br /> There's one thing I loved about it and it was a musical score that gave the film a lot of atmosphere. that's probably all I liked about him. This movie also has a high vote that is a bit random. I see a fair couple of people like it, but not enough to make an overall rating of 7.8. <br /> <br /> I'd give this movie a miss if I was you, but there's a lot of high voices for this so I think you should watch it and do your own view of what you think. I really didn't like it ............. 4/10 ............. j.d Seaton
