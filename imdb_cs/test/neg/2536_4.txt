Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon start in Switzerland because Sherlock Holmes (Basil Rathbone), a world-leading detective, overtakes the Nazi and smuggles a brilliant scientist named Dr. Franz Tobel (William Post Jr.) from the country and to relative security from London. But is London as safe as Holmes thinks? Dr. Tobel has developed a revolutionary new bomb that will change the airspace bombing forever and agree to give it to the British government, but the Nazis want it just as badly and the enemy of Holmes, Professor Moriarty (Lionel Atwill), plans to steal the bomb's secret and sell it to the Nazis. Add a damping inspector, Lestrade (Denis Hoey) from Scotland Yard, a love interest from Dr. Tobela Charlotte Eberli (Kaaren Verne), killers, mysterious scientists and the mysterious coded message & Holmes has her work cut out to dr. Delivering His Look at the Bomb ... <br /> <br /> Directed by Roy William Neill Sherlock Holmes and Secret Weapon were the fourth of a series of fourteen Holmes films to be produced between 1939 and 1946 and featured Rathbone & Bruce as Holmes & Watson . Edward T. Lowe Jr.'s screenplay, Scott Darling & Edmund L. Hartmann, is based on the short film The Dancing Men by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and is not a tradition that Holmes murders a mystery because it is rather a war adventure story. To neglect what Holmes is all about, solving complex crimes and mysteries is a big mistake when it comes to me and the involvement of the Nazis and the war as the background of the story is in place, it is unpleasant I will not sit with me too well. Dialogue is not great, Professor Moriarty feels almost like an idea, as if they could not come up with a villain for him and as a whole he is much less engaging than others in the series. However, at least it's short. Director Neill does his usual executive job, but you have to cut it a little and remember that it was made over 60 years ago. He has no real style or imagination and lacks both the atmosphere and the intrigue. <br /> <br /> Technically, the film is fine, if it is not remarkable, black and white cinematography is fine, although I understand that a computerized color version is also available. . Acting is fine, Bruce & Hoey make their usual comic reliefs and Rathbone's hairstyle looks ridiculous and I'm glad he changed it for later installments. Sherlock Holmes and the secret weapon were disappointing compared to some other great entrances to the series, there is very little I can recommend and everything that makes others so good that they are missing. Leave this one to the end and watch the first of the best, just for hard fans.
