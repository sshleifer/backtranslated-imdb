I saw this movie n I can say it's a really bad movie. The director's gone nuts ... Of course he knows a lot about the army, but then he's definitely a cheap man. There's also a lot of technical bugs in the movies ... <br /> <br /> Well ... here's my doubt - in the end, when they save the family (including the girl who was just raped) ... your place? I've never seen an ambulance at all! There are a lot of aspects in the film that are real ... but then I wish the major to tell / help / help some other good director to shoot the movie. Mohanlal certainly deserves a better director!
