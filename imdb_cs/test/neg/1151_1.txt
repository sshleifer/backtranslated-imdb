First of all, I would like to start with the obvious: anti-Semitism is a serious problem throughout history, which is present in many societies and causes the deaths of millions of Jews. The problem with this film is that it looks at the United States - probably the most enjoyable society for Jews outside Israel - as a very different place from Nazi Germany. Set in 1943, the film is about a man (William H. Macy) who gets confused with a Jew after he starts wearing glasses! After that, a few very nasty things happen to him (he loses his job and can't find a new one, his neighbors avoided him, all ended up in a violent confrontation). From one of Arthur Miller's own regrets, encouraging novels that gave liberalism a bad name.
