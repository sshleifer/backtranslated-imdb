This was by far one of the worst movies starring Sandra Bullock. Ben Affleck should stay behind the camera and continue writing scripts. This is definitely his forte and not acting. Actually, I lasted 54 minutes for this movie before I was so bored that I was forced to leave the theater. Anyway, it's from start to start, but 54 minutes to film. The premise "Guess what happened to me on my way to ...." was done again and again to death. Somehow it just doesn't seem to be anything funny or romantic about how people cheat. Parents should be aware that this may not be a suitable film for your teenage kids, especially those that may be perceived as a hero. There is a scene where writers / producers / directors thought it would be nice to show how "acceptable" it is to smoke a joint .... during the procedure .... and then have no consequences at all when caught. I am no proud, and when I was younger, I smoked my share, but I guarantee that I will not take my teenagers to see it and are a solid A & B student. or "Hope Floats", which in my opinion are two of her best works.
