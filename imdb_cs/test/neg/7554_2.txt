The production values ​​in this video are so bad that they are unreadable. The performance placed second in the tremendously creative studio games, with about thirty special effects per minute. It is filmed through a cloud of smoke, just one or two seconds of duration per shot and often, background spotlights shine directly into the camera. Lighting was terrible for filming. There is a constant approach and delay with complete lack of visual continuity. There could be some good dance available to a live audience, but video viewers will never know.
