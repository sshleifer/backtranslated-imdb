Direction: E. Elias Merhige "Begotten" is an experiment with some interesting ideas that will not succeed in what they are trying to do. The film is a very slow, sporadically effective and irritating experience that attempts to present a fascinating philosophy about the creation of Earth and human nature. a man tearing his stomach with a knife. Blood and human waste emerge from the guts. He continues to impregnate the dead god's seed. Later she will give birth to the Son of Earth. A retard who is constantly being abused by a group of cannibalistic people that I believe to represent humanity. "Begotten" has a twisted and disturbing look at the origin of life. Demonstrating self-destructive nature, violence, lust and greed that have become a trademark of humanity. The problem in the film comes from two points. One is that the movie is too slow at the show. What we get is a good thirty minutes spent on how the Earth Son is constantly shaking naked on the ground while being humiliated and tortured. Such a hopeless extension is bored fast enough and lacks a blow in giving the viewer a blow. The next point is the visual appearance and sound of "Beggoten". The grainy, inverted, black and white low-frame cinematography fascinates the intrusive factor of conspiracy, but such news often works only in short periods. They gradually lose their effect as viewers get used to the look. The sound has the same problems. It is a constant recurring and similar sounds become uncomfortable, so I had to turn off the volume. "Begotten" loses its spell shortly after the start. He is trying to be original and creative, but he cannot extend to the thoughts outlined by a vague plot instead of repeating the same scene over and over. The conclusion is that "Begotten" is stuck in one moment. Although they will try to move forward, the visuals and sound will remain the same. Displaying the same action slightly differently, with slightly different sound. One trick can't make a movie. It also needs pace and variety, something Merhige seems to have forgotten.
