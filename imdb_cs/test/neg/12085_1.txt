If I heard the male leadership, he said, "That's madness!" I would come back again. The film is one big clich√©, with a false "grind it under the heel" attitude. Not one man in this film has one redeeming quality; it reminds me of Soviet films with strongly political messages. I couldn't even understand why there was attraction between the bow and I couldn't wait for the end.
