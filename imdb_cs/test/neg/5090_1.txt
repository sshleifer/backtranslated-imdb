This is by far one of the most boring movies I've ever seen! And if you don't believe me I'm going into it and watching it for myself. <br /> <br /> The movie starts slowly, the story doesn't make any sense. People are fighting do not make sense. I couldn't make sense of what they were talking about during the movie (I didn't even bother in most cases). New Zealand looks amazing. Everything else is upset. Actors are trying to keep us awake, but unfortunately you go to sleep instead. Do us a favor, even if it gets on "On Demand", Don't WATCH IT!
