One of the worst movies I've ever seen. When I tried to watch this, I had the flu and I was quite open to think it was fun. Unfortunately, it was too much. How can there be so many clumsy actors in one movie? This film makes porn look like a European art film. The cast only speaks their lines without emotions; Special thanks go to Charlie Snows (Baldwin), a former wife who talks about her divorce just like the rest of us about the weather. Just awful (and funny). With plenty of booze and friends it could be just a background fun and a few laughs, as well as Ed Wood's movies. The plot is a joke and a soundtrack right from some cheeky soap opera. Hopefully no one has paid for this movie. <br /> <br />
