This film hit the movie screen on June 6, 1980, starring Stephen Macht as Sergeant Thor, Avery Schreiber as Captain Comelius Butt, J.D. Hinton as Buzz and Play Playmate of the Year Dorothy Stratton. The image begins with a police endless roaming space looking for a criminal. The ship is suddenly attacked by an unknown spaceship. He enters Sergeant Thor and his partner Buzz, trying to figure out who the unknown ship belongs to. When they fail to call Captain Comelius, who instructs his crew to fight. She enters the magnificent Dorothy Stratton, who plays the role of Galaxina, a man-made robot. Now a few thoughts in this picture. This movie was a stupid plan and it's one of the reasons I don't get into Sci-Fi. If you're on Sci-Fi, you should notice that the laser sound effects were borrowed from the early Sci-Fi movie Battlestar Galactica, which aired in theaters in 1978. A Sci-Fi movie that aired back in 1966 with Star Trek. Now, because I bought this movie, Dorothy Stratton. She's beautiful in one suit. I think her talent has been wasted in this picture and she should never be involved in such waste. Connie Sellecca was also considered for the role and her talents would be wasted as well. In the picture, I myself give this film 1 weasel star and I give her 10 weasel stars on Dorothy Stratton, though she didn't deserve to get into a garbage movie like this. If you like pictures like this, you can get a DVD version of Amazon.com
