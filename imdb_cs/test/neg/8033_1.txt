Even Mel Gibson couldn't save this film slop. That was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Why would Gibson make a movie that could definitely not sit and watch? what it was? A total boob on some heavy drugs chasing a schizophrenic lady who was also on some heavy illicit street drugs. For all viewers on heavy drugs; you will love this movie.
