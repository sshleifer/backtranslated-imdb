This movie is a pity, especially with regard to Andrzej Wajda is not an amateur but a professional director. However, this film cannot bring anything you could expect. First, I'm Polish, so I can tell the whole story because I read the books. But how can you say there is a war from this movie - a bunch of people going back and forth, some soldiers screaming ... Is it really World War II or soldiers on vacation? Negotiations and Dialogues - Poor, Poorly Poor. A. Å½mijewski, D.Stenka, M.Komorowska, W.Kowalski, A.Chyra throws into their roles, the rest of the (Polish) cast is out of place (especially M.Ostaszewska, one of the leading characters, what an unfortunate choice). 99% of the dialogues are not spoken, they are simply placed there, the actors have had difficulty performing and it is no wonder what special things they had to say. And that leads us to the most beautiful problem - you can't feel it. Everything is so theatrical, artificial. There is no real life, there is no feeling in it. There are many original shots from World War II and guess what material is much stronger, more dramatic than what A.Wajda did. I see only one positive - despite historical mistakes (as acronym ZSRR; it was created for propaganda purposes after 1945, to please Polish, that ZSRS was gone, and now there was ZSRR, but there in 1940 there there was no ZSRR!) Fortunately, it is undoubtedly shown that the Katyn was killed by the Soviets (yes, it's a fact, not some controversial gossip). Great, two hours for a 5-10 minute scene. Anyway - time and potential unnecessary. This is a tragedy of epic proportions, the will to fight in 1939 (barely shown), failure to notify the war against the Soviet Union by the Polish authorities (sic! Not shown here), imprisonment of soldiers shortly thereafter, living in outrageous conditions (not listed here), hope and fear of what next time (barely shown), and then ... extermination. Hand with Germans - The Soviets exterminated the Polish nation, targeting the people who formed the backbone of Poland. Unfortunately, they are doing well and the results are still visible today.
