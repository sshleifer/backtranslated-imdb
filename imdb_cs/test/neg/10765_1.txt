This is by far the most repulsive and appalling version of the Scarlet Pimpernel ever being designed. As a Pimpernel fan, I was sincerely offended by what they did with the characters - but this atrocity is not worth it when you don't know the story. , never stab people in the back just to get down the hall. Chauvelin would never have a chain of women in his bed. Marguerite has never had an affair with Chauvelin, nor Armand with Minette, whatever the hell. Chauvelin wouldn't accidentally shoot Tony in the head. Chauvelin's name is neither, nor was it, Paul. They completely eradicated any reference to Pimpernel's disguises, instead replaced by James Bond-esque and gizmos. Women look like clowns. The beauty of Elizabeth McGovern is randomly roaming around her face. Poor, malevolent actors have no scenario they could work with, so it's not their fault that their characters are as thin as damp tissue paper. Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. Dialogue is unbearable. And who is responsible for all those little headlines at the bottom of the screen should be forced to watch this movie as repentance. (In the first half hour, before I gave up, I counted 13 subtitles. As if we couldn't figure out that the watercourse between England and France is England's channel.) <br /> <br /> that it is really just a filter videotape - it is completely without redeeming value. Don't waste your time and brain cells on this reddish drivel - instead, go watch the 1982 Anthony Andrews / Jane Seymour version, or the 1934 Leslie Howard movie, or really something, but this one.
