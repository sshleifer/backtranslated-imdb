Terror! I've seen a lot of gore movies in my day, but this just makes me gag with laughter rather than repulsion. This is definitely a crazy movie and is a very low budget, maybe I would add, but if you are able to look for cheap audio, horrible dialogues, nasty girls, apparently fake gore scenes and the overall hoarseness of the movie, then you may find that some of this movie are somewhat fun. The story is about a killer cat who goes to a killing spree each "5th, 5th, 5th year" (wow, how original) and that's up to two detectives (one of them gave brave efforts to make a good one crack dialogue) to stop the murderer from bloody fury. Killing scenes (which are done with a plastic toy knife) are quite brutal (which is a good thing), but very annoying due to the constant repetition of an apparently recorded scream (which is a very piercing ear). As for gore, there's a lot, but it looks very fake; especially blood - dude, c'mon, purple blood? But if you are a fan of gore videos like me, then you will find something in this video to respect as me (crap-talking detective ... he is the best thing that goes on this movie). Other than that, all you find is a lot of senseless nudity (which is also a good thing, but too bad girls are OOOGLY) and a very idiotic hippie necrophiliac serial killer. Sorry, but this is shit.
