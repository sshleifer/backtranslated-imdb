This movie wasn't the best ... but there were some good actors in it. Isiaiah Washington was quite good as a homeless guy, Guy Torrey was good as his handicapped brother, Ice-T was funny as a landlord and surprisingly ... actress Tami Roman was good as a judge in the movie. I didn't even know it was her and I was a real fan of the real world. She was absolutely believable. Hopefully this film does not prevent these actors. I know Isiaiah has left this film far beyond the success of Gray's anatomy, Ice-T with his regular role on the NYPD Special Unit and Tami Roman landed on a repetitive role on Sex Love and Secrets. I wish the same to other actors because one bad movie is NOT a bad actor.
