There are shows and movies I've seen, and then I read the reviews on IMDb.com I disagreed with and I was happy to agree that there was a difference in opinion. The positive reading of this dirt review only makes me aware of a sinister conspiracy involving TV network staff who are ordered to browse the Internet, disclosing unconvincingly positive reviews for the programs for which they are responsible. How else would someone explain the review that this show is "sure it will become a phenomenon" all year after it is clear that it will be nothing like that? I will not waste words describing this mess, but let's just say, if you like, the wives who radiate their husbands, the husbands who exploit their sons, the children who are disrespectful of bullying towards their parents and absolutely no another thread of behavior or subtext that would legitimize characters that are basically just incompetent machines that act as one liner, and then watch this sh OW. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, I have some Seinfeld DVDs to get through. <br /> <br /> Futurama - Canceled. TItus - Canceled. Arrested Development - Canceled. War at home - restored. No justice.
