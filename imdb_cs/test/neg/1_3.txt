This is a pale imitation of "officer and master." There is no chemistry between Kutcher and an unknown woman who plays his love interest. The dialogue is wooden, the situation is hacking. It's too long and the peak is anti-climactic (!). I like USCG, his men and women are fearless and tough. Action scenes are amazing, but I'm afraid this movie doesn't do much. The script is formal but confusing. Kutcher's character tries to redeem for an accident that wasn't his fault? Costner is raging against dying light, but why? His 'conflict' with his wife is about as deep as a mud puddle. I saw this creeping preview for free and I certainly felt I had my money.
