Some movies are off-beat but enjoyable, but many movies are just amazingly weird. "Motorama" fits no-so nicely into the second category. Many of them like it because of endless guest appearances and a complete lack of meaning, but these two things can only have a movie so far, and "Motorama" just has no other merit on its credit. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" looks forward to the unlikely plot. Her main character, Gus, is a 10-year-old roadtrip cussing across an imaginary country trying to collect game pieces and win $ 500 million. When interacting with adults, it seems that none of them noticed or cared about being 10 years old. Initially it is incredibly funny, but it quickly becomes too unbelievable, especially with regard to the people you enter, and the fact that it seems to be so concerned about the many disturbing images they make around it. Gus has no depth, and as an anti-hero who has no problem causing suffering for others to get their pieces, it's hard to excuse him when he encounters problems. <br /> <br /> This problem is provided. Anyone who has killed a guest performance has noticed more and more with Gus. Aside from the fact that the characters that were already worn, even more incredible and less entertaining, the characters share Gus' lack of depth and are as constant. The character's activities can be a little interesting, but the actors don't add anything to them, so they negate the whole point of getting big names (they could all play and the character would be the same). It seems that these guest appearances have been signed more for marquee value than anything else. <br /> <br /> "Motorama" should be interesting - it's a unique idea, but there is too little semblance of sense of work in the script. Incidents that should have a lasting impact on the anti-hero and viewer, as the film quickly passes from incident to incident, in the hope that something will eventually get the audience to Gus sorry or understanding. This will never happen, because nothing will be allowed to connect, it just jerks back and forth, as if it were on the conveyor belt, one incident after another. With a story that is so nonsensical, it ceases to be fun, and the main character, who never develops to take care of himself or anyone else at a higher level, has nothing to offer except slapping and trying to get rich. Why should we care?
