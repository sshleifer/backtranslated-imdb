To call "Rocketship XM" sci-fi classic is due to its release date (1950), its subtle ability to capitalize on the publicity for "Moon Destination", and the appearance of actors who would later star on TV as Mike Sea Hunt Nelson, Rockford's dad and Wyatt Earp. The film itself is bad enough to be a good feed for MST3K and is best viewed with a commentary from Joel and the robots. This is the type of film that is most suitable for adding riffs from MST3K characters; something preaching, slow, badly written and full of painfully bad acting. While unintentionally funny things like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" do not match satirical commentaries (because the film keeps upstages hosts), really bad and boring movies like "Rocketship X-M" are ideal. So if you are watching MST3K, add some asterisks to the rating. The basic story has a crew of unplanned turn on the moon and ends up on Mars. What they find on this planet are the remnants of human civilization that was destroyed by the atomic war. Only one Martian is depicted in detail, a normal-looking woman who is blind or at least has no pupils in her eyes. Men look like "goons" in old Popeye cartoons, they agilly agilly around reefs and throw boulders on the crew with amazing accuracy - especially if they're to be blind. Of course, none of this is ever explained because it would require some sign of logical analysis from the script writers. The scenes on Mars are presented in something called "Sepia Color" to distinguish themselves from the rest of the black and white film. If you think you are the "Wizard of Oz", you will be disappointed because it is just a black and white thing with a slightly brown shade added to the postproduction print. In line with the moronic sexism of the film, the icy female scientist screws her fuel calculations-how she comes and goes. Her inability to measure to men causes her female side to surface and she and Mike Nelson coo sweetly to each other as they face their fate (insert the gag sound here). The real movie stars are reporters of the command center. So much that MST3K was inspired specifically to greet these unheralded heroes. The intrepid team of "journalists" appears for the first 10 minutes of the film, then become about 12 inches behind the technician and the monitoring center at the command center. Later, they are asked to ask about the moronic issues that the mission director needs to portray the already too obvious message of the film. <br /> <br /> The DVD has an extremely low sound level, is not a caption and is accompanied by a trailer. Even if you are grateful that it is only 77 minutes, it is still about 60 minutes too long, because any 30-minute episode "The Twilight Zone" has several times more content than the entire movie. Then what do I know? I'm just a child.
