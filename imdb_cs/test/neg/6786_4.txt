* SPOILERS! * When I first saw a preview of it, it looked like a good old-fashioned hallmark movie. I like bluegrass music so I couldn't wait to see it. When we rented the movie, we read it and sounded even better. The movie was quite boring for the first half, every now and then it will play the song. Then (I am embarrassed to write this) lesbian love saw came in. I was there that there was something more than friendship between teachers, but I certainly did not expect nudity and prolonged interview sessions. I watched it with my mother and I was quite embarrassed because I chose this movie. But besides, it was a good movie. The actress was fine, the actress who played Deladis was great. To be honest, the soundtrack was the best part of the movie. I don't care to see the movie again, but I bought a soundtrack the day after I saw the movie. And the disks follow. If I were you, I'd skip the movie and just get the music.
