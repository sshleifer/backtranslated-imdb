My friends and I are always on the lookout for chuck norris movies just bash and make fun. One of our favorite favorites is Lonewolf. I went to a Christmas shopping wal-mart and came across this movie at 5.99 bin. I had to get it. I had great hopes for this movie, and although we are occasionally very happy, we agreed that the bells of innocence are the worst movie we've ever seen, made, produced, invented, etc. ... who the hell would think it was a good idea . not only is it sometimes confusing, but acting is hard to follow. the man who plays the eagle can act against my own vomit, and this chuck plunged into this, not the greatest actor, but this was terrible. and what names are oren, conrad and jux ........ jux. come to people. If you sincerely thought that this movie was at all observable, great for you because it was hard for me and I was serious about having headaches and stomach pain after watching. I'm telling you, if you haven't seen this movie, no. For the love of God, please do not succumb to such horrible 90 minutes of your life.
