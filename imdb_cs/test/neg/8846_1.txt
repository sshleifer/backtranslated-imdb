Forget the miserable behavior that can be forgiven in this kind of movie. Or even horrible, unnatural dialogue and illogical events (if my headlines really reflected what was said). Much worse is the ruthless absence of a clever or experienced director who could go on a film with the editor during the holiday season? Watching the movie, it's totally outdated, though it was 'just' 7 years ago. Computer Virus as an Afterlife Portal? lol? Dial-up Internet? On the pictures ("On! Look there ... it's ... it's a face?" -Ooom on the face -Oops, the sound breaks - "take" - other scenes -), scenes and scenes are badly edited and as a result, it is not worth it. You will be looking at a girl who still hangs a corpse from one knot in one scene, and then, after ten seconds, she sees it again in a spot that is clearly intact, smiles and goes on. In addition to the many problems I have with the film in terms of production value, they are also painfully long and repetitive and so totally boring. <br /> <br /> I recommend "Shutter" instead of Oriental (Thai) horror movie. .
