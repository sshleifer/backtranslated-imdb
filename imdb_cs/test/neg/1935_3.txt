I saw it when it came back in the theaters back in 1996. I remember I was already familiar with the work of Elijah Wood (that's right, he did things before "The Lord of the Rings"!) And the merchandising ties were pretty abundant (the water "Flipper" syringes were in circulation. The adults were alerted to old movies and TV shows, and because of their nostalgia, their children looked around who were excited because it was a dolphin movie and a stupid boy. Unfortunately, it wasn't what anyone expected and dropped sharply. You know the film is in trouble when a boy swims away from a Hammerhead shark in the middle of the ocean, and a shark frightens a box of dolphins and a baby - instead of getting out of the water - floats in the water in five minutes thanking his dolphin for his rescue. .. apparently not taking into account that the shark is still out, maybe even under him. Another problem is Paul Hogan. She looks old, crunchy and tired of recycling his Croc Dundee shtick. No one even remembered the "crocodile Dundee" much less Hogan, and I expected him to suddenly start pretending he didn't know what the hair dryer was because of the laughter between the fish and the social satire. . All this is a really bad "family" movie that is amateurish and hard to watch sometimes. I hated it when I saw it in theaters in '96 and I hate it more now.
