To put it simply, Menia's mind is the worst, wildest show on Comedy Central and maybe the whole television ... ever. I love Comedy Central and I watch a lot of shows and movies all the time, but every time the introduction for this show starts after some good comedy, I can't find the remote control fast enough. Mencia tells the used, worn-out racial jokes in a bad attempt to be controversial, then points to the ethnic background he just spoke about in the audience as if to say they liked it, so your entire race she likes it and by also extending me. . Give me a break Mencia, I don't know if these people are plants or not, but just because after one of their ridiculous jokes you go to a black man and high five, doesn't mean he thinks you're funny. Does that mean you put him in place and what else will he do, sweep you off on TV? He gives the impression that his jokes are deep, meaningful and provocative, which is evident in his commercials, but when in fact you watch the show almost 100% of what he says is common sense. He also claims that only clever people get some of his jokes, but you don't have to be any smarter than monkeys to understand what he said when he says it, maybe you need to go to finish 3rd grade Carlos. The guy says he says what others think, but I think you'll find that if someone was thinking what they were saying, they found it ridiculous, so they never said it first. <br /> <br /> All in all, watch 1 episode and do with it if you have to, because after you've seen 1 episode, you've seen them all. Why Comedy Central is constantly renewing this terrible show is far behind me. If you are looking for a good comedy, look elsewhere because you will find very little.
