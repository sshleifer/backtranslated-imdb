This film seems to have been created for the sake of annoyance. All I hate about movies is present: false sentimentality, extreme grimness, bad child actors and more. This is ignoring the fact that it depicts extreme ignorance of American sports fans, with many of the cast claiming that football is lemon-shaped. What?! This is the Rugby ball. The story follows a group without hope that gets a new teacher they like (who, by chance, teaches a class in a short skirt) and gets them interested in football. Of course, it's all garbage (remember there are no hopes) except one guy who moved from El Paso. Blah Blah, etc. Etc. And children are still not good footballers, but good hearts follow, and no hope will change into a lot of well-rounded children. Hell, even adults are getting around; drunks are turned into caring parents, illegal immigrants are released from the hook ... moans. <br /> <br /> This movie stars Steve Guttenberg. Now, just hurry from your local video store to take a copy, hold for a minute. Guttenberg is waste. No no; let's admit it, how did this guy ever get into the movie? I have no idea whatsoever and there is nothing in this movie that will help me. Olivia d'Abo plays alongside Steve and doesn't impress. It seems that he is just going through the movements and looking nice. Although I have no problems with the second part; her movie performance is not credit. The child actors who make up the rest of the cast are as bad as you would expect from a movie. Most of them are disgusting and / or unpleasant. There is a goat in the movie who plays the mascot and does a good job; but you won't see a movie for a goat, so don't bother to see this movie.
