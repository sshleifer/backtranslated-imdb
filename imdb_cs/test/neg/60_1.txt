I'm getting sick from movies that entertain one-line synopsis, then I end up just like what you would find at the bottom of the compost pile. Who knows: "Maybe it sounded interesting in the playground for the studio, even with" big name cast "(like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink, winking) and the sparkling hobby of Hildegard Knef (I don't know, any woman. But on the film, it just falls apart faster than a paper-mache statue in a thunderstorm.These unhappy people seem to be trapped in an island mansion off the east coast, and one of them (woman, which I guess) is directed by the Satanic cult to carry the child of hell, while others are offended in grotesque, torturous ways. <br /> <br /> Well, here's the cross section of "The Exorcist", "The Omen", "The One Little Indians "and a few other smaller films in Satanic believers. Amok line. None of them are very entertaining and most of the time you cover the scene until it is over. <br /> <br /> Not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff doesn't help much, it's just to pick up a paycheck and a badge that it would be very important for them to give them "everything". <br /> <br /> From this perspective, Hasselhoff probably wishes to return to beack with Pam Anderson (and who can blame him) ?) and Linda ... well, who knows; Celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is that is nowadays. And torture scene! Ecchhhh. You will see how people close their mouths, hang in the drones, hover in the trees in thunderstorms, boats pour out of their throats, etc. Sheesh and I thought "Mark the Devil" was the most sadistic movie I saw ... . <br /> <br /> Don't bother. It's not worth your time. I can't believe I told you as much as I did. If you watch it, you'll see if you can calculate clich√©s. And yes, Blair is obsessed, as if you didn't see a marching band on the main street. <br /> <br /> No stars. "Witchcraft" - these witches itch you.
