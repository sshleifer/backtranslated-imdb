I liked most of this movie. As stated in other reviews, it has a good cast, the plot is interesting enough. All in all, it's fun to watch. But the end, I think it's totally spoiled, it left me confused. Yes, do you expect people to stretch in this film and overlap each other, but four times? Well, if that's justified by conspiracy, why not? But that's the wrong part, it's not even needed. After a while, it's all that makes sense. (Here comes SPOILER). Enrico and his accomplices have money on the airport scene. I couldn't understand that it was needed. Is it all necessary to wipe Federico's nose into the fact that he was confused? I'm not buying it. So 6 out of 10 on 3/4 film and 2 out of 10 on the end.
