First, let me make it clear that I'm a big fan of bad science fiction, especially when it comes to gigantic monsters. But this is so fantastic lame that I can't even make myself wrong. They apparently did not shave enough money off of the budget by converging on the props (only support we must show the size of a foreign girl's excessive novelty pencil, available at Spencer's Gifts for about fifteen dollars), they also decided not. to spend on concept or conspiracy. In my opinion, the monster looks fine, but it does not have enough interaction with the background, ie there is not enough destruction to suit most fans of the genre. The general rule of giant monster movies is: If you don't have a lot of fake-looking buildings to break, then you'd rather have another fake-looking monster you want to fight. This movie doesn't. I can't make a last complaint about a movie without giving away the end, but just telling the origin of the monster and the method that got rid of it just doesn't hold the water. Even most of these movies. Skip it.
