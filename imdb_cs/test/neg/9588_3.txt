This film attempts to pinch the era of Hollywood and morality in the 1950s. Guy Stone is intended to be a Rock Hudson, but Matt Letscher, both screenplay and actor, ends up instead of directing an incredible, cruel, baritone-like version of George Hamilton, which makes it unpleasant. Guy Stone is such a shameful human being that viewers have problems with this human skin waste. Unlike Hudson, who was sweetly promiscuous, Stone is a hateful man who consciously uses and then discards the sweet, handsome young men who share his bed every few hours. Veronica Cartwright is Jerry, Stone is a celibate lesbian manager. Cartwright is very good, but the director doesn't know what to do with her. The mistake lies in a dialogue that is a bit clunky, and the film suffers for it. Carly Preston's Sally owes more Ellen Greene to "The Little Shop of Horrors". As it is written, Preston's Sally is good for laughter, but little else. Newcomer Adam Greer is lost in this film. He can't act, and he seems to have been cast for his hot body and good looks. Like many recent films, "Straight-Jacket" is a "drama" - a comedy movie that switches Drama about two-thirds of the film's journey chaotically. And like almost all dramas, "Straight-Jacket" fails miserably. Despite the expensive Skywalker Sound services, the sound quality of the film leaves a lot of desire. Excessive use of the music soundtrack also creates a disruptive amount of cues. The film really couldn't satirize anything about the fifties. Unlike "Singin 'in the Rain", which perfectly captures Hollywood's ambivalence about the arrival of sound, as well as the learning mentality of form films, "Straight-Jacket" can't describe Hollywood well in the 1950s. The dialogue, files and behavior of key characters are indescribable rather than dead stereotypes of the 1950s in Hollywood. The same can be said for the lampooning of general mores, social trends and fads of the 1950s as a whole. Compare the transformation of Guy's house with a dead satire in the '50s' Little Shop of Horrors. No comparison; "Little Shop" hits a nail on the head, while "Straight-Jacket" doesn't even know it's a nail. Such motivations seem to be random. Rick Foster is believed to be a principled liberal, yet he almost immediately reaches a materialistic schmuck like Guy Stone. Rick is fine with Guy's status for many months. But when it comes time to go to Italy, it becomes a conflict for reasons that are completely unclear. And while Sally seems to be in love with Freddie during the party, this plot just disappears a few minutes later without comment. Rick leaves as a 90s homosexual, not a 1950s homosexual. Indeed, modern morality is losing this film - which should not be if it were a truly satirical view of homophobia in Hollywood in the 1950s. Saul repeatedly says that he will transfer Freddie Stevens to the federations, but he will never do that - he will allow Freddie to knock out Guy. Jerry and Saul's plot "in" Guy never makes any sense, nor does Sally's sudden decision to take the blame. And although Guy admitted he was a homosexual, he probably didn't matter and eventually ends up with a famous star and playwright. Unfortunately, none of the production values ​​can save this film. Cameraman Michael Pinkey is a pedestrian. The movie sometimes looks more like a movie game than a movie (especially the scenes in Saul's office). Everything is limited to medium frames and the film has an incredibly static charge. Cut Chris Conlee makes no movie. Long scenes that could benefit from inserting details or shifts in the view remain uncontrolled. Whether it's due to lack of coverage or poor editing is not clear, but the overall effect is to create a feeling of lethargy. The film relies on CGI's effects of Guy's home, created by the visual effect of designer Thomas Dickens. But CGI looks clumsy and hokey, and it is very noticeably amateurish. My overall impression of this movie is that jokes are cheap and easy, conspiracy confused, characterization wildly inconsistent and by the way brand, satire do not exist, performances go beyond and beyond the mark, and comic timing away. It's almost amateur movie. It's like someone took production in high school and threw $ 10 million for that.
