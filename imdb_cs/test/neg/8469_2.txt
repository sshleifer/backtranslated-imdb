I found that this film is extremely interesting, but a little tired, talking about violence and what it does, I still don't see the point of becoming a terrorist to stop terrorists. We have similar people in the United States and other countries that justify the use of violence and tactics because they think they're right. Remember the Puritans and the Christian Crusades against Islamic people during the Middle Ages. Lots of blood and death far outweigh today's violence, the western world has a negative impact on religion. I do not justify their actions, but Western culture has had a very negative impact in the past. But still remember that most Islamic people are PEACE! People of any nation feel some patriotism, but start a war about being right and need to reconsider your mistake. Again, you can't stop the terrorists by becoming like them.
