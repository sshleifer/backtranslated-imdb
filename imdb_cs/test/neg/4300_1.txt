Wow. They told me it was wrong, but I had no idea. We started tradition. We found one copy of this movie and we hand it over in person. The filmmaker watches and then passes it on to someone else who is considered worthy to see this unique, creative, horrible film. Hopefully he will travel around the world several times. It's painful. Really painful. It's even so bad that it's funny. Well, sometimes it's so bad, it's funny. But most of the time, it makes you feel like there's something inside yours that sucks in your brain. Wow. Watch it, then go through it.
