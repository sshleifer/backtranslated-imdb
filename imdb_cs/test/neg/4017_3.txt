A pretty horrible movie about a few unbalanced young people in the car starts quite well, but it becomes more bizarre and hard to swallow as it progresses. Rachel Leigh Cook is the only highlight in the gentle and sexy performance, but I would recommend this movie only to those who are hard actress fans.
