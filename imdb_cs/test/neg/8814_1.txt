I am a great horror enthusiast, especially from the 1980s. One Name? I guess I saw it. Last year, a new little horror scene was about to hit theaters, which seemed to slide under the mainstream radar called "Saw." I was slightly excited. When I heard nothing of it, I thought it looked promising, judging by the previews and posters (well, with the exception of the back and white with separate arms and legs ... those who looked horrible!) . It was one of the worst experiences of my life. This film was literally mentally and mentally painful to watch. Because it was scary? ... NO! Because it was one of the worst movies I've ever had when I saw it! First, the design of the script and the cut was absolutely cruel, even horror film standards. Based on the sequence in the victim's examination room (Shawnee Smith), who recently survived the serial killer's attack, she showed a memory of what she had survived? NOT SCARY! It was impossible to feel any type of tension when they knew that the above victim was perfectly fine. Sure, the inverted bear thing was scary ... but why should I feel the least scared when CLEARLY, you just showed me that she survived the suffering? Unfortunately, the whole film was constructed in this way. It starts with two guys in the cellar. Then, they show flashbacks as they were kidnapped ... not SCARY! Why? Because we already know what happens to them when we see the result of the attack. THEY ARE IN COMFORT! Continue with the story! Even more unfortunately, the real story was at best skinny. I couldn't worry less about these unpleasant, pitiful excuses for "characters" and acting didn't help. Cary Elwes was largely solid and then suddenly started crying like a lost child while trying to keep his American accent in tact (the audience I saw was not in the stitch). That led him to a rash and an idiotic decision, even if it doesn't make the simplest. He had other options. Better. SMARTER ONES. Even with his intense emotional state (severely communicated through terrible action), it was still irrational. I didn't buy it. BAD WRITING ALERT! In addition, although certain sequences were played directly and without recoil, they were painfully predictable. I kept waiting impatiently for my leg, waiting for the stupid sequence to end. It happened for the whole movie. I've seen every "twist." Twenty minutes into the movie I already called the killer's identity, not to mention his connection with his "accomplice" as SOON, as they appeared on the screen. Better acting could obscure the horrible scenario. Instead, actors could also have "RED-HERRING" or "ACCOMPLICE" tattooed over their foreheads. By the end of the movie, I was absolutely outraged I even wasted a fragment of my Life on this film and the whole theater was laughing hysterically in a totally terrible final. Seriously, you think they were watching Monty Python. I would also laugh if I wasn't so angry if the film couldn't be fulfilled completely. When we left, there was (without a joke) a line that would talk to the theater manager to give them back money (they didn't). I was absolutely positive that the movie would be a bomb at the box office. The following week he couldn't imagine my shock to find out that "Saw" hit number one at the box office and everyone talked about it (mostly individuals who found that "Napoleon Dynamite" is an epic story that provokes thoughts and "satire" was some kind of rubber). I'm so sick to hear people praise this movie, which I often felt like I wanted to vomit. It's fun for the poorest and simple minds of man. Those who find some strange Jigsaw clown-puppet riding on a tricycle threatening (is this a doll? Knock it up and leave what's so scary about it?). Don't get me wrong, I own every "Friday, 13", I love my movie splashes, thought "Napoleon Dynamite" was jolly, I can't get enough of Freddy, Michael, Pinhead, or Leatherface, have awards for the unknown horror jewels and the rank of "Sleepaway Camp II: The Unfortunate Campers" among my Top 10 Favorite Slashers, but I realize that these movies are not the most sophisticated American cinematography, I appreciate them for what they are "quick and easy fun". The film attempts to be intelligent and semi-sophisticated, ugly little excitement ride, and peat bogs to irritating, annoying loss of time, money, energy, and cellulose. Shame on all of you. <br /> <br /> I see "Saw II"? Maybe after I took a double-shot of Liquid Drano before my eyes were irritated and they punched pale, hot peaches on the shish kebab in my ears and colon. My rating: 0/10. Avoid at any cost.
