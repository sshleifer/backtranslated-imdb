So ... this is what the SXSW and Sundance Film Festival art, huh? I suppose I can relate as long as the story, script, dialogue, gaming (except Mrs. Aselton), cinematography and editing are completely irrelevant. I remember telling other filmmakers for several years that the biggest problem with digital video was that we would now have to wake up to the future sea of ​​crap, to get to anything worth watching, that anyone and his brother (or the Duplass brothers) could run away and make a movie. "Puffy Chair." Do I need to say more? This feature length video is another chapter in the dismal, ever-expanding world of "dudeology" films; young guns armed with DVX100A, a few thousand dollars, a hastily written, shallow script, and some friends who call actors who choose one afternoon to make a film and voilà!, a video creator. Don't get me wrong - I'm about an independent film (ie Hollywierd sucks). But when we say it, you can't argue with some of the facts of this system. <br /> <br /> If Duplass Brothers had to go out and raise the real budget and bring in real producers, its clear scenario would never have been ecologically lit! And that's the problem. There is no such thing as the process of checking for films (sorry ... videos) ready for production. Just grab the DV / P2 camera and turn it off! Worse still, such festivals, as mentioned above, really support and support this kind of nonsense. And why? Exactly because it has no budget. I believe it is important, especially in today's independent film climate, to stop allowing video creators to call this language "filmmakers". There's quite a difference in my book. When you have to go out and actually put your script on the line, ask friends and family or entrepreneurs for real money to make the feature "movie", knowing the potential losses at stake, then you will know what it means to be a "filmmaker." But a few hundred on Sam's Club for some DV tapes, some soda and chips don't cut it. Oh ... and by the way ... I must mention how uncomfortable it was to listen to a woman who was called "dude" throughout the movie. Even Mark Borchardt reserves that the intensely overused moniker for his friends is only where he is at least persistent, where his friend Mike is concerned. , no-budget videos for what they are, and at the same time swearing prestigious festivals for giving such occasional efforts, high praise. Either that or ask these festivals to at least politely add a new category to their festival lines ... "Dude Films."
