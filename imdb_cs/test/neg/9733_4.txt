Essential Summary: Ipswitch used to be a community of witches and escaped Salem witch hunting by creating a secrecy contract. The first-born men of these families have supernatural powers and must cope with the seductive, addictive nature of using these forces. Well, I usually give movies to benefit from doubts and start from a 5, from there: <br /> <br /> Production: -1 for a very obvious sync sound, +1 for a nicely done special effects, the darkness actually gave me frost, +0.5 for nice coloring (I like dim blue), -0.5 for silly sound track, +0.5 for opening sequence - I'm crazy for stylish composition and opulent title design. Story / Script: +1 for a decent main idea, -0.5 for DBZ / Matrix / Street Fighter ripoff / pastiche, -1 for unexplained some fiber threads very well (spiders, darkening) - 1 for a boring, predictable ending, -1 for unjustified exposure, both on-screen words and as a faint monologue <br /> <br /> Acting / Characterization: -0.5 for bad acting, even if it's a bit better as the movie progresses, -1 for lac to develop characters, especially among all women <br /> <br /> Other: +1 for gratuitous nudity of men and women, which is fun to watch and +0.5 for no sex scenes Which are for this genre usually done very badly and end up boring rather than hot, +1 for hitting your target audience, teen sci-fi / horror / thriller fans, although this movie is not exclusively one of these genres. Conclusion This is not a "movie", it's a movie. There's really nothing to analyze, it's just good, (relatively) pure fun. Lots of really attractive actors and actresses. Lots of DBZ and Street Fighter boys. If you like cute actors and actresses, supernatural special effects and / or thoughtlessly fun plot, this movie is for you. If you prefer Oscar-worthy, wonderfully-produced movie masterpieces with tons of multi-layered, allegorical plot threads and groundbreaking visualization techniques, you'll probably not like this movie. <br /> <br /> With my twisted logic, the movie gets 4/10.
