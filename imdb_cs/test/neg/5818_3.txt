This is the story of an investigator who hates his job - proving why the actors are - even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - on the big screen and your neighbors aren't! let's say it - better moments show some basis for being really funny (not just crazy) to try, maybe with some classes and use the time to learn how to make a good movie. ("Dude, Where's My Car" and "Scary Movie" sequences have it all this ... college attempt.) <br /> <br /> Lighting wasn't; production was not; and the screenplay had moments (space talk - a very nice attempt unconvincingly executed). (This reminded me of "Dark Star" - which is that he's "lost in space" - but this movie is just lost.) The talent was a bartender (said "dog" so uncomfortably I knew he had to act ... it wasn't him ... ... now he's an actor! Mark Hammond and Marty. I think I gave the movie for each of them ... 3/10. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> ______________________________________________ <br /> <br /> my faith: http://www.angelfire.com/ny5/jbc33/
