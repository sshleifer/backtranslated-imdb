You've seen this movie for the first time after it's bought on DVD <br /> <br /> It comes as a cheap cash attempt on two Conan movies. Unfortunately, this movie didn't seem to have the same budget as Conan's movies, so some files and effects aren't so flash and some scenes seem to hurry. Nielsen is okay to look, but unfortunately she couldn't act if her gun was put on her head. Arnie's supportive role seemed to do it as a favor by director Fleischer, who also directed Conan Destroyer. Maybe Arnie wasn't sure she would continue the cover films like Predator, Total Recall, T2, and so on. that they were talking to this movie. I couldn't be so jovial if I fought for my life. Whatever it is, this film required very little concentration to watch and be slightly entertaining. I saw much worse. Two stars.
