My Rating: Acting - 3/10 Suspense - 2/10 Standing Standing - 1/10 Plot - 2/10 Character Development - 2/10 Overall - 2/10 <br /> <br /> This show is officially very angry. CSI Miami is best for me, CSI NY 2. and CSI 100. I don't know, in the other CSIs you'll get into the episode you're watching. But in this case, you can't get into an episode, no matter how much you are trying, so in my opinion, this exhibition is not worth watching. I know people have different opinions, and I respect that, but for me this CSI isn't good enough. So if you like tension, real acting / performance, good conspiracy, direction, character / attachment development and a good show overall, I suggest you watch CSI Miami.
