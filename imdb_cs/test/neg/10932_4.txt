The material is bad .... the screenplay is terrible .... the actor's average at best and the music wire what the scene has to communicate as a kick in the head. Miss Y .... But Yancy Butlers isn't hot enough even in the semi nude scenes to save this audacity. I'm impressed, people rave about Yancy Butler ..... given what I've seen here and in a few other things I've seen her in that she has no depth or presence to she was a star ... and her off-screen behavior tends to indicate that she knows it too. The last thing is where was this picture? Neznám externí.
