I unexpectedly entered this "trap" of the film. <br /> <br /> If I could return time or simply get a replacement, I'd be happy. It was 7:30 PM Cinderella The Man didn't start until 10pm so I hurried to the theater to capture a movie that started at 19:20 ... and let me say that God has stretched out his hand (or pulled her) and allowed me to punish myself for his gluttony movie by sitting in this movie. It may be unfair to criticize a film that was not aimed at my heterosexual male cohorts, however, there is no excuse for miserable sound and video editing. This movie was most worthy of a high school project budget ... and I think I've seen it better in those French short films we've made with Louis Laloup. Maybe it's because I'm m Canadian and this movie was for LA fudge-pack crew and their sympathetic dames. Alas, when I realized that the whole audience saved me when I saved all the jokes and the entrants ... I fully understood the implied humor ... but I couldn't get in touch with it. Show me allegedly how Gay Men date and build relationships. However, even if it were their purpose of film, I feel that "Gayness" was focused on too strongly .... humanity seemed to be missing .... but again, maybe it was a point ... just being avant-gard ... and make a splash. <br /> <br /> I think with a low budget and poor equipment, you need to make your movie as "loud" as possible to make the crowds and cash return. I really wish I read my Sheldon Van Auken instead. Hehe ... I was a totally bad audience.
