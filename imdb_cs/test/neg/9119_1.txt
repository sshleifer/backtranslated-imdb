It wasn't because it came as a 2-dvd file paired with the original American Graffiti; It wasn't because I was here in Iraq for a few months and would watch almost everything at this point, so I would throw this film in the first ten minutes in the trash. This movie was terribly bad on so many levels, I just don't know where to start. Wrong, shot, drove, wrote, scored, edited. The first nine-year-old daughters of filmmaking are superior - and the dog is sleeping. (Think about it, I'm giving this piece of cinematography 9 stars. But I'm impressed.) If you have the slightest credit for quality filmmaking, avoid this waste at all costs. No character in this film has the only redeeming quality except an Icelandic girl who has no English line. I'm not going to waste more time describing what a bad movie is.
