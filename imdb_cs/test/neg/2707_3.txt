Laughter is little in this boring movie and I can't help but think about how this mess came first. The only good thing about this film is Griffin Dunne's talent, but his best effort was easily overshadowed by Madonn's unpleasant performance. I was able to sit without being bored, but that's probably the most beautiful thing I can say about this time.
