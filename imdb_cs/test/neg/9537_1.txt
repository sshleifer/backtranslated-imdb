I like bad movies, but this is a smoking heap. Do not lose a second from the shaky cameramen to the terrible sounds and devastating performances. The fifth grader could make a better film and the first graders could write a better script. Do you want a real overview? Ugly chicks in neon bikini dance too long. The discontinuous conspiracy has been aggravated by the hideous actions. The sets on the spot were not clear. Church scenes take place in the dance studio and oh yeah - what's with the two numbers of the dance coming out of the blue? Oh, and the total number of naked breasts that couldn't be. I didn't even save this movie - 0. Add this to the trash heap.
