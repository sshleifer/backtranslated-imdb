I have to give this movie 4 because of a few things. 1. What I call "stupid victim syndrome". If you have a killer on the floor and you have his gun - please shoot him. If you're a cop and you have a shotgun at the returned killer - please shoot him. 2. When you are in a high stress situation and you have a finger on the trigger trigger - your first instinct is to squeeze them. This is one of the first things that will teach you to practice pistol training and not to put your finger on the trigger until you are ready to fire - ask any hunter or pawn. If you are hit by electric shock, your muscles should also be shortened - so you press your finger. 3. It's really hard to put on the floor for 8 hours without 2 other people - one of them a doctor - didn't notice you were dead. Even more if you are allegedly dying of a brain tumor and have been in the hospital just a few months earlier. 4. Technically, the killer killed one of his victims - a guy he injected with a poison that had to get an antibody. If you poison someone, it's murder. 5. What was Adam's lesson to learn? Yes, the doctor had to be there, but what was Adam's crime? Maybe I missed something. <br /> <br /> In addition to these things, I would give this movie a higher degree. The story was pretty good, and the ways the killer decided to kill his victims were very resourceful. I can even forgive horrible behavior on the part of the doctor - scenes with my family were enough to get sick. The cinematography and the soundtrack were very good, but the end seemed to be made up and not working for me. Thank God, I didn't have to pay to see it, or I'd ask for a refund.
