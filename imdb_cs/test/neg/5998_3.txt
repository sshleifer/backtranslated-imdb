Jackie Chan movies are typical examples of how supply is greater than demand. Well, to be honest, which requirement? In this one Jackie Chan is what's his name in this, I doubt if he ever knows, and he's some kind of racing car driver. Well, he drives 10 miles per hour and then shots have accelerated, so I can do all the stunts myself anyway. how delicate this production is. Khan's fighting, especially in the casino scene, is decent, but when we talk about special effects, dear Lord. Stupid. And here it is really safe for the driver, there is no concrete wall in the neighborhood. And don't get me what terrible story it has, I think it's Hong Kong, it was probably written at the gun point of eight-year-old, but still what a mess. I like Chan just like another guy, maybe more because I saw "Rush Hour", but his agent's retarded cousin really needs to pick his projects better.
