I think I might hate this movie if I spoke Polish. In the first menu, I chose the English version, but gave me a Polish dialogue with English subtitles, as well as the Polish version. Perhaps the dialogue was so incoherent because the one who couldn't translate the headlines into English very well. To further deepen this problem, some of these dialogues had no subtitles at all. Acting was bad enough, especially female leadership that was melodramatic about everything! One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and when the crowd jerked her, her shirt opened and the director showed a close-up of her naked breast for the next 15-20 seconds. I couldn't see her breasts joining a scene or movie drama. Maybe the director tried to increase the number of teenage boys in the audience. A lot of the film takes place in an extermination camp liberated by Americans. First, "American" uniforms did not look like US Army uniforms. Second, none of the extermination camps in Poland were liberated by the Americans. I believe that a Polish film director who turned 19 in 1945 would have known better than an American born in 1966 that the Russians had freed all six extermination camps. All in all, it's not a very good movie unless you speak Polish.
