This film must be the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced with film. Acting is frightening, tension builds minimal and the storyline is ridiculous. I found myself sacrificing myself to hurry and become a victim because she obviously had to be brought out of her suffering. Anyone who has a basic understanding of how the world works will be immediately disgusted at the jumps we should do in logic, and the so-called tense accumulation would be lucky to take care of mild concerns for 3 years. I am appalled that a sequel is planned because it means they will ask us to swallow the plot again. If this is an example of Raw Feed work, I think I will avoid them.
