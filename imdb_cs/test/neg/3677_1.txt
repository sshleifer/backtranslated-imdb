Wow .. where do I start. I rented this movie because it sounded like something I was interested in. With a name like Val Kilmer playing in this movie, I thought how bad it could be? This must be the worst movie I've ever seen with such a big name. I wondered why it slipped through the cracks and I never remembered anything I heard when it came out for the first time. It starts pretty well, and is somewhat reminiscent of an intro sequence in a burne identity, but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then sets off to the WTF country. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't rent it unless you're a masochist or on the road to see every Val Kilmer movie out there. There are many other titles that deserve your time. This movie (if you can call it) is a bona fide waste of time. I want 82 minutes back.
