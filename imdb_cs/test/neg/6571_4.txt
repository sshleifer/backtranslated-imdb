Director William Shatner was supposedly referring to a "darker" film when he came to Star Trek V: The Final Frontier, but to Paramount suits, looking at the vast cash vouchers his predecessor had bought with humor. He insisted that the new movie had a lot of laughter. What we get is probably the weakest and busiest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast. There are bad ideas, along with some good ones, and if you're in a charitable mood, you can look at 'The Final Frontier' in the same way you would an episode of a TV series. On the plus side, Laurence Luckenbill is a great actor and gives one of the best 'guests' performances in any Star Trek, big or small screen, the order right there with William Windom's Commodore Decker. His portrayal of Sybok, Spock's half-brother, keeps picking up the film when it threatens to submerge, which happens all too often. Charles Cooper is good as an old fat Klingon general, Korrd; too bad his role is not as big as he is. If the story of Shatner's intentions is true, then I owe him an apology because I was willing to blame for the constant stupidity and non-convincing action scenes right at his director's feet. The reason for this is that I always felt that Shatner was the least "tuned" to all Star Trek's work and what makes him special to his fans. When I read my Trek memoirs, it is very obvious to me that he considered the show as another action adventure series that apparently took place in a science fiction setting. He favored Gene Coon's vision over Gene Roddenberry; Coon was known for his work on the popular Western series, 'Wild Wild West.' Shatner also mentioned that the popular Star Trek episode of his was a 'piece of action,' a silly second season episode of co-written Coon. Finally, if we had the opportunity to direct the feature film Star Trek, would Shatner not follow his instincts and create a film full of language full of humor? Someone did this because that's what's over. Shatner himself is certainly returning to the form of a Great Ham and, as Leonard Maltin points out, the film is suffering from a bad case of "cutes". In the opening scene in Yosemite National Park it's hard to say what's worse, super-cheese special effects or divine dialogue. Running gags on equipment doesn't work on Enterprise ran all the way from 'anger Khan' and by the fifth Trek movie, they ran to the ground. So he has the idea of ​​a "skeleton crew". One new development is the apparent romantic relationship between Scotty and Uhura, and it is sufficient to say that one does not feel the flames of passion exactly between the two. It is an unnecessary subplot and does not add anything. The culmination scene where "God" meets does not add much; Whether this is a good idea in the first place is debatable, but the scene itself makes no sense. (It seems that the "creation of God" differs according to what is needed at the moment.) Roughly half of this is a tired regression of the culmination of "Finding Spock." Leonard Nimoy manages to save Spock's integrity, even if such non-Spock lines look like "Get on yourself, Doctor." And DeForest Kelley, as usual, surpasses both Shatner and Nimoy; he really came as an actor in the finals of Trek movies. So this Trek trip isn't terrible, it's just not very good. Before the baton was handed over to the next generation, there was one more original film Trek, which was much more appropriate for the task than the "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier".
