I am a big fan of British films in general, but mostly gangster films. Unfortunately, this movie was shockingly bad. I think its pretty depressing that this movie is getting some good customer reviews. The idea that this film is bold and realistic is ridiculous. I read and heard with my fist the real life events mentioned in this film and they were almost all glorified over the highest violence, etc. The only brave real life event in the whole film was the Range Rover murders where some bouncer ambushes got out with people they couldn't deal with. This film is a shame for British cinema! He has no conspiracy and no decent acting and relies solely on being violent (bold and realistic, as some people like to say). Such people who made this film should not be allowed close to the budget or movie camera just like humans. this film should not be given the opportunity to say this pathetic violent story without consequences.
