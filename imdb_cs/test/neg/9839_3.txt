It is a pity that a film with such good cinematography as this one had no story backed by the work of Sarah Cawley (cinematography) and Adam Lichtenstein (film editing), and above all no sense of what was happening in Mexico City. The film tries to be a very realistic depiction of life in the city, but it cannot do it. It's a shame, a lot of wasted film. An American woman is trying to find her brother, whom they have kidnapped. The story's first description is powerful and interesting, very realistic, but there seems to be no effort to come up with a better description of the suffering, especially when it comes to the attitudes of the US Embassy staff in Mexico City when it is a problem like this. Let's compare it with Frantic (1988), which deals with similar issues. Something similar can be said about the role of local authorities. Let's compare Todo el Poder (1999) as an example. The film is worth watching if you want to get a feel for the city itself, pay little or no attention to the rather weak "conspiracy" and the many twists that require a relatively large suspension of infidelity. Who will believe that Mexico City's Mexican patrol will go all the way to capture the main characters on the border between Mexico and the US? And that this policeman will be able to use his radio from the border with Mexico! Only producers of this film. It is worth noting that, unlike Frida and other films about Mexico, they speak Spanish at least in these three Mexicans.
