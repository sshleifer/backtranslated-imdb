I like Kevin Bacon and Cathy Moriarty and I like Mary Stuart Masterson, but the movie wasn't good at all. The picture was not sympathetic and the story was almost non-existent. Mrs. Masterson is a great actress, but she just didn't pull out the character of "hard girl". (She had similar problems with her character in DAY 2 Christmas.) Maybe she should avoid these characters, especially those who have a disturbing female child. Evan Rachel Wood was unimaginable. Her character was a brat, simple and simple, and no young actress could give Harriet any positive feelings. <br /> <br /> For the sake of total revelation, I couldn't even finish this image. Forty-five minutes of my time is enough waste.
