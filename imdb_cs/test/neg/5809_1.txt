This movie is level with "Welcome home Roxy Carmichael" for the biggest pieces of garbage that ever hit the silver screen. If these guys weren't homosexual friends of Adam Sandler, this scenario would end up where it should be: like some big toilet paper for movie managers. I hate the movie, it makes me hurt people. I admit I have high standards, but honestly I'd like to watch Step Up 2. The extremely sad part was when I signed up for IMDb and read that the pieces of rubbish actually gave you this movie 6.9 ratings. This is proof for all the retards in our company that will go watch horrible movies that are just an hour and a half long bird, fart, and weed jokes with little to no originality. After seeing this review, I would like to suggest "Tyler Perry's House of Pain" to all who enjoyed this film. You will see some high quality humor at about the same level of this outrageous abomination.
