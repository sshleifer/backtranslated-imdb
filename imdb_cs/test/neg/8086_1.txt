This film, literally, does not have one redeeming function. The characters are one-dimensional, clich√©s, incredibly misogynistic and stupid. The script looks like it was tiled together out of 100 other movies, acting is terrible, and some of the "rough" humor made me feel sick. Shame on you, Gregory Poiriere, think ANYTHING would be funny or interesting! <br /> <br /> The worst movie I've seen in years.
