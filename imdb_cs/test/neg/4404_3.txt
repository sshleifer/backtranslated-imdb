I was very concerned about this film, was scheduled for a Jewish film festival and was announced as very hostile to Israel, using clever humor and irony. I was relieved that the film was not a diatribe, but as a film's work it was deeply disappointed. The film was full of random events, some of which eventually united, most of which not. Some of these actions were very clever and funny, but some of them were just random and meaningless. Between the two lovers, the scenes where the car is sitting, without a word and playing a game, are repeated. Maybe in some cultures it's erotic, but it's like watching your thumb. It was really tiring after the third time. I've always found David Lynch to be unreasonably bizarre, using strange stories and pictures to allow viewers to think he is so sophisticated that he doesn't understand his work; in fact, there is nothing to understand. The same is true here, stories do not contribute to anything and there is no political point (on one scene, a stormy Israeli soldier humiliates Palestinian drivers at the checkpoint. Are these news?) <br /> <Br /> I don't understand why this film has collected controversies or why it collected attention. It's a worse job and seeing it was a waste of time.
