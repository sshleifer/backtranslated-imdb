Honest young insurance agent Ronald Reagan (like Eric Gregg) is optimistic but poor. His wife, planning for Sheila Bromley (like Nona Gregg), longs for better things in life. Mrs Bromley, who describes herself as "not weighing in with a lot of justice," is spending more money than Mr Reagan is earning. Bromley gains more subtle things in his life, but puts the couple in debt. Bromley's fun. Handsome Reagan attracts more women like energetic clerk Gloria Blondell (as Patricia Carmody); but he doesn't do it. To pay the bills, Bromley enters the insurance fraud racket - helping her release her husband. Unemployed Reagan seems to be tempted into the life of crimes - will he stay straight up or will he cover? Clinton Rosemond has an uncomfortable scene of "broken arm". William Clemens ~ Ronald Reagan, Sheila Bromley, Gloria Blondell *** Happen (1938)
