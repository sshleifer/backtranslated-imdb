I remember seeing it years ago, having a reasonably promising start, with an interesting assumption, but then quickly falling apart into nonsense. Uninteresting characters, failed attempts to add drama and tension, and a little simplistic philosophy that culminated in a terrible end. <br /> <br /> Simply, it's a waste. Before I saw this TV movie, I didn't think I'd ever have any movie that I thought was "the worst" I've ever seen, but after watching it, I knew that since then somebody asked me what the worst movie I've ever seen, I could say without hesitation: "Second Coming". <br /> <br /> Avoid.
