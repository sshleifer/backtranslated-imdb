No wonder many of us hate classical music; and what do kids think? With an "educational" PR like this, classical music will soon slip from supporting life to morgue. Children know when they speak, and this is no exception; why can't anyone make a good movie about classical music for kids? I must admit that I enjoyed the actor who played Beethoven, took part in the enthusiasm and zealous balance of Beethoven's engaging and humorous aspects; he was obviously involved in research. Otherwise, this is the third speed rehash of the old ABC Afterschool Special, with none of the occasional charms of these short films. I am sorry for this anger, but this is an important issue for the young people to learn about and could have been well done; I wonder if they were responsible musicians or filmmakers? Either way, kids are hipper than you think, people ... Medtner
