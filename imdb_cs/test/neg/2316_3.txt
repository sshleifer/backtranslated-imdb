"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ"! If IMDb had one word, it would be mine. This film was originally intended only for children and it seems very difficult for adults or older children to watch a movie. Singing, story, everything is boring and washed - just like this public domain print. Like other comedy team films rooted in traditional children's stories (such as the terrible SNOW WHITE AND THREE SHOES and overrated BABES IN TOYLAND), this film has limited appeal and simply does not care. Now that I think about it, I seriously doubt that many children would even find this movie today! So my advice is not to watch this movie. If you MUST watch Abbott and Costello, almost everyone else in their movies (except A&C GO TO MARS) would be an improvement.
