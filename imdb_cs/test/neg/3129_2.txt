Sometimes the unforgettable Scenarist dialogue of Frederick Fox and the cast of old professionals can't save this lukewarm Western of whites that have been mounted in the desert by a group of bloodthirsty Cheyenne Indians. In addition to his occasional catchy dialogue, you won't find any surprise in Fox's script about this breakdown between White and Indians. The characters in the "Dakota Incident" create little interest, certainly not enough to become fanciful as well as some of Fox's choices. Unfortunately, good dialogue is Fox's only contribution, because this conventional little sagebrusher dries with the ending that conflicts with its previous 80 minutes. The end is conceived as coming and lacking credibility. Most of the characters are compassionate, but some of them just don't have enough common sense. Dale Robertson is suitably tough and leathery as outlaw John Banner, one of three bank robbers who must fire him with his low level. down, partners without an account. Western character veteran John Doucette (Rick Largo) takes care of the best of the badmen, while Skip Homeier, wasted in an unimportant role as Banner's brother Frank Banner, later dies of the Indian dart. Doucette is trying to shoot Bannera at the start of the event, but our left-handed artillery-hero fake his own death, watching down Largo later and wrapping his skin with him in a city called Christian Flats. Largo bites dust this time, but Banner is an interesting discovery. One of the passengers on the stagecoach from Christian Flats to Laramie turns out to be none other than an ATM, from which he stole money. Not only is John Carter (John Lund) searching for himself to find Banner, he also wants to clean up his own good name with a bank that has issued wanted posters for his arrest. Obviously, the authorities were wrong and spread Carter's role in the robbery. Carter is ready to take Banner to Laramie and turn him to the law, but Banner has other ideas about Laramie. Banner's ideas change as he crosses the road with Amy Clarke (former Twentieth Century Fox beauty Linda Darnell) who wears a bright red dress and still packs pretty bust. As everyone else mentioned in their reviews, Truecolor True Studio brings RED in everything, from Darnell's attractive clothes to blood spilled on the ground. The problem with director Lewis Foster's loading with this cross-country race is that everything that crashed on the peat bog is a loss of wheel and our heroes embark on a dry wash to defend themselves against Cheyenne. Good guys and Cheyenne will eventually run out of ammunition, but "Dakota Incident" will never run out of clich√©. Ward Bond has several interesting moments as a politically correct politician who advocates a reddish-brown path. By the time this 88-minute vacuum cleaner is over, you will feel that you have been trapped in a ravine and threatened to take Cheyenne yourself.
