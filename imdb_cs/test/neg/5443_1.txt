As a passionate go-cinema, I felt that even though I was on the list of my favorite movies, I felt it was fair to include the most hated movies. I'm afraid I have nothing positive about it. film. It's actually one of two movies I've ever gone to. In justice, I came back and watched the movie again to give me another chance and sat across it just wishing I should stay away. Sadly, the movie has a really decent cast and crew ... but then even the brightest stars in Hollywood can't bring the dead duck scenarios into life. Stay away ... Save yourself from this truly deplorable movie 1/10
