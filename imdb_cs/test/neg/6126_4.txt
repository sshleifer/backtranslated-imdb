The beginning of the movie is promising. When Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) hears the story of the incident that happened on the day she was born, she gives the possibility of being the daughter of the famous pianist Andre Polonski (Jacques Dutrone) to see if it is true or not and to give the truth that he also plays the piano, it is not such a distant idea. Jeanne meets Andr and his wife "Mika" Muller (Isabelle Huppert) and reveals with his son and on the road that there are so many secrets in this family. <br /> <br /> O.K. We've seen it before and it was done in a more interesting way than here. The character of "Mike" Muller is left with us to understand her motives for her and is not interesting enough to take care of her. Piano scenes look fake, and the entire piano sub-plot doesn't add anything to the character's attention, but serves to make the movie longer than it should be. In short, a very unsatisfactory trip from Chabrol, who can do it better
