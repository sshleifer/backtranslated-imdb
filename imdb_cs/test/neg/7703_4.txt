Let me start by saying that I'm a huge Abbie Hoffman fan and read Steal this Book and Steal this Urine Test. I am also a bigger fan of Jerry Rubin. But his film was a discreet pile of garbage that created a very good version of Abbie Hoffman. The director had no chance to make Abbie Hoffman interesting in this film. They forgave Stewart as a cartoon f *** ing who lacked intelligence, the man was professor at Berkley for christsakes. Okay, that for Anita Hoffman they made a terrible cast, they did work in Horrible, which occupied the character of Jerry Rubin. I just guess the movie doesn't fit the message flashing that I saw Abbie or the book he wrote. The movie just didn't fit and upset me. Oh yeah and theat is the absolute worst voice I've ever heard about Richard Nixon. This is one of the few movies I've ever rented that I couldn't sit all the way because I have a passion for Abbie Hoffman and his discreet Yippies, and this movie was just badly done. And that hurt me when people see a movie about yippos, they see a terrible adaptation and they don't get a real sense of reality. Instead, they get hollywood palanthra crap. <br /> <br />
