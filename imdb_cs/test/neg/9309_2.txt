This movie was a bad movie. The conspiracy was poor and the comedy they tried to deliver came out badly. Accidents seem fictitious and predictable. I thought the actors were trying to some extent, but with this movie it was so lame that it could go so far. One of the worst movies I've seen and I don't recommend to anyone. Mr Accident's only accident was his release.
