Recap: A lone swordsman, living in the desert, acting as an agent of other swordsmen, recalls how his life proved himself. It started with the woman he loved choosing to marry her brother instead of leaving him. One of the swordsmen is Huang, who is alone in the middle of a complicated love story where a woman wants to kill him for running away from the promise of marrying her younger sister. But the nurse wants to hire swordsmen to protect Huang, and everything is on the verge of being the same person and woman. Comments: I saw a version of Redux in 2008 that was released in 1994. As both versions differ, I can't say, but Redux is very strongly stylized in the way Chinese action Wuxia. This is unfortunate because this style reminds me of one of the most important elements of a successful and fun movie. Reasonable story. But true to their styles and visuals, they seem to be much more important and much more focused on writer and director Kar Wai Wong. That's why there are plenty of colorful, very beautiful scenes that are completely unrelated to the story. The storyline adjustment and timeline is also incorrectly processed. Much is omitted in scenes, the timeline is broken and rearranged in a confusing way. Very slow and calm scenes are suddenly free of surprisingly brutal and seemingly unmotivated fights just because they get rid of something else and unrelated. The result is a confusing and very uninteresting film. Thanks to these brutal but very few fights, the film is put into action. The poster and the photos also suggest this, but they can almost be considered false marketing. Only a few minutes out of the 90's could be considered something of an action, the other couldn't be further away from it. The film in its entirety is very slow, boring and therefore very boring. Even rare scenes do not help because they are disconnected from the rest of the film. <br /> <br /> I could say that I'm not a fan of this Chinese style because they often seem to be affected by these same problems, especially that visual is more important than the story, but Ashes of Time Redux is perhaps the worst example I saw. <br /> <br /> 3/10
