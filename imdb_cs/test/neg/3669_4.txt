"Undercurrent" is the ultimate cast of amazing actors who could be put together for a perfect comedy. Unfortunately, they are largely wasted on 'female' potboiler - and paper-thin on it. Katharine Hepburn is truly shining like an old tomboy who finally got married, but her husband is deeply disturbed and obscures the dark family secrets. Director Vincente Minnelli has no idea how to consolidate this exclusive plot invented by Edward Chodorov from Thelma Strabel's story, and the friendly, first-class cast (including Robert Taylor, Robert Mitchum and Edmund Gwenn) is treading in the murky waters. ** of ****
