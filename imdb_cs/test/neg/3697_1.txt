I saw this movie because it had a huge person and was labeled a monster. I don't understand why it's called a monster. The movie is drama. I was expecting a lot of destruction, but what did I get? Most of the film was relationship problems, and people thought the woman was a loony because she saw an inexplicable spaceship with a giant inside. The action started a few minutes to the end. Isn't it murder since the woman was killed? Couldn't they do anything else besides murder? If you watch it because you expect it to have an action because it is marked as a monster, don't watch it. It's not a monster. It's a drama.
