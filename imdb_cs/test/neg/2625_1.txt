I was forced to watch 'Changi' last year 10 Australian History. As they looked around the classroom, both classes, all 40 students almost slept, 40 people on the table whispering to the person beside them. I refuse to believe that since I am only 16 years old that my opinion is not that I was studying World War II, I was not just embarrassed and ashamed to watch this Australian piece of television. I was from my mind in the frightening effort that this mini series used to use film elements. The behavior was bad, the script was very inaccurate and the score was terrible. Please don't look at this movie, it's bias and very racist (to Japans).
