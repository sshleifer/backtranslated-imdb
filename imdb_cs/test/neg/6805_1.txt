For anyone who cares about knowing something about real Diane Arbus, or who values ​​psychological truth, this film is bleak. Arbus was a brilliant, talented, restless and troubled person, but this film describes her as absolutely confident and truly bizarre in his taste and judgment. Kidman portrays her as scant and unclear, while she was someone who attacked her with charisma. The fictional relationship that is at the heart of the film is incredible, and Robert Downey is simply annoying because of his suffering in his harassing depiction of someone who thinks he is superior to the rest of the world. The film captures this encounter as a source of interest for Arbus about the "madman", which is truly a trivial explanation for some of the greatest photographs of the 20th century. The mystery to me is why people of some talent and intelligence have decided to be involved with this film in some way.
