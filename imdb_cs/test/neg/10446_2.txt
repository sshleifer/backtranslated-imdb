Hi, how great an idea to open a movie - to show one's home movie. Dramatic schools must be full of idiots! There are drama lessons hoping to become the next big thing in Hollywood, when all you have to do is send a home movie to the studio. Hey, I think I'm gonna send a video from my wedding and call him THE LARGEST ROME EVER SEEN or send a tape to my honeymoon and call her the Biggest SEX EVER SEEN. Hold on, I'm not married and I've never been to honeymoon! Don't worry, I'll send someone's video elses wedding / honeymoon <br /> <br /> !!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!! Do you think SHARK HUNTER could be improved by opening it if you didn't? How shocking it may seem to be a home movie, it's the best directed, best written, and best acting part of the movie, unfortunately it's all downhill, because the family goes to the sea (in fact it's a veiled pool covered with fog). foot yacht where mom and dad eat CGI fin and their son Spencer swears revenge against the fin. So far, limited time and the French are using the underwater research base for oil exploration. The only thing is - And it's so obvious that you can't notice it - it's not filmed under water !!! the director did not even try to use the unconvincing technique of filming a scene through a fish tank. The underwater research base is thrown away by a shark (Maybe he's hired by Greenpeace?) To kill everyone inside and Spencer now an adult man is hired to hunt a shark that killed his parents and a bunch of Frenchmen. What will happen? No idea because I decided to watch something else <br /> <br /> No hard feelings if any of the actors and crew read it and I hope Matt Codd will become a big fish in Hollywood. You think you know about sharks to Matt? You haven't seen anything yet
