There was always something good for all Nickelodeon fans who watched the network in the 1980s and 1990s. You had fun things like you couldn't do on TV. You had a strange but good show like Pete & Pete. You even had cartoons that taught morale like Doug. But like Disney, Nickelodeon fell into the pipes, limited their demographic to shallow preteens and gave us bad excuses to come up with new, innovative shows. As I tried to watch Zoey 101, I just shook my head in disgust. <br /> <br /> The settings couldn't be more fake than this. Each character attends a boarding school called the Pacific Coast Academy, bragging all that spoiled baby wants. Sushi bar, laptops everywhere, flat-screen TV in every room, cool dorms you can meet, etc. Children in this show are rarely seen in the classroom and there are no real teachers. It looks more like a place you would spend on a nice summer vacation, rather than a job and a study to prepare for college. <br /> <br /> The characters were also a factor that turned me off. Each episode consists of the problems of the boy, the situations they have caused, and the problems that should be resolved. Each character is a stereotype. Zoey (Jamie Lynn) looks perfect in anything she does, and each of her friends asks for help when they feel they are in serious danger. She only leads her to have no other side. I went through school and I can tell you that no one is like that. Chase is stupid. Logan plays an arrogant hard guy. Quinn plays a nerd who is very unrealistic in what she does. Michael is an idiot. Lola is a clone of Nicole. Dana is a good, hard man. Why not use some originality? Something that is unique to these characters and different from other personalities? Is it the stereotype that the creators of this show can come up with? Instead, these actors are boring personalities with the sense that there is a lack of creativity involving their roles. There is nothing to impress or surprise. Not only that, but the show is clearly focused on intentions aimed at children of adolescence, facing a stage in which they must evolve from childhood. adult. During this period, they must learn to study themselves, make their own decisions and do what is right for them. Zoey 101 doesn't contain any of these values. In this case, we believe that good looking and having a stereotypical personality is all you need to succeed. I'm sorry, but that's just not true. People can't expect to be given things like actors in this show, and let them sit there. If I expect things to happen in Zoey 101 in real life, then I will live in a fantasy world shut in a dream. Nothing in this show applies to those facing health and financial problems. It doesn't even concern children who want to learn something meaningful. So in the end, Zoey 101 is a show that Nickelodeon exposes to just fall on her. This shows a terrible news for the kids and I very much think that the show itself is simply inappropriate for them. Sure, she doesn't have morbid violence, but she teaches everything to make a child behave and look stupid. Terrible show, and should be forgotten with the rest of the garbage Nickelodeon does in recent years. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
