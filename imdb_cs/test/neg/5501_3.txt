A few things take effect after the first few minutes of this movie. First, the scenery and special effects are incredible - the best, and if everything else worked the same, his austere presence could make him a great movie. But once the actors open their mouths, you realize you're sitting in your diary and watching the movie. The story itself is full of rhetoric and melodrama, and dialogue is one of the worst I've ever seen. And as if it wasn't bad enough, they made a fool of a hero and in my experience you don't want to do it if the movie isn't a comedy. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: I hardly got into it and wouldn't recommend it.
