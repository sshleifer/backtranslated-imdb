One of the few films filmed at Coronado High School in Scottsdale, AZ in the late 1980s, as well as Just One of the Boys, Bill and Ted's Outstanding Adventure and Just Perfect (which was a segmented movie played during the Mickey Mouse Club.) for kids because previous comments do it pretty well. Coronado has been overhauled in the last few years and many of the buildings you see in this movie are now gone. The fields where they play are adjacent to the football field, one of the few areas still there. Interior scenes near the locker I believe were in the old 200 building. <br /> <br /> If it's not late at night on the Disney Channel it can be very hard to find a quick one. How it happened, it's out of me.
