In addition to all the negative reviews: I was amazed to see that somewhere in a drop of a hat some CCTV camera was called to the most likely place to show what the "crisis" team was (especially 'Maaaaaaaaaaaaa') Thames-barriers, where the professor is hit in full (wind) power against the head by a heavy object and consequently lives to tell the story. Otherwise, I wasn't able to get rid of the idea of ​​some actors being shown in other films / programs: I told my wife: 'Hey, it's Neil, from Young Ones' (Nigel Planer) and' Calling Hercule Poirot for help? (David Suchet). To add to the shame of this movie (featured in two parts at ITV UK recently), ITV has shown an environmental agency phone number after each episode for audience worries living in 'flood-threatened' areas. How low can your TV station be like your broadcasting station? What does the Environment Agency think? ('' Oh no, it's Mrs. Jones from Hull again. She says she was fine all the time, she saw it on ITV '').
