This is perhaps the most ridiculous crap I've ever watched. Three unrelated stories about totally stupid and random things are sometimes interrupted by a bus and a boring monologue about the relationships of a stupid man. Christ knows why so many people have been involved. Highlights: Green Refrigerator Man Reading Jean-Paul Sartre, Freedom Mans Dinner Guest and Her Horse Dung Hair Products, RIDICULOUSLY Disproportionate Woman in Third Short That Suspicious Man Fouls Game Just for Interest in Her General Activity, Blowers. I need to use a few more lines, so other stupid things about the movie may be mentioned. The first film includes a man driving a car and talking about his disproportionate demands for absolutely no apparent reason. The only way to watch this movie is if you were blind and had other debilitating defects in your personality and brain. It is ironically funny, but also extremely tiring, as if I had been chewing on a colored carpet for a long time.
