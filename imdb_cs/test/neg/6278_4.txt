I'm not a big fan of this Spielberg / Cruise movie. So I have to bet with a more humble version of Latt / Howel. C Thomas Howel had more hearts and more sympathy for that Cruise starring (at least in my opinion). Now it's hard to imagine until you get rid of everything in the Spielberg version that cost more than a thousand dollars. Nothing left, no special effects, no sets, no Cruise. Because I doubt there is anything more than a great one in David Michael Latt's version. So, compare apples to turnip I think I have to go with turnip. At least it gives independent films a shot in the epic science fiction science catastrophe market.
