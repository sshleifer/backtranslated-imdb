Do you know what farmers are spraying on the field? That's right - manure, so when the BBC decided to do a lot of humor plot thriller about GMO and farming, what we got was one of the most beautiful BBC manure caused to its audience <br /> <br /> !!!! SPOILERS !!!! THE GOLDEN AREAS opens a bunch of masked scientists in a lab where a female scientist (According to BBC Trends All Scientists Are Women) announces "A New Strain of Wheat That Saves the Third World From Hunger", then turns the story into another If you are going to make a thriller of any type, you shouldn't open it with a hook that catches the audience? WOC DOCTOR was great about it, just like X-FILES, while 28 DAYS OTHERS opened with a hook held in the lab. I think someone in the BBC didn't think this thriller needed a hook, because the audience had several weeks of stuffed trailers. <br /> <br /> How the story (Not too exciting) continues with a few journalists (One is a drunk man with morality lower than Bill Clinton and Dubya Bush, while the other is a female journalist full of virtue) examining patients at a county hospital who could get through "Merc" This is at this point things start to be confused as a female journalist is threatened by MI5 ghosts and the first episode ends with a major MI5 scarecrow to get murdered. <br /> <br /> The second episode shows that patients at the regional hospital actually have die due to VRSA superbug infection. That's when things go completely hay wire. Throughout the theater, viewers were encouraged to believe that the intelligence services and company listed in the opening sequence were dead - but not. It turns out that an evil man is an organic farmer who makes VRSA superbug in his bedroom, and the story ends with a MATRIX camera with a drunken male journalist lit a fire on a VRSA field, spreading superbug around the country. Br /> <br /> I find it impossible to say a good word about GOLD. At the time of my posting, I was a member of the Scottish Green Party and Greenpeace. Since then, I have given up my time in the ecological movement, but even now I am somewhat insulted by how ecologists are portrayed here and that evil man spread a deadly genetically modified virus as a warning against the dangers of genetically modified organisms. It is a bit like a member of the CND who has released Nuke in London to warn of the dangers of nuclear war. I was also slightly offended by how male characters were written as bastards, while all women were highly intelligent and morally superior to men. There are other problems with the script, especially with regard to VRSA. Unlike the screenwriters, if you have time and problems with VRSA research, you will find that it is completely different from what is seen here. Oh and if you light the diesel, it won't explode like napalm. Perhaps the worst criticism of the script is that it resembles the structure of the JEEPERS CREEPERS, in which the last ten minutes contradict most of what was before. Where JEEPERS CREEPERS only lasted about 90 minutes GOLDEN AREA lasted twice as long, making it twice as irritating and illogical <br /> <br /> As a footnote ecology never creates a good theme for a thriller (Anyone who remembers those Steven films Segala?) And it's about the time when TV and film producers realized it
