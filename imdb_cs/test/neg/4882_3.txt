I think I won the "bargaining" contest for this film because I got it as part of the "Martial Arts Movie Classics" DVD collection with 50 films for $ 20, which means I paid something like 50 cents to watch "Black Fist" "a version of the movie that was released as" Bogard ". <br /> <br /> For the basic "revenge", "Black Fist" is not too bad, though it is clearly hampered by a low budget. One of my informal "thumb rules" for watching a movie is that if the main actor is better than his production and script, the film automatically gets at least three stars. This is certainly the case; Lawson has some presence and some charisma, and probably deserved a better film career than he got. Street fighting choreography (seemingly the reason for the film) will not really impress anyone who has ever gotten into a martial arts school, or even just been knocked out at school. I only spent about two years learning basic kung fu, but I would never fall on the front "stamp" kicks, arm with shoulders and round wounds on display. But the atmosphere is good - dust and blood and crowds, and actors make a feel for the scenes. Less believable is the conspiracy. Dawson's character "Leroy Fisk" is portrayed as a street, sharp young man who is looking for a job as a pick-up fighter in illegal, unapproved street games. But is he surprised and outraged when he has to pay off the cops? Excuse me, but I was raised in a small town of Iowa, and I even knew (from the "Hard Times" with Charles Bronson) that the cops had to be paid for this kind of action and that the guys who fought needed fasteners to reach their compliance, and that the fixators are worth the money. So you have to watch this movie with some deliberate hanging of critical skills so you can accept it as a "black brother who is being repressed". (Most of the non-black fighters in the stable are knocked into the face for the same deal, all right?). The film suffers from a brief attention span. Of course, the director did not have the budget to shoot some of the scenes he needed, so he had to fill the gaps with some rather ridiculous exposure scenes (The "I wined him, I accused him, and then I killed him" scene just doesn't work) along with voice and photo montages that they are clumsy and unconvincing. This is especially true for the whole romantic angle that seems to be filmed as if it were an idea. This is a little scaly when you think the death of "Fisk's" marital death is supposed to contribute to his revenge. But once the film switches from a "young warrior rising through to the subject of revenge, it takes a little steam and plays with a little more conviction. I'm not sure the last reward is worth the buildup - Roger Ebert he calls this kind of thing a "long ride on the beach for a short day" .. but with what's right, he takes a sensible way. <br /> <br /> If Sylvester Stallone made this movie with a real budget and the same casts panty sets and costumes and alone as a hero, people would welcome him as another "Rocky" who goes to show you how circumstance and chances can be played by many filmmaker's dreams. <br /> <br /> It's worth seeing once For different decent shots and lines and watch Dabney Coleman embarrassment himself in the role that is underneath.
