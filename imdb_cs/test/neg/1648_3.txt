It amazes me that someone would find Pauly Shore fun: it's basically one joke that becomes angry * fast *. He has his little "California" vocabulary and basic supplies of lame jokes. Especially, he's just uncomfortable. That means I watched this movie because I was sick and there was nothing but infomercials, otherwise I'd turn it off after 30 minutes. The movie might be fine if Pauly could just turn off his spiel and just play as a comedian actor instead of Pauly. By the way, I'm sure Pauly's fans will be just like that - but if you're not a Paula fan, stay away from this dung manure. <br /> <br /> I had to leave this comment after seeing that another user actually gave this movie 10/10! (Maybe it was Pauly !!) I personally gave him 3/10 because they didn't have any mike-in-frame shots, didn't go into the camera and the accompanying cast was pretty good.
