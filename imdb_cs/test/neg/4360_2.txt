It doesn't say much. This movie Killjoy has better cinematography and is more professional than the last one. That doesn't mean it's more professional. The horrible last movie was about gangsters who killed a child and then chased a voodoo clown. I thought the one who played Killjoy in the last one was a bad actor, but wow !!! This Killjoy is honestly the worst actor I've seen in every movie, and I've seen a lot of movies. The last movie the clown came in in 15 minutes is shorter and the clown doesn't come within 40 minutes and it's just 65 minutes !!! I give him 2 because some characters are fine.
