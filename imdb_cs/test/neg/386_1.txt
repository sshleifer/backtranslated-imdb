I classify it as the worst movie of all time. If there was a movie I wished for my enemies, it would be. The storyline is ridiculous, there are only 2 characters and the coincidence between these characters is absolutely convincing. These factors combine this extremely boring film. My wife and mother performed in the film in about 15 minutes. I thought that a film that is so boring and slow must have some interesting interesting plot, and was quite disappointed when nothing exciting happened. Shortly, I was thinking of sending filmmakers on account for 2 hours of lost life.
