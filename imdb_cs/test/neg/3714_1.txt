On this site I often bothered Americans for not knowing how to write a comedy, BUT, although they never produced anything of the quality of 'Fawlty Towers', 'Blackadder' or 'The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin', also never (in my knowledge) ) have done nothing as bad as this: Nadir British comedy. On my Richter scale of comic horror, she considers herself to be a truly executable "You Filed" as the worst English-language comedy show, with bad acting, unpleasant characters and humor that I grew up before I left elementary School. Unfortunately, it was part of a great crop show back then, along with "Dad's Army", "It's not half the Hot Mum" and "Allo, Allo" that relied on ridiculous situations and familiar phrases to make the audience "amused". Michael Crawford later proved to be a talented artist, but personally I'd rather condemn to a month of watching "Random" than to endure one episode of this drive that makes me ashamed to be a British.
