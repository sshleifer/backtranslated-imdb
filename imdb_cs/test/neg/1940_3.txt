Bam Margera of Jackass Fame is back with his own reality show, not just not as funny as Jackass, but it's also amazingly stupid! This must be one of the stupidest thoughts ever created. Sure, there are worse reality shows, but none of them is so lively or stupid. Bam Marger made it great, and his parents decided to get rid of fame. Bam and his parents, his uncle, his crew of idiotic friends all live together, and while Bam and his mates are off breaking things and getting into misery, generally his parents are at home stupid. When Bam's parents are not just lazy at home, they are tortured by Bam, especially his father. To add to the humor, we treat his fat uncle Don Vitto, who is constantly out of it, and never pay attention. This show is really like a toned version of Jackass ... toned down in that there aren't bits, instead Bam and his mates just go to break things, and do lame stunts, and meanwhile loud music plays do it More amazing. It's not funny. I can't imagine it being like that because there's no intelligence. <br /> <br /> If you are a big fan of Bam Marger and want to see one of the many follow-ups to the cash-in sequel to the Jackass series. <br /> <br /> My rating: * outside ****. 30 minutes.
