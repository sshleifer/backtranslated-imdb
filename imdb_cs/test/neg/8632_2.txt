If I had to choose the most depressing movie, try to be tense, I saw it was this one. I know how good the original should be, it should be better than this one. The film is so dark and depressing, but it is not interesting to see how I have seen the thrilling "thriller" movies that have been rescued because of the tension that would lead to countermeasures and dark quality balence. Vanishing it didn't, it was so disturbing to watch as it started and there was nothing positive to this classic type of movie. I think another IMDb poster is right when he said this genre just saw thrillers done in a much better form. I totally agree - I would recommend that I skip this-maybe I'll watch the original day, but I doubt it. I give it 2 out of 10.
