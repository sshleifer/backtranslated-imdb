What can I say about a movie as bad as this one? The people who made this movie didn't even try to make the monster look realistic. You will never see more than his head, and his head is just a giant puppet that has little movement except to open her mouth to roar. And the sound they used to roar is the best. In many places in the movie it sounds just like a TIE fighter! I couldn't believe that when I first heard it and had to rewind several times to get into a squat. In addition to the horrible looking monster and the sounds it does, there is nothing more to this movie than just a few corny attacks of the scene and a crazy Scotsman attacking the kids trying to have an intimate moment in his castle. Yet it is traceable if you like this kind of waste. I know you do.
