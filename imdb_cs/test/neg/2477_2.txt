This is a comedy / romance film directed by Andy Tennant, starring Will Smith, Eva Mendes and Kevin James. This is a professional dating doctor -Will Smith - known as 'Hitch', who helps men to plot data with the women she cares about. Currently, a shapely, clumsy Albert, who is obsessed with a very strong, famous and wealthy woman named Allegra, is helping. At the same time, Hitch was interested in the predators' comments, Sara, - Eva Mendes, who was commissioned to write about Allegro. When Sara's best friend is disillusioned with love with a man Sara thinks is a client of Hitch, she pays revenge against Hitch and misunderstanding leads two couples to a conflict situation. It has a lot of man-assaulting and both subtle and glaring man-hating. There are also double standards that you would not blindly see. Hitch and Sara are both very cautious about the opposite sex, Hitch still likes women despite their burns in the past and teaches men to make them happy. But of course, Sara, is a sexist bigot who makes frequent sexist comments in the spirit of "men want to have sex with anything that goes." She is obsessed with herself and knows she looks like a goddess and knows that there are no "real men". Most of all, I was bothered by the "bad" guy who wanted a quick fumble with Sarain's best friend, who is a classic example of defenseless "victim," and even after being physically rejected by Hitch, he got a pill of Sara, after which he says "Now I'm satisfied." Add to the fact that "women are still oppressed" the vibration you get from Allegra is not allowed to spend your own money after asking for permission from a men's table. Despite all the assumptions about waste and generalization - women can always say when you are not equal to them? - This movie has the right point that love just doesn't exist in America. There are some funny parts in this movie like Albert and his dance habits, but this film overall, just beats the horrible Honey movie fringe.
