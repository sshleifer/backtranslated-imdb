I saw it last night for the first time in 40 years. It is bad. Really bad. But he's got a lot of hilarious moments worth looking at. First, was it intentional to make the boy totally effeminate? He even tells Costello to Mae West that you're fascinating me! how Costello does double. God only knows what would happen if the guard was a piece. THIS CHILD WOULD WANT IT IN THE HEART! Then there's the main male dancer. He's totally incapable. He shouts with laughter as he jumps and price lists without talent over the giant's grave during He never looked better in his life. Two romantic conductors are zeros, wastes. Abbott gets singing one line and it was dubbed by another singer. Geez, I think he couldn't even carry the melody! Costello can be charming in her I Fear Nothing, and I think it could be very young children, but it's not much to recommend. But the seductive womanish boy! The aspect itself threw me away! Plus the fact that the family has accepted someone from the street with no childcare links! A little baby boy would have been taken away today!
