This movie is removed as porn with all good parts. It's like all the pornstars who didn't want to fulfill their duties, united around this terrible, incredible, unnecessary piece of gargoyle abstinence. This is a useful film if you are in the mood of torturing a beloved (or unloved). It is important that if you choose to use this film as a method of torture, put it in ear plugs and put on a scarf to avoid madness. <br /> <br /> If I had a choice between this movie and The 700 Club ... I'd choose Girls Gone Wild. Overall, it would be better if you drank. But just because it becomes a drinking game of epic proportions.
