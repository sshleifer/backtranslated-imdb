A young spinster who does not associate with women of his age and is a retired gentleman's eyes, invites a gentle young man to his apartment on a rainy day. Anxious and too polite to hide his own sexual insecurities, he is most pleased when the boy returns to his guest room ... but not so happy when he emerges from the window at night. Sandy Dennis is not an unfortunate actress, but why she has been attracted to these sad roles. Based on Richard Miles' book and about as far from a commercial drama as one could get, this lurid material not only attracted Dennis, but also director Robert Altman (whose work is static at best). The story seems to be almost sex-reversal of "The Collector", a tag that can sell film-rights, but which does not seem to be a good idea kinematic. Even the best sequence of the film (Dennis shopping for a prostitute who would satisfy her prisoner) would not work because Sandy acted ill and indignant (whose idea was this plan?). Michael Burns is pretty good as a guy who uses this tasteless, pasty sick woman just for her comfortable exploitation, but with Altman it handles it too bashfully, with lots of strategically placed towels and fleshy colors (Altman clearly not ready) for adult images with themes for adults). Sandy Dennis has some very good scenes; She doesn't get through here without thinking, thinks she is worryingly cautious before she talks and in her activities. Unfortunately, the role itself is a trouble, with an obvious slip into the mental deterioration that seems off screen. As such, the sudden final is crazy and the overall results are lukewarm. * 1/2 from ****
