Ocean's 12 starts at annoying and gets worse from there. Like celebrity awards, every major actor / actress is introduced in short 60-second scenarios that seem to stop just short with the flashing "clap now" sign. The first 60 minutes of the movie are incredibly incoherent, poorly edited, and sometimes totally unrelated to the story and confusing. Speaking of the story, ... there's one, a little ... but its barely visible to all "look at me" footage and portraits. Only Matt Damon seemed to actually "act" during this movie ... the rest of the cast seemed to be there just to attend a rat session. When it comes to robbery, action, drama .... it was inserted into the last 8-10 minutes of the movie and was pathetic and anticlimactic. Grapes! Grapes! Grapes!
