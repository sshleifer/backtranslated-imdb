I saw the trailers of this movie and I found cinematography and what was interesting. I saw the IMDb rating and 6.8 confirmed that it was an above-average movie. So it was possible to see it. The Story Is About Mandy Lane (Amber Heard) ??? beautiful girl in high school who is the subject of male sexual desire. Mandy's friend Emmet (Michael Welch) provoked another classmate to show his love for Mandy, leaving a drunk schoolmate and leaping down to death. Nine months pass and Mandy is invited to a summer weekend in a secluded ranch of her teenage friends? three girls and three guys go there! There is a security guard Garth (Anson Mount) who works on the ranch. Will the killing take place during the first night? one by one the members of the group are killed. Who's behind the murders? Didn't I say here to spoil sports? Did I like the movie? NO. After the usual interesting opening? the movie turns down with every evolution of the event. By the middle of the time the killer is discovered, every interest in the remaining proceedings is losing. There is the last twist in the story to shock viewers, but rather it made me shake my head in disbelief and laugh! All this for tension? Huh ?? Amber Heard acts and plays her role well as a shy and conscious girl ??? who is aware of her beauty and the desire of men for her. Are the remaining casts usual? what to say. Are there so many movies of teenage boys and girls going to a secluded place and slowly killing them one by one? I don't care anymore. Director Jonathan Levine is trying to make the film interesting by using the teenagers' current chat conversations, loaded with sexual overtones, but not allowing the film to rise above the mundane level. . The only and most attractive economical grace of the film is his cinematography by Darren Genet? who captures the beautiful picture perfect pictures! (3 stars out of 10)
