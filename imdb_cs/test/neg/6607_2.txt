The film has three main problems. Or rather there are three reasons why it is not even a competitor worthy of serious consideration. First, and that was always true, it's not nearly as good as books. But at least we could expect to reflect some of Sapkowski's wit or depth. Second, we have production. Fantasy movies are in my opinion the hardest to produce well. Everything from props to costumes, scenery, stunts and (mainly) CGI is non-standard. Finally, and that's a lot of very subjective, I just can't play acting seriously. I wasn't raised in Poland, so I can't really judge - this is my lack of knowledge of films in Polish. The same lines seem to be very amateur-delivered ... Casting can also be better. In summary, the only possible balancing feature of this film is the rest of the shining shot: it is not unlike a diamond ring on a rotting corpse. <br /> <br /> On a separate note I heard that the books are in English. I haven't seen them yet, but I can't imagine how anyone could translate them ... I'd like to ask English-speaking readers to take note of this when deciding on the book.
