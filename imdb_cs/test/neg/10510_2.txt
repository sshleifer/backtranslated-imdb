I really don't know where to start here.just imagine a movie that's so bad in every way from playing the props to the story that makes it angry. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen and it says a lot because I saw some bad ones. When I saw this movie, I knew it was the blade I knocked down, but I thought hey his kung fu and vampires, a combination I thought he couldn't fail. That is until I popped it to my DVD player. As Ron Hall managed to eradicate something as cold as vampires and martial arts, follow me. first acts. I didn't expect to start a lot here because of his action movie and B one on it, but the acting here is so bad that I couldn't help but bothered it. the expressions and vocal tones were out of place, there were no emotions in almost the entire movie and it was so ridiculous when I was there that I was watching a mad television. For example, Derek's girly male screams let go of master kao who should never be born first. Overall, I saw better playing at elementary school plays.then there is action. nor in comparison with things that have been done in action cinema. but the action was not yet total, as Ron's hall seems to have some martial arts skills. but also the skill it has is overshadowed by the stupid things it does, such as the part of the movie where it starts spinning and then the camera changes. I almost ripped the pillow in the middle and the battle scene where his prison buddy fights the vampires when his hands swing on them. WOW.OR how about parts in jail where Derek suddenly knows magic and can preform songs that make tap water holy water. and when it comes to props. weapons look like walmart toys, teeth were stolen from Halloween costumes, and words can't describe how bad CG graphics are. I could go for hours on all this movie stuff and believe me it's just the tip of the iceberg. Its just getting 2 because it made me laugh. Even though I laughed at how bad the movie was done, laughter is laughter. I would say avoiding a vampire killer if you don't want to laugh in a horrible movie or plan to torture yourself for a long time and want to practice
