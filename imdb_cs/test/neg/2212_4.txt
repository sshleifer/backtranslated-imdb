Yeah, it doesn't have to be for adults, and some adults may consider it stupid, but if you don't think so, it's really not that bad. The story has Alvin and his gang going across the world in search of the jewels for the bad man and the disasters they come into contact with. So the animation is good and the story is cute and the songs are forgotten, but it's a good movie. I give him 6 out of 10 or *** out of 4 stars.
