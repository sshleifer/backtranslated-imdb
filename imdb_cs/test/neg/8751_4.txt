A young psyche woman named Jessica Burns (Carolyn Kearney), while avoiding water, comes across something completely different. He discovers a chest that has been buried on aunt's ranch for centuries. Instead of treasures, she hopes the aunt hopes the chest contains the head of Gideon Drew, the devil who has been honored by Sir Francis Drake. Telepathically controlling the hired hand that opened the chest, Drew's head goes to the murderous spree in search of the rest of the body? also buried at Aunt Jessica's farm. While Jessica is sure she feels the presence of evil, can she stop Drew's plans and be in time to prevent her from becoming whole? I thought I was largely familiar with most of Horror's horror performances before the 1960s, but this is one universal movie from the 1950s that certainly didn't mention. While the thing that could not die is not what I would call a "good" movie, it has a few things to do. First, the film has some interesting ideas and is actually rather ambitious. Director Will Cowan, whether luck or intent, is able to give the film a pleasant atmosphere from time to time. And the special effects on the head are certainly scary. But the whole project is offended by acting. I am shocked to find out that any of the "actors" in this matter have appeared elsewhere. You would think it was a "one and did" type of movie for most of those involved. Kearney is the worst offender. She's terrible. Also, a thing that could not die could be too ambitious for its own good. Because of the budget and other constraints, there was no way the film could strive for its noble thoughts. Finally, the film ends rather suddenly. Just like things are getting interesting, The End. What is it?
