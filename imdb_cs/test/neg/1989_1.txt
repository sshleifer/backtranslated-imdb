This film is worse than the "gate of heaven" or "plan 9 of space". I don't know why one Oscar came, he should get a million raspberries, as well as an audience that either came out or didn't come first. The hospital was a first-rate financial failure, but I'm sure the elite classes of left-wing, eavesman intellectuals have made sure the American public is too plebeian to appreciate biting social comments when they see it, and on and on. George C Scott, in one of the most exclusive and embarrassing roles, along with the aging of Diana Rigg's sexual symbol, spends most of the film trying to go crazy as he pushes for a stupid plot. Bad Old George is helpless and is simply crushed by the event, but after a lot of dirty language between him and Rigg, he multiplies it several times a beautiful night in a filthy, crumbling NYC hospital that looks so disgusting that I don't want to. dying rat. There is also some sacramental junk-scattering dialogue about it and yon, snapped with enough cussing as well. It ends with displaying the wrong view that unusual stress without physical exertion always brings cardiac arrest. You never want to see another minute of this horrible movie.
