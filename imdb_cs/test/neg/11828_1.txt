Ah Animorphs. I loved the book series and eagerly absorbed everyone in high school and when I heard it was a TV adaptation, I was very excited. I think it was for me a moment when Nickelodeon ceased to be about great programming and more generic. So what was wrong with the show? Let me calculate the ways in which: 1. The characters were HORRIFICALLY miscast. In the books, Animorphs was somewhere between 12-14, the television broadcast was at least 18. I remember being horrified when I first saw a cast of photos. 2. Terrible Negotiations / Bad Writing. I don't know who was to blame so I burst into lumpy mass that it was. Maybe it was the fact that the accelerated age of the cast made humor, which is at least cute, coming out of 13 years because of Marco - not funny. In fact, I don't remember a single comic moment from the band and there were few. Certainly not even the writing, which was, at best, insignificant and the head saddest at the worst, certainly did not help the actor. 3. My Lord, they were greedy with the budget. The final result of the Andalites themselves was to convince Viacom to pull out the plug ... Their heads had clefts that clearly showed which helmet was. 4. Back to Cast - Rachel was by far the greatest released, far from being a warrior woman in books, the best equivalent in the TV series was "The Scarecrow". I also know that Cassie was an idealist, but there is a difference between an "idealist" and an "idiot". 5. One of the worst opening titles ever. Must there be music that is obvious? 6. The answer to question 6, "yes", because everything else was confused, so why should the less intelligent viewers expect to get thick songs from a limp rap-rock rip-off or what the hell was that. Since then, there have been more breaks (Iraq, 2004), but in the absence of a statement - this show was blazing and was an abomination to the book series to be based.
