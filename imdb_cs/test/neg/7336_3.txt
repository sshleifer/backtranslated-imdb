First, let me mention the fact that, despite its name ("Stories", in the plural), there is only ONE kitchen story. As to whether Isak died at the end or not, I'm not so sure, because in one of the last scenes, HIS PIPE is seen on the table next to two cups. There is a link to Dad on the DVD cover. He claims the film is "très drôle: rappelle Tati!" ("Very funny: reminiscent of Dad!". Grand Jacques Tati relied mainly on pantomime attitudes and quiet dead spots to achieve his comic effects and offered his critically satirical views on his French "modern" 1950s. Of course, it takes place during the fifties and offers some (somewhat weak) satirical references to the absurdities of bureaucracy and there are some long moments when no words are going in. aren't they really funny, are all these little things enough to make «Kitchens» «Tatiesque» movie? That being said, I have to admit that «Kitchens» is sometimes dealing with the false objectivity of scientific research versus «truth» Human subjective emotions: Generally speaking, the film was agonist-slow, nothing was happening - barely a "dramatic impulse": the first 15 minutes or so during the last ha If an hour or so, the last segment was - FINALLY !!! it might seem that it was a short subject, shorter than one hour, unreasonably stretched for 90 minutes. Now about setting up ("scientific" observation of the behavior of single men in their kitchen): at first it seemed very hopeful - with mapping the arrival and departure of the young men in their kitchen as a means of determining what new inventions would be best. But very quickly this assumption proved to be merely a prologue, an "apology" that presented a true object that was fully developed to the end and was about loneliness and an invaluable bond of friendship. Škoda! I sincerely wanted to like the movie. Yes, it seemed so promising when I heard about some of his unusual "anecdotes" - which were really there and which I enjoyed - like the burning of male hair (instead of using scissors), the "investment" that has a huge amount of «valuable» black pepper stacked in a barn, the role of overturning (watching becomes observed), man's mouth issuing sounds from a radio program. And there is also a sick horse that becomes a catalyst for half-hidden human despair, the relative importance of right-hand or left-hand driving in Sweden and Norway (a reflection of the importance of each of these very close neighbors confirming its individuality?). Am I the only person who didn't enjoy the movie at all? Does that necessarily mean I'm wrong? Maybe it's almost universally praised "fine points" for me in fact "too fine"? Perhaps ... Could my individual views on this film ironically reflect the very essence of the film itself - which would be a necessary necessity to have the right to differ, to confirm its individuality and not blindly follow social trends and opinions? Each of us has the right to have different personal opinions and not to be slaves to the demands of his bread "dictatorial" requirement: we often have other alternatives that would allow each of us to be useful to our respect for internal principles. In short, being true to yourself - so that the Folke movie (Isak's scientific observer) ends up giving up his job and prefers to stay in the house of his new friend Isak and help him with his farm's tasks ... So , «Vive la différence», as the French say!
