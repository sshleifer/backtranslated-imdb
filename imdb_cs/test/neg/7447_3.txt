For most people, RoboCop 3 is a movie that's really a big shame for Robo. He has few fans and most people hate it for being the shameless commercial method of PG-13. Now I'm not going to say that RoboCop 3 is good. Frankly, it's almost annoyed. But when it comes to proper shot and executed movie, it overcomes this piece of chaos in the circuit. Yes, the truth is that RoboCop 2 is the worst of the two bad and unnecessary sequels of an almost masterpiece. So what if RoboCop 3 turns Rob into a caricature super hero in ultra mainstream production for kids to enjoy - at least he does it openly. I do not know where RoboCop 2 starts and ends, I do not know what it is about or what it is, I do not understand what is happening in it, I do not understand which jokes are intentional and which are not, I do not understand anything what anyone would say I can't believe someone looked at the shooting scenario and found it to work and I can't believe Irvin Kirshner saw the end result and found himself enjoying what he saw. By the way, probably not, neither Miller, nor Weller nor Allen. It is not difficult to understand why. <br /> <br /> Now RoboCop 2 has fans, I know. Most of the time, there are absolute opposites in this league who dismiss anyone expecting any depth or subject from the first film, as academic scholar Roger Ebert Sith. It's just a lot of fun, good action and great fun. Yeah, well, I think if you didn't listen to what those characters say to you, you might be fooled by having Arnold's place in Weller's suit. Don't get me wrong, I like a good action movie, with pure fun value because it's just - the most satisfying - virtue. But RoboCop 2, sir, is nothing like that. <br /> <br /> Watch the first few scenes. This terrible actor, Rob, reiterates that it is just a machine, and then goes to this opera speech about how he can never be a man where - after Murphy's wife (who sues OCP for robotic pursuit) - walks out of the sky and has this sad little moment with him, and then never again! Certainly I would like to go to this movie scene by scene because everyone has such absurdities in it. It's like a 12-year-old fan boy made the script. OCP wants to stop crime with a new Rob, especially this drug called "nuke", but then it seems that he really wants to become this great capitalist empire and control the whole city? politics is abandoned I think understandable given the comic mayor, villain (played by Tom Noonan who made a better version of this in Last Action Hero and it says a lot) is addicted, but is still used for this machine. The woman behind it has an agenda that cannot be understood. Speaking of a 12-year-old, this film has the infamous role of "Hub", this crazy boy who swears and kills people who play a child actor. I'm not going to be moral about it, it's a free world and if you want a psycho boy in your action movie, go for it. I don't know the extent to which Frank Miller's original vision has been embedded in it, but at the very least, credits recognize him as a "story" representative. And as I zoom out, I saw it as a pretty cool figure. It is certainly grim to have a maniac killer, but then it is again the world of RoboCop and who would be surprised? This whole OCP business is trying to become this huge monopoly on everything, it is dystopian and good. Also, the idea of ​​RoboCop getting in touch with his wife and boy who puts them in some way in the story would also be great, and if I saw a natural and logical step if they had to do the sequel to RoboCop. But of course these are just ideas. As many people have said, the script is a 100% mess. The boy has one scene (a torture scene) where it is suggested that he is in fact a stereotype of a confused boy, and then we have this unimaginable scene where he dies and gets all soft and friendly to the tin head. Why doesn't he just take his uzi and try to take it off with his last breath? Isn't that what his character would do? Does his life give a little thought to his deathbed? Not necessarily, since his last words are "sucks", then why? It really doesn't make sense, and it can be said about everyone, not everything in this movie. Is there a strike in the police force? IS RoboCop Machine or Man? What is the problem of how to turn Robo into this community machine for 10 minutes? Sure, it's pretty funny I wouldn't deny it. But why build it and then destroy it? And why the hell is Allen so under-utilized? And what it is Weller has an obvious urge to express with his character and yeah, well, the threads are many and the mess is huge. This review is just as confused as a movie. The only reason I gave another star is because of the first film actors, I'm sure they have good intentions. I think it's somewhat stable, some anchor in the sea of ​​bad film.
