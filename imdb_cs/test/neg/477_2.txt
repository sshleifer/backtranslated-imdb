My brain shouted "Why do you keep looking! Turn it off and go to bed!" But he won the couch potatoness and I watched until the foreseeable end. I think if it's Bruce Campbell I have to give a chance. <br /> <br /> It's difficult for me to complain about a low budget movie just because of a low budget ... again and again we see low budget movies that prove a good story, good writing and good gaming are good to make a good movie. Ted and Bruce got their start in such a movie, but they didn't seem to learn from Sam that it took a little more to make a film. It's too sad. because Bruce has always been a favorite. After the 1970s and 1980s, I just can't believe that movies that are bad are still being done. Bruce, I'm really disappointed.
