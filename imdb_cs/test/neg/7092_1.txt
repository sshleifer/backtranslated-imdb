The last time I checked, the Nazis didn't win World War II - not that you noticed the announcement. After all, the Third Reich was big enough to give orders and demand cold, robotic obedience from the people, and that is to a large extent what we saddled today. But the way orders are delivered has changed. Instead of barking in a German accent through a loudhailer, they are disguised as if they were interested in expert advice and sailed under the nose every time you turn on the TV or open a newspaper. self-improvement whispering into the wind. <br /> <br /> "You eat too much. You eat bad things. You drink. You smoke. You don't have enough exercise. You will die if you do not change your ways, your health will suffer, you have no self-respect, look at you, you will kill me, I regret you, I hate you, we all hate you "God hates you. Can't you? It's just bloody sad. " That's the mantra. And it goes without saying that people who recite it are commonly portrayed as saints. Last year, the media fell to his knees to Jamie Oliver a collective strike through his school series in which he campaigns to get a healthier meal at the school menu. Since the reaction to the back was ephemeral, you would be forgiven for thinking that he had personally saved 5,000 children from the pedophile driving jaws. However, the series was a huge success. In fact, it was only one real drawback on television: it was not reversible. After all, once you've saved every child in a nation from a certain death, you can't do it a second time. The only solution is to find a new threat that brings us to the Unfit Kids program (Wed, 21:00, C4), Ian Wright, the "issuetainment" weekly magazine, in which a former footballer and renowned grammar enemy forces a bunch of obese young people to take part in some extracurricular PE. It's basically a carbon copy of Jamie Oliver's show, with more sweating and less shots of students mixing fresh basil with a pestle. gang misfits into a slim, average, training machine - fighting apathy and lethargy, confronting lazy parents and trying to turn the whole thing into a nationwide affair that will have Range Rover mothers wherever they damp their panties with total seductiveness between the trips to the Conran store. Oh, isn't it just terrible what you blob-some plebes do for yourself? He is not our Josh, who you understand: he eats nothing but organic spinach and goes to lacrosse practice six times a week. I bet you, little sh1t yes, it's pleasing to watch flabby, uncomfortable kids transforming with a little simple activity ... but there's something about the baseline food report that's in my crawl really holds, in case you didn't. <br /> <br /> What Happened With Choice, You * Beep * So a little jogging could increase life expectancy - so what? That's just a few years in a nursing home - a girl. And besides, tomorrow I would rather die dead than spend the rest of my life sharing a planet with a lot of smug feasts that are trying to get each other's health. <br /> <br /> In episodes two, video games and the Internet are chosen as villains in the war on Flab: they make kids too sedentary, you see. Surprisingly, television, which is equally sedentary, and unlike these two activities, actively encourages you to let your mind atrophy along with your character, escape without limp. Funny that. Well listen here, Channel 4 - instead of forcing kids to eat bracken or doing squat-thrusts, how about how to teach them to think more expansively, so they reject the sly, cajoling character of programs like this? Or would the campaign go too far?
