Pure schlock from start to finish. An average 12-year-old may find it has an interesting discrimination. Otherwise, it's a pure endurance test. Just like one of those so-called Star Trek episodes, The Next Generation, which thinks it has something important to say. However, it is worth seeing for his portrayal of drag-king prostitutes, a mess where young women pay old men to have sex with them (as it is to change roles), and lesbian series. Ghost Valerie Solanis lives!
