I stumbled over this movie late at night on TV. My brother and I couldn't stop laughing as awful. Poor sound effects, whenever White Ninja or Black Ninja punch, kick or use a gun, are cheerful. This movie is almost on the same level as the Evil Dead series, but you can only watch this movie once because it is a shear crappiness. I'm not sure if the director wanted it to be so bad because he knew that idiots like me would buy them.
