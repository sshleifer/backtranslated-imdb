Sorry, this movie was bad for TV movie. Are you the other on drugs when you watched it? I thought hair, makeup, and characters were bad 2 dimensional types. The story is dubious, especially since all the main characters are dead or almost dead. I think it's not good? Not what was with the hair on the main guy in the turtles? It looked bad, and the chops seemed to fall out at any moment. It didn't feel like anything new appeared in the band's story and how members met other bands and people. All I laughed at, Frank Zappa looked stupid, just like Mama Cass, just like the Beatles. They were exposed to look stupid and ridiculous. Also, other bands like Jim Morrison, Donovan have also taken a big hit looking stupid. It's awful if you remember these people. It's a bad history lesson about music, it's a fictional way it was created.
