The production value of AvP2 can be described by one adjective: AWFUL <br /> <br /> The script is ridiculous, even in the fictional area of ​​AvP: What are the facehuggers good on the Predator ship? Why does the Predator cleanse all the signs of his influence and lose precious time with gutting and even present the insignificant human cop's body? Why is the predator alone? Why does the Predator remember only on earth, but on his home planet? Why does a predator do his job so uncomfortably to himself by hunting extraterrestrials rather than bombarding the whole landscape like people do in the end? Why the predator drops more and more of his weapons before collecting them to keep them together after use. In the end, he even drops his armor before fighting Predalien in hand: what is the bad plagiarism of the last battle among predators before Arny and Predator. Predator gestures are so exaggerated that they move more like a Japanese sumo than a highly qualified extraterrestrial safari hunter. As you can see immediately, the whole story is a mess. But it is even worse because this work with full boots is filled with a boring mosaic of pointless phantoms, such as a long episode of ordering a pizza or some detailed information about the criminal history of two brothers (Dallas & Ricky). The Sheriff is, of course, a friend of these two criminals who regularly stand behind bars. (not convincing and utterly unnecessary for conspiracy). Besides, casting actors is terrible. Compared to the high class of directors and actors of former Aliens or Predator films, AvP2 is embarrassingly wrong. Finally, the action of the movie is really bad. There is no single scene of action fighting in which viewers can see the entire set. Each fight is shot in short and shaky doses with near-full darkness. This results in a terrifying experience for the audience, because you usually don't see anything but a shaky screen. I suggest to two directors the Straus brothers to buy themselves a steadycam and get a lesson in a modern CG so that the next film contains some visible actions of visible characters and may not be necessary to disguise their bad skills in that way. <br /> <br /> I would recommend anyone (even die hard fans of AvP) against watching this movie: the first or original Aliens or the original Predator movies, but avoid disappointment yourself by losing precious time for this failure.
