Diane Lane, Mickey Rourke, Rosario Dawson and Thomas Jane ...... It's not a bad cast in my opinion, but they were absolutely useless in this movie. There was no real direction, there were no unusual facts In fact, the whole movie was very predictable from start to finish. Mickey Rourke had a really annoying sidekick who had done nothing but irritation since the beginning. Rosario Dawson was totally useless, and there was hardly any character in it because he had a character in the film. <br /> <br /> I really believe it's one of those DVD movies that everyone will quickly forget. a pity because the movie could have been much better.
