This show, Paranormal State, has almost a "Blairwitch project". As in the film, you are looking at a documentary that is actually a mere screenplay that is designed to look like a documentary. My biggest problem with the show is that they are Warren's external advisors, who were famous for their 'investigations' of Amityville murders, which were completely fraudulent, based only on police reports of family deaths! (eg, the eldest daughter who actually got involved in the whole thing, to the point that she might help with some deaths!) Then there's a way to constantly jump on blaming the demons for everything. Not to mention how proud a group is about what cases they take. They don't want to help those who need it the most, they just want the strangest cases that bring them the most pressure and attention. <br /> <br /> They are total fraud, simple and simple.
