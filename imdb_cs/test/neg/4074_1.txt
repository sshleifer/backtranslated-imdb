This film was embarrassing in its clich√©s, misconduct, and generally low production values. It starts poorly with long hair 3 star general hero calls, Masters, "major" when he is apparently wearing silver oak leaves of the colonel. But the most worrying was the crew of the Neptune Atoll. How to get out of touch with any reality you can get? All of them were 747 flying experts, and the scenes of soldiers who dug the ditch were out of the comic. <br /> <br /> WARNING: THIS FILM IS DANGEROUS FOR YOUR INTELLECTUAL HEALTH! FOLLOW YOUR OWN PERIL!
