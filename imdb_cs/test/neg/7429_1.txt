This will be my first review on IMDb and I am glad that the standard rating is 1 out of 10, because then I don't have to change anything ... <br /> <br /> There are horrible movies first. Movies that make you laugh like Island City, Battlefield Earth, or Conan The Destroyer. This is perfectly acceptable. Makes a great party enhancer. Then there's the worst movie ever. I can't believe how totally miserable this smoking dog pile was. <br /> <br /> I found it on secondhand VHS and quickly bought it because I like science fiction, Terminator, post-apocalypse and more. like this. Everything on the box was very promising. Then I quickly loaded the tape when I got home and the first thing I noticed was ... WHAT? There was perhaps 10 minutes (or more) of switching between current clips and flashbacks in a very unpleasant blue effect, with sounds that make you puke. And it just goes on over and over again. Then there will be some "acting" game and you wonder why you were ever born in a world where this abomination of mankind really exists ... And then I realized that they were two PREQUELS. At first I didn't think about it, but the title says "3" ... And I was horrified. But as I watched in great pain and agony to the end, I thought I was never able to feel worse about myself and this universe ... But then a little text appeared that said ... "More ... "and ... NEMESIS 4?!?!?! NO PLEASE NO !!!!!!!!
