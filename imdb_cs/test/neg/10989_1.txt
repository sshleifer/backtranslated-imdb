I always say, "there's nothing like a good movie". And I have to say that it was nothing like a good movie! Drab, boring and boring. It was like one of those bad dreams that never ended, no matter how hard you try to wake up. I don't mind the idea of ​​a movie without words (ie Entering the world of fantasy or dreams), but there must be something that captures your imagination, not just the empty images, which is the movie. It didn't seem to have any character development, and it was so quickly emerging from the scene that it was difficult to tell a story. (Was there even a story?) Could you say that the actors were trying their best, but unfortunately the wrong direction was the work of all the actors. It seemed like a type of film masturbation ... just that it would please the director and nobody else. Big waste of time.
