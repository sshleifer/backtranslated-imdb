Oh, the hell where should I start ... First; This show is just another stupid American non-humorous so-called comedy that has a pathetic performance and very bad humor. The American way of laughing-tracking the business is worse. How come I hear laughter but nothing happens? Pretty stupid, huh? This show is only for those American people who have never heard that they are much more fun, better and more humorous - not only in the UK but also in America (for example the Simpsons). I just can't understand what's so good at "Reba" that it took a long time on TV. It has nothing to offer, underestimates (possible) viewers in many ways and it just isn't funny at all. I could live with the fact that there were such bad shows as "Reba", but why the hell they had to run here in Finland. When I see a few seconds of this horrible show, the rest of the day is ruined for me. Take my word and believe me - this show will kick off your ass even more than this kind of American "comedy" usually does. This is just awful. Do yourself a favor; never see this peace sh * t. <br /> <br /> Well, I'll leave a comment for those who now have this language better. Thank you for your interest.
