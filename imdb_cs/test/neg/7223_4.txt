Richard Donner demonstrates his liberal credentials with this ridiculously revised simplified attack on South Africa's policy. It's not like America was the cradle of racial harmony and fraternal love - and the added irony is that the film is set in the city that was home to Rodney's King and celebrates the police department that has so much focused on community relations with their brutal racist behavior. So Donner's pairing with salt and pepper, which clearly has a late development of the teen, crushes themselves, doing their own thing with a gentle overlook of the rule of law or the rules of evidence, and no one cares, because bad people are white South Africans - certainly a worrying example of police racism itself ? Inside Rudd's office (Joss Ackland - a totally hissing office), the decor is designed and illuminated to resemble the Fuhrerbunker as much as possible, and just in case some somewhat stupid viewers miss a point, he and his men are referred to as "Nazis" at regular intervals. ". For me, the only clear spot in the film was when Mel Gibson appeared on an anti-apartheid demonstration bearing the inscription "End Aparthied Now". The intensely teasing Joe Pesci is introduced into the franchise to take part of the weight of the boys' shoulders by following them around the yapping continuously as a poorly-trained puppy. That would be bearable if there was the farthest option to end him in a concrete mantle but unfortunately survive, to irritate another day. Miss Patsy Kensit seems to be in her own world, maybe she didn't believe her luck in hurling herself against Mel Gibson, who has little trouble getting her to bed in a mobile home that seemed to be washed somewhere. The affair that gets under fire from several helicopters that fire enough bikes to Mel Caravan to make the US military in Iraq six months. Fortunately, he has a dog who is not afraid to cause coitus interruptus, just as they go for seconds and his barking warns them of an impending attack. I hope he got a special bone as a reward. The film culminated (without interruption from Mel's dog) on ​​a cargo ship heading for Nazi Germany (sorry South Africa) when Mel and Danny murdered so many members of the race race that I lost the count. The influence of hail hail, Mel survives, curled up in the arms of his partner as a small child with a wise and benevolent father.
