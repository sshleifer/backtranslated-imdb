I loved Tim Burton in the past. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and even Mars attacks. But I hate the movie. Initially, the costume drama scenes were so badly executed, tense things that had served to destroy the historic drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the scenes that left me cold, and that's something that should mean something, I think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings, and the rider who jumped out of the tree was a nice special effect, but overall the movie was just boring and meaningless.
