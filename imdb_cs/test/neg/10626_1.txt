Big spoiler here: this movie is B! AND! D! But enjoy, it's good bad. Bugged is the kind of movie you can't believe with dialogue, plotting, and direction that is so awkward that the home video of Carlsbad Cavern Uncle Ned looks like an IMAX experience. Since it's a Troma swing, there's a lot of rough-out gore on the tap, but it's even stronger than usual. Most production money seems to have gone into buying soda and sandwiches for cast and crew. Brilliant dialogue is best summarized in the immortal "% @ # $! What was it?" who is second only to oft shouted, "now what?" <br /> <br /> Every knowledge of how people act in a desperate situation is alien Ronald Armstrong, writer / director. When one of the friends is found to have eaten a live horse with a grasshopper / termite / chiapet, Armstrong has the survivors to take time with a cute but dumb-as-a-do-click, "divine". While it is hit, Divine cooks on the stove a large cooker of a mixture of rats and oats, which is stirred, smiles, blends, smiles and never falls from the fumes dead! The murderous mistakes are as frightening as pi√±ata, which are too similar. The effects that are used to move them include dragging them over the tiles in real-time with the legs stretching behind them. The highlight of the movie would probably be a house that would blow up, but it was either cash or cash. He never had any, so instead of seeing even the miniature going up in flames, they just let the screen go black (eat your heart from ILM). The cast is virtually all black. How the NAACP can consistently censor something really funny like Amos and Andy (who shows characters that are no less similar to those that are 99% of all white comedy shows), but tells Nara that they are looking at something like Bugged. It is best if they do not know how this film is for everyone (as it would be if it was played by an individual ethnic group, honestly). Before giving kabosh to Bugged, get some friends together and get ready for Plan 9 Bug Exterminator movies.
