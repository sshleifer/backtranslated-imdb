First of all, I'm by no means a picky film follower. I'm not one of those people who get movies just to get rid of the shortcomings and criticize, I, like most other people, watch the fun. Basically, I'll watch any type of movie, no matter how badly someone says it is (sometimes the movie is so crafted and written that it creates some kind of compassion for the humor I get from). With that one side, the lil pimp was simply pathetic. I saw it on TV and I just didn't know what I was watching. It was too badly written and cheesy to be an adult movie, and it had too much sex, allusion, and cursing to be a children's film, in fact, I doubt that kids would be fun. Humor (quite generous, even though he said it) was so challenging and camped that I couldn't see anyone with half his mind even considering it fun. All that made me laugh was how people like Bernie mac and ridiculous could put their name and time on something so wounded. Lud's character was such a cheap trick for laughter that fell extremely short of his goal. The storyline makes no sense at all, the story must be the worst sequence of events ever on screen. I could go on, but I want to see what people think of my reaction before I discuss specific cases of poor scenes. All I have to say is that it's really necessary for you to wonder how much time these writers spent on their knees and trying to do it. <br /> <br /> J
