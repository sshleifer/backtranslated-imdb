This is absolutely awful. It's everywhere & nowhere & has no kind of point. I've never understood what's good about Jeff Garlin or Sarah Silverman. Bonnie Hunt is so overwhelmed that she had to be personal friends with people because there is no way to read any part of the so-called "script" and thoughts, "Yeah, I want to do it!" Most movies find at least one or two things that can be redeemed or funny. That's ZERO. It's very stupid. There is no other word to describe it. This is perhaps the biggest loss of money for making a movie I've seen for a long time. Skip it at all costs, you'll be glad you did it.
