Bad temperament, verbally rude film director, leads his male assistant ragged with requests for nitro-collecting, keeping the young man firmly thumbed with the constant threat of unemployment; after a year of official horror, it finally bursts. Writer-director George Huang may have a little more than he can chew. His "shark swimming" is not a diatribe against Hollywood, nor is it a homage to a hard-working subordinate ... instead, he is a stunt film movie with a twist, a one-piece tunnel pony. The neighborhood doesn't look like or feel like Tinsel Town (maybe because of a limited budget) and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a film-making unit (it could be a real estate office in the Valley, for everyone, know). Leading Kevin Spacey, who also served as one of the film's producers, gives controlled and focused performance as a mighty madman whose ego is out of control; it does a good job, and yet the character doesn't ring. We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and position in high positions cannot move with what we see; to whom does this man answer? what drives him outside humiliating others for sport? what projects is juggling away from one script we see around? The film is so emotionally dwarfed and insufficiently populated, it seems to be a scenic game stuffed on a big screen - yet there are not enough characters or motivations in it. Maybe Huang wanted to keep things simple, but instead his film looks like a half-baked project that needed much more insight, humor and atmosphere. ** of ****
