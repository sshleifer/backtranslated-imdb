I was so excited to see the cast in this movie that I was absolutely surprised at how completely this movie was WRONG. I love John Voight, but I have no idea what owned him to be part of this journey. Biblical accuracy was totally non-existent, and I could not sincerely watch the movie with the children. My children were stunned because they didn't even know that Lot wasn't even thinking about Noah building the Ark. I think NBC should be ashamed of allowing manufacturers to mock the Word and cause even more confusion in a world that hardly knows the truth, how is it ... DO NOT BUY THIS FILM !!! I was thinking about burning my copy, but I have all the intentions to write producers and send them links to biblical references that SHOULD read before they did this movie!
