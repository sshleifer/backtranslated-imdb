I really liked every character on this show from the beginning with the exception of Reby. She's leaving as a stool than you, and frankly, a big Bully. And it stinks because it's in every scene and every episode. In later periods Van becomes also unlikely, like the spoof of his former self. and Kyra walks around smirks and unhappiness. The first 3 to 4 seasons are pretty good if you miss Reba. Towards the end, it's pretty bleak. Basically, every Barbara jean episode goes around being stupid, Reba meant it to her, but poor Ole Barbara jean desperately wants Reba to like her, resulting in Barabara Jean says Reba how wonderful she is. every episode. I think it's pretty clear that Reba has problems with self-esteem and wants to be seen as all forgiving the saint. It's really a shame because other than her has such potential.
