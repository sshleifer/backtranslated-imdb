Some filmmakers cannot be mistaken in the eyes of national critics, which is one of the reasons why you should never be careful of them. This film is a perfect example. Critics as director Eric Rohmer. This film is a boring soap opera about a woman and a teenager ("Pauline") she cares about in the summer and about the relationships they have with several men. . They talk, talk, talk and talk. For those looking at the envelope and hoping to be titrated, there are a few quick naked shots and a few swearing words, but otherwise it is a harmless game of French morality. My friend lent me the tape. He thought he was getting some sexy French movie and was disappointed. I was just as disappointed because it was also boring. <br /> <br /> As it gets such great reviews it is almost incomprehensible.
