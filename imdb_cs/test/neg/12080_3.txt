This film was made and released as a successor to the gruesome - albeit quite popular - slapstick of California's beachside comedy Hardbodies, but it has little or no connection with the earlier film and is better rated in its film. own right. It is certainly better than Hardbodies I, and is more close to movies like Venus and Summer Lovers, which were also filmed in the Greek islands in the summer. The combination of blissful beaches on blue bays with beautiful bare bosomes contributes to seductive observation, but (with the exception of travel books designed to help you plan your next vacation), such films also require a reasonable story if they are to attract viewers for more than a few minutes. Venus was supported by the legend of the re-incarnation of the goddess, and summer lovers had the viability of the "trois threat" as its theme. In my opinion, both of these films were much more successful than Hardbodies II, which have a very subtle story line, and it depends on the simplified semi-slapstick comedy. Using slapstick quickly becomes tedious, it usually leads to a series of very short selftained succession sequences that are difficult to integrate into an ongoing story. Mel Brooks has achieved brilliantly with Silent Movie, but several other films have succeeded the same way and Hardbodies II unfortunately did not. There is also the problem that slapstick sequences do not interact happily with the idyllic and calm scenario in which the film is set. The final airport sequences were undoubtedly meant to make a happy ending for this film, but in my opinion they are an example of the worst type of overlapped pseudo-comedy. They are also roughly elongated, so I left the cinema with a bad taste in my mouth. It is a film that could be much more successful with a stronger story, and most of its grotesque sequences were very severely cut off. As it has been released it certainly does not guarantee viewers a rating higher than 3. <br /> <br /> There is little memorable in acting, but the cast does the best within the limits set by the thin story and the wrong direction - it's just in these areas, where failure arises. <br /> <br />
