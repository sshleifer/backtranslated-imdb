Now I like bad, old movies, like most people. And I understand that the budget is a budget. This means that the Dinosaur Planet is as bad as a bad movie. The thing doesn't have any actors and just one attractive woman who kills two minutes after swimming on shore. There are virtually no redemptive properties in this pile of wasted cellulose. The only thing that was not useless was paper ... the script had to be longer than four pages. Surely no one actually WROTE this nonsense. I am constantly amazed that such films have been made, much less released. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see a waste of time. It's 75 minutes of my life, I'll never come back.
