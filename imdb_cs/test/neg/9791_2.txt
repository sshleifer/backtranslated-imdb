Apparently SHRUNKEN HEADS was the last film in which Julius Harris played his part. I haven't seen all his movies, but Julius Harris has been in many good movies and I remember him best from "Live and Let Die" where Tee-Hee played and which was full of Voodoo references, something that is common here in South Florida! I always thought LIVE AND LET DIE was a great movie because unlike most 007 films, it had some atmosphere and mysticism. SHRUNKEN HEADS is Julius Harris in Voodoo! He has a great style for secrets and occultism and his part in this film is excellent. Sadly, the rest of the movie is something of a comedy. SPOILERS: Three kids who seem to have been fired from THE LITTLE RASCALS are killed by a neighboring hoodlum who seems to have been fired from FAME! or as a dancer at AMERICAN BANDSTAND DICK CLARK'S. In other words, these children give LOW BUDGET another dimension. Julius Harris goes to the funeral home, cuts off the heads of three children (and nobody notices) and then takes them to his condominium unit, where he has a huge boiler of boiling liquids. Three heads fit, along with some herbs, spices and Voodoo items. At that moment, Mr. Harris had ugly little heads on the table and he poured blood on them and came to life like talking heads! They can fly, joke, throw their eyes and get vengeance from Evil-Doers. They usually look pretty funny flying around, but the effects aren't bad. For some reason, one of the kids always has a switch and he uses it to cut people's necks and cut tire holes. This movie is weird and funny, but only for the first time you see it. Meg Foster is in this movie and looks fatter than Rosie O'Donnell and Meg plays the male leader of local gangsters. Strange movie.
