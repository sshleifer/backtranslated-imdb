I watched the world premiere on Starz Action. They call it Vampires: Turning. The story was a little confusing. In the introduction there is a voice interview about the 800-year war and I didn't quite understand it. The film is about a young couple somewhere in Asia (maybe in China, I don't think the movie is setting). The couple has an argument and Meredith Monroe is running away and is kidnapped by the Vampire biker group. A friend finds a group of vampires who do not kill people and enter the fight with cyclists. The human group of killers is involved in some way, and the last battle sequence takes place during the solar eclipse. This film is neither related to vampires nor to vampires: Los Muertos. Confusing but decent action. Four out of 10 stars.
