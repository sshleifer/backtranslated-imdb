Love and Human Remains Directed by Denys Arcand are boundlessly pathetic film because it is completely different from the kind of films they have been doing throughout their careers. Creating another film is not an unacceptable matter, which is an unpleasant fact that if the film from the master is perfectly tuned then it is a really bad event. The film starts with a good note because there is some tension. But as the film progresses, it is just a futile attempt to create something meaningful, as Arcand shows us half a dozen weirds, moody characters whose lives are intertwined. Homosexuality and lesbianism have no consequences here. What is even more annoying is the guilt associated with characters that are more in the repair of their feelings towards themselves and sexuality. Such a movie would be interesting for some who want to see another Denys Arcand movie. there would certainly not be many people interested in this film.
