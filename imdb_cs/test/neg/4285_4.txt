4 out of 10 \ t Gary Oldham's performance is very uneven ... not so good in performance but consistency. His character does not behave consistently. Sometimes quiet / relaxed / methodical / thoughtful, sometimes violent / loud / almost mad. It's just incredible. Many films from the 1980s were badly dated? Will they be more fun for 20 years? <br /> <br />
