Before I saw this movie, I believed there were two kinds of bad movie. (1) Your average, totally uninspired tariff (ie "Constantine"), and (2) a work that is glamorous bad or so bad, it's good (la "Manos The Hands of Fate"). Now that I've seen "Dr. Gore", I know there's a third kind of bad movie: a complete sandwich. This will be irretrievably tattooed on your memory. Work that is tremendously enforceable. Anathema. Some movies I hated before, but I never hated the movie so much that I managed to keep my hate going and become hateful! Have you seen a movie that not only regrets you losing the hour you were watching, but making it another hour after you did it? Mystery Science Theater teachers are careful, this is a cinema that collects souls. Instead, rent "Iron Circle" or "Killer Shrews".
