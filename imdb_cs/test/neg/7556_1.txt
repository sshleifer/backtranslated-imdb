I can't remember any details of this movie except that the settings looked terribly good. Then I realized that it was filmed on Lazy Lizard Hostel in Moab, Utah. It was one of my favorite places to visit when I was younger and wandered all over the country. The one who owns / manages the dormitory has gotten into the film. I remember the plot of the movie that it was a jeeps and naked women. It's great to just look at the scenery (I mean rock formations) ... If you're just looking for soft-core porn, you'll probably be better off elsewhere. I don't even know if this movie is available on tape or DVD.
