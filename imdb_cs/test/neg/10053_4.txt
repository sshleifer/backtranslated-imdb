ATTENTION SPOILER: At the end of the movie, it is announced that the bridge collapsed just days after its capture. The impression is that the attack was for nothing. In fact, taking over the bridge at Remagen was the last major victory for the Western Allies. The Allies tried to reach six months. Since the Remagen Bridge was taken, the war ended in just a few weeks. The bridge must only last one day after being captured. That was enough time for Americans to send combat engineers and a great protective force on the other side, and then they could start building a series of pontoon bridges. The takeover of the bridge was a complete success and meant that the end of the war was close and could not hold in the summer. Contrary to the cynical nature of the film, victory was heralded by the joy of the soldiers who did it. They knew how important the battle was. This film has nothing to do with true history. It was rather a reflection of the cynical nature of the time in which it was made.
