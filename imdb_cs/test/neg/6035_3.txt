Reeves plays Hadi Murad, a hero in Russia in 1850. This is a badly dubbed movie when June Foray makes some voices. Unfortunately, who ever assumed that he would sync voices to his lips was blind because words never match lips. Whoever says that Japanese movies are bad was never watching this movie. <br /> <br /> The storyline of the film is instantly forgotten, so I forgot it when the movie was over, and to sit and write it. Perhaps it has more to do with the fact that the film is one of the many Reeves has done in the hope of moving away from action to more conspiracy-driven movies. Maybe it was a good thing for Reeves, but his deadly death for viewers who have to go through shedding like this, where all his court intrigues have very little action. In Reeves' defense, he was a good actor, he just had no real luck in choosing films that were good. They all looked great, but very few of them saved those who watched them in a coma for the time of the movie. This movie gets you unconscious. Watch it only if you need to sleep and all the more gentle means have failed.
