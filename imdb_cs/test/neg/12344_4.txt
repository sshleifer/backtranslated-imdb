The film begins with a little interest with the son interested in a teenage girl his own age. Clayburgh's shy-emerging husband is killed in a car crash as he prepares to go to Rome and sing like diva. Matthew objects, but comes. Once again she gets in touch with a young girl, but this time Matt is cocaine. His great voice, beautiful, expressionless mother is in the spotlight. He doesn't know how to handle Matt's addiction. The film pulls in search of a plot. Clayburgh is in the wrong role, and Bertolucci may have had his head on the moon while controlling the picture. The moon has great symbolism. <br /> <br /> Save time. I may be too generous with a 4 *.
