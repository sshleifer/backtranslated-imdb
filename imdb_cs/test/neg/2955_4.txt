Slight spoiler in the second paragraph. Anna Christie was Garbo's bland first talkie. She and Dressler look like the only people who know what they're doing in this movie. The old man who plays in Garbo's dad (George F. Marion) is soooo ah-noying !! All he does is stumble in a drunken way in a totally fake way and scream for "data old dah-veel sea". He accuses Garbo's "past", all his life and everything at sea! Coming as stupid x 10. Charles Bickford's Matt, a rough 'n' drummer Garbo falls in love, and he is fine in his role, but nothing really outstanding. The best part is when Garbo unleashes his "horrible secret" on Bickford and her father. Finally, Marion stops talking about the evil sea and beats his head and fists on the table in perfect time with Bickford. Then he soon sets out on the sea by sea. I had to get practically to finish Anna Christie. It is too melodramatic in many parts and creaking. There are many good early interviews, but this is not one of them. If you haven't seen Garbo yet, try something different than Anna Christie like CAMILLE or GRAND HOTEL.
