It does not take balls to do-fun retarded people. Having to listen to Mencia insist on being brave to "retard" jokes is unbearable. It also doesn't take the balls to bite off the chapel show. Racial games-show, racial Olympics, it seems that a lot of parodies is just a revised scene of the parade Chapelle Show, which is simply less fun. But the worst thing in the show is his insistence that he is just marching to the rhythm of his own drum when he is actually marching to the rhythm of many overworked, reworked drums. that have been drummed many times. I hate this show. I hate being presented as a voice for Latin America. And no Carlos, I'm not trying to censor you. If people like it, then keep it. But I personally think it's a bad show.
