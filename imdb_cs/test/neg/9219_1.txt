Since I don't have a TV and I've never heard of this mini-series, I didn't know what to expect from The Second Coming, and I hired it purely on the basis of its interesting sounding outline. > <br /> Dear God! If someone told me that it was written in a thirteen-year-old class who was given a project to turn the other into school, I would not be surprised. Why Why They Decide to portray Jesus II. like what an idiot savant was? Is there anything in the gospels to suggest it? Okay, ordinary guy, but Great Northern Moron. I don't think so. Apparently, all Jesus did to impress people, his miracles, because his preaching made sure that hell never impressed anyone. Sure, without a night at night, Mr. Jesus Eccleston would be helpless without canoe, paddle, or any follow-up. And strange strange controversies that set in motion, no rhyme or reason. Otherwise, of course, Russell waved the QAF on the fan base. Jesus is hovering in a pub to hire "disciples" (more helpless northern slaughterers and, of course, homosexuals - harpy woman, stupid, stupid, ugly). Homosexual rights are murdered by the throat for no real purpose, almost like Russell thought he "owed him boys" to place Jesus on the spot. I can't really see the real Jesus coming up with "Well, I'm against him personally, buddy." Only someone in the middle class and woolly could imagine Jesus being so wet. And don't try to end me. "Please come and go out of the rat because the only way we can be truly free is when God dies." It was like a sketch of God Eddie Izzard as Bill Gates. "Hi, I'm Bill Gates, and now you warned me that my global domination is your style of giving it to you, my customers." Of course we're going to poison rats. Often I am mystified by the values ​​on the IMDb, but the high rating on this one has a biscuit. He doesn't mind Jesus for the new millennium - that's Jesus for MTV's helpless young. God really helps us all.
