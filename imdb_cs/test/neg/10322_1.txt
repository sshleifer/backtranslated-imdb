The DVD version we bought was on the cover of Sandra Bullock, but we found that it was her picture from another movie. Unfortunately, there is very little in this film. However, you can see how far she has come. One other bright spot in the film, in addition to its very small part, was several scenes of location, shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980s. The sound is awful. Sometimes the background noise is so loud that dialogue is difficult to hear. Sometimes the dialogue was redesigned without any background noise, which is worrying. For example, sometimes when they are in the car, the noise from the car is too loud and then there is no more noise at all. The director likes close-ups on the cheeks and then it is clear that the film was dubbed because the words do not correspond to the movements of the lips. Through most of the movie, voices sound like people talking into a can. <br /> <br /> Background music when it's music is a distracting place to add to the movie. The direction is ridiculous. Amazing camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke, especially when it comes to tension, like in the middle of battles. Writing is terrible. There are some subplots that don't make sense, and most of the characters come up looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all of their motivation. The writer / director tries to explain some of the relationships between the men who were together in Vietnam, but none of this makes sense. These top killers and former soldiers do not seem able to see other people's shadows or hear other people moving. Actors go from calm to panic and back to calm down again without any warning. It's just a combination of bad direction and bad writing. The production values ​​are so bad that we first thought we'd come across someone's student film that Sandra Bullock had just done. If you like to laugh at really bad student films, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, avoid this movie.
