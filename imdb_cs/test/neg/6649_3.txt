When federal agent Frank Poo (Andy Garcia) broke into a secret database file for matching DNA sera, he discovers that the only person who can save his son's life is the psychopath played by Michael Keaton. However, when the transfer of serum in a local hospital is terribly bad, certain Mr.Poo must do everything in his power to ensure that the madman stays alive so that he can be inevitable. By the way, his name isn't really Poo, I feel like I'm calling him. Despite the original concept, it is an unlikely and turgidly non-threatening action thriller. I have never been a big fan of Andy Garcia, and awarded his charecter here is'nt that connectable, this movie will end up getting worse. The sequences are processed quite disappointing, and the end sucks quite badly. After Keaton made a great villain in the Pacific Heights, Keaton's psychopathic evil man is here, a madman who is too witty and charismatic to be condemned.
