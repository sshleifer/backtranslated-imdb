The rebirth of old movies that you thought were average is not necessarily a good thing. Sometimes they get worse. Fangori Camp Championships (in Gorezone it was referred to as "the most horrifying film from Texas by CHAINSAW"? No, no), LUTHER GEEK inexplicably developed a cult following as an "intense" horror picture. Is it just an average stalk and a slash? Uh, a movie bite that briefly separates from the package by presenting a killer who clucks like a chicken. Yes, clucks like chicken. At the very least, the filmmaker did not make the killer sound like a duck in New New York. That would be stupid. Narrative logic is completely abandoned in LUTHER THE GEEK. I'm not saying that slasher movies are plentiful, but at least in HALLOWEEN Michael Myers escaped. Luther is actually paroled after a long scene where people argue that he is reformed, even though he clucks like a chicken and has a tooth razor (which he apparently created in prison). It's the kind of movie the couple sees in the door thoughtfully and the girl refuses to say, "Oh, my mom had to forget her keys. She forgot a lot of things since Dad died." The movie, where a hysterical mother hits a cop, is looking for Luther and tells him, "The murderer is in my house!" So what does he do? He grabs her and literally pulls her back into the house and says, "Just show me where he is and I'll do the rest." Why not call back? It is too bad that the film is filled with such terrible action and dialogue, because Luther's character is actually quite interesting. Most of the loans go to Ed Terry, Tom Noonan's dead ringman at MANHUNTER, which gives tempting Luther the real air of threat. In the hands of the right director, LUTHER THE GEEK could be on the same level as SONNY BOY or SANTA SANGRE and be a real movie specialty. But Albright is not the director, and only the fascinating character of Luther leads into boring slasher traps.
