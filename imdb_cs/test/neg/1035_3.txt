Frustrating document. The son of Louis Kahn's son, who had only minimally seen his father since he was a member of only one of three separate families created by his father, is trying to explore more about his father by exploring his architecture and his life. It sounds like a great idea for a document, but it ends up being flat and uninteresting. Unfortunately, the basic problem is that Kahn's son Nathaniel is not just one of the film's protagonists --- he is also a director, writer, producer, interviewer and narrator. Nathaniel seems too inexperienced and perhaps too close to material to work well in any of these roles. Furthermore, while it is a pretty handsome man, he does not have too much presence on the screen, so the fact that he is the only constant in the film is worn. Nathaniel also encounters an unprepared and amateur interviewer --- there are a few points where the interviewee makes an interesting or provocative statement and the camera takes a picture of Nathaniel, who offers a little more than a blank look and a shy one. uh-huh "as if he was a little panicked to have to come up with something he could answer. Sometimes I felt embarrassed by watching people who might have really interesting things about Kahn (or at least better things with their time) when they realized they were in the hands of an interviewer who would rely on them. lead a conversation. Nathaniel's double role as a documentarist and a lost son seems to make the film more than help. One of them is that some of the respondents are reluctant to really open up on the negative aspects of Kahn's personality and career, probably because Nathaniel is unclear whether he is trying to dig into the truth or just wants to hear nice stories about his father - - best those that confirm his hope that his dad really cared about Nathaniel and his mother before it seemed likely. His passive attitude as an interviewer can stem directly from this conflict. The only person Nathaniel is pushing is his own mother, but these conversations tend to feel a bit like a bad teen drama (Not ANGRY, Mom?) And they don't offer much in terms of helping us (or Nathaniel) understand Kahn or the loyalty they make he evoked from the people around him. What the film desperately misses is to form an experienced and independent hand, not to exclude Nathaniel, but to balance his subjectivity and inexperience. They have gone away from the material, given that they could think more about what the interviewees could do, and hopefully cut out parts of the documentary process that just don't work, such as a strange segment with a guy who says he saw Kahn died (which made it look like Nathaniel was just taken by a loony), or a whole bit about hooking up with Kahn's first cousin, who had nothing to say about Kahn or Nathaniel. or near the building of Kahn buttonholi told them that his father was a designer. (Ahhh? Huh. Thaaat is nice, sir. Umm? I have to go now.) I understand why these things could be important to Nathaniel and that the documentary process is sometimes interesting, but that's one of those examples where a document can be a TOO personal. As a party I thought the score written for the movie was great! (But one of the strangest moments in the whole thing was for me when, during a tour of the Kimball Art Museum), voice notes quote Kahn as a comparison between architecture and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Beethoven's NINTH Symphony, mistake? Injury? Who knows? That made me laugh.) Kahn was a great architect and it's clear that he was an unusual person and had an interesting life story. He is definitely a good documentary about him. One is sympathetic to Nathaniel's search for a father he didn't know, but I'm not sure it's an interesting story. It doesn't work so well in this movie either.
