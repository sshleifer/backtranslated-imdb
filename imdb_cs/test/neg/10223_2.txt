Walt was especially fond of. So how come producers in Disney would release such a terribly modified, roughly acted (even for family fare!) Movie Disorder? GREAT GREEN had a good concept. And because it's Disney, you know how the movie will appear. But GREEN GREEN is terrible. Jokes are lame. And Steve Guttenburg, still alive, pulls another terrible performance about his biography. Children with too much time on hand in the small town of Elma are given the opportunity to play their new teacher in football. But children know nothing. And kindly for us, see Steve Guttenburg trying to hit the teacher from start to finish. <br /> <br /> The camera does not work faster. LARGE GREEN is full of accelerated tempo of the characters moving the movie. Children are not idiots. They will catch themselves if you give them enough help without showing all the trash. Guttenburg, once in his life, should refuse an offer to join this film. Also, the nice Olivia d'Abo should also call. A GREAT GREEN can be known as the "Big Bomb."
