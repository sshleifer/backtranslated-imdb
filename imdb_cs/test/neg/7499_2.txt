Am I the only one who thinks this is a bad movie? I admit that horror movies often lack things like big story or good gaming or even good special effects. But the way these shortcomings meet in this film is surprisingly pathetic. Poor Story: The idea of ​​a raped vagina that has been revenge by turning into a male individual sounds pretty funny, but what the author wrote is stupid. Bad Behavior: Actors move like puppets. They play and look like people who really try hard but can't act. Bad FX: Especially Van explosion looks inexpressively cheap. It is surprising that the director, who has made some nice movies in his carrier, is moving on to such things.
