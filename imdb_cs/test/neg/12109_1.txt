To even say that this film is Sebastien's work at his best, tell you everything you need to know about the man. Sebastien is pathetic, stupid, not entertaining at best, but a very popular guest on French television. If observing any of his programs is free of torture for any normally created human being, his first (ie, Only Hope) film has proven to be the worst. Sebastien's rape excuse (victim fell in love with his aggressor) is not only poorly placed, but obviously unacceptable. I highly recommend that you not bother to look at this picture (or any future features of Sebastien), you would just lose your time ... There's something about French television that doesn't feel right ... and this is Patrick Sebastien !!!
