Twelve oceans: just stupid, bad and nothing compared to the other two. <br /> <br /> Artistic Robbery. At least 10 known actors. Weak scenario and very slow development idea. That is why I characterize a movie I have seen for at least 20 minutes. Don't get me wrong, maybe you like it. But I like Ocean movies just because of Heist. If Ocean 12, it's not about Heist, what's the point of seeing it? Glad Soderberg saw his main mistake and redeemed himself by making the film far better than the first one. Kudos for it. Steven Soderberg is not a really good director. In addition to his hit "Sex Lies and Videotapes" ... nothing else has happened so great for this director's career. Shame on him. Just his fault.
