I'm sorry, but after watching the credits, I thought it would be a decent homage to former SF players. The boy was wrong. The direction and narration of POS stories are terrible. I've never been so offended by a production. I have great respect and love for many actors in this "movie," but I have to say they were called. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen this debacle yet, do yourself a favor and avoid it. It's not just two hours before you return, but it also destroys your respect for some of the actors you once enjoyed.
