In Thailand, Americans Connor (Colin Egglesfield) and his girlfriend Amanda (Meredith Monroe) argue in Muay-Thai combat and Amanda leaves Connor alone. She asks the hotel about the stranger, the middle vampire Niran (Don Hetrakul), and she is bitten and kidnapped by his gang of evil vampires in motorbikes. Connor joins the clan of "good" vampires led by Sang (Stephanie Chao) and tries to save Amanda from Niran's claws. I expected "Vampires: Turning" to be a good movie. Places and cinematography are beautiful; very heavy music score is excellent; Stephanie Chao is beautiful and attractive; but the screenplay and director are unfortunately terrible and the very loose Meredith Monroe costume doesn't help her. The story is very short and unknown Marty Weiss uses long scenes with a motorcycle race, fighting and boring flashbacks to complete the minimum time of the movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Vampiros: A Convers√£o" ("Vampires: Conversion")
