If someone wants to have a character in the film that could disrupt the sexual encounter that would embarrass him in later life, the only thing the audience would see as a disgrace was the bestiality, and now it has happened. Judging by some other comments, it didn't work well either. I can't remember one funny scene, though I have to admit that I had to turn it off before I turned it off. I looked at the director's commentary and seemed to be as surprised as anyone who did the film well. If you want to get the same feeling that you get out of this movie, but only cheaper, keep your head in a pile of dung and breath deeply.
