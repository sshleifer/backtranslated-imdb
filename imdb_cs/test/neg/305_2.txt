The film's assumption was very promising - a kind of Napoleon Dynamite movie. And to be fair, there were some funny moments and funny lines, but overall it wasn't very good. The scenario and dialogue seemed to be a local sketch, full of clich√©s and scenes that were predictable. However, there was enough that was fun that I got stuck to see how it ended because there was something special about the end. But it seems that either the movie ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely sudden, almost skipping directly from what seemed to be the key conflict in the film's final credits. Overall, it was very unsatisfactory, but not entirely unnoticeable ...
