Zombie movies are hot, I love them. I can't get enough. Why would I buy a movie of this caliber without explanation, I just love zombies. Surprise, it really is not much of a zombie movie; I can handle a low budget, just cheating on me. <br /> <br /> A group of horrific film cliches are stuck in a warehouse / lab / who-knows-how to escape a fireplace outside. Panic, screaming, weak light and (eventually) zombies follow. I feel bad for filmmakers because it is obvious they really thought they were putting together something good; serious, horrifying horror. It's not far away, it's a boring mess with wooden acting, cheese FX, bad lighting, excessive dialogue and over cut. for characters to ever sit down and figure out what's going on. It's worse when they go another 20 minutes and still sit around trying to figure out what's going on. All this is covered with idle and bad dialogue. Finally, someone joins (but not zombies) and hopes flicker just by touch before the characters crawl around the whining (the only one who generates emotions) about how much it upsets. Me too guys, me too. Finally, the zombies are in the mix, but nobody cares about it. I think there was some blood in it and gore tossed in, but I was too busy praying to see the credits. And when the screen finally faded black, I felt even more deceived by the useless "Cube" inspired end. I will give it for that I tried very hard, even though it failed miserably. This and the punk chick was very hot if it was completely used. You can't really recommend this, except for film students looking for "no-no". <br /> <br/> 4/10
