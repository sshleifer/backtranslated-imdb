Except Frankie Muniz understands too quickly (Malcolm in the middle flashback?), This movie still can't conjure up fear. The idea of ​​a "countess" and a history around her that was put into the story was fun, but a plot, and many side plots, just didn't tie up. Fence synopsis: killing the spirit attracts victims through video games. Throwing some blood splatters and special effects and you get another bombed would be a horror movie. Spiritual clergy resemble the spirit in "The Ring Two" too much. Behavior and constant and dramatic change in each person's emotions is incredible. Save your money.
