Bulletproof is clearly a one-shot film. The kind where a bullet has fed good people and bad guys is sprayed everywhere so much that you really can't see them like humans. Yawning between lines from Wayans and Sandler is really extensive. He tries hard, but, unfortunately, a favor, persona itself is not a good movie. Jimmy Caan plays a handy villain, but he always has this edge on his back. My favorite scene is the repetitive clips of a TV commercial in which Caan reveals that America's virtues can be shown to the world that they have 2 cars in every garage. Besides, it's a friendly movie with brain weapons. Pass this.
