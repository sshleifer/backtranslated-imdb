Like 'Singin' in the Rain ',' Cover Girl 'has a trio of two boys and a girl. In "Cover Girl" Phil Silvers (Genius) is a comic relief. He matches Donald O'Connor's funny male part in 'Singin in the Rain'. In Cover Girl, Gene Kelly's love interest is Rita Hayworth and in 'Rain', it's Debbie Reynolds. This is where the comparison ends. While "Singin 'in the Rain" is a classic American film musical, "Cover Girl" is average incarnate, the story is not too complicated. Rusty Parker (Rita Hayworth) is a low-rent dancer at Brooklyn's Danny MacGuire, Rusty decides to join Cover Girl, sponsored by rich publisher John Coudair, who failed Rusty's grandmother a few years ago, Coudair introduced Rusty's producer Broadway Noel Wheaton Danny he feels humiliated when Rusty starts late at the nightclub rehearsals and decides to shut down the club and go out on the road to entertain the soldiers along with his sidekick, Genius. on the altar, Noel realizes the mistake of his travels and leads back to Danny, who lives happily ever after. Gene Kelly has the least developed part in the film. is that it owns a nightclub and is madly in love with Rusty. Coudair and Wheaton behave like exploited teenagers towards Rusty and Phil Silvers adds some thoroughly goofy but rude shtick. The most interesting aspect of Rita Hayworth's performance is the scene in which she gets drunk. This predicts what happened to her in real life. Anyone who has read her biography will learn that they don't like Hollywood, go to a normal home life that she never achieved, but eventually started drinking and ended up full-fledged Alzheimer's disease in the last years of her life. Almost all songs in Cover Girl are old fashioned and not too graceful. Gene Kelly has only one really great dance number and that is the scene where she dances with her "alter ego". Previously, the trio has a different number that is the pale ancestor of 'Make em laugh' from 'Singin' in the rain '. <br /> <br /> The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way Rita Hayworth is built on the pedestal. A few decades later, Raquel Welch had the same problem. Both actresses later in their career would always try to find scripts that showed their acting skills. They wanted to be known as "actresses" and not "girls". Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used women to make a profit.
