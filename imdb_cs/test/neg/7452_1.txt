I've seen this movie several times, it's definitely one of the cheapest action shots of the 1980s. So I think many viewers would definitely change the channel when they meet this one. But if you are in big waste, "Dragon Hunt" is made for you. The main characters (McNamara Twins) are big sporting mustaches and look so ridiculous in their camouflage clothes. One of the best scenes is when one of them gets shot in the foot and still digs his enemies into the nirvana. This movie is really awful, but then it's a great party tape!
