Guy Pearce almost looks like Flynn, and this resemblance is the only one this movie can claim. Nowhere in Flynn's autobiography is Klaus Reicher's character mention, homosexual encounter is speculative fiction, and the film's claim that Flynn was treating the native work badly is unfounded. Director Frank Howson has made no unforgettable movies, and I consider him to be limp, to infall Flynn unmistakably to pursue his remarkable career. <br /> <br />
