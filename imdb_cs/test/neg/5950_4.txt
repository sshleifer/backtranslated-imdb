He just finished watching this movie. I can't imagine it on VHS because there were scenes where I needed subtitles to hear through accent or sound effect, even though the scene itself was in English. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is quite appealing. Several CG effects were very obvious, but the prosthetics / creature effects were not bad. It's not perfect, but the photos and cuts (which were good enough) were spent a lot. Acting was generally bad, though how much of it could be blamed for a director I couldn't say when I had never seen any of the actors before. The exception, I think, was M. Gomez (Uxia). She stole every scene she participated in, not only because of her very nice face, but also something similar to the urgency of her performance, which none of the others had. Writing could have been much better - the conspiracy was still undoubtedly Lovecraft, and a lot of Lovecraft's details were written, but I could do it without much of the dialogue.
