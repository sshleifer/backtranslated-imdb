Let Freedom Ring was probably made with the best intentions, but it broadcasts curious mixed messages in the final product. People in the western city, where railroads go through, are stunned by the arrival of immigrant railroad workers, funded by robber Baron Edward Arnold. There are few farmers and farmers whose country stands in the railroad way, and these people are treated by collectively hired Arnold men. One man who does not give up is Lionel Barrymore, whose son returns from a law firm from Harvard and is ready to accept the cause of the ranch. Only Nelson Eddy decided that the best way to fight is to go Zorro to the bad guys. But besides Charles Butterworth, no one knows it's Wasp (by the way, a very interesting choice of names). What Arnold did is to use the proven methods of political bosses in the East to vote for immigrants. Nelson's idea is simple, if the immigrants knew only the truth about what the bad guy Arnold was, they would vote with the original settlers and head out into their midst an alien city political machine. He kidnaps newspaper editor Raymond Walburn and takes him and prints to a mountain cave where some subversive newspapers are printed and distributed. Railway workers are a real mixed group of immigrants, not an Irish working west or a Chinese working east, as history has. It is a real United Nations working on the Arnold Railway. Workers are held in line with Victor Victor McLaglen, and Nelson has the unenviable task of defeating some sense into him as John Wayne did in The Quiet Man. Of all the movies that Jeanette and Nelson had played and they sure got into history as a duo, that was the worst of what they did in MGM. Nelson is to be hanged with Barrymore for crimes that are at best undefined, but it's definitely not worth hanging up. And Virginia Bruce, who plays Nelson's girlfriend, rescues the day by portraying My Country Tis of Thee that the immigrants join. Faced with his rebellion paid for immigrants, Arnold quite rationally packs and leaves the city to build his railroad somewhere else. It's not me, it's over. What kind of news is it, vote with the settlers and lose your job with Arnold? But will you get here? I wonder sometimes if 20 years after the events of this film took place and the city settled in sleepy water in the west, while some of the cities where the railroad went through are now cities, that good citizens of this city have not thought on what Nelson Eddy did. If they did, they would probably go on the rail. Of course, Nelson is in a good voice and has a number of concert and popular songs that they sing, including ballads to immigrants, written by Sigmund Romberg. Where Otherwise But Here. The song is a sincere tribute to an immigrant who has come to terms with his land. Too bad it didn't have a better place. Nearly Platinum Blonde Virginia Bruce is definitely dubbed. And I'm sure Jeanette MacDonald was just as happy that Nelson hadn't come to that west.
