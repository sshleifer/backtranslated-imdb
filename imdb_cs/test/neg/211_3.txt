After 15 minutes I knew how it would end. It's a clich√© movie with stupid settings. I'm a big fan of thieving movies, but this doesn't mean anything new or special. It's probably an insidious robbery that was bad because "hot head - bad guy" shoots ass, and of course "make a good guy" goes on a moral path. The reason it's stupid and unbelievable is. When you are so far away that you killed your ass, why not just kill that guy who is standing between you and 43 million. They have 45 minutes to steal money and the robbery stage nobody in the true spirit would hesitate to shoot Mr. "make good" and in this case he is the guy he has known for days. to move quickly from the center, but I dug it up and I regret it
