Every time I see a movie like this, I'm sick of my stomach. When I watch a movie, I like to see what I see in everyday life. When I go through the day, I see blacks, whites, Asians, Latinos, etc. ... How do you make a film and don't think other ethnic groups will walk around you? I'm sure they didn't do it intentionally, but they pay attention. I don't care if he's in Kansas or South Central. I saw only one black token. It was typical in the 80s. Hi! It's 2007, with all the rappers, singers and athletes working as actors Thomas Haden Church could pay more attention to his cast. Shouldn't Actors Be More Liberal?
