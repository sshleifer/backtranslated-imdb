So what do you do if you're a porn star with faded glances? I know, become a pop star! This document - and I use this term freely - follows Colton's courts and tribulations when it tries to transform from gay porn star to electronic music singer (reading: dance). I just want Mr. Ford's voice to be as muscular as his arm ... I'm sorry his vocals are painfully thin. It's not very interesting here, but Mr. Ford and friends are a feast for the eyes. You'll see how he records a song that sounds just like any other mindless dance melody. See how he travels to New York to "make a connection." You see him go back to L.A with little success. Look in the mirror and ask, "Why am I wasting my time watching this mess?"
