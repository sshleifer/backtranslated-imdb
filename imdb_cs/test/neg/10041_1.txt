BELL WITCH HAUNTING (aka THE HAUNT) is an American horror movie, allegedly based on real events that took place between 1817 and 1821. This is not to be confused with BELL WITCH: THE MOVIE, and Betsy's movie Palmer based on the same events. However, I can say that I wish I saw this other film instead of what I saw! I enjoyed Betsy Palmer on Friday 13th. I think that even on a bad day, she could do better than anyone involved in the travesty known as THE HAUNT. <br /> <br /> As for my number, this film is not painful to watch because the content is distracting. It's painful to watch because it's just downright boring. <br /> <br /> Reading positive reviews for this movie, I could only identify three options. The first option - these authors have somehow engaged in production. The second option - authors who were not directly involved, were paid for writing positive reviews after production was completed. The ultimate option - none of these authors have seen enough horror movies, and so is inexperienced with the concepts they use to make successful attempts. The land setting is Robertson County, Tennessee. James Johnston gets a visit from two journalists eager to hear the story of the Bell Witch. The story is told as a series of flashbacks. A series of supernatural events takes place in John Bell's house and his family. Soon it turns out to be a vengeful spirit behind him. On the surface, the plot seems to be a standard poltergeistic issue, although one is based on real events. <br /> <br /> But where a brilliant concept is done, it is all that could go wrong. And then some! First, acting. The meeting is almost evenly horrible right over the deck. This factor causes the most damage to production, which undermines any possible credibility of the belief or interest of the viewer. The voice of a vengeful spirit sounds more like a teenage girl who experiences teenage angst rather than a powerful demonic power expressing a malicious intention. I almost laughed when I heard some of her lines. Unfortunately, this voice has become very annoying very quickly! Maybe I wasn't alive in the 1800s, but it is incredibly hard for me to believe that every young woman alive at that time will speak so that this "spirit" does! Second, direction. The direction is random and very uneven. Some scenes show promise, but the potential is missed by a clearly inexperienced director. Nothing is done with the camera, with sound or lighting to add intensity to the scenes to be scary. The atmosphere is equally flat. The vengeful spirit is said to be behind the supernatural events. However, the effects are so incredibly awkward that no one who sees a proper horror movie would buy into them. I'll give one example. In one scene, somebody attacks someone. Look at the scene for yourself. It's almost funny - almost. Third, the script. While these events may be true to actual events, it cannot be denied that most scenes are incredibly flat and boring. Scenes that are less than two minutes long feel bad for dialogue - a dialogue that doesn't add depth to characters or story. This movie is too dependent on interviews to move the story forward. Although this style was also the case of British films from the British horror flourish of the 1960s and 1970s, it cannot be denied that dialogue exchanges have always been interesting to watch in these professional earlier works. For example, Peter Cushing could read the phone book and still the viewers' attention. The same cannot be said about the actors in The HAUNT. Finally, humor. Unsuccessful humor attempts in this film are unbearable. An overweight boy is the ass of many jokes. One particularly terrible scene sees the boy go to the outside toilet. This scene should never be included - but it is and is complemented by sound effects if you don't understand what it does! The only positive point of the film are placement and costumes. The decision to rotate the image near the original location helped add some authenticity. The costumes were also well chosen. Overall, HAUNT is a scary movie. It's not even in "so bad it's a good" league. Instead, it's just boring. I encourage everyone to save money and avoid this movie as a plague. Don't even bother to see it for free! I've never seen another movie about Bell Witch. But it really can't be any worse than the HAUNT. Could it? I'll give this other film a chance to watch it. Meanwhile, I would recommend that everyone try some horror movies about ghosts and ghosts. LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE, CHANGELING, RING, GRUDGE (Japanese original) and ONE MISSED CALL are good places to start.
