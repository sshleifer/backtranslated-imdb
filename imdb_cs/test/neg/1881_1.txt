What really impressed me on this movie was that it sounded so fake. First, who in the late 1980s (when the film is taking place) lived like this family? A college professor would not make enough money to support the lifestyle I saw on the film. Therefore, he and his wife stay would be plagued by financial woes, especially when she gets cancer. Second, Streep is my age and most women, especially in their class (educated, white, well), have experienced a feminist movement. But this woman seems to ignore her anachronistic behavior. Actually, I felt that he was a very control woman who keeps her husband an emotional child by taking care of his every need. In the past, I have admired Carl Franklin's films and actually like Meryl Streep, but gad, what a manipulative and false film.
