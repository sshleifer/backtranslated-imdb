I saw Wicked Little Things as part of "8 Movies To Die For" Horrorfest, and this was the only movie that disappointed me. Mom, her little girl and teenage daughter settle in an abandoned house in the Pennsylvania mountains. But every night, the vengeful spirits of the children killed in the coal mine run and kill everyone they find. I'd say the director guessed on his audience that children would be able to kill pickaxes and eat the human body (which is rich in footage, as a nice tribute to George Romero) because the film is not otherwise frightening. Simply put, there are too many founding shots of evil children running to their next place of murder. If someone gets into the barn, it will shoot the children who get into the barn (oh voltage) and then move to kill. Come to think about it, why do kids suddenly walk so slowly when they cover their prey? And not that I have any experience in it, but I think the shotgun blast fits the baby A LOT FARTHER before this movie suggests ...? Nor does it help that my mother is one of the worst parents I've ever seen in every movie. "The lock on the front door is destroyed"? IN WOOD WITH WOOD AND SEA BOTTLES, YOU HAVE A BETTER LEARNED GOOD PERSON! FIX IT, MORON !!! In addition, Mum and her eldest daughter look too close to each other - even to teenage pregnancies, and there's an incredible death that involves sneaking on someone trying to pull the car out of the mud's ass. I give it 3 because he tried it. It's not bad to spray a movie. But for good fear go somewhere else.
