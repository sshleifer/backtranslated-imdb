First, if you want to make a good movie, don't fill the entire exposure in the last 10 minutes. The viewer is expected to be almost two hours confused, just to let Margo's father explain everything to Alexi very late in the movie. To make matters worse, the screenwriter decided that it wasn't enough for a basic secret to be resolved, but it gave us a totally useless murder that we knew nothing about (with Alex's father!). <br /> <br /> There's something serious motivational problems with the characters as well. Margo's father's choices do not seem to make sense once the movie is over. Why didn't he just kill Philippe's father? Instead, the elaborate plot to conceal the truth is devised, but the one which ensures that everyone will be in physical danger for years (including a completely innocent photographer, who gets murdered Philippe's criminals). Although Alex is a physician (who thinks he is fairly clear), he decided to flee the police, during which he not only threatens his own life, but also those involved in the ugly pile on the highway. Why was Margo's friend so enthusiastic that Margo promised her when all the bullshit hit Alex? And should we think Margin's father would rather kill than go to jail? What about his wife? Has she considered her wishes? These are some of the major issues. Then there are some nasty details like: why was her father there on the night of her fake death? How did he get on the drug addict's body in such a short time and quickly return him to bury him with the other two? Alex's friend Bruno seems to be extremely eager to be part of the chaos he and his friends have to kill for Alexa, despite the perceived debt he owes Alex for saving his son's life. What good photos would Margo do? Philippe is not at all concerned. And why should Margo have a safe deposit box for her potential kidnappers that night? Do I miss any other things? Probably. Minor irritation is the fact that although Alex is a doctor, he smokes like a devil. Which leads to his marathon running away from the police, even more impressive. Also, when driving in a convertible with your lawyer, neither of them has a seat belt. How bright could they be?
