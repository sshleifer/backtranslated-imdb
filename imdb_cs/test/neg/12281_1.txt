I had to write a review for this movie based on those who say bloody, non-stop action, great movie .. <br /> <br /> These people probably watched another movie. Killpoint sincerely sucked from the word go !! I waited and waited for this film to improve and it was fruitless. Some said this film was brutal and others said bloody, but I can't find any of the adjectives that actually appear in it, I think there are so many scenes with people who are shot and there's no blood at all it's not even funny! ! I think the best way to summarize this is that PG should be rated according to the standards of 1984 and now in 2010 there is no doubt that it will be PG !! Bad, BAD is not in the fun movie "B" variety !!
