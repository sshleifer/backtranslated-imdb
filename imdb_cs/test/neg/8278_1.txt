The movie review is for me an extension of my love for film - and especially horror. The reviews I have written so far have been for films that I love, respect and admire, and I eagerly appreciated them with shining honors and perfect ten ratings. A lifelong horror movie fan, I am delighted to share my thoughts and ideas about big horror movies with others, and hopefully they will be able to expose people to films they might not otherwise seek. . Only recently did I start exploring IMDB movies and it was my first intention to focus solely on my personal favorites, researching those that, in my opinion, are the essence and lasting value of the horror genre. However, the existence of movies like "Graduation Day" is, without a pun, a thorn in my side. Completely without merit, this 1981 hour of unfinished thoughts is an amateur-driven, misbehaving, and in every sense incredible embarrassment for horror. During the short few years before and after the release of this film, we saw the appearance of home (and Canadian) movies like "Halloween II", "Prom Night", "Terror Train", "Madman", "My Bloody Valentine," "" Prowler, "" Just before dawn, "" Final rehearsal, "and" Hell's night, "among others. These films, albeit with varying degrees of quality, have clearly sought to achieve something in terms of story, plot, acting, direction, and overall tone. Not every movie released during this rich period of the Slasher era would be of merit or commercial success of the original "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th," but these films were all well-made and clearly contributed to the ongoing development. horror cinema. "Graduation Day," an abysmal farce about a masked killer who chased high school team members, was directed by Herb Freed, who can only hope he will never attempt a horrible genre with such aggressiveness. The task of creating valuable horror movies is best left to those who have true love and respect for the genre. This film unfortunately fails at all possible levels, the smallest of which are horrible wooden performances, special effects with a ten-year trade, irritating musical scores and, above all, a story with no indication of tension or tension. An unthinkable exercise in wasting your movie, "Graduation Day" is a total horror of horror.
