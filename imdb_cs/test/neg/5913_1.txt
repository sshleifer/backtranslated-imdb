That's really one of the worst movies ever made - and I don't mean that bad way. Eddie Murphy is a great comedian and this is proof of how bad this movie is that he almost killed his career. Writing and directing are awkward, the sets and productions are just as imaginative as Brady Bunch's episode and acting shows how bad a great cast can be when he has nothing to do with him. If it weren't for costumes - which, besides Eddie Murphy, seem to be responsible for the bulk of the budget - you'd swear that this thing was knocked down by a lot of highly educated schoolboys wasting peppermint. That anyone who can find this patience somehow witty or fun is overwhelming. It is probably no coincidence that misleading souls who praise this smelly are hardly literate. But if your idea of ​​delight is Della Reese getting her "pinkie toe" shot away, then by all means, put down her drooling cup and go rent this movie.
