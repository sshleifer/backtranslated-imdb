I do not mind the creative ideas that are embedded in these films, but seriously. There is no cohesive part of the game in this movie. It seems to be a trend to buy rights and then just make a movie that has nothing to do with what fans want. This cutting is almost fun because you know you're giving up hiding behind the lack of skills and money control (not yours) that allows you to. Play a game, hire someone, and please create a real movie, or get in the ring and put your ass together as you claim. <br /> <br /> wow, 9 lines of text and I was done. she had to add blaa to scare you, sorry
