It takes forever for this typically over-simplified and idiotic film based on Stephen King, who finally gets out of the starting blocks. About half an hour is devoted to unnecessary introductions to various boring characters and their irrelevant little personal issues that could upset the boring housewives and apathetic retirees in soap dramas, but this is supposed to be a horror genre (or so naively). Mutt does not look so fearsome that Leonard Maltin, notoriously helpless / hopeless and always a funny film critic, would disagree with: Cujo considers "really scary". (I often wonder if Maltin is really fat - or just likes to do a favor for his Hollywood friends ...) It's both illogical and inconsistent the way Wallace survives an attack with only a leg injury. And her car naturally falls apart when she needs her to save her life: this is one of the oldest horror clich√©s; to trust the king to use him for minimal effect. The assumption is imbecile, too banal, even for horror movies: angry mutt attacks the family. Is that it? This kind of thing hardly represents a 3-minute sub-sub-fence in your average zombie movie. I think Cujo must have felt that he was playing in Turkey. Mutts have terrible agents ... But what I really don't understand is how people can really fit into the book "Cujo" and read it from the envelope to cover it? These SK fans must be immortal: this is the only explanation, ie, why it treats time as such an insignificant commodity. Bodycount: 3.
