If she wasn't married to a producer, Jennifer Jones wouldn't be the most obvious choice for a leading female role in this tragic story of an American soldier and English nurse affair, built on the background of World War I. Her British accent is not perfect, and in the fifties it was unusual for a great romantic lead to go to her actress in her thirties, even as attractive as Miss Jones, especially when she was a few years older than her leading man. There were a number of beautiful young British actresses in Hollywood around this time, such as Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean Simmons and Joan Collins, any of whom might have been more convincing in the role, but Miss Jones had one important attribute they all missed, namely, a marriage certificate with David O. Selznick's name on it. In this case, it turned out that the film was such a turkey, which was undoubtedly grateful for not having it on his CVs. A long-length film tells the story of a romance between American volunteer Frederick, who served as an ambulance driver in the Italian army, and Catherine, a nurse of the British Red Cross. After the Italian defeat at the Battle of Caporetto, Frederick is incorrectly charged with being a German spy and sentenced to death. (The film is a very rough picture of Italian military justice; it seems that the Italian courts have the power to pass a death sentence after a thirty-second trial without hearing any evidence and without allowing the defendant to be legally represented or speak in his defense. ). Frederick manages to escape and cross the border to neutral Switzerland accompanied by Catherine. Hemingway's novels have not always been a great success in filming. Howard Hawks succeeded in making a good version of "To Have and Have Not", a film that is considerably better than the book on which it is nominally based, but it is because he largely ignored Hemingway's plot and turned the film into a remake of "Casablanca", based in Martinique rather than French Morocco. Like the 1943 version of "For Who the Bell Toll", "Farewell to the Guns" is too long and deadly slow to move. It's too bad. Jennifer Jones never lets Catherine come to life. As for Rock Hudson, his supposed Christian name could unfortunately be appropriate. He could be as strong as rock, but also impolite as one, and in this film his Frederick appears to be the personification of the Great Stone Face. Despite the passion and emotion inherent in Hemingway's conspiracy, the emotional temperature is always too cold. The picture has little to do except for some attractive views of postcards from Italian and Swiss scenery. No wonder it was not a success and that his failure ended up as Selznick's career as a producer. 4/10 <br /> <br /> Terror. Shortly before the Caporetta battle, an Italian officer said Russia had already made a separate peace with Germany. This battle began in October 1917, at a time when Kerensky Russia was still fighting alongside the Allies. The Russian Revolution took place only in November; it was just the "October Revolution" by the Old Julian Calendar. The new Bolshevik regime signed a truce with Germany in December 1917, but a separate peace was not signed until the Brest-Litovsk Treaty in March 1918
