All right, this movie could be good if there was a plot behind it. After ten minutes, the title didn't fit. the wind didn't have a lot of work with the rest of the movie. acting was subpara, and writing reminded me of something you would read in a children's book of terrifying stories. <br /> <br /> As for horror movies, it shouldn't be classified as one. It was a horror for horror fans and thrillers everywhere. I hate being so cruel, but I felt I wanted the time I spent watching this movie. hopefully it will not follow. This movie should be locked in a vault and never be published for viewing.
