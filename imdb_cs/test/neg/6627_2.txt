Or at least a retirement pension! This film is terrible, terrible, terrible, good, rotten, ugly ... well, you have an idea. DO NOT use this piece of crumbling waste under any circumstances if you do not wish a deadly wish because it will certainly kill you. (I just survived because I missed the first half hour.) Carrot Top is a bad comedian and even worse actor. I can't believe he got someone to fund this huge time and money. It's just to show that some people have no snippets if they think they could make money or two (literally ... I can't imagine more than $ 2!). And somebody please tell me what sort of motivation Courtney Thorne Smith (halfway decent actress, certainly in any case) thought she signed up for this smoking pile of manure. Was it boring during the 3.5 second dry spell between Melrose Place and Ally McBeal? Or did she owe some karmic debt The most annoying person on the planet's face (aka carrot above)? I give it 2/10, and that's probably too high. I'm trying to save my '1's for movies that make me vomit, and since I haven't seen all these one my stomach content has fortunately remained contained. I don't think I'll watch it again to see if it's really worth it!
