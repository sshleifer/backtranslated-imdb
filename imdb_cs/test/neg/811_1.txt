Set in 1945, Skenbart follows an unsuccessful Swedish book editor who decides to take a non-stop train to Berlin. Unfortunately for everyone around them, it is walking misfortune, causing chaos wherever it goes. The train also holds a man and his mistress intending to murder a man's wife (who is also on the train), a soldier on his way home, two homosexual gentlemen, an angry train conductor, two nuns, a lot of refugees and even more people. As a mix of noir-ish thriller (which does it quite well - at least at the beginning) and comedy, the film fails with both. It doesn't match how the film changes tone with every new scene. And as the train goes to its final destination, the film becomes more bizarre, ending on a really surrealistic note. Good pieces are unnecessary in countless conspiracies and characters. Skenbart is full of famous Swedish actors, no matter how small it is. It seems to me that all the filmmakers rang all the people they worked with and offered them a share in the film. It is a pity that the performances are as bad as the script (it's your lines - they don't read them!). The comedy is more or less grotesque, with the same jokes repeated over and over again. The tempo is incredibly slow over time (quite often in fact) when on the scene, especially dragging for about ten minutes without good reason. The screenwriter also seems to think the oath is a good way to replace a decent dialogue. The film looks great, in moody B&W, but is unnecessary on a film that is in every other department. [1/10]
