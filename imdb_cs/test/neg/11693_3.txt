I am a fan of horror movies, no matter where they come from. I know what to expect from the West, the East and most of the horrors in the middle. So I received the "Acacia" DVD in the post and I was looking forward to the slow build-up of ever-increasing tensions and terrifying children with strange, discontinuous movements hiding under the duvets. The main selling point of this movie is that it has a much more linear story than many of this ilk - you get who the characters are, where they are from and what they do. You get basic information (a nice couple, you can't have children) and remember that the assumption is too normal for something to happen. And then comes the bad. Complaint number one is that the story is OBVIOUS. I got it almost when the baby embraced the tree. I knew where the film was going and I was even able to predict the order of death and why. The cut is shocking and unfortunately not in favor of the film. Even though I was still thinking about events, the tension is not allowed to build because the director seems to have got a new birthday editing kit and wanted to use it as much as possible. <br /> <br /> gripe is this .... the tree was useless. That would be an absolutely good story about subtle horror when a few people broke up over the death of a child - the titular tree did not buy anything, nor anything exciting. So I'll quit where I started - my overall impression was 'Oh.'
