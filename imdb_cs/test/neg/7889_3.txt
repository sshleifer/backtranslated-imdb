This film, intended as a light entertainment, is truly successful first during its first half, but then succumbs to the fast founding scenario that drops it. Harry (Judd Nelson), a "reformed" thief, and Daphne (Gina Gershon), an aspiring actress, are employed as a live window dummy in a department store where one evening they are late in leaving and are locked inside, whereupon they are witnesses, \ t Their less than protective glass observation point, the apparent killing on the street. The apparent murderer Miles Raymond (Nick Mancuso), a local sculptor, will return the next day to watch the dummies, realizing that they are the only possible witnesses of the violent event of the previous night, and when one of the "tearing" pairs begins, the fun begins. Daphne and Harry announce their observations at the local police station, but when the detective takes the news of the crime, he becomes cynical. There are plenty of ways the movie can become frayed, and it manages to use most of them, including the mandatory slow motion bedroom. A low budget issue shot in Vancouver, even police procedural aspects are displayed rote. Always capable of doing something of his role, Mancuso is incredibly histrionic, so bizarre, that he attacks his lines with obvious free pressure. Although the film plunges into nonsense, cameraman Glen MacPherson prefers not to watch this suit, as he prepares for the camera and sheds light on some amazingly performed songs that the viewer can focus on, ignoring holes and intrepid dialogue. Well-formed score, appropriately based on action, contributes to Hal Beckett. This dialogue is initially somewhat fresh and introduced by Nelson and Gershon, but predictability prevails in the following context of erroneous continuity and logic. The direction reflects a lack of original ideas or perspectives, and post-production deficiencies set work back than one would expect with a basic thriller.
