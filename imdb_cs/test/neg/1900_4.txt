It was one of Christie's later stories. During her long career, she was interested in the changing story and the notion of conflicting factors. Both are basically the same, and they are arguing about who controls or creates the situation. In detective fiction there is a game of conflicting realities. The killer intends to change reality to deceive the detective, the writer intends to do the same to the reader. The reader and the detective are in similar struggles to create what they see. That's why her stories often include writers. In his works, he explores every combination of the tricks he thinks about it. On the way, we often have bodies that are not who they seem, and times, and intended victims, and so on. But the real magic of books is this notion of control. It was literally a building in 'Bertram'. Here's a dead man. Sometimes it happens, but not like that. It's like the writer was famous Mr. Rafiel. This is especially sweet for Marple readers who remember the same character from "Carribean Mystery", which was also in a way framed by a nephew. In this story, Rafiel was the carrier of the story to the authorities. <br /> <br /> The producers of this series have an almost unusual commitment to using another creative team on each of them. Sometimes it produces subtle work. Bertram's episode was somewhat brilliantly introduced. This one is the richest in the series and has an active camera. But unlike Bertram's work, it has nothing to do with the story. <br /> <br /> The camera moves and captures just because it can. At the beginning, Citizen Kane was too literal and dull. This story is good, but the adapter has taken out some very critical things, and it's irrelevant camera inconvenience. Ted's rating - 2 of 3: Has some interesting features.
