I really like Kinski, he's a great actor. I saw this movie because I heard there are autobiographical aspects in this movie. The film is full of symbols like the river sinking in the river or strange shadow images on the walls. The narrator then always says abstract sentences like: "The child sells wealth, but her box is now empty." This is really disturbing and it wasn't really necessary because everyone understands what the whole film is about. The film shows how the Kinski character treated a woman and how he kept them under control. If there are really any aspects of Kinsh life in this story - then he was really a pig. There is no need to watch this movie unless you want to see Kinsky naked or if you like sick movies to laugh.
