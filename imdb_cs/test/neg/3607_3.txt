... but of course I was wrong. Now I never expected to like the first movie. I'm not sure what's going on with the Disney marketing group, but every trailer they make for an animated movie seems to discourage me as too childish, or stupid, or stupid, and yet movies are usually nothing but. And no movie seemed worse than in New Groove, which is why I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed the movie when I finally broke down and saw it. I entered with zero expectations and came out amusingly fun. Despite Disney's direct video record, I was hoping for a better Chronicle experience ... but at the end I was nothing but disappointed (and unfortunately I wasn't surprised that I was so felt). There is hardly any humor for adults. The original songs are uninspired and sick cute. The animation, though not bad, is still approaching the emperor (who was not the left king to start). The main plot, as such, is tremendously "smaller" and is composed mainly of a sequence of mini-plot flashbacks - in fact while the moment felt more like a sequence of pilot episodes for the Saturday morning cartoon series than a well-conceived one entity. David Spade gets about four lines throughout the movie and there's not much John John Goodman, so overall we just left with too much of Kronk Patrick Warburton - who was fun as a side character in the first movie, but is totally unsuitable as the main You are here. Although children may be a little funny, the only thing Kronk New Groove has done to me is to come back and watch a much better original.
