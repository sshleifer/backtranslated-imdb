What a frustrating movie. The small southern city overflows with the possibilities to explore the complexity of interpersonal relationships and dark underbelly hidden beneath the calm surfaces, as anyone who has read something from Carson McCullers already knows. It doesn't do any of this. Instead, writers have settled for cutesy twinkles, cheap hot fuzzies and banal melodrama. The thing looks like a movie made for television and has been directed without any particular difference, but it's hard to imagine what anyone could do to make this material interesting. The Most Frustrating Aspect It is a fact that there are plenty of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast to do their best to do what they can do about it - well, there's nothing to do another word - drivel. Tragic waste of talent, especially big Stockard Channing.
