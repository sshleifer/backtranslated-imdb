It's an incredibly bad action movie. I think his primary mistake is that it's BORING. Arghh! Funky cabinets, retro chic design and decent cinematography cannot prevent this film from becoming a snoozer. The second (main) mistake of the Mod Squad is the lack of character development - underlined by the lack of actor talent. I tend to work with Claire Danes, so I was quite surprised by her non-existent performance in this movie. Giovanni Ribisi is woefully mistaken: how could his cotton mouth, a humiliating acting style, fit into the movie ACTION? As for Omar Epps, he has to take a few acting lessons to learn emotions. The man had the same facial expression for the whole movie! My suggestion is to save a few bucks and wait for me to see this cable on Turkey.
