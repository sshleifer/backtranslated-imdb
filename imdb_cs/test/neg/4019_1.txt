The 20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only a pretty stupid noir but is an incredible unreal boring film. Fully unconvincing cardboard figures are written by Edward Chodorov, which he also produced, and is surprisingly the director Jean Negulesco, who would expect much more. Miscast is Ida Lupino's leading role! Lupino, a lady who has been able to radiate as much sexual attraction as a blood orange, is under the illusion that Rita Hayworth is playing the role of Torch Singer's sexy bar room. Handsome Cornel Wilde as her lover is as timely as usual, and the pointless Celeste Holm, whose role is a little more than just a bit, is absolutely useless. Then we have Richard Widmark, who has the saddest written part in the picture! When we see him for the first time, it's a nice O.K. The guy who runs the prosperous Road House. Then suddenly - and for reasons that aren't clear enough - he becomes crazy jealous of his manager (Wilde) when he tells him he's going to marry Lupine. You see, Widmark wanted to marry her alone, but - 1) He never told her - 2) They never had a relationship (they didn't have anything that resembled a love scene together) and - 3) without being told (including Lupine)) got marriage certificate. Wow! As Widmark was supposed to achieve something like a blissful bliss with Lupine after such "courtship" is no one who has a taste. Huh? Well, when Widmark goes bits all over the affair, the movie I'm sorry for. From there, the Widmark brand unintentionally turns into a comic! His loss of balls so early in the proceedings is totally unlikely and unconvincing. Eventually going over the edge, becoming totally ambushed and with a few Tommy Udo sniggers, goes ridiculously to shoot for poor Cornel Wilde from biting the dust himself. And if it is not enough to mess the film for you - the image is also marked by the constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors. There is not a single outdoor shot in the whole movie! Added to it - 95% of the film takes place at night. <br /> <br /> In addition to the interactive print book and photo gallery, the extras also include featurette "Widmark & ​​Lupino At Fox". Whatever the documentary, it is behind me! As far as I know, they have never been in a Fox movie or anywhere else before! However, this featurette is hosted by such a heavy hitter know-alls as Robert Osborne, Eddie Muller, Rudy Belhmer and several others who have amazingly heaped praise on this tedious and cringe - provoking affair. I can say it must be me. But so far, "Road House" has been a forgotten and buried Noir, and as far as I am concerned, it should remain so. Fox would do better to release DVDs of superior and still elusive Widmark movies such as "Down To The Sea In Ships" (1949) and "Red Skies Of Montana" (1952).
