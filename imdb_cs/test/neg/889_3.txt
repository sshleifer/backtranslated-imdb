I'm not sure why manufacturers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie series, because the name suggests that this is a continuation of the first three films. Although Marques Houston appeared in "HP3", he played a totally different character (he was, eight years older) in this film. Well ... so Reid and Martin weren't the most talented and couldn't carry the film themselves, but trading on the franchise HP seems to me to be somehow (albeit less) referring to earlier movies. I'm sure everyone who wanted to see it was "deceived" - to think he saw the sequel - not a completely different film with a familiar name. And I'm sorry ... Kym Whitley's not funny, and he couldn't hold a candle for late Robin Harris, Ketty Lester, or DC Curry in earlier movies. Although Meagen Good and Mari Morrow are a substantial visual distraction ... I have to give this THUMBS DOWN !! Just naming the movie "Down to Last Minute" would be fine. In addition, the brothers Hudlin (who produced the first three films) was not involved in the production of this film.
