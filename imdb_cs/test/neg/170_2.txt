There were so many classic movies that were made where leading people were out-and-out liars, and yet they are made to look good. I never bought it. "Comics" that were related to "screwdriver comedies" were full of stuff, so there were a lot of Fred Astaire movies. Here Barbara Stanwyck plays the famous "country" writer who has been lying to the public for years. and feel that he must lie to keep his person (and her work). He even lies to the boy about getting married, another topic that has always been trivialized in classic movies. She is a New York woman who pretends to be a great cook and someone who knows how to handle children, etc. Apparently she doesn't know anything and lies are accumulating so fast that you lose track. I think all this is supposed to be funny because the lessons are taught in the end and true love wins, etc. Please go through the barf bag. Most of this movie isn't funny. Stanwyck was much better in the film noir genre. As for Dennis Morgan, well, again the bag.
