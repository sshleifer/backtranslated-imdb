This film is as bad as "The Birdman of Alcatraz". I'm not talking about acting, but about the premise of both films that try to portray psychopathic criminals as heroic characters. In addition, it disturbs me when honorable actors such as Alan Alda (and Burt Lancaster) play such roles because their status tends to provide credibility to the director's intention to uphold the theme of film, a social outcast. I was in high school during the last years of Caryl Chessman's life and his report on the death penalty and the books were very interesting in the news. I remember the opinion that the death penalty was wrong and Chessman was a victim. <br /> <br /> Get people's grip. Read history. Chessman was a criminal and sexual predator. At night he rode the streets of LA with stolen police lights in his vehicle. He stopped the cars with attractive women inside, under the auspices of the arrest; then they kidnapped and raped women. Rape is the worst trauma a woman can experience, and many victims say she would rather die of horror and humiliation. The chess player got exactly what he deserved, it only took ten years. No sympathy for the devil here.
