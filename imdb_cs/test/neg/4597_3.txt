After Matt Dillon's phenomenal performance at CRASH, most of them are likely to dive to pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Dillon is real or just lucky with a great script. The fact that Factotum certainly has his moments, but the simplicity ... everything is most likely to change the audience. But nothing should be taken from Dillon. His performance is amazing and full of excellent humor, proving that he is a solid actor with strong chops; It's just a shame about direction and script. The story is about Henry "Hank" Chinaski (Dillon) and his refusal to comply with something similar to normal. He leaves or is thrown out of work in just a few minutes, just to find himself in a bleak pub where he also encountered more frightening women while trying to write a non-conformist novel. We never know what a novel is about, except that it is "everything" (cancer, movies, you, me). Jumping from the workplace to the workplace and constantly returning to John (Lili Taylor, THE HAUNTING), a defeated friend who is as embarrassed as he is, Hank tries in vain to find out what his life should hold. Whatever it may be to interpret. Some may say that they will never do so, while others might argue that his life is simply a path to darkness. Regardless of the fact that Factotum has nothing to do with the subtle performance of Matt Dillon. The story goes through Hank's life without thinking where to go. And that's a shame. Dillon's performance would shine even brighter if she gave him a decent script.
