It was terrible and simple. What was their message? Where's the movie? It has all the sub-B film components. From the barren story to the bad effect on the cheese slow film. I used to watch a movie I've seen like Goodfellas, Bronx Tale, even Grease. There are no sympathetic characters. Finally, you want everyone to die. Save 2 hours of your life and skip this one.
