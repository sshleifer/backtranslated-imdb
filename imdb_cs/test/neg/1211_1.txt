I wrote a spoiler, but there's not much that could be spoiled. It's like spoiling spoiled meat. This movie is probably the worst I've ever seen. Not because of actors or special effects, but because of the sheer number of errors, both factual and physical. MIGs are not at all MIGs. They are Mirages and they are French. And how the hell can Doug's dad endure the maneuvers his son does to avoid "MIG" without a g-suit? And why would Chappy try to board a plane without a g-suit? And how could Doug beat an enemy pilot ace with such ease? I didn't like this movie. And the worst part is that it has 3 sequels, the last of 1995. Now it's scary.
