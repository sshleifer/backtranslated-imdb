Sheba Shayne (Pam Grier) receives a telegram telling her that her father may have trouble. Sheba, a private investigator and former cop, goes to her father's help. But someone does not stop at nothing to get his father out of work. Try to show that their muscles are happening and Sheb's father is shot dead by cold blood. These guys went wrong with a bad woman. <br /> <br /> If I had to describe Sheba Baby, the best I could lose is Pam Grier Lite with some really bad acting. Sheba Baby is incredibly tame for Pam Grier. She is nowhere as violent as some of her earlier films. Gone are over-the-top pictures of Pam placing a small revolver or razor blade in her afro. The pilot (D'Urville Martin) and his crew can't hold the candle at some real Pam villains they face in their previous movies. It's strictly to-the-numbers and almost has a made-for-tv feel. As far as bad behavior is concerned, the baddies Pam faces are just as unnatural sounding in their delivery as I have seen. As a result, characters like Pilot do not face as terribly as they should or need to make the film work. This does not mean that there are no moments or elements in Sheba Baby that I did not like (Pam in a neoprene suit and Pam, who speared a spear), that's just that compared to the rest of Pam is a movie like Coffy, Foxy Brown, and even Friday Foster that the movie fails. One final observation - maybe I'm just more sensitive to these things post-9/11, but I don't even remember the time, even in the security laxes of the 1970s, when you can take a suitcase full of weapons on a plane. When Sheba flies to his father's help, he has a packed arsenal in his luggage!
