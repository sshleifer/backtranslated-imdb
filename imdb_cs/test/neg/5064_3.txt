I have to admit that I chose this film only for casting, and while Sutherland, Scacchi and Prochnow were - as usual - great artists, the rest of the film was such a decline. He feels as if he is assembled by a team of adolescents with low-level scripts, which means that scripts lack any depth, scary photos and cuts, and a merry miserable score! I can't believe I was able to watch this seemingly long movie to the end ... sad is that it could be a really big political thriller that gave an interesting plot. All the potential was there to be a hit; that is, the two main components are there: a great story of national conspiracies, and a great core cast (though many other actors are largely soap opera quality). But maybe I'm missing something; in the meantime, in my opinion, it is not worth more than 3.
