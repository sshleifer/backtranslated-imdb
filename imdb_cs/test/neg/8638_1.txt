The film begins with a protagonist who explains some of the crimes that occur throughout the city, and then we know that the hero is a cop who is either suspended or probably retired. I did not have the patience or interest in verifying the above before commenting. If there is a stereotype for the narrator to have a deep sleep-inducing voice, it's high time to end it. I really fell asleep and didn't even bother to turn off the movie. I'm still trying to figure out what the movie is about and why there was no outdoor shooting. The third TV series will have a larger number of sets compared to this movie and I still regret the actors and producers involved in this huge movie. It was supposed to be made as a normal TV series or maybe as a local theater drama instead of on a big screen. Total loss of time and money. The movie was supposed to be in production for a long time and it would be better to leave it that way. With redundant dialogs and sleep-inducing sets, it's the worst movie I've ever seen.
