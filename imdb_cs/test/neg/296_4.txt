I've heard a lot of this new bird flu that has killed dozens of people in Southeast Asia over the past three years. It seems to be the end of a time when it mutates into something very contagious, and millions of people will be destroyed in a global pandemic. I just thought I'd mention it if you don't have a wheel to write your will. I would also think I would mention it because I watched something tonight called CARRIERS. t o naval warfare, but the scene opens up that is a cross between OUTBREAK and the episode THE X FILES I've seen many years ago. I thought I'd watch something with added resonance after I heard the dangers posed by bird flu, but after the relentless opening of CARRIERS descends into cheap and cheerful TVM and like any other TVM, you'll see that the main characters are women one of them is a figure of authority, while the other leading woman is the mother of small children. It goes without saying that it is also a sick child subplot too <br /> <br /> What is irritating to the TVM format is that it overwhelms the potential of what could be a pretty good movie if it was made for a cinema. There is quite a cruel scene of someone coughing blood all over her sister's face and a very formidable jay walker getting run down stunts, but these pieces are quickly forgotten as the mood descends into family sentiment because it - And almost every other TVM ever made - was made for an essentially female audience
