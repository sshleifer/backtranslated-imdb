This movie has a lot of actions and hearts. Forget a moment that almost every aspect of the Russian Revolution gets bad - after all, we have only less than an hour to tell our story. In fact czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and the interim government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story. Here we have a revolution that "in the Russian newspapers" said in what seems to be a still functioning country until sudden violence and the life of nobleman Baron Nikita Nikki 'Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) help . They strike from home with their former Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll), a service girl, and start a new life in Constantinople. Before the Revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a game for a girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a distraction of the species. The revolution won't change, and he continues to try to use what seems to be a very simple girl. It certainly does not mean that the audience, like this guy, sees him to play with her. Tanyusha follows Baron because he literally has nowhere to go for the revolutionaries who will take over the Baron's home, and have no other life than wait for Nikki's hand and leg. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly takes on life as a moneyless laborer and that is when she meets her former lover, the Russian nobleman VÄ›ra Zimina, who has a plan to get them to Paris, where the Tsaras gathered after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan doesn't include her. <br /> <br /> This film manages to waste a lot of the great game talent of actress Nancy Carroll. He's doing a good job of having little, but it's not much. Lilyan Tashman is a standout, though she has little role as a Russian vampa Vera. Lilyan has been so often referred to as supportive roles as he is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous look make her the center of attention in every scene she appears in. Guy Kibbee even appears in a humorous piece as an American tourist who is curious about Russian royalties that have been forcibly thrown out of the country.
