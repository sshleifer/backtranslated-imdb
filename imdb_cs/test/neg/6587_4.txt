That day I borrowed it on a DVD from a friend. I didn't know what to expect. I haven't seen many Russian movies and I don't think I've ever seen a Russian war movie. Maybe it made me expect something else, something more in line with the idea of ​​Russian mentality. But no matter what she was expecting, they were a shame because it was a fairly common war movie. The whole wording of following several young people from their recruitment, training, deployment and through some is known. We've seen it many years ago and recently (like Jarhead). Sure, here's the difference because the movie is about Russian soldiers instead of Americans, as it is almost always. But in general it could be as easy as a Vietnamese movie. I think that is what underlines my feeling that Afghanistan was the Soviet Union of Vietnam. The country that was supposed to be a pushover for the superpowers caused the war to go on for years with terrible loss of life for both soldiers and civilians. Good points in this movie I felt were good photos (here are some beautiful shots of the atmosphere) and good effects on what I think must be a rather low budget movie. What disappoints me is the story itself. I just can't distract any emotions. Mostly because character development is lousy. And to really feel something when people are shot, you have to make them people, not just anonymous cardboard cutouts. They can't do it in this movie. It is also too long and it seems to be a certain trend recently. In my opinion, a film that is longer than two hours must have something to offer. There is also a disturbing music that is like any wet blanket. Especially in action scenes, it's very distracting, not that you need action music, but something more than a slow keyboard music would be nice. Otherwise the production values ​​were good enough, that was not a problem. <br /> <br /> I don't know how to view this movie. As a reminder of the fact that no matter where you are, war sucks? That Russian filmmakers have been watching too many American war movies to create something? Regardless, this film is rather cliché, lacking in spirit and at the same time has acceptable technical qualities, lacks script and character development. Eventually, it becomes another of all the war films that you can't think of. I saw much worse, but also much better. I rate it 4/10.
