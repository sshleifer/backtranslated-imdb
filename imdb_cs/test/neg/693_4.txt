Wrestlemania 2 is the only Wrestlemania | it will be held in three different places, and although it was an interesting idea, it actually didn't work. There are only two matches that really ended, the rest was decent, or most of them were pretty bad. There are some fun celebrities on the side like Susan Saint James, Ray Charles and Cathy Crosby, but the experience was a waste of time for the most part. The British bulldgos Vs The Dream Team is worth the admission, but you can honestly see it anywhere. <br /> <br /> Matches. Nassau Coliseum. Paul Orndorff Vs The Magnificent Muraco / W Mr. Throughout the time he had, and despite the miserable conclusion, it was surprisingly bearable and the crowd really got into it. The crowd sings "Bullsh * t" at the end. It is said that she did nothing for any career. The match ends in a double countdown when they fight off the ring. <br/> <br/> 2/5 <br /> <br /> Intercontinental Championships. Randy Savage | C | Vs George "Animal" Steele. Not such a great match that is wise but strongly entertaining to the antiquities involved, and some great Steele comedy, besides savages, can fight potato and make it interesting. Savage wins when he puts his feet on the ropes for leverage. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Jake "The Snake" Roberts Vs George Wells. It was better than it should be for a match, but it's too short for it to be at all. Roberts wins with DDT, pulls out a snake afterwords that disgusts Saint James. <br /> <br /> 1 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Boxing Match. Mr.T / W The Hati Kid & Joe Frazier Vs Roddy Piper / W Lou Duva & Bob Orton. Huge failure in my opinion. During that time, I was bored nonsensically, and although it may have been a marketing success, I certainly didn't enjoy it. A lot of cheerful singing is evident. T Wins DQ When Piper Blows T. Rosemont Horizon <br /> <br /> Women Title Match. Wonderful Moolah | C | Vs Velvet McIntyre. It ends up too fast before it gets a chance to start, making a record for the fast falling pins when it comes to female matches. Moolah wins when he uses the missed splash Velveta from the top rope <br /> <br /> 0/5 <br /> <br /> Corporal Kirchner Vs Nikolai Volkoff / W Classy Freddie Blassie. Big pop for corporal. Stupid match, with a boring offense from both, being too short to be important. Corporal wins when he deals with Volkoff with Blassie's wand. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Battle Royal. William Perry and Andre get the biggest pop. This is pretty fun stuff, despite all the NFL talent involved. It is also notable for Bret Hart's first ever Wrestlemania look. Andre wins by throwing The Hart Foundation out. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Team Title Tags. British Bulldogs / W Lou Albano and Ozzy Osbourne Vs The Dream Team / W Johnny Valiant | Absolutely great match, which is one of the best wrestlemania matches of all time. You won't have time to catch your breath, with all the maneuvers at hand and excellent psychology in the ring. This is a pure match, it's the best, you can't call yourself a fan of matches unless you like this match. Bulldogs win when Dynamite Kid knocks off Valentine with Ricky Steamboat Vs Hercules Hernandez. Quite a decent match here, both men on solid performances. Hercules is ugly rough, with above-average skills, and this contrasts with the high-performance Steamboat style. Steamboat wins with high-flying cross body off top rope. <br /> <br /> 2 1/2 / 5 <br /> <br /> Adrian Adonis Vs Uncle Elmer. Terrible struggle, with an unpleasant comedy. Fans love Uncle Elmer, but I don't. Adonis won with a top rope maneuver. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Funk Brothers V Tito Santana & JYD. Pretty solid match here, with many unforgettable bumps taken from Terry Funk | the one over the table was different for that time. I'd have to rate it as my second favorite. Funks win with the help of Jimmy Hart's megaphone. <br /> <br /> 3/5 <br /> <br /> WWF Championship. Hulk Hogan | C | Vs King Kong Jackets. A decent pop for Hogan. One of the most exaggerated matches in the history of Wrestlemania. Hogan can't wrestle for licking and Bundy isn't so big alone. Violence was brutal at the time, but Hogan's superheroes are a bit uncomfortable and there are too many boring moments. Hogan wins when he escapes from Jackets. <br /> <br /> 1/5 <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Wrestlemania 2 is a failure in most aspects. Die hard wrestling fans should see it once, but you really don't have it either. There's not enough to satisfy a real fan. Vince fired it. Don't be fooled by the hype of the main event, it's really a boring business like most cards. Not recommended and ranked among the worst of Wrestlemania's, beyond the great brand match. <br/> <br/> 4/10
