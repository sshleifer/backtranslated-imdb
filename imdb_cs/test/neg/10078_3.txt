It is clear that they wanted to have a character-driven story for this film. But immediately the story will cause you not to like the new main characters. Fly over the island and dinosaurs below missed any impact and almost look like a cartoon. All action entry to the island is only rehash parts from JP 1 and 2. The story is predictable up to the point of anger and it's a totally unsatisfactory ending that let me cheat. That gave me no choice but to grant film 3/10!
