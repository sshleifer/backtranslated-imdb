Wow, I haven't seen the movie so bad since "Fire Down". Wait, that's Seagal's movie. Like "On Deadly Ground" and "Fire Down Below," Seagal focuses the film around its environmental awareness report and how the Army, FBI and CIA are incompetent idiots. The problem is that both the reality and the sensible plot are secondary, whether social comment gobbleygook Seagal is trying to overcome.
