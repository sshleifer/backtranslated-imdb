They took the story of the dear people of Edinburgh's heart, a real story and changed it as Hollywood did earlier to many stories. The end result is a film that is well done for those who do not know the story but quite different and inaccurate. The original film of this story, which Walt Disney himself oversaw, used the right breed of dog that is critical to this story, and did not make John Gray anything special that he was a poor Shepard who died in poverty at the inn. If you like the story, watch the original Disney for a better story with a warm heart. It is a shame cast and the potential there has been for an amazing remake of the classic story. Read the book for the exact story. And if you like it, you can visit the real Kirkyard in Edinburgh.
