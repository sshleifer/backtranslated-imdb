I attended the screening of this film. It was forged with clichés and very indecent jokes and settings. I think other comments were people who had to work on the film or were family members of the cast. I am amazed that this film costs $ 3 - $ 4 million without any real stars. Where did the budget go? Apparently it didn't go to transcription writers. Nice idea of ​​the bank for the success of the Big Fat Greek wedding, but the main lady. The main characters were small or some spark, and the inciting incident was, at best, somewhat feeble. The direction was uninspired and looked like a student film. I don't even know what it means that everyone wants Italian. That's a real saying. I never heard it.
