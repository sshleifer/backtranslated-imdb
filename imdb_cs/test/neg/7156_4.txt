I really hoped for the best with this, but it just didn't happen. Funded in a very non-Dutch way and still look great, with style and pace that is very similar to Hollywood. What I do not understand is how - with all the great benefits - to the director, the writer, the producer has yet managed to make this film a horrible picture he was watching. Filled with bad jokes, cheap nudity and actors who just can't speak English in English. Kudo's for pulling him, but what the guy thought!
