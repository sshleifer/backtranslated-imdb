The Big Knife, a film about the dark side of the film industry in Hollywood, is ironically much more like a movie game than the movie itself. In addition to several very short exposure scenes, all the action takes place in the living room of the hero of the movie, played by Jack Palance. He is a film actor who wants to leave his contract with his studio because he has no qualities in the films they publish. Again, the woman (Ida Lupino) is also cold in the studio, not to mention her husband's travels. Unfortunately for them both, the studio head (Rod Steiger) is a real bastard. She has blackmail that is forcing an increasingly tortured actor to sign a new contract. But it's just a matter of time before she pushes the man too hard. This movie is not, I repeat NOT, film noir. Rather, it is an extraordinarily theatrical melodrama in the living room. The plot goes at a snail's pace and is so complicated and confusing that it is in violent disharmony with static settings and carefully crafted blocking of real scenes. The action is ultimately overworked and moves sharply between out and out of history and softer, but no less erratic, soliloquies, which are obviously intended to be annoying, but run like a puffy pluck, especially in the hands of a pitifully confused Palance . Apparently Aldrich went for a stylized "something", but I doubt he knew what it was, and he would never do that to the audience. I think the main lesson is that movies and games are very different media. What could have been playing in the game was neither a long distance nor a movie. Result? Big waste of time. There is little here.
