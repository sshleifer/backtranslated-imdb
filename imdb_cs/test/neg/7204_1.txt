As you may recall, it seems to me that all three trash trilogies seem to be the first, and the first movie is the only one that can be viewed remotely. The second part was a low-level wastewater, and this installment is a little better than two, but still one smoking pile of something I removed from my backyard last Monday. The assumption makes no sense why those moonshine murdered that poor old lady, and even in 1921 I think someone will notice a lot of greasy boys, where a little old old lady once lived. Second, the scarecrow is pathetic compared to how cold they looked in the first movie. It's just old clothes and burlap. Let's face it, the show is waste and should be forgotten. NOISE!
