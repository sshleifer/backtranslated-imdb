Meek and gentle Edward G. Robinson (like Wilbert Winkle) decides to quit his job at the bank and do what he wants to open a repair shop behind the house. Mr. Robinson is married but childless; he befriended the local orphanage residence of Don Donaldson (as Barry). Young Donaldson is an eager helper and sees Robinson as his father's figure. Robinson's annoying wife Ruth Warwick (as Amy) is dissatisfied with Robinson's choice of work and plots to return the matter to her idea of ​​normality. Their lives are further disturbed when Robinson is developed. War also disrupts what might be an interesting story, because Robinson's character fights against a dominating, unsympathetic wife. Perhaps the filmmakers show how war can save marriage and redirect lives positively. Robinson and Donaldson are a nice team. Robert Mitchum has a bad part. The end of "trick" playing Mrs. Warwick and Donaldson is predictably introduced.
