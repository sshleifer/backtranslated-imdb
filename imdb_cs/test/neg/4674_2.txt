I saw this movie last night. I'm afraid I've turned into one of those left-wing liberals who enjoy having fun in South Park. Because I found it very offensive. Am I ridiculously sensitive? First, it is the old basic principle that America is the only country in the world that is physically capable of everything, sometimes. Second, and freezingly, there is an early meteor strike that hits some (untitled ?? why do they need a name?) Asian country. The response to this is to look at it as a warning. As in "my god, imagine a tragedy that could * become". Because, you know, it happened to the Asians. It could happen to white Americans and * it would be tragic. Then Paris later hits a larger meteor. Our cast on earth is irritated because it can mean our boys have less time than they thought. She is not very upset in America. No mention that many people have died. Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. Beautiful actor wasted. He had never been such a black man. Between the hard drill team, his job seems to be standing in his back, sometimes saying, "Hey, you're a man." Really. Why did they bring him? It's not as if he was petty. He never picks up the tool once, does not strain the spacecraft, or does not repair anything that blows up. Even if you ignore the Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a pointless role), who seems to be drunk most of the time and hits with the keys instead of fixing them because "Data is as we do dese dings in Russia, "it's pretty awful. <br /> <br /> Of course, all the cemented on-site blond, blue-eyed American kids all celebrate in the cornfield at salvation and everything is fine. Because all death and destruction for the rest of the world is irrelevant. You expect a bad script, lengthy action, unlikely conspiracy (fat, middle-aged men who are trained for 12 days on astronauts) Including who seems to be retarded?). But I could not believe that the racism and xenophobia contained in the film, and the reckless disrespect of the lives of someone who is not a corn American. It is a chilling accusation of the attitude of part of the Western Society in the world. And it's a lousy movie.
