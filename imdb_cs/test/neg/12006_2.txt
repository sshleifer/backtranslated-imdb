This movie was incredibly stupid with the meaning of what ever. I fell badly for all the actors and actresses who had ruined their career to be in this silly movie. the whole movie was based on how unrealistic they would have made it, so that he didn't like it a bit, which made him even more stupid. even some names were unrealistic. The movie is fun to watch, which is why it had 2 out of 10 stars. this is probably the third most stupid movie ever made. I really did after I realized that it had mostly adult actors in it even in being a baby movie. The most worrying was Danny Trejo's horror actor who is always dirty. Other actors have been largely cleaning up what concerns me.
