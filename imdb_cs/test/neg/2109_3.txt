The film begins in Mexico, where the girl was cursed, spitting on snakes for green jelly, and her boyfriend trying all these crazy spells to curse. She will do nothing but sing a terrible language that does nothing, so they decide to cross the line to get on the train to reach L.A. There's a comic merriment. This movie still has the same snakes! It has garden snakes and pythons that never bite. They all make the sound of rattlesnakes, which makes no sense. The whole movie has some funny lines, some weak effects, but the most important thing is the great ending that will leave you as WHAM BAM WHAT ARE THE NECK I HAPPEN !!! The whole movie is about 1, but the end is 10, so according to my crazy math it gets a total of 3. When a blockbuster has nothing else you want, grab it for fun!
