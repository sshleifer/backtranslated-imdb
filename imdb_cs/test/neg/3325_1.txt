This film was basically set for studio failure. One, Anne Rice (author of the book) offered to write the game on screen, but the studio was rejected. Two, trying to emulate 2 in depth novels into a two-hour film. I keep the only way these two books - Vampire Lestat and Queen of the Damned - can work in the form of live action. be through mini-series. First, Vampire Lestat itself takes place from 1700 to the 1980s and has a wealth of character that is important to understanding the main character, Lestat. The whole book Vampire Lestat prepares the events of the second part of Queen of the Damned. Without this full understanding, the image of the film is destroyed. Lestat wasn't cruel and cruel to everyone, he didn't want to go with Akash's plans, Marius didn't do Lestat, Lestat doesn't love Jesse or her, Lestat couldn't go unharmed by the light, Marius wasn't even David, every character was totally represented wrong, BASE same names different story. <br /> <br /> If they wanted to make a vampire movie, fine. Even if you want to be inspired by these novels, all right. But don't go back to the theaters from Rice's great novels and characters to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read books that you won't read to understand the movie really, if you've read the books, you'll be offended. As has been said, I am such a huge fan that I had to see a movie that knew well that it was going to be the case and I was still following it. Catch 22, he must see it, he will hate it.
