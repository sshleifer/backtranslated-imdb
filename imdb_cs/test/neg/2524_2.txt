I read online reviews to praise this obscure trip as a combination of cruel horror, quirky black comedy and border art-house; the movie has all three elements, are sure, but they are at the service of such a supremely silly premise (the title instantly puts the game away) ??? and amateur production at the start ?? that his long-term neglect due to lack of proper distribution? basically until Cult Epics picks up the DVD release 30 years after its creation! ?? there was no big loss for cinema or even genre (s). The bed was apparently designed to satisfy the demon's dispute with the woman; just like a dying man who has used four posters and even painted it, he ends up trapped in the wall behind the screen (!) and gives an intermittent commentary on "action." Several people (from runaway teenagers to gangsters who are hiding) feed on an ever-starving bed; last in the offer are three girls ??? one of them, however, remembers her mistress from the distant past, and therefore she seems to fear her bed! See different objects? from cigars to pieces of fried chicken? and people who swallow (the belly of the bed is depicted as a honey-colored liquid container) makes the film somewhat amusing in some cases (especially when the hands of a young man are reduced to their skeletal formation, which seems to be too easy in his step!) but also terribly repeating ?? So that even for a short 77 minutes, the whole nonsensical performance feels tense and downright desperate.
