Why the powers that will continue to occupy Jennifer Lopez in incredible roles? She was excellent in Selena and pretty good at Money Train, who both cast her in roles where she could be basically herself. However, a role like this just draws a line. I've never seen Lopez as an FBI agent (see Out of Sight for this unprecedented performance), but as a psychotherapist? Give me a break! Lopez plays basically the aforementioned psychotherapist who is involved in virtual reality experiments that enter the minds of his patients to help them solve their problems. When he comes into the mind of a comatose serial killer who helps to save one of his victims, he breaks all the rules to try to insane his inner mind. I can't get through this high tone of voice she has. She's not Julia Roberts, but she still appears on the screen as if she believed he's on the same field. Well, he's not in the same stadium either. Sure, he's a very sexy lady; However, it will not carry the movie, and it certainly does not wear this. With someone else who would cast this film in this role, it would be excellent, especially if it was busy with someone who could give the character more credibility. . The colors are wonderful, and the story story is not half bad in the B-movie way. The sound here is also excellent. This film gets a few points for a fairly original story, and the main points of what it looks like and sounds. Unfortunately, acting and bad casting make it a few notches. <br /> <br /> My rating: 6/10
