This movie was one of the worst I've ever seen (including anything with Paula Shore). I couldn't believe the movie could actually be THIS bad! Coolio must be the only worst actor (again without Paula Shore) to become a "star" in the film. The temptation to hit the STOP button during this movie was huge (in fact if I had THROW IN TRASH on my VCR, I'd be willing to press it). Do yourself a favor and do something more interesting than watching this movie like watching grass grow or watching golf on TV.
