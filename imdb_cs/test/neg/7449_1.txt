The first Robocop had a sense of cynical joke and a sick feeling of violence. It was a nice line, but Paul Verhoeven pulled it out and the film did so well that they continued. How horrible. (Possible spoilers ahead - though something that could spoil them is beyond me). Irvin Kershner is not the director of this type of film. He clearly misunderstood the original joke and, as a result, the massive excessive senseless violence looks really bad - and worse is very disgusting. Even worse is the music score. Leonard Rosenman was an old man from another era and heroic, light music doesn't match the images on the screen at all! What scored?! Great American Hero?! The worst of all is that he completely removed Robocop's theme from the first film, which was so unforgettable and perfect. Can you imagine the movie Superman without fanfare John Johnms, or Indiana Jones, etc.? How could he do that? !! The storyline is just a collection of ideas that are not gel. In the beginning we see Rob "chase" his old wife. All right, good idea. But it will completely drop it. Then there is this stupid idea that the company reprograms Robo so that it is nice. This is thrown for 10 minutes and then immediately dropped. Or, the stupid idea that a repulsive 10-year-old drug lord reminds Rob of his son - again a faint motive that is briefly displayed twice and dropped. This can work in comics, but not on film and Frank Miller was unfortunately too inexperienced at the time and threw every idea along with a kitchen sink. It doesn't work as a whole. It seems that some people here praise the sting in this film and the privatization of the police. This is the best part of the movie that is consistent with the first. However, in the original, the old man was a tough business man out for profit, but eventually just at the end. In this film, he is only a pure evil in his desire for money and power. You can't just change characters like that. And the character of Nancy Allen is useless in this film, while at first she was essential for Robo's quest. She is as gratuitous as the violence in this film. And violence, yes violence. I like many violent, bloody movies when they serve purposes and tell a story. Irvin Kershner appears to be on human beings who are thrown into pieces, shot to pieces, children longing for death and torture, and people's desire for drugs. He doesn't know when to stop. Do we really need to see every last innocent bystander (even people trying to help others) to be awake ???? This is derived when we see poor shooting of Robocop repeatedly! Instead, Mr. Kershner proves that he has very little taste for this type of work and creates a nasty mess that is a terrible piece of pop art and a worse, disgusting message of violence for all young people watching the film. No, this movie is not supposed to be a message, and for this reason I have definitely not followed the Robocop or Alien or Predator movies. However, when you go too far and cross the border, you need to question what you are doing. And as far as this movie is concerned, in the words of the dealer's last word, the bad guy dies, "It's still shit".
