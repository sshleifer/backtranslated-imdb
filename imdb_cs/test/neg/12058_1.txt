It's a riddle for me how this movie got to distribution. Sure, it's horrible and there is a fair share of nudity, but by God, the value of production is the lowest I have ever seen, the equipment used is worse than the standard equipment of the home, everything is overheated, giving all the amateur look , bring your idea to the worst American home video or any name that is called .. <br /> <br /> Please, it's too much to ask you to make a real effort when you expect will you waste 90 minutes of life watching people? You really should have done some short projects because it's obvious you're a bunch of amateurs! 1/10
