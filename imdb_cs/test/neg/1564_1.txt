Cultural Vandalism Is New Hallmark's Gulliver's Travels an Act of Cultural Vandalism? Not literally. After all, neither copy of the book is burned. But if this one Gulliver's people are exposed? and many people will? Those people won't get anything similar to what Jonathan Swift intended. If Jonathan Swift were alive, Hallmark could be sued for violating moral rights and losing. This is a good way to think about someone else's ideas before starting a project. Swift's masterpiece is an extraordinary vision of humanity. Through his hero, Gulliver, he travels to places where he feels great, small, breaking and? human. Little people in Lilleput are small in every way. Tiny and stupid, they fight, big and small people, endless wars of destruction, at the end of which their soft eggs open at the dinner table. It sounds a bit like us. I've forgotten most of the rest: it's been a few years since I read it. The TV show reminded me of a few things, and on the clear side it wished me to read it again. This gift to mankind ran like Gulligan under branches under vulgar yahoos, and Danson, Steenbergen, and especially two great actors, Peter O'Toole and Edward Fox, should be ashamed. Some "creative people" have got a clear idea of ​​focusing on "star:" Gulliver, played by Ted Danson, whose acting is just wrong. Gulliver portrays himself crazy. All his ways were assembled. Weeeeel. Yeeeaaah! Of course Swift created Gulliver! Of course, the countries he visited were imaginary: this is called fiction. His goal was to talk about humanity and our, often terrible, mutual relationships. The way of his imaginary character to the imaginary lands is his method. But these people treat the imagination as a disease, and anyone who has the moment that Hallmark can't turn into one of his cards is suspicious. It's so bad that O'Toole, always deep, seems so little as his lilliputian character. Of course, he has character while commenting on the character at the same time, so much if not all the great actors. Informing the character casts a light on it. Our light complements the character. This act of psychic triangulation becomes three-dimensional. Most actors do it very gently, like Hopkins in "Remains of the Day." Others, such as Nicholson, in most things over the past twenty years have been playing a large part of each other. Actually, Nicholson is playing with his two points and also with us: with him, he is the cradle of all cats and he laughs with all the strings. Great fun, just like O'Toole. But something is missing. Shouting into a megaphone (as big as ever) and all his senses are hollow shells standing underneath. It's because it is. Search for "anodyne" and the word "Hallmark" as a synonym. Harmless, bland, harmless: Hallmark is a doll who can't pee because she has no genitals: it's norm, average, person without distinction. Hallmark is a hallmark that has no hallmark. I never suspected that such people despised those who had such imagination. Suddenly, Pound's "Disney Against Meta-Physicals" stands out in bold font. Or Einstein's "genius men will always be forcibly opposed to the average minds". Indeed, anyone, to this average type, who has a different question from "a)" or "b)" is suspicious. Who is more prominent than the man who travels to the darker places of the human soul and shines with his little flashlight to illuminate what is there? That is why it is an act of vandalism. The Taliban destroyed Buddhas in Afghanistan, the Palestinians the oldest synagogue in the world in Jericho, the barbarians of the great sculpture of the classical age, and these things are obviously vandalism. Hallmark tries to protect us from foreign enemies by undermining our own culture; the one who nourishes and maintains them. And we. Please buy a copy of Gulliver's travels wherever you live and read it. Or order it online. I like to use ABE Books.
