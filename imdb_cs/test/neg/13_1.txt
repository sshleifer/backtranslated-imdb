Clear vanity press for Julie in her first film with Blake. See you. Where do we start. He is a traitor during World War II; He will buy it by falling in love; her friends (who are probably patriots because they are German citizens) are expendable and must die; and ends up being a heroine. OK. Drunk pilot and buffoon scenes who work for French intelligence cannot even be described, nor will we mention Rock's romantic scenes with a woman. (By the way, when he visits the museum, look at his view - I'll play it on the video and it's invaluable). Is it a farce or is it a romantic classic or is it a war movie? I don't know, nor do you.
