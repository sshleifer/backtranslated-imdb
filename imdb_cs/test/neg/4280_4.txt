As a passionate Disney fan, I wasn't overwhelmed by this film, and I was definitely not motivated to capture it in the theaters. However, I am so glad I caught him on DVD and watched special features. You have to look at "Moose's commentary": the whole movie can be viewed with a commentary from Rutt and Tuke, a comic relief lottery story from Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas. Two veterans of the famous comedy ensemble Second City ad-lib - in the character - for an hour and a half about a movie they like clearly. I laughed all the time. The pleasure I received from this commentary turned into a lukewarm reaction I had to the film itself. Do yourself a favor and listen to it!
