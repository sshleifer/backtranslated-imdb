I have just done watching this movie and I have to say it was a good movie, I loved some of the good ones and I loved the killer robot, but the movie had a hole in it. <br /> <br /> The name of the people in it was a bit ... attacked .. I think people should sue the creator of this movie for how it was at the end of the llama, the first half hour was good, but then it it was just dragged on and on I was happy .. it ended ... but still loved the killer robot and some of his good guy are in it. I think it was the best I ever spent because I do like a stupid b-movie like this one and come .. it's a b-movie everyone.
