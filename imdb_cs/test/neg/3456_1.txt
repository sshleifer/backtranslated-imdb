It is incredible to me that the best rendition of this amazing story remains the Walt Disney cartoon in the 1940s, but its true. Here, another clumsy attempt to sputter confusion and alienation would be spectators with admirable efficiency and at the same time successfully alienate those of us who actually read the story. Irving's original work is short at every scale and creating a feature film is a challenge. One can either fully rewrite the story of la Tim Burton which is a discussion for another time, or fall bust-old girl's line with unintended detail. The other is what he is trying to do here and, if I can say, woefully. The unimaginable and thoroughly modern new features of the character's character, such as the religious zealotry in Crane or wanderlust in the good old Bram Bones will destroy the story's intent and betray the serious lack of talent of filmmakers. By the time the glorious climax of the story approached, I was completely lost interest. It's the kind of movie you expect to see on stage in the background.
