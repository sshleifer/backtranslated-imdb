This is the kind that already hatches into a beautiful model (Mathilda May). Breaking baby with urge to kiss and kill! <br /> <br /> The movie starts with a strong start and is infected with the virus throughout the center. <br /> <br /> The weakest point is the presentation of a basic plot / story. As you should compare, Natasha Henstridge's kind got the same plot, but it adds many interesting side conspiracies and doesn't list good actions and strong clymatic ending. This explains why Patrick Stewart joins the Star Trek Next Generation business fleet; wanted to find more models in a glass cage, floating inside Halley-comets. Must see science fiction fans.
