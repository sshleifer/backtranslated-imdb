I believe that this advice will soon be filled with comments from people who are overly emotionally praising "Dear John" as a "pearl" and "rollercoaster ride" and all the other empty words that the target audience usually employs. I'm not definitely the target audience of this movie, but I also don't like the romantic dramas if they're well done, so here's my movie target. It's not good. It's not a bad movie either. But the plot of the meanders, the development stagnates where it should move forward (right around the center to be precise), and as far as the end ... almost seemed to have run out of ideas, so suddenly they said, "Hey, let's go! just shoot the last great scene, put some sentimental soundtrack in it and end it. " Even Amanda Seyfried's beauty couldn't save it. Channing Tatum also gave a good performance, but you can only do so much with the wrong script. Speaking of music, it is unbearably predictable and kitchy. From the smokey-voiced, irritatingly high-profile female folk singer schtick (certainly chosen to address most of the girls who will watch this movie) to the overused "glittering strings and piano" combos, it only annoys anyone who pays more the film as a whole, rather than its own "feelings." The film has a good start and the great conflict that puts us in the second act was promising. So he was part of the second act itself, as the story unfolded. Then the movie just dropped the ball. In addition, I would have to give spoilers. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" is not a bad movie, but it doesn't work as it should. If you want to see a truly moving movie about prolonged love waiting to be reunited, look at "Notebook", which was really excellent.
