I'm not sure who recommended me Surveillance, but I think I have an idea: one of "Fat Guys at the Movies". The person said they were amazed at how much it was and said it was one of the bloodiest movies. (I paraphrase it and just do it with memory, so forgive me when I was wrong.) Anyway, I decided to follow it. So I will take the blame for my own bad guess in watching one of the most horrible, predictable and STUPID movies I've ever seen. Strange, I doubt that I ever called the movie "stupid", but it was the first word that came to mind about a third and remained in my mind until the end. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Incredible assumption and reaction, incredibly brain-dead characters (could blame writing or actors, or I will blame both) and extremely bad behavior. Previously, I would have believed that Bill Pullman would be US president rather than an FBI agent. (Of course, there is a reason for this, and I will get to it in part.) And if you don't think of the so-called shocking "twist" in the first 5 minutes, then you have to come late to the theater or come to the room to watch him late. Don't worry, they'll tell you a "twist" every five minutes afterwards. There was some freelance serial killer (s) in the most depressed city in the county or the world. But there's more to the story! Some dumbass and corrupt cops like to blow up tires for their own amusement. Could it be more? Yeah, there's a family, maybe not, but there are four people, one boy, one girl, and an adult couple. The girl says she sees things with much less conviction than Cole sees dead people in the Sixth sense. It must be more than what I mentioned! That's what makes the movie interesting! Adding as many subplots that can be / may not be developed is the way to go! Okay, then I'll continue. We have crazy FBI agents who made me laugh. A pair of giggling males who first shocked their OD dealer but then resorted to a robbery. A cop who must behave like a comic who must always fight an angry / suspicious cop. Finally, (the poor, the poor) Michael Ironside, who has not only done his performance, has barely written it. <br /> <br /> None of these works. They are all told in different forms of presence or flashbacks, and believe me, after the first of many subheadings, you will lose all sense of care. In addition, the reaction of some of these characters is the most shocking of all. I think I mean mainly cops, but mainly a girl who lost her family and barely blinked. This stupid, stupid movie stinks. It's barely bloody as a person who recommended that it was if his exposure was limited to Goosebumps stories. And what about the title? Surveillance? Oh, I understand; this is because it was used in 1/50 subplots only for film interviews. Since it is so random, it could also be called COP CAR, BULLET or COFFEE. Stay away from this terrible mess.
