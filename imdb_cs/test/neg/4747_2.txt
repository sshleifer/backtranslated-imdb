Starting where the last AVP ended, Alien "Chest" emerges from the dead Predator on the Predator spacecraft, and causes the Predator spacecraft to fall into the modern day Gunnison Colorado, where it breeds several more aliens that begin to cause confusion. The Predator will send a lone very experienced and armed predator to "clean up the mess". Our human figures are captured in the midst of an intergalactic battle. The biggest problem with this movie is stimulation. This movie is moving too fast. The opening credits just rolled and the Predator crashes into Earth after Alien grows to full height, introduces the hunter and son's character, but before we get to their names, they're both killed, then we see Predator Home-World and Head Predator flies Away Fighting Alien Attacks, and all this happens in the first five minutes. This unnatural pace does not allow the whole film; The National Guard comes to town, but within two minutes everyone is killed without looking at one face, the pizzeria store manager gets one character development scene to be killed the next time we see him once. again, without learning his name, random hobos, cafe waitress and chef are killed again without learning their names. One moment our main characters are at home, another running around the city, another in the gun shop, another in the APC, and this random set is jumping over and over just never letting the audience settle in letting them grab straws. Another problem is setup and timeframe. The film takes place in modern day Gunnison Colorado. Every other Alien and Predator movie was shot in stunning environments such as industrial spaceships, guerrilla warfare, rainforest, extraterrestrial planets, and underground labyrinths. Now comes with AVP-R, set in a small modern American city, with "highlights", including a sports shop, car parks, pizzerias and girls. They wanted, actually, to make the film look so boring, dull and uninteresting as possible?! It's hard to perceive these monsters as scary creatures as they stand beside a shelf full of Reeboks, or hiding in the bushes outside the little girls bedroom. Continuity is a big deal with this movie. The Alien series has been set in the future, no one has ever heard of the first Alien, and the aliens have never been on Earth, but if ever they were on Earth, humanity would be destroyed. This film destroys that entire concept by being laid out in a modern day, with the average Joes seeing strangers all over the place, and by the end of the film, humanity is not destroyed, nor the suffering that could be considered minor losses. All over this concept of other movies, it sucks. Attempts to maintain continuity are made with the massive Deus Ex Machina's. The predator simply happens to wear an unlimited magical blue liquid around the bottle, which is only to dissolve all the bodies with just one drop, the army at the end of the film simply goes into too drastic measures and drops a nuclear warhead that just wipes out all the evidence of aliens Despite the fact that there have been many survivors of the incident who are witnesses, and many other bad attempts are being made to fill the impossible to cover the conspiracy holes. Also for the film "Verses", which has a relentless bias in favor of predators. For most of the movie, the lone Predator manages to kill dozens if not dozens of dozens of aliens, all at a range of mêlée while scarcely gaining a single scratch, while aliens simply get defeated by the left and the center like the pigeons, just waiting he tried to defend his self. This film should not be called "Alien vs. Predator", just as it should be "Predator Aliens Massacre". How can you have two species that struggle with tension and tension when one is shown to be extremely superior to the other? <br /> <br /> The characters in this movie are among the biggest shortcomings. Not only do they fade in comparison to the characters from previous Alien and Predator films, they are bleak, rough, and even cowering sometimes. The characters in this movie consist of not being a child, horny couples who want to get laid, a pizza delivery boy, blonde bimbo, college bullying, kids and a ruthless copy and insertion of a copy of Ripley and Newt; the worst and most cliché possible ideas for characters. Not only that, but all of the above characters are teenagers. While teenage casting is an obvious attempt to attract a younger audience, its only effect is to make the film look and look like a typical movie with a film that is typical of teenybopper, with actors who are too young to learn how to give convincing performance. , mostly with totally empty facial expressions that provide a monotonous dialogue. Not only that, but these characters do some of the most kinematically retarded things at all, such as using Predator weapons, commenting on powers when it was for hours, after silly plans to get out of town, rather than just walking out of town somewhat quickly, and just So many more idiots that the movie actually had an audience in my theater sighing out of frustration. At the end of this movie is just a horrible B movie, something that deserves a direct on DVD category. The fact that this film was a theatrical release amazes me because every part of the film is just a series of amateur works.
