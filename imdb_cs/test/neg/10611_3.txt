I have to preface this note with some input: I suppose I only have a soft spot for the original TV series of the 60s and 70s. I think the filmmakers threw it out of the way to casting: in a supposed remake, viewers would look for hip reflections, athletic Linc (Clarence Williams III), or great, with Michael Cole, and so on. Instead, we get Giovanni Ribisi as a poor little white boy who leaves as pathetic as he does in all his roles (once in the office where I worked, I am amused by creating a fake movie poster, casting various actors as office staff members) , guess who I occupied as Dorky son of President?). The Danes do OK like a new Julie, but none of the characters have much to do as the story just sits there, mired in convention. Besides, it's pretty forgotten. What was I talking about?
