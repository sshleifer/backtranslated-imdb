This film is, far and wide beyond any shadow of doubt, the only worst and most contemptuous film in the history of the universe. It's really * bad. Personally, I always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of the horrible movie and rented one that thought it would be one of them. It wasn't my great disappointment. <br /> <br /> The script comes in a way that sounds like reading lines directly from posters, the story has no meaning at all and the real movie looks like it was taken on a home camera. I couldn't even watch it. It's even worse than the "Witch Academy", which is enough power in itself. I can't even begin to understand how a director could make this film, and then he would still feel it could be. decent enough to relax. Painful, terrible, terrible.
