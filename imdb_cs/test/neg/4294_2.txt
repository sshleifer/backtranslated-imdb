"Jho je na mÄ›" is undoubtedly the most controversial film in 23 years of shorts. The reason is understandable; according to today's standards, this film can be considered racist. For this reason, he is rarely, if at all, on television on television. Let me just say that for the record the Japanese were not soldiers in the movie; they were Japanese-Americans sent to a relocation center during World War II. They were treated and shown as an evil enemy in this film. All the accounts - including the US government, which justified excuses and reparations in the 1980s - were Japanese-Americans as loyal and hardworking as all Americans during World War II. Their imprisonment at this time is a dark spot in American history. There are several Stooge laughs in this movie, but the memories of how the Americans were treated in Japan during that time are fun values. Let's not confuse loyal Japanese with their representation in this film as criminals. Loyal Japanese-Americans and the World War-Evil Empire of Japan are not synonymous. 2 out of 10.
