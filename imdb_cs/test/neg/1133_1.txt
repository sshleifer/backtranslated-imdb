I was out of town, I visited an old friend. After dinner, he spoke, he expressed some reservations to his daughter's friend. She is 15, beautiful, smart, athletic, and the young man is also of great family, nice, athletic (if not so smart). I told him he could feel normal fatherly worries; A few minutes later, however, the young man came up with a DVD of this film, which he had apparently looked after for some time to share with others. These people have a bona fide home theater set-up, with a screen of over 4 feet, and two young people preceded the view while a young swain went on to earn their virtue almost I saw enough in a few moments (and with a little bit fascination in his horror) to support all the most critical comments I've seen here while scanning. I told my friend that I wouldn't go so far as to disqualify a young suitor just because of his fondness for this opus - but it certainly seems to require his close monitoring. Some movements are so bad they're good: classic plan 9 from space; and in my opinion the amazingly scary Bruce Jenner / Village People works, "Can't stop the music." However, this one will remain firmly simply in a terrible category. Second / Third / Fourth "Bananas" - Even the Best of Them (eg Tim Conway, Don Knotts, all with Seinfeld) have a lot of trouble with the later series (or, as it is, the movie) . And they were great characters in their original situations. The character "Eddie", really at the fifth or sixth banana level in previous Griswald movies, has never added a lot to them. , In my opinion. Randy Quaid is a capable actor who has shown some good performances. His contribution to the previous "Holiday" image was at best average. Both he and the other cast members, many of whom have done a good job in the past, have done nothing for their efforts, except that they have made several-year household payments or some IRA contributions. <br /> <br /> the whole presentation --- story, show (from lead to support) can't be worse.
