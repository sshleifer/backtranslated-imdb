Does anyone remember BRAVEHEART? He played Mel Gibson, who also directed and wrote Randall Wallace. The film contains over 200 errors. Does anyone remember the GREEN BERETS? This is John Wayne Western, where the Duke rescues a homestead called Vietnam from a bunch of comics injuns. If you look at WE WOLE SOLDIERS, you can't help them, but remember these two movies. First of all, what played three times in the movie with this Scottish lament, four if you counted the final credits? I mean what is the connection between Scotland and `Nam? Maybe Wallace uses it in vain hope that because BRAVEHEART was bombarded - I could add in an unbelievable way - with a few Oscars could it be this movie? Whatever the reason, it's really a glass. Gibson plays Hal Moore as a cross between William Wallace and John Wayne, and I expected to say something like, "They never take our freedom - they will be" and it is impossible to ignore other similarities with GREEN BERETES as a subplot of a journalist who raises a weapon and it turns into a warrior, and Moore tells the reporter about the blame in the scene almost identical to the one seen in the Wayne movie <br /> <br /> When you don't remember the audience of other movies, WWS is also unable to stand on its own, it's based on The real events of 1965, but they seem to lack the integrity needed to make a story of justice, never feel like 1965 and lacks a sense of time and place probably because it was filmed in America not Asia. Hal Moore may have taken care of the French experience in Indo-China, but if it were, he was unique because the US Army was out of the way to read the French Indo-Chinese War. previous conflict Westmoreland replied that there was nothing to be learned from the French "Who did not win the war since Napoleon", so I was confused about the depiction of the NVA in this film when, in 1965, the American commander, North Americans and VC contemptuously held up arrogance. It's like a history rewritten to show that rice farmers in Vietnam are superlative fighters. They are, but very few Americans believed it in the mid-sixties. There are a few other things that confused me how women returned home telegrams that tell them their husbands are dead? No bodies are shown to fly back to base, and no one on the screen can see who would be killed in the La Drang Valley. Likewise, we don't see reinforcements coming on the screen, so how suddenly do we see NVA Americans? I put them as directorial / editing errors on Wallace's side, who doesn't hit me as much as a director, and his biggest problem is that he communicates the horror of battle. Take the scene where the American burned on the sharp is flying out screaming "Tell your wife I love her". This should have an emotional impact similar to the THAT death scene in PLATOON, but there is no impact. In fact, I found the scene clich√© and condescending, and he is not the only sign that would mouth the words "He told my wife ..." while mutilating or dying, I counted at least two other characters to use the phrase. Did the characters in the battle say that? I have no idea, but since Randall Wallace wrote the script, I have reservations <br /> <br /> I was sitting in a shocked amazement watching APOCALYPSE NOW, PLATOON and THE KILLING FIELDS made my eyes out of the water, I laughed FULL METAL JACKET, Still I was looking at my watch with DEER HUNTER and after seeing we were soldiers, I felt totally sponsored
