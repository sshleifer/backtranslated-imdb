I am a huge fan of Emily Watson (Breaking The Waves) and Tom Wilkinson (Normal) and I was amused to see them as Rupert Everett (Dellamorte Dellamore) in this shocking, somewhat small film that had all the ingredients so much. more. Too short scenes depicting the weak, infinitely legitimate, worthless son of the rich Lord are in place and entertaining. But for the love triangle, it was remarkably little chemistry to talk to anyone. The music was unpleasantly cinematic, voice and unnecessary. Obviously, the work of the director of the first time with a small budget that either lacked or did not care enough for good advice. Damage. <br /> <br /> I can appreciate how the people you hate at the beginning are the ones you love at the end, and vice versa, so there is some kind of arc character at the address of at least perception. For example, Watson's character, while refreshingly honest with her husband about her feelings for another man, began with me at the end of the horn, particularly when she announced her husband that she simply had absolutely no control over her actions, and later when she she did it. he simply stated that he would return to his marriage without asking for permission, offering no excuses. And I went from the displeasure of Wilkinson's freak / moral relativistic character to understanding and not wanting him to change (unlike his wife). This film has changed awkwardly from whodunit to "love story". "or" drama of steel magnolias "without informing me enough about this fact, so I had a scattered guess as to what might be what the next plot might be long after they were all revealed (it was the Lord who The scene where the Lord visits Wilkinson and explains how brave Watson is, the most beautiful sister a dying friend could ever ask, Florence Nightingale, incarnations, etc. She was fine until he started to sob excitedly as a child. If you ask me, he's just another crazy rich person with too much time on his hands, so he controls his hard work, provides a husband who's crazy with an unnecessary drama. the dying boy was an added bonus for her, because in some way her previous actions were totally reproachable. <br /> <br /> Look j, everyone would be better if Wilkinson had just left her for her secretary, who seemed to appreciate him for who he was. Instead, he acted like a battered dog, his open desire for his wife's affection increased with every kick he gave him. I'm not an anti PC or anything, it just wasn't true, even though we took into account all the harsh facts of middle age, we all tend to face it. The end for me was (and not the director's intention, I'm sure) depressing. The film has spent the last 80 minutes and convinced me that these two people just don't belong together, so I wasn't happy about the promise that their relationship was continuing. I'm not in the mood to manipulate my emotions with a story, it just has to be somewhat credible and awkward. Is it too much? <br /> <br /> My score: 4/10
