I think the South Park is cheerful, and I have no problem with people shooting with them on the left, but think that after you take the whole movie to attack celebrities for risking their careers come for an illegal war, and then being together with GASP would make sense to start giving w. and bastards who destroyed the country. Bush looks like he gets a pretty free run out of these guys for so stupid and messed up as he is. Gore is a fair game, but please do what Republicans have to do, how badly they have to f ^ & k to the country before these guys finally act as if they're just trying to do their best they can, And that they have done some real screwing ... or maybe go after a hurry limbaugh ... hes a good goal ... or even just kidding off Condoleeza rice's gap teeth.
