After seeing this movie, I felt bad about my stomach and if I saw one more minute I would have to hurry to the bathroom and vomit until dawn. A sick film that wasn't funny and had no money, no money at all. If anyone wants to see this movie, no! Your children will never forgive you and claim a week's illness. So if you value your child's education and want to stimulate your child's mind, you won't see this film. Please, no!
