Frankly, Mr. Thalluri ... if you make a dramatic movie in a high school environment that follows a lot of teenagers during the school day, and if you break the time frame and jump back and forth ... if you do it, you can't use exactly the same visual narration of the "Elephant" device, which is through a camera that passes from one character to another and has scenes displayed 3 times from different angles. You just can't do this because it's such a dull burst that it's hard to believe that someone has given more than 5 ratings. Where "Elephant" (which was released 3 years before this film) uses shooting schools (or be exact Columbine shooting) as a focal point for his screenplay 2:37 uses teenage suicide and see reviews of shock value worked on this subject. His same slow storytelling, a lot of dramatic piano music that leads to the finale you know from the beginning. At least the characters seem to be trying to be a little different in this department. So you have an atypical homosexual who looks like a stoner / skater, a hunky boy-boy who can't deal with his homosexual side, brother and sister from a wealthy family who both have their own problems and here comes their nose. dive. You'll also get a spoiled bulimic cub and one of the most ridiculous characters of all time ... a guy with a medical condition that strains his pants because of the "2 urethra" syndrome that has never really heard of the invention. diapers, but rather briefs his pants in class and then turns into new clothes and makes EVERY DAY! WOW, as hard as this movie tries to be realistic, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. He is defeated in the toilet and is obviously ashamed of it, but not rubs the blood of his nose as he walks through the whole school with wet trousers and a bleeding nose. This is a new realism that directly leads to a "twist" and a final character that turns out to be a suicide victim ... After watching a "very realistic" life of teenagers (one day including incest) - translation, teenage pregnancy, bulimia, parental pressure on the degrees and appearance and homosexual theme mentioned earlier, something like your "very realistic" daily soap ... trying to be) looking at the girl we met once at the beginning of this movie and who doesn't no reason, but the guy who was supposed to crush the room when she talked to him (in a well thought out piano sequence of BTW, saw it somewhere before ??). And it is even better ... before she tears her wrists on the painful long scene "Yes" and "No", she asks a 2-ureth guy to see if she's fine, she smiles constantly, and then cuts her wrist with scissors at the school restroom . Now you have a movie that is a total elephant ripple, fails with some really sloppy storytelling (the whole thing of rape-incest was, by the way, too incredible) and people call it shock. <br /> <br /> What the hell is going on? Is all that is needed to make some pseudo-dramatic music, boring storytelling and adding a shock theme to the top and people think that there's a major deep message? I think the Elephant is already overrated, but the film was original, while here it is clear that many other levels are failing. I've never seen more insolent theft of a movie concept ... and believe me I've been watching a hundred horror movies, so I know how low you can go. It is a total decline in all departments ... its neither realistic, alienated, its damned slow, and by all means I wonder what is more useless ... another romantic suicide (many give it to this movie that interests me if they're just watching Romeo + Juliet all day because there are dozens of movies that deal with the topic in a clear non-romantic and more REALISTIC way) or this ridiculous set ... Come on! I'm still trying to figure out if a 2-uretra-guy or suicide is more unrealistic and ridiculous in itself.
