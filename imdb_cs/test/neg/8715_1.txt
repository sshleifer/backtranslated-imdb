It's amazing that some people considered it art. We saw it as badly filmed (shaking hand-held camera and everything), (in general) badly acting, spotless mess that looked more like a high school film project with kids experimenting in black and white movies. The poetry injection mound does not create an artistic film instead of a story. When we watched it in the theater, people began to have giggles (including us) of the infinite stupidity of this confident, meandering mess. And believe me, it seems endless. If we finished our candy and popcorn, we would also leave the theater with two dozen other people who packed up and went looking for something more interesting!
