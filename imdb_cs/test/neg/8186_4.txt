If Jacqueline McKenzie and John Lynch weren't such talented actors, this movie would be worse than it really is. The story of two mentally disabled people who fall in love and have a child is interesting and worth exploring. On the negative side, the plot becomes increasingly worse as the story progresses, and musical choices are increasingly bizarre, so I finally laughed when I knew the director wanted to cry.
