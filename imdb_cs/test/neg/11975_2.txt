Normally I love to find old (and some not so old) Westerns I haven't seen to be fun for the evening. It is such a great way to sit down, relax and escape politics and world issues for hours. However, this was not the case with this version of the Magnificent Seven. Casting and the story of this series closely follow the Hollywood formula for politically correct entertainment; old good get-your-mind-right, revisionist history, where "bad guys" must be all white, male, Confederate (in this case) and preferably Christian (if it can be somehow incorporated into the script). It's really sad. The best films are there and they are always talking about a good story on the big screen - not passing on one's political ideology.
