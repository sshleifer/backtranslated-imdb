It all looked quite promising. The upcoming Presidential Adviser is conceived for a series of murders because he is condemned to have a plot in the White House. He plays outstanding Donald Sutherland among several capable actors. Very few people have a good say about it. The whole thing really needed some depth. You can imagine the president being too left-wing with his ideas, and some inside the government want him dead to stop these thoughts. It seems that Conrad simply wants the country to be managed in its own way, not on the path of an elected leader. However, the action scenes had several logical holes - the aforementioned sewers and elevators and the somewhat unhappy assassination method - and Linda Hamilton's character is completely uninspired. Her "abuse of her president" was ridiculous - that would make the president about 10 when it happened. Even worse was her predictable final scene with the bishop. They could have made a challenging, resourceful political thriller, but either bottled or failed. They could go to the city for special effects, but the good ones were wasted. In general, they could achieve much more. It barely cost Â£ 1, it cost me.
