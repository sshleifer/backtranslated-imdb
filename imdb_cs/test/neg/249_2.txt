I am a big fan of bad horrors, cheap horrors, b movies, and all those 100 movies, and I don't deny that they are the worst things that have ever hit the big screen or even your home video. Some of them, for example, the infamous Manos Hands of Destiny are really bad and to watch them, especially on their own, without friends and beer, is torture for the good taste of cinema. La Momia Azteca Contra El Roboto Humano, however, was not so bad. Well, of course it's BAD - it's stupid, dated, crazy, cheap, etc., There's an Aztec mom, a tin robot, a fat masked villain, a mad scientist, Mexican mafia, etc., Assembly is bad, line, Well, Let's say the lines are not theatrical, FX and SFX are the best Mexican low-budget production could offer, etc., and so on. it's so bad that you laugh cheerfully for an hour. It certainly depends on the sense of humor, but I'm sure La Momia should teach every newcomer to this kind of movie how to enjoy it. Please note: the film takes about an hour and I think it's enough time that one can easily spend. There's one other thing - La Momia observation can give you an idea of ​​what the whole SF / Horror genre is in the 1950s, when you compare it to the current Matrix cinematography era. I think it also shows how the industry and the audience have evolved, since watches like La Momia still attract the whole house in theaters for some special shows (movies are so fine) and they often get ovations. .
