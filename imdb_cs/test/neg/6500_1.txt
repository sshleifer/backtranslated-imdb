If you plan to plan your program for a film festival, don't be fooled by what it says in the brochure. This is a complete waste of time and energy. I saw Bunuel, I saw Dali and admired them. but this is not surrealism, it should not be BE at all. Did they not think about the reputation of the human race when they watched it? After extinction by global warming, it will be the remnants of our civilization. What if the aliens taste it as an example of our intellectual capital? With all due respect for the efforts made in this regard, it would be good to end all copies of this film - or whatever it is.
