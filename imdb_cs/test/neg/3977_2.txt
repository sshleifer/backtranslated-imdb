I've never seen this movie myself, but like many others who have already commented, I've seen it as an MST3K episode. A truly terrible television broadcast of the 1970s. But someone saw their potential because it turned into a $ 125 million flop called The Island. And to the person who asked if there were any good films in the 1970s, I want to remind her that it was the golden age of American film with directors Robert Altman and Martin Scorces who first appeared in their own creation. Not to mention the little things like Star Wars (1977). Only the reminder that the 1970s was much more creative than the 21st century has been yet.
