My Take: Another lame PG-13 horror movie with a predictable spooky tactic and derived chart. Ghosts are moving. The walls creaked. There's something wrong in the basement. These, along with several other horror cliches, haunts the walls of yet another house in the country at Sam Raimi-produced by MESSENGERS, a lame pastiche of the most predictable frightened tactics thrown on a plot wildly recycled from better (and sometimes worse) horror movies from the past. When Solomon's family moves to an old farmhouse in South Dakota, in another father's attempt (Dylan McDermott) to reunite with his family, especially his former drunkard. Jessica's daughter (underestimated by Kristen Stewart) in a softer landscape than home in Chicago. Horror follows when Jessica begins to receive small surprise visits from the house of poltergeists. When she thinks he's a teenage girl who cried a wolf, her parents don't trust her. How could they? The real horror in MESSENGERS is waiting for the next horror movie. Will it be an angry flock of crows who want more than family crops (a direct burst of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece THE BIRDS)? Will it be a haunted house with a history dated from AMITYVILLE HORROR or POLTERGEIST? Or will they be grotesque ghosts based on your famous recent horrors like RING and GRUDGE? Hell, the movie even manages a rip-off scene or two of some really bad horror movies like AMITYVILLE 3-D and the average COLD CREEK MANOR. Maybe all the Pang Brothers really wanted to make a B-level horror movie, but had to be so bad? Couldn't they break away from the best? Avoid it. <br /> <br /> Rating: * of 5.
