"Love and Human Remains" is one of those obviously written, manifestly acted, apparently staged flares that are so obvious that escape speed from its controversy and production is behind me. It is not worth the explanation, this amateur film tries to stuff every clever line, every misanthropic subtext, every special sexual predilection into a single film with no interest in making the pieces fit. In short, the sensational crap without feeling ... that leaves a lot of crap to a great extent.
