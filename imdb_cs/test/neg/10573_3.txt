I thought it would be fun. I did. I do not know what happened. But I think a lot of the problem unfortunately falls with the casting. I don't know who the boy is, he could be a very nice person, but it wasn't right for this movie. The support cast was great, making it clearer. For example, there would be a scene with him and his love interest, and your mind is just beginning to wander, but then Keith David starts talking, or Leslie Nielsen, or Marion Ross, and it's like somebody lights up and you can pay attention again and you you think it may not be that bad. But when they return to the main characters, the lights go out again. Spoofing material available in the superhero genre is rich, so the fact that most jokes were basically fart is wondering who wrote this thing. I mean a few funny pieces, as I remember laughing a few times, but now I don't remember why and that was just a few days ago. <br /> <br /> I really give it or leave it rating, but I think most people should just leave it.
