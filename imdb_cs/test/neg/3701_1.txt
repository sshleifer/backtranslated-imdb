I know a lot of people like this show, and I apologize to people who think this show is amazing, but it's the worst show ever made. Sure, I'm sure I'd be a big fan of the show if Jeremy Clarkson wasn't there. I think I think testing cars and doing things like seeing a car can beat a plane is amazing! But Jeremy Clarkson is just pathetic. Here are the reasons why I hate this man :. They think it's super to speed up a camera speed that measures your average speed by measuring your distance and driving time 200 mph along the road and then resting for two hours. . He clearly thinks he's better than Richard Hammond and James May. . He has my best friend who says he's pathetic. . He screams at children just because he took a picture of him. I'm sorry for the top gear, but Jeremy Clarkson is crazy.
