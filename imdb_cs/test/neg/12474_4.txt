One of the first things I noticed that allowed this culture to stand out among others was during the wake of Sole. The aerial image is used to show Sole being a flowered kiss at the women's sea. I believed it was a comment on the closeness that women had for themselves from this culture? Those who have stuck together for generations, separations and misunderstandings, and are still able to connect and rely on each other. The film also seemed to celebrate women as almost flawless individuals. What I mean flawlessly is that they did not suffer the consequences for their actions and were treated as if they had no imperfections. An example of this is shortly after Paul accidentally killed her father. Her mother immediately comes to her rescue and takes full responsibility for the act, while Paula seems to suffer almost no remorse for what she did. Another example is that each daughter (or granddaughter) had the opportunity to meet her supposed "dead" mother (grandmother). Knowing that it has most likely caused them in their family, each of them still hugs her mother without taking care of what she did? That is, killing your husband and his lover. In this light, women are portrayed as those who love each other not only independently of characters but also those that do not seem to be bothered by the least acts in which their friends / family members act. Another thought I thought interesting for this culture was with regard to their idea of ​​supernatural. With the death of Raimunda and Solo's mother and an inexplicable return, the director creates the emotions of the audience to believe that this film embodies supernaturalism. People in this culture seem to be very supernatural, ie very eager to believe that life exists outside the grave. Their aunt, a longtime friend of Augustine, a prostitute and other people living in La Mancha, believes that rumors of the dead are returning to family members to complete the "unfinished business". I believed that this was a mixed reflection of the religious belief of culture (predominantly Catholic), as well as their need to remedy those who have no chance of being forgiven during mortality. The belief they had in connection with the dead "living" was also to give hope for the unfortunate circumstances they had suffered in mortality. When the viewer is exposed to the fact that this film is not supernatural at all, it is interesting to watch the role that the mother continues to play. It is treated as if it is still a ghost (ie hiding in small slots (under the bed or inside the trunk of a car)). I believe the director portrayed her mother in such a way as to increase the already existing supernatural beliefs that the city has received. The mother's figure seemed to be a metaphor for the city's long-term faith in life after death.
