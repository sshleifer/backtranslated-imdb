"Kicked in the Head" is about the character of Corrigan, twenty something on the way to finding himself, and his involvement with a handful of quirky characters. This thin and ambiguous story written by Corrigan has a make-it-up-as-you-go feeling and a scenario that smells like an uninspired low budget India. Despite this and some annoying Hindenburg scenarios, the film is out of rhythm, an unpredictable kind of spell that can somehow appeal to people with a similar sense of humor. Not for everyone, not for most, but maybe fun for someone. (D +)
