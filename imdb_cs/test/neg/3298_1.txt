What is Fox's fascination with dysfunctional families, made up of average, unpleasant, spoiled children and parents who are determined to be cool, unlike parenting? I'm sorry, but I don't get it. One episode I could barely follow was about one of the kids who demanded a bar mitzvah, with the intention of getting thousands of dollars in gift money. Of course, an idiotic mother decides that her precious little junior must have the biggest and bes-test party of all, and she has no problem dropping 20,000 to a big event. Ditzy, a dead boy, a crazy teen boy throws himself back and forth between wanting to be Jewish and then Catholic when he sees "cute" religious teachers. The only boundary "heartfelt" moment in the whole episode was when the father's putz, who was convinced all the time that Bar Mitzvah was merely a money-making program, saw a son studying his Hebrew lessons, The moment is deceived when he thinks his pleasure descendants be honest about the right to pass to the team. This warm, fuzzy feeling is instantly torn from the chest when it informs the younger that because there is no bris yet, a "procedure" has to be done. The Mitzvah Bar is called, and the mother is out several thousand dollars when the child refuses to comply. <br /> <br /> This show is a waste, and I'm sad that I will never get back 23 minutes of my life I watched this piece of crap unnecessarily because there was nothing else on TV ...
