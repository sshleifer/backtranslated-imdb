This movie started really tense when a poor young boy is ready for a pack of wild dogs. After a tense pursuit, Grandpa with a magical whip saved them. Then we're introduced into a chain of unpleasant friends from home, including one cake that is always half-dressed. During this phase, the film increases the tension with the strange "plinky plinky" background sounds that make me at the edge of my seat. I stopped paying attention for a while, but when I looked back at the screen, where the strange creature type things about grunting and killing. One word if you are ever trapped in your house by some nutter - get cardboard boxes and tray. Although we skipped half of the film because it was totally uninteresting or unforgettable, we are now in a stunning conclusion, the last surviving creature is battling with the Whip Whore with Grandpa and his magic whip. I'm not going to tell you what's going on here, but I can say that the whip battle is full of tension, with air combat, split-level combat and all kinds of drama. <br /> <br /> Now I'm going to move this neighbor's door like I don't like.
