We rented a movie and maybe the worst movie ever. The box they had in the video store had a cool-looking monster on the cover, but in fact it was a monster from the mask of a black lagoon. Terrible, terrible, awful ... in fact, you might have to rent it, it's so bad. It's like watching a bizzare-on home movie.
