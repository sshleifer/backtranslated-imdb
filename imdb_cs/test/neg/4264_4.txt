This film did not give Mr. Bachchan justice. He is a great actor and I was very disappointed in the movie. This is the fact that this is the first film in which I was disappointed in it. It's getting back to her home with her daughter and he's a photographer. She takes a picture of her in the garden where she hides. He is a sixty-year-old man who has nothing to do but to photograph this girl. The film doesn't make sense. The whole movie is about being haunted and she tells him how much he cares about him. Then his daughter falls and he has to take this girl around the places so she is not bored and the daughter finds out. I just didn't think this movie was in line with Bachchan's standards. It's better than this movie. I always imagined him as a noble man, and then I saw him in this movie and I couldn't see him in this movie. I wasn't interested in the film at all. I couldn't wait to see the movie end. And neither will you.
