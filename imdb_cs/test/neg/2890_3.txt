I was in a bad run of movies. This is a clinker about an arson conspiracy and a psychopath. Tom Skerrit, whom I really like, was quite young here. He is a builder with passion but has a partner whose motive motivates excessive insurance and burning. An agent comes to the mix who drowned, his daughter and her nut boyfriend. James Mason plays an insurance investigator. Any idiot given a small warning would know something was rotten in the nation of Australia. But they still break the way. The most interesting thing for me was that the huge hotel to be built never crossed a bunch of sticks. Low budget, I think. The story could be interesting. Maybe they should hire a film editor (that?). Half the time you do not know where the characters are, but I guarantee that the $ 5 million would probably make careful monitoring of the structure mandatory. It does not work. Although there is a lot of neat fire.
