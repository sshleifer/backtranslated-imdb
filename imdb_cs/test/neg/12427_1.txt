I think it's one of those few movies I want to evaluate as low as possible, just to pay for a compliment. I haven't seen this movie in about 25 years, so I really can't say much about it. It's still hard to find in the video. But I remember being with my brother and stumbling on him somewhere in the UHF toxic warning in late night when I was about 10 years old. I've never actually seen the beginning of a movie, but I've seen most of it. The first thing I remember is that this couple is creeping out of the camp and rowing on the island to make out, and then they are attacked by a mad Cattle in a kilt with an ax! He will escape, but he will be attacked by Loch Ness Monster, who is only the head and neck of the body in this film. The monster's eyes and mouth do not move, it looks like a pi√±ata. I mean, I've never literally ever seen anything in this area and it totally hit my head. In the early 1980s, I saw some bad movies on TV, but I never saw anything so clumsy and so sloppy and thoughtlessly constructed that it seemed that the people who did it spent less time and effort on it than we watched it. I've already seen some of Trom's films and what they're trying to be "campy" but this was a pure and real thing and it was my first encounter with really big bad movie work. This film was the last glimpse of the era and I caught it in time. In fact, when we watched it, we couldn't figure out if it was in the 50's or 70's. It turned out to be only a few years before I saw it. Later I came into contact with the Mystery Science Theater and found a lot of old B movies and series, but I've seen it in this movie. The movie is so funny that I never laughed so hard at Monty Python or Bill Murray or the comic. After watching this movie, I always tried to look for "good bad" movies and got a lot of friends into it. But this movie was and is basically impossible to find. I never actually found out what it was or who Larry Buchanan was until the 90's when the IMDb took off and the internet took off and the information began to pass by. However, this film still has to be discovered by many others who might appreciate its transcendentally bad qualities. Look for it.
