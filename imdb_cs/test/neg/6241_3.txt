I wanted this movie, and there is definitely room for a psychological character film that doesn't interest cheap excitement. But to enjoy the movie, one needs a believable plot, some stimulation and editing, and a feeling of engagement. At The Clearing, what starts as an interesting secret with kidnapping and unknown motifs turns into a slow blunt, nonsensical exercise. Nothing really happens, and so-called angle-controlled characters (as the director said in his commentary) do not really add much. Gentle actors are lost here. Robert Redford tries to get Willem Dafoe involved and outwit. Dafoe's character brings a bit of nuance, because he can feel a little sympathetic to him. It is unfortunate that Dafoe was cast as a villain, went to the Hall of Fame of Christopher Walken, where he wrote about television. Wendy Crewson is usually good, but her character is short and fanciful in the movie. wondering why they bother to imagine her character. By far the greatest loss of talent was Helen Mirren. In the director's commentary, I heard only how great talent was. I agree, he's a great actress. So why not use it properly? Just to culminate in this movie, he gets to show up, but the viewer stops worrying. Too bad, I liked the parts of this movie, but once another reviewer wrote you once in the middle of the movie you know the movie won't be much better.
