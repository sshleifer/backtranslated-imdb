The depiction of Ichaboda Crana's character was so unlikable, my wife and I were hoping that a rider (or some other character) would not only cut off Crane's head, but would do it slowly and painfully. Even this kid Brent Carver played it on top - like on Broadway. And he was such a relentless jackass that we had no sympathy for him. I could continue with specific criticisms of how this film failed, but I don't focus on energy. <br /> <br /> Skip it and go to Johnny Depp. Either that or rent a Haunted Pumpkin of Sleepy Hollow (animated). It's pretty good - fun for kids and adults. Even better, read the original story of Washington Irving.
