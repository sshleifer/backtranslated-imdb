Makes the fourth theatrical release (one national Lampoon took its name OFF) to look like a comedy classic. A complete mistake and a sad attempt to use the once proud franchise. Painfully ununny and unnoticeable ... even for a TV movie! Cousin Eddie's character gradually became less entertaining, from the original holiday when she was fresh and unique, over the Christmas holidays, when she started to wear a little skinny, on a holiday in Vegas, where it was really unpleasant to see them appear on the screen Justice, there were a lot of things that were uncomfortable to see coming up on the screen in that movie!). However, this attempt to move the character to the leadership is at least unhappy. Vacation pictures have met with a nasty death in Las Vegas, and this hope of reviving even the thinnest TV show was misleading. Chevy Chase and the company put together a great trilogy when it was in its premiere; Now just pull out the plug and let the title rest in peace. (One small note of interest: The original Audrey Griswold - Dana Barron, the first of four actresses to play, including Juliette Lewis - returns to the role 20 years later!)
