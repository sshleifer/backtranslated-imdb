Though I thought to myself, "Oh God why!" At the very beginning I thought that "it could be average", but acting and conspiracy on most parts was terrible. <br /> <br /> Every part of it was so predictable, though the first movie seemed to be plain. Great resemblance to the ring, it was half a decent movie, but it seemed like all the good things about the first and made them terrible. Some pieces made everyone in the audience get wet. Geller fell from the building that had me in the stitch. My girlfriend had to tell me to calm down, so I kept commenting on what would happen next, and I was more than right. Why go to her house to come after you doesn't make sense. It was a bad excuse for a lot of murders, and no really depth was ever seen. <br /> <br /> You can see everything that comes up, which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching. Oh she's behind her ... she didn't see one coming * yawns *. Certainly these people had to think about ... Oh, I don't know, to wear a round knife or at least Try to fight instead of being eaten, but someone's hair? At best, during the movie I was very slightly scared (and I think slightly), I was just crying on the credits as I rolled up, exhaled short "Oh thank God." If you haven't done so yet, don't waste your time and money. useless, conspiracy less, sorry for continuing!
