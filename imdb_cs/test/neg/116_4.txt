Blind Date (Columbia Pictures, 1934) was a decent movie, but I have some problems with this movie. First, I do not perceive the actor in this film at all, but more or less I have a problem with the script. I also understand that this film was made in the 1930s and people tried to escape reality, but the script by Ann Sothern's character seemed weak. She went back and forth between the suitors and felt like she should end up with Paul Kelly. He really took care of her and her family and would do anything for her and do it by finally letting her awake to recover from Neil Hamilton, which in my opinion was a good time. Paul Kelly's character, though a workaholic was a man of integrity and a really beloved Kitty (Ann Sothern), unlike Neil Hamilton, while he loved her, I didn't see the depth of love he had for her character. The production values ​​were great, but the script could use a bit of work.
