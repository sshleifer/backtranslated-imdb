Some scientists for some reason descend into the cave and there is some kind of creature that kills them. I usually give a more detailed plot, but I didn't pay too much attention to it. Overall, it was boring and the only time you really pay attention is during the action scenes that the director has contributed to. Acting is fine, but the characters are so boring and forgotten to blend into your mind. You forget who lived and who died for two reasons: 1. Killing is boring 2. Characters are boring. The end could shock me more if I knew who he was. So you're looking for a movie in a cave? Check out The Descent.
