This is one of the strangest things on TV. It is set in a bizarrely underpopulated Midlands superb called Leatherbridge, which seems to be the stupidest place in the country. It is equipped with a bar without visible staff or customers, a university without students, a police station without criminals, and doctors' surgeries with more doctors than patients. The rows of the story are horrible - every episode revolves around a bizarre health problem that derives from various brummies of extras who can never act and for some reason the doctor always ends up around his home and solves their problem. Quite amusing for its pure comedic value, but I can't believe this thing is actually a serious drama. Bonkers.
