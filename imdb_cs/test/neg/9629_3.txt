So many people loved this movie, but there are a few of us IMDb reviewers who have found Mirrormask immensely annoying to watch and ass-clenchingly boring. I fall into these two camps and I will try to explain what it was that my nails curled so uncomfortably. First of all to set a record - I like Neil Gaiman's books. Sometimes I find that his conscious, sarcastic, "humorous" humor is a little freaky, and I actually prefer his work when he plays it straight and leaves jokes alone - but with occasional blackouts of 'dad' gags, His creativity and imagination are something special. Interestingly, one of Gaiman's most powerful works is Coraline, a gothic fairy tale story for kids who has very low jokes and high tension and scary. His last novel (Anansi Boys) overflows with funnies and tends to read in times like Terry Pratchett makes sisters of mercy (not nuns but a band). Mirrormask inhabits a similar territory to Coraline, and when I saw stunning visuals in the trailer, I was a little thrilled that someone had succeeded in converting Gaiman's spectacular vision and imagination. <br /> <br /> Praise the movie, some sequences look stunning. However, visual effects are sometimes destroyed by CGI animation, which looks like a Media Studies student project. Backgrounds and scenery are often incredible, but some of the character's animations look clumsy, amateurish, and cheap. In the early dream, the spider is beautifully animated, but the cat-animal animal looks bad and is very "computer generated". Compared to the standard of animation found in productions such as 'The Corpse Bride', Mirrormask sometimes appears very amateurish. However, in the defense of Mirrormask, the budget was slight for such a great vision, and a few creaking in effects can be understood and forgiven. <br /> <br /> What cannot be forgiven is powered, stags, cringeworthy and pretentious dialogue. The actors desperately struggle with the dialogue - and there are so many of them that they constantly hinder and stumble. Conversation becomes completely unnatural, jokes fall over and over again, and turgid manifestations seem to be just a writer's method of plotting conspiracy. Combined with the fact that the actors are working against the blue screen (which always adds "Phantom Menace") - this makes the film almost unnoticeable. In such an unreal environment, actors have to work twice as hard to believe and basically fail. The girl who plays the leading role puts a brave struggle against the impossible dialogue with the school and occasionally shows a true promise, but it is never enough. The god-horrible cod-'Oirish 'character of Valentine (with whom she is forced to spend a disproportionate amount of time on the screen) pays any chance that this young actress rises above the material. It seems like it's Valentine's Day to explain the plot to the younger audience and add a little light relief. Personally, I wouldn't want him anywhere near my 15-year-old daughter. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with this movie? Answer ... Rob Brydon. What is uncomfortable (for us British anyway), we know that Rob Brydon can act! We saw him hold the screen for half an hour on his own (doing 'Marion & Geoff' monologues), and the first 'real' bit of the movie is fine. However, keep him in front of the blue screen and lose all sense of character and turn into the worst am-dram-ham I've seen in years. Real damage. <br /> <br /> What else is wrong? Answer ... kind slap-basing, sub-Courtney Pine saxing and an incredible, too high soundtrack that never stops. God, music is continuous, loud, distracting, irrelevant, and if it's not enough, it's all tidal bass. This makes the dialogue very difficult to hear, but it could be a blessing in disguise. <br /> <br /> What's wrong with it? Answer .... The whistle artist. There should be no place for facial expression in modern society, except for certain secret places in France. Every time the camera persists on the whistling, whistling, mossy juggling, yoghurt Roamer idiot, I understand why the locals of Edinburgh are a little worried when festival time reappears. My latest criticism is that the movie is pretty boring. Surrealism is often boring? either it requires its viewers to slip into a dreaming, zen, receiving state, or the audience is constantly stunned by greater and greater surprises. A little pace story that includes characters we could trust and care about would go a long way to making this film an emotional center that was unfortunately missing, while stopping the eyelids. Finally, I apologize to all those who have found depth, meaning, and miracle in this film. You managed to suspend your distrust, saw a creaking CGI, ignored the miserable dialogue, and the abysmal performances that had emerged and understood the magnificent, imaginative vision of the creator. I wanted it, but I didn't see in the past a failure in the real world that dragged it down. I hope that next time Neil Gaiman gets it if he gets an opportunity (or even wants).
