"Destiny" leads Walter Sparrow to come up with a mysterious novel that has strange similarities and links to his life, all based on number 23. connected. and how the story ends. <br /> <br /> Number 23 offers an interesting premise that is incomplete with poor design. The movie simply failed at many different levels, which is quite disappointing because it has such a great potential. The scenario was probably the worst part. It was filled with silly sequences and a ridiculous dialogue that had just killed the film's mood. The screenwriter seemed to have a good idea, just didn't know how to unfold it to stretch over ninety minutes. The second half of the film was little noticeable, the twist was quite obvious, and the end was severe. Joel Schumacher is responsible for one of the worst films ever and he has a little redemption. Telephone booth and several other movies, but number 23 reminds me that he's still able to make a smelly one. He has a film soaked in style, but he just can't get a good focus. The film moves in a clumsy and slow pace. She's going from reality to what's actually happening in a book that bothered herself quickly. The real book in the movie "The Number 23" is a scary detective story and the audience is stuck listening to Carrey who tells him that bored me to tears. When Carrey is finally done with the book, we get stuck watching him try to solve the mystery. At this point, viewers have lost interest and there is no real tension. We are waiting impatiently for the film to reach its horrible end and unconvincing explanation before we celebrate that the film is finally over. Acting was mostly average and quite forgotten. Apparently Jim Carrey was just moving around with his performance, and he didn't seem to be trying. In some scenes he was either upstairs or very wooden. His narrative was a complete work to listen to, and he had no life in his character. Virginia Madsen has done the best she could with a limited role, but she has to choose better scripts. Logan Lerman was quite bland as Danny Huston. Overall, number 23 was a horrible thriller that offered more laughter than tension or excitement. Rating 3/10
