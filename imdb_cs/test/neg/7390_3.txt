"The King Is Alive" is a faulty and fake mess of film that comes as a confident excuse for authors to deliver a lot of actors to the Namibian Desert, where Major-Dogme-domo and the film could play his selfishly conceived, stupid, overcrowded drama with utter ignoring the real forces of human nature, the attractiveness of the market, common sense, and even good art. In other words, this is one dumbassed movie and if you don't believe it, your repentance follows it. Only for film directors, critics, dilettante and the like. (D)
