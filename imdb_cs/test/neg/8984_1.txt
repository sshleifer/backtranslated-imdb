I'm not leaving IMDb comments on movies, but this ... this movie was bad. very bad. Most of that I quickly advanced, I stopped where I was hoping the game had improved from the last scene, only to continue fast forward. Formula - As soon as the apparent murderers were discounted, there was only one left. And that was in the first five minutes. The scene scene seemed to have read the script before, because there was no surprise, no secret. Tori character ... bad bad behavior. A real waste of time on DVD and some choice "let's go to sleep" if it's the only thing on TV. If you watch this movie, you will realize that you will never be able to get back the time you have just spent.
