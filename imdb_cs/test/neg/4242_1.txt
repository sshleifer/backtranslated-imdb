Playmania is extremely boring. This is the basis of the exhibition. Mel or Shandi ask very simple questions that a 2 year old could answer at a very slow pace. This show lasts 2 hours and probably only plays about 10 games during this period. People may like this show because the hosts are a feast for the eyes, but they are totally destroyed by being so friggin uncomfortable. <br /> <br /> They mention that we need more players a million times during the show. The top 5 surveys that they probably do take about 20 minutes. This show is probably one of the worst game shows ever made. One of the reasons they probably don't have a caller is that the show is so cheap with money. The most money I've ever seen was $ 210. I would not be surprised if this "gaming show" was canceled by the end of 2006.
