This film with subtle production values ​​represents a secret and how friends use each other. Henry May Long is a very well-functioning, dimly lit, depressing late-century song about a friendship between a deadly man and a melancholy, an addict in debt. Talka drama in the salon is not my cup of tea and all crying is thin. We recommend, if you like the independent, cunningly intellectual, slow Merchant Ivory feature. I thought the main characters were in love, but their connection was so intimate that it didn't actually have the emotional impact of the "Broken Mountain". It features some good writing with a scene discussing how to disappear in life, but it is a really dark and depressing film.
