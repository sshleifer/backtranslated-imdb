There is really very little positive that can be said about this movie. Walter Pidgeon is a really unconvincing hero and even a moreso when he tries to go "secretly" as a villain we believed to drink too much and knock his wife down a bit. Margaret Leighton, because the wife / secret sergeant is a little more convincing, but it is still hard to believe that any hood that is worth their salt would not have seen their charade in less than a minute. The story, the bullies, is stupid, and the action rather than the grips. David Tomlinson, who plays Algy in the same way as David Tomlinson, seems to play all his roles, the only glimmer of light in a totally boring business.
