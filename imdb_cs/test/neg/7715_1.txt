I worked in a video store. I saw this title in the horror section and took it as one night free. This movie was really horrible, there is no redeeming quality because it actually requires a respected sub-genre of the film and it's just about its destruction. If the first movie wasn't low enough, then this movie really takes a biscuit, usually (usually) inside and at night ... and therefore avoids the picturesque setting of the first film price. Instead of being silenced, half is heartily apologizing and the girl mentions that despite being thrown over the car's hood (accelerating as he approached her), there is nothing to worry about ... after attacking her with a crowbar and killing her! If it's not strange, he wants to do an experiment on her, bring her back from the dead ... and so she feels the need to remove her clothes to do so. The soft core of female nudity (and pubic hair) is uncontrollable throughout the film and is, to be honest, the only real thing to keep the audience's average interest in the audience ... as a swimming scene in the first movie. but also that the film goes from bad to worse with its bad acting, miserable dialogue and absurd plot .... why imagine a key character that has survived 29 days since the zombie attack just kill them within 10 minutes .... its just a very bad movie
