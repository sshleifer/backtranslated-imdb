I saw this film on the strength of one positive review and I can only imagine that the guy is shill. Actually, female leadership is pretty good, but the film is so unbearably boring that I could barely bear. This is the very definition of numbness. This film is currently rated as 8 out of 10 for 7 votes. This means that the director, girlfriend, producer, actress and drinking friends have made their own movie 10. <br /> <br /> Avoid this for the rest of you who just want to have fun or enjoy a good story. <br /> <br /> This street man will give him 2 out of 10. <br /> <br /> FDA note: while this movie can be used as an assistant to get good nights sleep, no healing value is implicitly offered or offered.
