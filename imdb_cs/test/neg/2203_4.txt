Made and released at a time when the internet was just huge, that's the story Hitchcock would love. Sadly, Hitchcock wasn't around to make it, and we stayed with the occasional thrilling, but mainly stupid thriller that is being held (barely) along with Bullock's intelligence. It was released in 1995, but is already dated, and the number of errors and inaccuracies about computers must be seen to be imprisoned, and you don't even have to be a dot.com person on the site is!
