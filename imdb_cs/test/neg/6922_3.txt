Seeing that this is a theatrical release anywhere in the world, it merely serves as a reminder of the career of those talented women, Denise Richards and Milla Jovovich. It is also a special grating kind of movie, a kind that thinks they are smart, funny and original and at the same time poor in every aspect. Full blame can go to Brian Burns, who wrote and directed this potboiler. His screenplay has a totally unoriginal situation and goes nowhere. The situation develops completely without any internal logic, except for the logic of the desperate writer. The characters are thinner than cardboard cutouts, they behave stupidly and without real motivation. Nowhere is this clearer than the inclusion of Mrs. Richards. We do not believe her relationship with David Krumholtz's character for one minute, and the way he returns to the game after an hour mark is particularly pitiful. Why would someone fall for an egocentric, confident, arrogant b ** ch like this in the first place, much less a second time? Especially after he allegedly found his ... true love? And if any of these things are not enough to make the film sink completely than the central couple. The connection between Krumholtz and Jovovich is only slightly more credible or developed than Richards-one, but it is fruitless. There is no chemistry, no spark, nothing we can accept as a trusted couple. Worse, these two central characters are particularly annoying and irritating, doing annoying and irritating things that the viewer is not interested in at all. Even artificial fans of rom-com may want to pass on this because there are dozens of films made with more skill or more charm.
