Have you ever read a book, then you saw a movie and wondered how it went wrong? That's one of those. The book of Huffaker, "No one likes drunk Indian" was great, terrible funny ... this movie is not. It seems as if nobody cared to move in the direction, so we took care of the characters. This film, which touches on some real concerns about the Indians, wonders why we haven't seen more holocaust or slavery comedies. It is not good.
