Sebastian Cole's adventure is about a boy named Sebastian (Adrian Grenier), who at some point gets excited to become a writer because he really puts his effort into it. This movie is probably the year it gets its writing material, adventure years, the title and the previous quote. In it we experience a very typical story of ages and warnings about love, drugs and sex ... changes. Yeah, it's a bit of a twist here, that's very interesting, and that's because Sebastian's step father (Clark Gregg) very soon makes a rough decision to get a sexual change that has a huge impact on Sebastian's family and his relationship with his move . Clark Gregg plays Hank / Henrietta, Sebastian's stepfather and is very good at the party, very believable without being upstairs, a way this movie could take quite easily. Fortunately not. Known only from Entourage, Adrien Grenier is also very good in his role as Sebastian and along with Gregg have a great relationship on the screen. It's always very interesting to watch these guys (?) The relationship as it evolves and is truly heartbreaking at times. And that's the best of what this movie has to offer. Unfortunately, it brings with it some average camera work, directing and cinematography. It's not bad, but it's far from being good or unforgettable in the least. The characters are also sparsely written, and it is clear from the way most arches will eject. The only really fascinating character through and through is Clark Gregg's Hank / Henrietta. I have already said that Grenier was doing well, but Sebastian's character is not just eye-catching, but unlikely. I honestly don't see why anyone in the viewer could do something he does for his character. Mopes, whores, cheats, lies and no other ambitions than being a complete miser. Would it be different if it were a side character or a comic relief, but to be the main target and be asked to take the character seriously? Come in. And I'm not really against this movie, but I just want to say ... pick a different song in all those movies, Hollywood! No more "Where is my mind" from Pixies, we all know it's a good song, stop using it in any other movie! <br /> <br /> I feel like I could tear this film more and more, but I hated it in all honesty. I just didn't really care about it and wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Sebastian Cole's adventure is not a bad or boring movie, it's not a very good or engaging movie. It is very uneven and the script could use quite a bit of work. I think the purpose of the film is to be a free look at the life of a writer before he did it, and it worked ... if the writer interpreted pieces of fiction I wouldn't want to read.
