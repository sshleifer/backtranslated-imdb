I just bought this movie because I'm happy to dedicate to Operation Smile, the charity on which the movie was based ... but I found that writing a movie is very special. In fact, he does not focus too much on Operation Smile or similar organizations like The Smile Train and their Herculean efforts to alleviate the suffering of children born with facial deformities in third world countries. No, he's targeting an American teenage volunteer, Katie, whose "senior" life in Malibu, California includes a mother who brings her to a doctor, so she'll have birth control pills before she sleeps with her boyfriend. . What does this nonsense control of births do, titrate viewers? It is 2005. I would be more surprised if in 2005 Malibu teenager was not on contraception, and even though he is, so what and who cares? Contrasting Katie is a character of Lin in China, a girl with facial deformity who had no chance of surgery last year and she doesn't want to have this year. None of the characters are written in such a way that viewers can truly identify with it, let alone understand the motivation of one girl. On the other hand, the actors do adequate work and try to play a bad hand with the one who wrote this ridiculous scenario. The best performance was a gentleman playing Lin's father, though many of his dialogues are in Chinese and subtitles. Operation Smile deserves to be honored with a much better film than this!
