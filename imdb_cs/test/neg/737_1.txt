We don't really know where to start when we talk about this movie. But we'll start with the plot. We sincerely believe that whoever wrote / produced / directed this film never read the book. Because they missed the whole point. SATIRICAL, not horror. Just a hint. Second, the spa scene. He said enough. Third, added characters. Sketchy Gothic French lady and her black page, enjoying, holding hands and brushing. We don't understand where it came from. And then there was a casting. They were all really unlikely. We were very upset that Catherine and Mr. Tilney ended up together because they were so relentless that no one would ever want to see them happy. And ... music. We think BBC manufacturers ran out of money, so they hit the grandmother's attic. And they found some old records. Saxophone, crying female voices and occasional electric guitar. * Shudder * <br /> <br /> Plus, the best line ever: "From the time you left, the white rose bush died grief." If anyone has an explanation, we'd like to hear it. Because it makes no sense. We are still curious about what everyone on the ground was thinking about when they cruelly released this pathetic apology to the film in public. We think it should be considered a federal offense. Torture is illegal. This film is by far the worst we've ever seen. I've seen a lot of movies. <br /> <br /> Our recommendation: Give this film to anyone you hate. They will watch it and want to kill themselves. And we agree with the previous post, we would give this star, if at all possible. DO NOT LOOK!! And we strongly believe that everyone who has commented on this film has been involved in its production. Or they were mentally ill. These are the only reasons we could come up with the fact that this would encourage a favorable assessment.
