Barney and friends ... Dora explorer of the nineties. OK, I'll confess. As a kid, Barney was my main hero. I had a barney plush toy and I was looking at the same barney episodes over and over on a videotape. Maybe it made it so coated with sugar and mind-numbing. However, by the time I turned 7, I started hating barney. everyone at school would be Dis barney, and I went with him (mainly because it was funny), and that's what little boys do. But a few years later I discovered something else about barney that I will never forget. The person who is known on IMDb as Angel_meiru has done an essay for school, explaining the dangers of watching barney, and he or he. she sent him in the news. many of these dangers made sense. Barney is a dinosaur that can magically come to life during school day. he is supposedly educational, or so Sheryl Leach (Barney's Creator) says, but really, all I remember teaching me is that magic can solve anything, which is not true. <br /> <br /> end this comment, I'd like to tell you a little story. There was once a young boy who watched a strange episode of barney. One day he was alone when a stranger lured him into the car and left with him. I don't know the result (but it's safe to assume that the child died), but why was he kidnapped in the first place? because he was watching an episode of Barney and Friends called "Alien is a friend you haven't met yet." <br/> <br /> 0/10
