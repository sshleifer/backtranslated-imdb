This film tried, but in the end it was a waste of talent. She tried to be "sexy". I do not postpone the works of such actresses as Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson (who will find something besides the television "Le Femme Nikita" worthy of their talent). The thespians tried to make the scene. If the sexual elements of Wilson's disrupted sexual victim did not touch our heart (which in the end did not deserve it), or the murderous element of the conspiracy. Maybe it was a scenario or maybe a direction, but in this movie I didn't feel for anyone and the film doesn't work for me without this feeling. If you are interested in a film about lesbianism, there are at least two movies on both sides of the spectrum to see: 1.) A fun "Bound" pleasure that works well in a noir environment; and 2.) A more honest and touching story of a lesbian growing up in a hellish kitchen called "All Over Me". It is a well-defined indie since the mid-1990s that addresses the issue of the coming of age with a feeling, not a forced sexuality. Both would be better rents than "mercy" that has nothing else.
