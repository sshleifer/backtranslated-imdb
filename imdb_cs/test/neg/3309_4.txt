Like many people, I've heard more about it and wanted to watch it because of the music that Pink Floyd wrote. I must say that I was really disappointed, not because of the music, but the film itself. It's a boring insipid movie that lacks rhythm. Where does this disappointment come from? To me, from different things. First, the film is the subject, the drug connects badly with the idle sunny atmosphere of the film. It should take place in the areas where Paris is located, and it was to give birth, for example, to a dark and helpless climate. Plus, it's supposed to go down to hell, but this descent is softened and barely outlined. Barbet Schroeder does not have enough on the dramatic side of the story. You could have wanted a little more madness, cutting. On the other hand, Schroeder fails to gain the emotion and grip of the audience from the fear of the two main characters. You are watching carelessly your drug tests. While the two main actors are totally non-expressive and hardly evolve during the film, especially Mimsy Farmer. At the end, you just keep the beauty of Mediterranean landscapes bathed in sunlight. The film made a huge feeling when it was released in 1969. Nowadays it seems to be <br /> <br /> old. Hippie culture is nothing less than distant memory.
