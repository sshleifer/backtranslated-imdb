How could they have such a beautifully animated gem like Don Bluth's All Dogs go to heaven and bastard him with a fearless, cheesy, uninspired sequel. Scary music and beautiful characters are gone, now they are replaced by cheap animations and unimaginable conspiracy. Pros: Charlie Sheen is sometimes entertaining as Charlie, but lacks the enchanting, tough manlike attitude that has led him to live in Burt Reynolds. I especially enjoyed the songs "I'll always be with you" and "It's too heavenly here". Disadvantages: There seems to be no connection between the original and the original. At first Charlie's friends with Carface, but wait a minute. Isn't it the same character who was responsible for the murder of Charlie and kidnapped the sweet orphan he loved? I think all the changes in heaven, but why isn't Anne-Marie mentioned at all? If Itchy does it to heaven, will Flo and Killer not do that either? What's wrong with Annabelle? In the original it sounded feminine and charming and in the sequel it sounds like a jolly, biting, parrot. New characters aren't so great (except Sasha). And animation is better than generic Saturday cartoon. The constant cartoony "humor" is flat and indecent, and the "heart" just doesn't work when compared to the original, which had such a moving untouchable touch that makes me cry every time. <br /> <br /> All dogs go to heaven is one of my favorite movies. As Don Bluth has allowed this continuation to be done, he is behind me. BOTTOM LINE: Not all sequels go to heaven.
