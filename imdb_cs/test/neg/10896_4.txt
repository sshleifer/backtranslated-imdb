There's something going on in this movie that X-Files wrote to John Shiban who missed me. You get the feeling when the movie moves so that everything is not what it seems, yet I feel that the movie doesn't give you enough to really look after it. It's about perception. There are characters heroine Nicole (Jaimie Alexander) meets in a movie that talks to it up and disappear. This might seem like a spoiler, but it's something that really inherits only a small amount of focus on part of the creators. He seems to be having fun with us when we look curiously about whether we should believe what Nicole sees or not. She'll never get the right answer, and I was a little helpless at that point. In the movie comes the time when ambiguity can be frustrating because the viewer is guided on a wild chase that ends in a dead end with little explanation of what we just saw. psycho-drama. There is nothing wrong with ambiguity now, but give us something that could be captured or avoided. So I felt when I was watching "Stop Stop". This film is allegedly about a young woman named Nicole, who decides to escape to California with her lover Jesse (Joey Mendicino) to be big in Hollywood. They do what is supposed to be a mild detour to a rest stop so that Nicole can pee, but she descends for her when she discovers her Jesse is completely missing. Someone in a crunchy, dusty yellow truck is in need of work that seems to cause Nicole a lot of trouble and soon realize he is behind Jesse's disappearance when things start appearing, the stamps she will be given will be found way out of a very difficult situation. Nicole is far from any existing city and with limited resources to defend herself against a maniac who gives her some strong evidence of how bad she can be. <br /> <br /> This is an easy part. When a female character enters the game, the film makes a really bizarre leap from logic because we're not sure where it came from, how it got there, and more importantly, once it tries to get Nicole free of her alleged prison in dressing room toiletry aids. She meets a second, police officer in the area (Joey Lawrence) who might seem like her savior, but when she is also a truck driver, surprising things reappear if they are actually there. The truck driver commits torturous acts to Nicole (as if straightening it to the toilet and when he tries to untie the wire that the killer wrapped around the door lock gets a nasty bite from him). He then lights the restroom leaving her without a haven from the beast. It is the timing of truck driver attacks that make me angry. Maybe he likes to bother her, but he does appear in certain situations when Nicole has time to run or prepare. It doesn't make much sense, its motives that drive the film into illogical thought. Why is it so clear? Why does she allow her to prepare herself? It looks like I'm going out to the limb, that he likes his quarry believes they can find a way to escape, just to stamp that hope when it comes with another terrible attack. But why did Shiban decide to play with the viewer that Nicole experiences a special encounter with people who do not exist? What is Shiban and the team writing to say? And to make the film irritable, the family is in RV. They play a small role in the scheme of things as religious fanatics themselves, but the film doesn't do enough for the viewer to explain why they should be in this movie at all.
