I bought Jack-O a few months ago while selling a video clip, and at that time I didn't expect anything special from him. When I looked at it, I realized that I was not only having more than I could ever negotiate but also much more. It seems weird, I know. And it is. But it's perfectly appropriate when you think the sheer weirdness that is "Jack-O" <br /> <br /> follows a young boy named Shawn Kelly. Somehow, despite ancestral ties, he is marked for death in the hands of a demented, cosmic wielding Pumpkin Man. This pumpkin man was killed by Shawn's grandfather-uncle-cousin, etc., And now that the villain has been resurrected, Shawn's death is obviously crucial to his hellish mission of revenge. Likewise, a lot of "horror" follows as Jack-O hacks his way through different neighbors before fighting Shawn to the goal. I'm not so much here to discuss the plot, how to determine who can find any value in this movie. I can honestly tell you that Jack-O is one of the worst movies ever. Activity is a deadlock (except when it should be), the script is probably a first class group project and the production budget must not exceed $ 150. Some of the most ridiculous scenes of death are being performed in this anti-thriller and are all the funniest when you realize that director Steve Latshaw seems serious in his filmmaking. The movie enjoyed heartily. I can call it a horrible horror, yes. But I can also say that I had a great look at my friends and I have watched it several times since the fateful first tour. Many people (including some of my friends) find that this film is unbearable and time-consuming, and that is understandable. If you are like me and enjoy the ridiculously bad horror movies that are taken seriously, you will find that Jack-O is an instant classic that is also understandable. That's why it's so hard to evaluate this movie. If I rated Jack-O quality as a movie, I wouldn't do anything. The studio would owe me stars. Yet if I were judged, it was based on pure enjoyment, I'd give him 8 or 9. I'll give it 4 to be somewhere in the middle. I encourage everyone to go out, rent it and make their own conclusion.
