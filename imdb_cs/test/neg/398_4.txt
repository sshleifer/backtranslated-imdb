Opening the MORTE and VENEZIA resembles Duran Duran's classical music video, which is the pinnacle of the movie <br /> <br /> "As for What Theo?" <br /> <br /> all but excitement. I doubt there was ever a slower slower moving movie than this one. Yeah, it's a European art house, so I didn't expect Charles Bronson to massacre hordes of bad guys, but I still expected some substance, if not a real conspiracy <br /> <br /> The film revolves around Professor Gustav Von Aschenbach visited Venice. Gustav attends Venice and goes on a gondola, Gustav eats in an expensive restaurant, Gustav looks out the window of his hotel and if it's the excitement you want, Gustav has a flashback <br /> <br /> Bad if it was the whole movie but that's worse because Gustav notices a handsome teenager boy. So you have a middle-aged academic lust after some teenage boy saw some old queen becomes obsessed with a stranger. Great idea for a movie? I don't think so and thanks to gawd it has been yawning fest instead of some sleazy gay porn precursor <br /> <br /> I've noticed a lot of people who praise this movie trying to intellectualize it. In my opinion, I can be monosyllabic and unpretentious and say that the only subtext I could conceive was the physical and emotional disintegration of Gustav, but that was not due to the spectacular beauty of a teenage boy. boring and opulent film
