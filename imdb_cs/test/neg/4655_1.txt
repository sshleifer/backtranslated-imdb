Lassie, which was supposed to be "sleep" .... FOREVER. This is how I would describe this painfully grim time loss of the film. So average in all aspects that it just becomes boring, uninteresting clutter, this is one of the most memorable movies I've seen. It's not a success as a movie "so bad - it's good" or "so bad - it's an unforgettable" movie. The idea of ​​Lassie being bad is interesting, but so little is actually happening, and so slowly that you feel your life is slipping while sitting there, watching the non-actors read their rows from the starting cards waiting for their miserable payouts . It's an empty, empty film shell. Seriously, it's not worth wasting your time or your childhood time. If you are both heavily medicated. That's all I have to say. <br /> <br /> Avoid, Avoid, Avoid! This will drive you barking crazy! Hahahah, take it? COLORING! Hahahahahahaha! Sorry, I had a rough week.
