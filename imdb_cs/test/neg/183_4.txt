One who fights monsters can take care not to become a monster. And if you look into the abyss for a long time, the gap also looks at you. Yes, this is from Nietzsche's aphorism 146 from "For Good and Evil". And that's what you'll find at the beginning of this movie. <br /> <br /> If you watch the whole movie, you will doubt whether it was the message Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. As the scenes gradually emerge, they are very violent and sometimes spread, the viewer should forget about Nietzsche's quote and think differently. To deal with several people, you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agash, who will be entitled to kill anyone, not just write FIRs (something the police don't do as we believe). When TADA was canceled and the government wanted to go through newer and even more draconian laws, RGV's "Satya" has done the desired brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplexing growing urban crowd whose views are important in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA went through. When real-life specialist Daya Nayak 'became a monster on the way to fight them' and was himself reserved by MCOCA, "Aab so Chhappan" was being careful of the "false" impression among the people. With his "you must be a monster to save your nation" approach. And people used it. No questions have been raised. He merely praises and hopes to get Sadhu Agash to his local police station to solve all the problems, leaving only milk and butter to flow. Blood? You can ignore it. Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like "India must likewise attack Pakistan". This movie is for such psychopaths. If you don't give it to them, they're likely to die from boredom and LSD and not. Therefore, this game about the passion of hate.
