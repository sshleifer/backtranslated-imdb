I went to see a movie because my friend waved about how much he wanted to see him and how his friends were and loved him. So I came up with a neutral attitude, in fact I didn't expect the worst. Unfortunately, that's what I got. I could write a 15-page paper on why it's easy to see the movie I've ever seen. But for your benefit, I will point to the pros and end of the supply of disadvantages. In the beginning, acting was very good, especially Christopher Waltz and Melanie Laurent. There were also a few lines that deserved laughter and a couple of exciting scenes. Sad, good acting, a little humor and tension is where good points end. The entire opening story could be great. The Jewish girl's family is defeated, goes into hiding, later meets the man responsible for her pain, and then a big plan for revenge hatches. Sounds very good. But the film would not be so "satisfying" for Americans and Jews who long for Nazi blood. I have no problem with World War II films or killing Nazis; I saw Defiance and I really like it. However, it is the way and attitude with which our potential heroes kill. I will give you a great example of the kind of hypocrisy that this film emanates. Our hoodlum gang raids a German unit and kills / scalps all but the sergeant and two other soldiers (so far no problem). They ask the sergeant to disclose information about another German unit. When "respectfully" refuses to betray the lives of their soldiers, bash his head with a baseball bat, cheering and swearing as if they were on a football match. They took the Nazi's head out of yaaayy! Now let's look at hypocrisy in this scene. Here is a hypothetical situation: a group of American soldiers is ambushed and captured by the enemy. The same scenario follows, and the US commanding officer would rather die than betray his fellow soldier. Enemy's head with a big celebration. This would annoy the audience if this scene was in the movie. The American soldier was a hero for placing his men on top of each other and the barbarians murdered him brutally! And what about the Nazi sergeant? He's a Nazi and deserves to die the cruellest possible death, right? Coincidentally, the Nazis felt the same with the Jews. Do you see hypocrisy? By celebrating the Nazi butcher, we are on the same sadistic level. Major Hypocrisy No. 2: The Nazis made a propaganda film about a German sniper who kills nearly 300 US soldiers. At the end of the movie, the film is revealed. Hitler and his cohorts giggle as they watch the American soldier fire out the window and fall into the fountain. The Nazis are cheering like a soldier after a soldier falls to sniper skill. It is to enrag the American viewers of this scene. The evil Nazis laugh at the deaths of our brave men! The irony is that what we did (or should have done) the whole time we watch Inglorious Basterds? To laugh at the pain of others just because they were "bad guys." How would we feel if Americans had a movie in which the American settlers would have a bloody revenge? Or what if blacks made a film that celebrates the Nat Turner uprising? Good enough about hypocritical flaws. <br /> <br /> Summing up the other reasons for rating 1 stars. 1) Admirable characters were seen throughout the film. Brad Pitt even tortures a woman by shoving her finger into a gunshot wound because she suspects she has betrayed him. Is he a good guy? 2) The scenes were dragged much longer than they needed. 3) Brad Pitt's southern, probably Tennessee accent is HORRIBLE and thoroughly annoying throughout the move. I'll quit now because I'm 700 words. Unfortunately, it seems that the general population no longer thinks they want blood. And that's why this film has received such a high rating. I recommend this movie for the ignorant or if you are Jewish and you just want to see a nice "fantasy justice." Personally, when I finally got out of the cinema, I felt like I was scalped (or I wished I had more than 2 hours of rape).
