I thought I'd see a UFO movie. Instead, I saw a movie that tried to get the audience (me) to make the decision to accept Christ in my life, or risk going to hell. The whole UFO thing was one big red herring !!! The negotiations in him were pathetic enough. In fact, it seemed that some of the evangelical church got together and decided they wanted to make a film. All the characters spoke as if they were in a church where they talked to other church members. It was not a real dialogue at all. I wish I read some reviews before I see this movie, so I wouldn't waste money on it. If, on the other hand, you are on a big stage in the whole church scene and want to see a demonstration of how to push your views (no matter how you restrict them) to other people, then look at it.
