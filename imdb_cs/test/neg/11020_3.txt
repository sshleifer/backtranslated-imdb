After seeing TV commercials for this movie, I marched to a local cinema where I had a lot of laughter. Finally, it was one of the longest 90 minutes I've ever spent. Wog Boy really failed to provide a story with sufficient content to make my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes did not fill this emptiness. The scene where the two 'Wog Boys' dominate the dance floor of their local nightclub was the only one to impress me. The only thing worthwhile to be was 'Nathan', played by Stephen Curry from the castle, his opposite sex match, which provides most of those few ridiculous laughs. Save time and just watch TV advertising because it is only laughing on it.
