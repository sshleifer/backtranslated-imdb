WHAT WAS THIS?!?!?! How sad the actor is so enormously talented as Michael Rapaport who stole our heart in "mighty Aphrodite" and fascinated us in "Ill Town" - sank to this pathetic level. Writing on this sitcom is a bark left on the bottom of the barrel after it has been scratched. Damage to everyone involved. There is a trend: the main movie actors who are already hot goods are turning to television - often with disastrous results (a reference to stinkaroos on CBS and NBC, however, ABC has hit with "Boston legal" - hip writing and great nostalgic use of Bill Shatner ). Wasting Michael Rapaport in this "All In The Family" rip-off is an insult to viewers and mostly Michael himself.
