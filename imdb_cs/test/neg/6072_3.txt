I expected much more than what I got from watching this movie. The point is not to oppose a literary license (if that's what it should be called), especially when there's no obvious attempt to say "based on a true story." But this film is about Beethoven - a true historical person who is so widely known and so deeply rooted in our musical experiences, and I expected the film to be true to history in at least the primary elements. This film took such a big exception to the historical record that it could only disappoint. <br /> <br /> My assumption (because I didn't investigate the movie at all) was that it was true. In the middle of the way I stopped the movie to watch the IMDb. The rest of the film was a remarkably different experience. I was relieved that it wasn't accurate with history because it was hard to believe the main part of the story. To enjoy this movie, I had to recognize it as a fantasy, "what if it was like this" story. The film lacked this honest statement. What disappointed me most was the fictional leadership of the 9th Symphony. The very concept depicted in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredibility. I ended up doubting that something else was different from Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethoven. I was very excited about Ed Harris's performance - an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and stay out of it, and that's about it and for being 3/10. Those who pretend that this film is as good or better than Amadeus have no idea that either being a songwriter and looking for what this movie really is, because it was cheap at the end story novel - pulp fiction.
