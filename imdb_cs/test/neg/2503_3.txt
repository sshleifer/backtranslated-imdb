Wow. I felt like I needed to shower after I looked at this, but maybe I had other reasons to leave for your imagination. I felt that I was used to being abused after wacking, thinking about watching this movie. Furry chests, thick mustaches and well hairy everything describes this porn / horror movie, but hey, it was in 1981, you can't call it "porn" in the 70s and 80s without hair. Like horror, this bite. But as a piece of exploitation / pornography from the rich Italian film history, it certainly has a place in my library. I have a copy in Italian with English subtitles. I wish he had a really badly dubbed English, I think it would add to the leanness factor that already existed. The only white guy who gets into the movie is "Mark Shannon" - he's a mustache wearing a hairy chest machismo piece that really tries and puts performance every time he "steps to bat". That was the end of the era when porn producers tried to do something artistic. Nothing like panning the camera from a tropical background to a hairy man having sex with a dog-style woman. I can't help but laugh. This is one of those films I pray that my future wife and children will never find.
