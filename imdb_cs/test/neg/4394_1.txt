When I went to the video rental company to get the movie I saw this one and I immediately thought it would be funny. In the picture, it looked like a classic comedy type involving teenagers (such as a Trip) that I thought would be worth it. When I turned, I was disappointed because the jokes were horrible and raw. The only piece the director might think would be funny was someone slipping on the wet floor. This is not a joke and people are not allowed to laugh. Actually, I was thinking about this movie going to half. I was angry with this movie because it was just a waste of time and money to rent it. Not enough attention has been paid to the film being stretched and enough time and work to be put into it. I found that the deal is also bad enough. The only time I laughed was the very bad "jokes" that were made and which were not really funny !!! I rate this movie 1/10. I hope this comment was helpful.
