Don't do me wrong now I love bad movies ... don't adore bad movies, Troll 2 .... very painful, Manos Hands of destiny ... just watch Torgo, Guru Mad Monk .. is that traffic noise in the medieval background? OK, so it's clear, but this is one of those movies that seemed to be trying to be better, but they didn't. Why not? It would be easy to blame conspiracy, but we saw worse, there were not too many holes and heh I know there is not much originality in it, but then it doesn't have to kill the movie. The effects are not bad (if you completely ignore the last scene), the monster is fine, the truck is menacing, so where did it go wrong? Well, I'd like to blame him for the look of Harley who looks like Chris Moyles, so I'll do it! Comedy and horror are difficult to mix, bad comedy and horror worse and there's a problem. I hated the guy since he pushed his head up (literally), the constant growth of too humble Adam becomes annoying, so annoying that you're losing the belief that the mildest people don't react by pushing him out of a moving car Door ... and thinking I think it's the monster the director wanted us to convince. Why are bad movies fun? Well, you have great fun getting stuck in them, laughing in the script, howling, etc. This movie doesn't make the coveted category of "the worst movies" because its bad because it's annoying nuff. Don't bother, go look at something else and you'll be a better person for it ... I promise! (Fade on Torgo Torgo Torgo)
