I wasn't old enough to really appreciate the original Mod Squad, but I knew everyone was fine. I have some "books" that were written based on a series in my collection on the screen, and are pretty lightweight, so I didn't expect much from the movie. This is a good thing because this film was bad on a long leash. <br /> <br /> I admire the risk of making a movie that is as true as the 1960s hit. A film audience, though, has gained sophistication in 30 years. At least I think. Certainly I expect something more than an hour and a half of the original Mod Squad concept, with (now old) chase cars (now considered poor), a camera, (tinny sounding) soundtrack, and (bad) scenario and all, on a big screen. We were not so interested in the 60's because we had minimal expectations. There was an integrated police team of young people wearing something besides suits. That was another thrilling episode "Ironsides" or "Password". <br /> <br /> Rating this "episode" against the usual theatrical version, the story was ... well, I'm not sure I should even say it because I'm not sure there was one. Drugs Are Bad? It does not matter. The script was stupid. When characters exchange dialogue and follow the conspiracy with lines like "I heard it on the phone," and "I think I have a plan," we really have problems. No wonder acting was terrible: no one knew how to say such idiotic lines. If I were Claire Danes, I'd go to my agent with the flamethrower right now. (Actually, I think anyone who watches a movie has the right to seek revenge.) <br /> <br /> And where was Mod in this group? I realize these kids got out of the youth room, but no one had a velvet suit? "Mod" means just young and integrated? What happened to white go-go shoes? Maybe the costume department was brave, but they were all dirty and dirty. Given that the film was absolutely true to the original series and required special behavior from actors, cameramen, stuntmen, etc., we should appreciate it more. Unfortunately, I don't like it. If I wanted to watch the drama of the 1960s, I'd buy a DVD. No, thanks.
