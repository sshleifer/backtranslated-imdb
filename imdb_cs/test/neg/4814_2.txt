With No Dead Heroes you get silly lines like this, that pitifully abysmal action move must be seen to be believed. William Sanders is rescued by his mate Harry Cotter during mining in Vietnam, but gets captured by the enemy. Fast forward for ten years, and Harry is now a Russian operative with a brain with a mind control microchip that has been implanted in the brain. His new Russian boss is Ivan playing on the obscene grip of Nick Nicholson, who could add not only to one day trying to speak with a Russian accent, but rather to a Kentucky gas station with his dirty teeth. Even more absurd is the fact that he was also a dialogue coach for this film. Soon the CIA is recruited again to hunt Harry. He associates with Barbara, a freedom fighter who infiltrated Ivan's Salvadoran camp, and soon both of them will blow half of South America. Some scenes are so jealous that it is no wonder why this film does not have more cult following. One such scene is the sudden love in the jungle of William and Barbara, accompanied by the most appropriate music I've ever heard. Who would be naked in the middle of the jungle in South America? There is a rape scene that uses the ending theme from Blood to Satan's Claw as well. No Dead Heroes is a master of magical charge of all time, where one shot leads to multiple killings. In one scene, Harry shoves his rifle from behind a rock and kills seven boys. I had to rewind and count. It's hard to find a movie that has recently received full HD MGM treatment. Watch this movie down and watch it for the sheer stupidity that follows.
