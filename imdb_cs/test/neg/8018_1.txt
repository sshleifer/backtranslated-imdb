Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. Some really wonderful movies were made from his novels ("Far from Madding Crowd," "Tess D'Urbervilles," "Mayor of Casterbridge"), and I had great hopes for this one. Hallmark-Hall-of-Fame-ification "The Return of a Native" totally destroyed. The cast was amazing, the photos were excellent, but the script was depressing and the direction was positively destroyed. People went to the people, they called the lines, they left. When Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta Jones (very young, very beautiful) exchanged a bit of material pressure, she lost a little, but even Clive, who is a great actor, couldn't save him. It was flooded with the usual Hallmark "romantic" string background music and pretend to be bumpkins offering a plot of conspiracy, and what could be dynamite turned out to be terrible. The wealth of the above three films was completely missing.
