Now it's a movie that I really don't like. It's one of the most boring horror movies of the 1990s, mainly because it starts slow and concentrates on a dull atmosphere. The setting is neither attractive to the eye nor used for film purposes. The puppets look really cheesy, not in a good way like in the puppets of Master 80. What did they do with our favorite toys ?! The story is lame, not interesting and NEVER really explains the ominous origin of puppets. There are no scenes of death as in previous films and f / x are terrible. <br /> <br /> I felt asleep for the first time, so I can recommend it for insomnia.
