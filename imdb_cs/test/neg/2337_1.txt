Some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell the story, David Lynch takes 2 and a half hours to create scenes together with the script and his strange mark, but there's never a story. No plot. No progress of characters (unless you find an obvious illusion of "procedure"). This amazes me how anyone can call Lynch on "art" rubbish, but if beauty lies in the eyes of the viewer, whatever it is. Lynch's film and television production in the 1980s came out as "avant-garde" and "alternative", all right. Twenty years later, working as "Mulholland Drive" comes as a 2.5 hour David Lynch masturbation piece. It's awkward. Finally, I saw the movie that takes me as the worst. At least people spewing "Godzilla" and "Rodan" did not pass them like "art."
