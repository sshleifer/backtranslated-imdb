This takes place in the 1920s by Harlem. The black nightclub has to deal with gangsters and corrupt policemen. The awful vanity of the project for Eddie Murphy. He tries to combine comedy and drama and fails in both. The comedy is just not funny and the drama is boring and wrong. Do you think the movie with three comedy legends - Eddie Murphy, Redd Foxx and Richard Pryor - would be great, but it is not. There is a nonstop spell and the OPEN scene has a young boy who shoots a man to death (this turns out to be OK). We also have a beautiful Della Reese demoted to play madam. One of the "comedic" highs has a long, unreal and terribly cruel fight between her and Murphy. Boring, offensive and stupid mess. It's not Murphy's worst movie, but pretty close. And 1 all the way.
