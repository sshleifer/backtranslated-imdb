The idea that anyone could think of such a trivial, clich√©, but infallible comic movie is shocking. The last 20 minutes of this film is comic fame; with six men dig enough ditch in 10 minutes to light up the gasoline track for the 747, while the supposed 'major' perfectly lands 747 in the 110mph crosswind - leading one to question the incorrect naming of this film CRASH LANDING ... <br /> <br /> > Some of the dialogues in my ears were equivalent to rubbing sandpaper, while the only aspect that saved the film was the amount of attractive women who filled the screen with much of the time. It's not exactly a consolidation for this pathetic apology of the movie, but my mute button has finally accepted the training. <br /> <br /> Show at your own risk! 2 out of 10
