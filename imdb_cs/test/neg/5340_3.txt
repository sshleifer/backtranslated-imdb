Well, it's a Monogram speedometer from the dreaded period of the 1940s, when poor studio studios released many "horror" movies that are almost unimaginably boring ... So I was expecting the worst. The story relates to a doctor working on a way to restore life to the dead by using a room full of non-utilitarian electrical devices that sparkles nicely. There is a dog's heart hanging under the bell and twitching insidiously that we are informed is proof that his method is perfect. A brief discussion of metaphysical implications and the mention of an important point of conspiracy precedes the inevitable death of a young man who is revived in a somewhat inconspicuous sequence - undramatic even with sparks. An important point of the conspiracy is that the convicted killer is executed just at midnight, which turns out to be exactly when the young man is revived. No wonder the young man is very different after his experience; apparently amnesic and with a strange desire to visit the ghosts of the underworld and get to know certain gangsters ... <br /> <br /> It is difficult to explain why it is not completely unobservable, but maybe just to say that it is slightly interesting and contains several murders and some interesting characters. At the end, he even begins to move with a little bit of real tension and confrontation, which is Hitchcockian. SPOILER <br /> <br /> I have to warn against a very, very bad end. The mark on useless, the pain in the ass sorta ends. Once the conspiracy resolves quite effectively ... <br /> <br /> You know the kind of thing ... It's all a dream. It never happened.
