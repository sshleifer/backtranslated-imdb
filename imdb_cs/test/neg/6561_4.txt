The weakest of the old Star Trek movies, this film suffers from a terrible scenario and obvious budget constraints, especially in the wrong final. The bones of good film are here, and the directing from Shatner is not as bad as it is commonly made out, but the characters end up talking and playing in a way out of style that the previous 3 films carefully founded.
