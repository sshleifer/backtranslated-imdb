Slasher's sequel (fourth film SUMBER PART MASSACRE film) relates to a group of nubile cheerleaders stranded in a mountain hut in the snow, offended by a frightened killer. Typical slasher elements for hardcore slasher fans, gore, wonderfully unreasonable female nudity, no conspiracy. Although it eventually abandons its welcome, even to short lengths. The original star Brinke Stevens makes a portrait that seems to be part of the film.
