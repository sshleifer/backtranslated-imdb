The American family moves to the countryside in Spain to live in an isolated house. Regina (Anna Paquin), a teenage daughter of Mark (Iain Glen) who is sick and has some mental problems, and nurse Maria (Lena Olin), notes that strange things are happening in the house and with her young brother Paul (Stephan Enquist) ), but her mother doesn't trust her. Reggie decides to investigate the beginnings of the house with his friend Carlos (Fele Martínez), and finds that forty years ago this place was the phase of the death of six children. Reggie decides to ask for the support of his grandfather Albert (Giancarlo Giannini) to protect his brother from the house and her father. the names Anna Paquin, Lena Olin, Fele Martínez (from "Thesis" and "Abre los Ojos") and Giancarlo Giannini. I also like Spanish cinema very much. Despite this, I found a terrible scenario, a terrible direction and a pitiful act of great actors and actresses. The intention of this story is good, at some times it slightly recalls "The Shinning", but unfortunately it is poorly developed, it is never clear, for example, the reasons and reasons why an American family moved to Spain or a terrible relationship between members. families, especially the situation between Mary and Reggio. The direction is confused, wrong trying to use dark and shadows to keep the story frightening effects. I love Anna Paquin, but her expressionless face never works in this movie. Lena Olin is a cartoon of the great actress she is; and Stephan Enquist is too weak for such an important role. Only Fele Martínez has a good performance in his support. I liked the open end of the story. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Setima Vitima" ("Seventh Sacrifice")
