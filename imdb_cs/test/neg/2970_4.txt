42/100. Often referred to as "Tarzan with Clothes", but not at all in the same league as his far better Tarzan series. Basically, the Jungle Jim series became a replacement for Tarzan for Johnny Weismuller, after getting into the form of a loincloth. The Jungle Jim is fully dressed. It cannot be compared to the Tarzan series in any way, not in acting, scenarios, or production quality. It's pretty hockey stuff. This one is the first best in the series, and it doesn't say much. Too many tracks are used and it is so obvious. The score is exaggerated and the action is lame and the production is so bad it is sometimes difficult to watch.
