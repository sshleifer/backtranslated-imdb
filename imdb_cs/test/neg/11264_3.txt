I saw this film last week at the Berlin Film Festival and had moderate expectations. - The director is Bertrand Tavernier and some of his earlier works in French film. I actually enjoyed some of his earlier films. - Cast: Tommy Lee Jones, John Goodman, Peter Sarsgard, Mary Steenburgen ... I was looking forward to seeing all these talents on the screen. - I wasn't familiar with the book on which it was based, and I never read anything about the movie, but I was told it was an investigative film based in Deep South (we saw a lot of those who were in the past), maybe it will as good as others ...) <br /> <br /> 2 hours later, the final titles will appear: THANK YOU GOD, OVER! - The story is beyond understanding. If you have read the book, you have a significant advantage. There were too many tiny characters and there were a lot of useless arches. We didn't understand anything! - Accents. My God! The accent of Tommy Lee Jones is decent, but I still have nightmares from Cajun-French singing Mary Steenburgen ... - In my opinion, bad casting. I can't believe the old man Tommy Lee Jones can beat the bullshit of goons built on linebacker ... And I'm not afraid of John Goodman. - Who were these people? We hardly understand who all these characters are and what they do. Is there a bait shop? Tommy Lee Jones has a girl from Guatemala? Bl√∂rg! - Comedy trials were pathetic. The funniest thing about the movie was probably his "action" and "tension" of the scene. They were terrible. No excitement. Bad Play (Can Tommy Lee Jones do different faces or is it like Derek Zoolander?) ... - And then there are science fiction stuff. No spoilers, but it's ridiculously and unpleasantly strange. I usually don't write any comments on IMDb, but I thought the movie was so bad and unsatisfactory that I felt compelled to share my opinion. But it's me ...
