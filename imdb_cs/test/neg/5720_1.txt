I remember the trailer for this infamous weak Conan spin. I saw the movie a few years later and I laughed. Inadvertently! Poor Briggite Nielson. Her career never had a chance with Cobra and Red Sonja. The storyline is this: Sonja (Brigitte Nielson) comes from a tribe of female warriors who were killed by the evil Queen Gedren (Sandahl Bergman). Queen Gedren steals the orb of the female warriors she protects and uses it to destroy every city she passes by. Sonja goes to hunt for Queen Gedren and later finds out that Gedren killed his parents. On her way reluctantly joins Kalidor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), an arrogant prince named Tarn (Ernie Reyes Jr.) and his blunt idiot servant, Falkon (Paul L. Smith). Together they go hunting for Queen Gedren and the ball. The activity is subpar and the action scenes are soso. I think Briggite Neilson looks so emotional. For someone who has lost the whole family, as well as her friends, Sonja doesn't look at all. Arnold plays his usual stoic role and Ernie Reyes Jr .... what annoying dirty brat in this movie! Moronic servant Falkon had more personality than these guys. Action scenes are the only swinging moments of a movie, though sometimes they fall. The scene in which they struggle with a mechanical sea creature made me laugh when I was acting. Dialogue is also hooves. It's like a screenwriter thought nobody would want to take a film seriously to work with him. I can only recommend this movie if you like your epic extra campy movies. No one else is bothering.
