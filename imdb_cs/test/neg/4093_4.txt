This was a movie that was condemned by his concept. The idea itself was lame - take a smaller character from the average PG-13 movie and create a complete non-sequel when changing your tone to a PG-rated family movie. I didn't care little about it. Then the trailer came. Not only did it confirm that the film would be unreal and generic, but also managed to hand out ENTIRE; and I don't exaggerate - every moment, every conspiracy, every joke is told in the trailer. It's like a 3-minute version of Cliff's Notes. So of course I didn't want to pay to see it, but as soon as he hit the DVD, I was sure I'd watch it for free. Maybe Steve Carell can save him. <br /> <br /> No. I'm still confused why he signed up for it. He had to owe someone a favor. The jokes were all so flat and obvious, and of course the director asked him to go for a very wide comedy style like Jimmy Carrey's original. But it's not funny. Of course, the studio tried to earn the success of the 40-year-old Virgin Mary, complemented by several of Carella's past co-stars, a reference to a film shot on the theater stage and another musical final sequence. But even talented Carrell can't save it. His teammates aren't much better because people like Morgan Freeman, Jonah Hill and Ed Helms just wasted. Wanda Sykes is not wasted, it is just a waste of whatever she does, and her terrible one-track and reaction are just making people want to stop doing their jobs. The story itself is just predictable and lazy. This bothered you with an obvious harbinger, such as Evan's disrespect for the environment (he drives the glowing Humvee gases, chooses to use the trees from the endangered trees for his house, hates animals, ...) and is just over -the culmination of preaching about both faith and the environment. Why the movie was made at all is pretty confusing, but I don't really understand how it was supposedly the most expensive comedy ever. The only real effect work is the presence of all animals and the integration of those into the scenes is one of the worst and most obvious blue-green works I've ever seen. Maybe renting live animals for a set is lucky. Who knows. But whatever it was that it cost so much, it didn't translate quality, that's for sure. But hey, it was far from the worst movie of the year. There's still a lot of worse bagpipes like Norbit and Death Proof.
