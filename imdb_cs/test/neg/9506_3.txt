I'm partly a fan of Miyazaki's work. I say "partially" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant and boring. Unfortunately, this film falls into a later category. This film has the same major problems as Miyazaki's recent film Howl's Moving Castle. The interesting premise is set, but then immediately reduced to something more than the background for some incomprehensible events that merely weave the plot rather than explain it. The first third of the film reveals the post -apocalyptic world story is set in, and actually looks like a very interesting story about to unfold. Since then things have been falling apart. The middle part of the film is mostly made up of thin-shrouded eco-propaganda, and the end is heavily spoiled by relying on a kind of impenetrable spiritualism that destroys a large number of Japanese animated films. Overall, the film feels like someone tore every other page from the script before handing it to the animators. What is left is something that is visually stunning (although the version I saw was a copy of the N-generation, with the wrong color - giving rise to a common myth that Nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but it gives little meaning and finally left me confused.
