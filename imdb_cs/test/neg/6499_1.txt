The new highlander is set in a post-apocalyptic future and is an effeminate little twerp named Quentin MacLeod, who is mentored by the new Ramirez while his little sister tries to defeat the evil immortal ruler. To do this, Quentin must absorb all the knowledge of other immortals before this ruler, Korton, does. In short, this is pure crap, much like the continuation of the Highlanders. Quentin is quite a stupid character, constantly whining and moaning and biting into "a woe to me a reluctant hero", and never touches on the fact that he is immortal and cannot be killed, at least easily. Ramirez would have done it better if he had to steal it and thwart Korton himself.
