When viewers hear two popular villains / characters will fight, they flock to theaters to see how the battle ends. Freddy is here vs. Jason, in which two very popular horror icons try to kill. And similarly is Godzilla versus (Insert Name Here). But very general Komodo vs. Python is just a horrible title and an even worse assumption. Obviously, the film is a D-list image, but at least it comes up with a more convincing name, maybe something that can make the viewer watch it. With a similar name, you know what to get to. <br /> <br /> A group of military men / women, including a 20-year-old sexy scientific woman, are left to the dead army on an island inhabited by a giant comodo dragon. As long as they can make it out of the island and onto the ship, they'll be fine, but ... no ... there's a huge python that keeps the ocean and the way out. Hopefully all these boys will get off the island and that python and commodo are not taking each other in some terrible special fight. Indeed, this movie is bad in almost every way. Acting is pretty bad, or maybe it's that special effects are so cheesy that acting is unbelievable because nobody believes these people are in danger with creatures that look like they were made in the early 1990s. However, this movie is actually quite funny. The creators are so clumsy and the actors really pretend to be in danger. <br /> <br /> I'd like to say that this movie is a smoking pile of sh * squawk! * ... but I can not. This PG-13 rated movie actually bleeds itself out. Every time the word of the curse comes, it will give the word parrot. Even the words that can be said on a television network. How * to stir up the cheap, to throw out the words, and with the parrot not less. Eventually, these parrot sounds came to me and I couldn't help but laugh at the inability. This film is bad, from a stupid beginning to a ridiculous Night of Dead Life, but it's also a kind of fun. As a horror movie, it unfortunately fails, like an action movie, it fails a little less, but still bad enough, and as a comedy it shines. <br /> <br /> My rating: * outside ****. 95 minutes. PG-13 for some violence and Squawked out the curse.
