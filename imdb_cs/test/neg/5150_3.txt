This movie began to cringe-worthy - but it was wanted, with a groundbreaking mother, rival witch, and a hesitant beauty queen constantly coming in the second. There was some goofy overacting, and a few unlikely plot points (she comes in the second in every single competition? All of them?) Unfortunately, the film suffers severely from it needs, well, being a television movie. Rather than ending at the end of the movie, the fun twist in which the killer is (semi-credible) revealed, the film continues for another twenty minutes, just to make sure that justice is done. Of course, now that the murderer is revealed, she is suddenly undergoing a complete change of personality - her character will be completely rewritten because writers no longer have to keep her identity secret. The cheese is falling completely, otherwise it could be a passively fun movie.
