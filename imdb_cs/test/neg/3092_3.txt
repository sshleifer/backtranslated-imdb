This film should be much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor, but even he could not save this story of a young woman seeking the truth over the death of her sister. Spoiler warning: In fact, the older sister (playing Diaz) is just a spoiled, selfish and shallow girl who has taken too many drugs. It's not too twisted or interesting. The movie is also crowded with too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic stimulation. All this is definitely worth missing - not recommended.
