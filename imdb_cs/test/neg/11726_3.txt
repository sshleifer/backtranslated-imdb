A completely new way, however it should happen, that LOVE THAT MAY MAY YOU SHOULD be seen by film enthusiasts - just as warning measures that prove everything that can go wrong with the production of "vanity". I guess it's vanity because there is no other reason why God's green earth should be a talented and not very attractive singer / actress like Isabel Gold in the lead role of a lady. Seekers "like Cameron Bancroft and Andrew McCarthy - except that they also helped write this bizarre little movie." Her singing leaves much to be desired, and yet, incredible as it is, all the other characters in the movie think she is amazing. There are a few moments of real magic or humor, but PUBLIC little. Otherwise, it's a silly, sad fiasco that moves from numbers to numbers to bad numbers. You know how it is when people look at a piece of modern art and someone says, "My baby could do better than that!" Well, this is a movie he could do - or someone - a boy.
