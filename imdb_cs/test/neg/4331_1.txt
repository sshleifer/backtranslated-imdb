The shameless loss of my time as a viewer. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in age. Don't let it be rented as you regret it! Guaranteed! I wonder how Kathleen Turner ended up in it! She is a legitimate actress and people might be attracted to this film for her. But it is better to act as if this title had never been done! It shouldn't have happened!
