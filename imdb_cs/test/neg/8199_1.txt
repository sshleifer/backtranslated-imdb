The only factor in this movie was the fact that it was on TV for free, and that it probably helped the Romanian economy. Other than that, Hallmark needs to rethink this division of their empire, and perhaps keep their films more oriented towards bizarre love affairs between cancer-stricken hemophiliacs in Mississippi. To go into detail on how thoughtlessly this movie would give credit for being unforgettable. It was not. I remember watching it, there were vampires (some of them teens) and some very bad dubbing. Whoever worked on the film's dubbing track must be moved to another sphere of society ... maybe to eat, to the deaf. If you have the opportunity, check out this movie just because it does so many other really bad movies seem to be Oscar-worthy in retrospective. Then again, if you actually ended up in the profile of this movie, I think it may be too late ...
