This show was rushed, and relied heavily on surprise cuts to commercials (when it came back from commercial, noise or "surprise" was something simple like a mouse) them and fails miserably. What's with the director's logo? Is it a star trek? It just destroys the news of this show, which has faded quickly. The only reason is that people want to laugh purely anti-climatic. They will never find anything and will most likely never be. Properly, they always point to something that is what they are "hunting" and guess what?! It's a flashing red radio station!
