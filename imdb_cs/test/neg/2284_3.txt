It only took one look at this dog to say, "Never again!" It is so extremely impossible that I had to read other people's reactions before I could remember anything else (1) that it was horrible, (2) Connery was supposed to quit while he was ahead, and (3) the film included a total of rough bits including a retinal scan facing over the most horrific (not to mention terribly inefficient) means possible. In fact, I never understood why someone would prefer Connery Bond's best films despite the worst trips of Moore or Dalton. Or Lazenby, Brosnan, or even David Niven. I personally found Octopussy and Moonraker, among other "canonical" Bond films, being far more fun than this, and probably for the same reasons why others condemn Moore Bond movies, namely their humor humor, and their willingness to surrender to the absurdity of all basic Bond milieu.
