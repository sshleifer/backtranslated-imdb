Before I started as a reviewer, I never went to films like this, so I remained blissfully unaware that a deeply woman-hating ghost is lying in the soul of a Hollywood film that is putting its kneeling knees on a silver screen. they all either get in the way or come back to it. Or is it just a very bad year? An ugly trend? Here we have one more seemingly sweet, innocent, beautiful woman who has turned a deadly weapon. The kind that warns us that under every pair of stinging eyes and nesting instincts lies a wild beast guaranteeing that each of them lives within 50 miles of living hell. The sample of this month is Jewel Valentine's (Liv Tyler), whose simple dreams include a private house, a fountain in the garden and a home entertainment system. Unfortunately, Randy (Matt Dillon, in his first film in 3 years), the dim-bulb bartender, who raises one night in McCool and wants to rob, is less materially oriented. The guy who drinks beer from the toilet plunger prefers to hide in the house of his dead mother with little comfort and save his snowglobe collection. <br /> <br /> In the same low-rent bar, the red dress devil also encounters cousin Randy, Carl (a highly entertaining Paul Reiser), a lawyer with an ego-size st. Louis. When things go south within a few hours, enter a widowed detective with a heart of gold (John Goodman). Result? Three men keep big, bad crunches on the leopard-dressed offspring of Steven Tyler and Bebe Buell-crushes, which make them common sense that would normally contraindicate. Just as you get involved first. Multiple angles and flashes back combines news on the first page about how easy it is to become a victim of libido, especially if you're a man. As each of these men connects his perspective with the confidant, his desire to possess the jewel of the "truth" of the situation. About 70 minutes later, things meet in a reasonably fun way. But it's an amusement from the same source that tells you that things on popcorn actually taste like butter. MCCOOL'S is Norway's first commercial and music video director, Harald Zwart, and his pedigree is clear in some fantasy segments, including one about car washing, soap, and a hose you can probably extrapolate. It's also a debut project from a production company owned by Michael Douglas who found his niche as a toupeed sleezeball in a bingo lounge. Dillon and Tyler are unlikely to win any gold statues. because of the one-dimensional nature of their exaggerated noir movie characters, you can't really cause them. Several minor roles pull the unexpected guests - Reba McEntire plays Carla's Psychiatrist, and Andrew Dice Clay doubles as hoodlum Utah and his even-more frightening brother. (Finally, an outlet for all those aggression.) This film unknowingly talks about the dynamics between men and women - or men and their mothers. But in the end you would probably find more lasting psychological truths in the Bugs Bunny episode. I will say it is better, more fun, more sophisticated than other recent gems like TOMCATS, but should we really choose what we will see based on what is the lowest on the scale of misogynism?
