The way is to seek God, a great guy in the sky, a big cheese with a beard. Cunningly disguised as a thirst for perfect knowledge. The takeover by Leonard Nimoy in the control chair is The Shat himself, Captain Tiberius William Shatner Kirk. Shatner and his co-authors have achieved what is almost an embarrassing parody of the parody in an effort to mix fun coral aspects of the series with the history of science fiction (Klingon Dialogue Consultant). Where is the danger? where are the brothers in the spirit of weapons? in fact, where is our badly signed crew? Star Trek humor is a wonderful thing when it is in the right places and is done with a straight lace to suit what came before The Final Frontier. Some light moments exist, but they don't compensate for the lack of serious moments. Although we really need another Spock revelation,? really?. Some nice sets and little consciously Trek moments aside, the Final Frontier is just a bad movie experience. 3/10
