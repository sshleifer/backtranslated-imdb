For a variety of reasons, a group of people go deep into the jungle and finally find a lost city (where Solomon's diamonds are apparently) and a super-gorilla race ... Now you know you're having trouble getting actors like Linney and Curry in one movie who plays ... talking gorilla, and that's just the beginning. Okay, what else ...? There's a movie for the action / adventure movie ... well, it's just missing. The first hour (!) Of a movie that isn't even in the jungle, just trying to get there, with a subplot after a subplot (something about local military mode, anything), and when they finally do ... it's just not fun anymore. The effects of the movie are just so-and-so (and really bad compared to the earlier movie Jurassic Park). <br /> <br /> End now. Father didn't care about the death of his son, but only about diamonds? Uh-huh ... just in people's movies, just in movies. Complete Waste of Talent, Chricton Adaptation (Jurassic Park, Twister, ER). 2/10.
