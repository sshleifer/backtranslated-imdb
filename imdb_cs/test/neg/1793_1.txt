Too bad I like Kristen Cloke and Gary Busey. But the director couldn't put it together. There's a lot of action, a lot of promises, but it's all falling apart. The director did not do his job. Promising action comes from lame. So much seems to be in a desperate attempt to save the film. This version of "The Rage" (DirecTV's credits like 1996) just isn't worth watching. Another director would do a better job.
