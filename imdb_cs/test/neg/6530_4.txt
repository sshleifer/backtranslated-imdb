Tomas Milian and Manny Perez ?? "Washington Heights" is a low budget drama in the Latino neighborhood of New York. Young comic artist (Manny Perez) wants to escape Latino. When his father is paralyzed by a robber's shot, the young man is forced to run a family wine shop. <br /> <br /> The movie was filmed in a budget (low resolution video and bad sound) with low profile actors. Br /> <br /> 85 minutes, but the last 5 minutes were just awful. We're not sure if Perez and his girlfriend stayed together and if Angel ended up in jail for shooting. <br/> <br/> 4/10
