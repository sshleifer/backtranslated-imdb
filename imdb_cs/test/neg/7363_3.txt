As the main Canadian history, my first thing to say: HISTORICAL DATA IS NOT EXACT! How can a producer do this? Acadian deportation was not in 1759 when we saw Franklin in London but in 1755! How can it go through in the movie? The scenes in London were also useless. Then for a story for anyone who reads "Les Anciens Canadians", you have a story right here. It's the story of La Coriveau, the "witch". Add a love story and the tragic relationship between mother and daughter ends. Sure, it brought tears to my eyes. But that's it. Then there is the fact that it is probably set up in Quebec City, but is mostly shot at Forteresse de Louisbourg. Of course it's a historic site and it's accurate for a while, but it was obvious that the scenes were not all set in Quebec City. Overall, if you're looking for a New France documentary, go to Candad: A People's History, a real documentary about the history of Candy and NEw France. If you want a love story that brings you tears, a story set in a beautiful forest, watch New France.
