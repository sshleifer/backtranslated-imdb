I suppose it would be a totally horrible movie would be unfair, but it's pretty bad. The sub-Disney story involves dogs playing football and falling in love (aw, how cute!) Acting is not bad, but it could definitely be better, especially the young Canadian actor Kevin Zegers, who looks embarrassed throughout the movie as if he didn't want to be. By the way, children will love, but parents will be careful!
