This film is ideal for any aspiring writer, actor or director. Watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today. There are so many clichés that I enjoyed sitting in this movie. Nothing is original about it, and every single line has been cut off from those movie clichés we've all seen in the 1990s. Although she has a few cheap laughs, overall, it's badly wrong. I was so bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic that I actually noticed how much makeup was stuffed on Tara Reid's face to cover the massive bags and wrinkles from her endless party. Seriously, she was wearing so many bases that you could literally scratch her and fill her entire bottle. But what shocked me was that so many talented and popular actors would join this work. spam. And I don't know how I sat in that terrible scream that makes Ashton Kutcher, you know when she's upset or something, and shouting his words in this unpleasant way? Ashton's horrifying "talking", Tara's face is ten shades darker than her neck, a dazed owl, a script that looked like a three-year-old ... <br /> <br /> I watched that I shouldn't have enjoyed any matter no matter how bad it was. It deserves awards for being first. BAD BAD BAD ... I don't think there is a single word in the English dictionary that could describe this crooked film. Today I tried to watch, but I had to shut it down as ten minutes because I was about to cry out of the overwhelming amount of cliché. Don't even bother to rent it to your blockbuster, it's not worth a penny, in fact I'm willing to pay anyone out there considering watching this movie so they can go do something decent with their lives.
