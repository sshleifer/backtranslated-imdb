Surprisingly, this film Kieslowski is disappointing to me because sometimes weird and sometimes cliché scenario, which also seems to work bad observation sometimes. There's an isolated young man. He lives with one of his relatives, but is lonely and watches the woman who lives in their building every night. It looks! that she wants her. He is one of the youth who are not good at communicating with the opposite sex. However, he likes that woman when a woman comes to his house with a man, Tomek gets pain. Then we understood that Kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs to flirt or fall in love with a mature woman. He does nothing else because he knows it's his salvation. One day she stops the woman, suddenly she seems to be a shy boy, but proves he's not, so she explains almost everything. He lectures and rejects. Everything is as realistic as the other Kieslowski movies, no problem. Problems begin when Tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but unrequited love) turns into a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman. the woman refuses, but after a short time she begins to change her mind. This U-Turn makes a movie cliché first. Tomek's personality is weird? or the result of poor observation? I failed this character, that's my opinion, and I'll try to say why. When he goes to his house, Magda treats him very friendly. He asks what you want from me? Kissing me? love with me? go out with me? At this point I remember people who say he's a femme fatale. See? When Tomek returned to the scene, he rejects all the suggestions. Why? Because she's shy? I don't think so, but his communication is dull, OK. After the foot scene at home, some events make the film lack its goal. I believe that the aim of the film is (to be according to the story) to show us that some people are lacking in enthusiasm and saving from this situation is not easy due to lack of communication and booking especially for men. I think at this point, what does the movie say? It's blurred and unsatisfactory. You can see that there is no hunger for love or woman or sex. And then what? This suicide scene supports this weakness. To touch her feet, he wants to kill himself! By the way, as I mentioned earlier, some say Magda is a fatal woman. Not at all. He's trying to make Tomek happy. Does he avoid contact with him? No. Is he hurting him? No. Does he enjoy it? No. Will he deceive him? No. He has some problems with his (ex) lover so he's not O.K. But from Tomk, take revenge. It is not an angel, but not a femme fatale.
