This film is an absolute waste and progresses to an even worse, very lengthy end! The storyline is confused and strained, the actors couldn't take care of less access (maybe they were paid in advance - a bad move, or they knew they wouldn't get paid) and the Sets were dull, boring and cheap. Twice I fell asleep and actually decided not to bother the last 5 minutes as I assumed the actors would fall asleep then. More irretrievable life time wasted! <br /> <br /> If you have to watch him, take him to the bedroom and forget about sleeping pills. But you may need an antidepressant instead! Sometimes it is good when cellulose decomposes.
