First there was Tsui Hark's Zu Warriors (2001), which is visually ground-breaking, but much missing in acting and writing departments, now this film which is visually almost as good as Zu (though no longer groundbreaking), but is still worse in acting and writing departments. It's really sad that there is almost a complete lack of gaming and talent writing in the HK film industry. I think you have to understand Cantonese to understand how bad and vulgar the dialogues in the film are. It's like some delinquent kids talking on the street, it's so bad. To make things worse, actors and actresses themselves look like delinquent children and cannot act, even if life depends on them. Do I understand that this film should be a comedy directed at the younger generation in HK, but adolescents are really so dead that they can't appreciate anything but youthful and vulgar acting / writing? If that's the case, it's a shame to be out of HK. I wish HK's filmmakers to learn lessons from directors like Zhang Yi-Mou or Ang Lee and finally make a film that is visually stunning as well as competent and mature in gaming and writing department. And stop using young singers / idols / hearts as actors because they can't act, but many fans can have in HK!
