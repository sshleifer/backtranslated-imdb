This film is a perfect example of how to capture a fascinating theme, come up with 25 minutes of material and stretch it to a six-hour borefest that resembles the shape a document might have had if Fox news decided to make it. Even participants in this unpleasantly stubborn film cannot hide their laughter from the stupidity of their attempt to show one of the few great times in world history where people take a stand and work to create a better world. If only the creators talked to Ken Burns for 5 minutes, they could come out with something slightly intelligent instead of this cure for insomnia.
