To call this film a disaster, it will be underestimated. I don't even know where to start! But I have questions and a lot of them. I'd like to know who created this scenario? Who gave them this movie? Who was in charge of casting and costumes? They should all be sued! I saw this movie in the local library catalog and thought, "Hey! Great!" I just saw two FOG movies made by Hollywood and then realized that Bollywood has a version. Unknown to me, it would turn out to be a total and utter crap! Dhund - Fog, is a movie about four friends (actually just one of them, but you should know that there are four friends), one of them is the beauty queen (played by First Lady of India). The world, Aditi Govitrikar) and the director have no cost to make it possible for you. The script even claims that she (the name of the character is Simran) has Aishwarya Rai's eyes, Kareena Kapoor's lips and Rani Mukherjee's hair. Feel free to barf if you want, at least at this point you haven't seen the movie, unlike the poor me. : * (<br /> <br /> Anyway, Simran gets a threat of death one day from one of the contestants' uncles who tells her to get out of the competition so his niece has a better chance of winning, but Simran's friend won't let her she did so, so she participates in the competition and victory, which is followed by the uncle of cocaine-sniffing her former classmate at Tanya, but with the help of her cousin Kajal Simran drowns the offender and they hire both their lovers to get rid It's hard, but eventually get into it. <br /> <br /> In a scene that borrows from the Hollywood movie Diabolique, a pool where dead body is hidden is exhausted only to reveal that body is missing, and it starts puzzler Whodunitu and where-is-it? By the time the movie ended, the movie successful steals the scene from 'I know what you did last summer, I still know Scream 1, Scream 2, Scream 3 , Murder wrote episodes and not m entry, Columbo and Scooby Doo '! Don't be shy, I say ya! <br /> <br /> The inconsistencies and problems in the movie include, but are not limited to: <br /> <br /> Simran answers the phone calls three times from her killer, the camera shows her to turn the phone off the hook, but the phone can ring again and pick it up to answer. 2. Tanya tries to kill because he doesn't win a beauty contest? WTF? Even Aishwarya Rai, who is ten times more beautiful, did not attempt suicide when she did not win Miss India! <br /> <br /> 3. In the pool scene, kids who come to load the ball that fell into the pool will disappear comfortably as soon as the police arrive. And the ball also disappears. 4. The cliches of the blue contacts of the killer's lens change from blue to brown in a drowning scene, but when his corpses re-fit, his eyes are blue. 5. Nobody who dies in the film is mourning (special, especially for Indian society). 6. When Vikram jumps into a filthy, dirty pool, the underwater camera shows us his actions and miraculously, the pool is turned into an Olympic size and clear as a day. 7. A sexy belly dancer performs a pseudo-orgasm soaked song and a dance number about the coming of age. That would be great for a bachelor party, but they celebrated Simran's victory! Hi!!!! 8. Kunal, Sameer, Simran and Kajal cannot properly dance or synchronize Lip Synch. But don't blame them, just accept that there was no choreographer for the dance numbers. 9. There was nothing choreographic in the movie, it was as if they just told the actors to show up and do what they wanted. 10. The film was like no script. Either that or the director was tall and drunk while filming this waste! 11. When Simran's painting was published without her journal approval, she flew to the police headquarters to let the photographers arrest, but she is threatened with death and never bothered to alert the police. Just mention a few of course. This film was a painful experience for me and I recommend to everyone to skip it with all necessary and possible means. Bollywood should be ashamed of this kind of film making.
