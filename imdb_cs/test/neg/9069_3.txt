The 1970s was undoubtedly the golden age "made for television." This is one of those that were probably spewed out as ABC movie of the week. It's the old story of the house and the spirit that has one of the new owners. The film has a promise, but never realized it. Everything is rushing too much. Tension and tension need time to build and grow. And there's nothing new. We've seen it all before and even better. Last thought: I don't understand why Robert Wagner's character would fall for a long dead movie star when he married Kate Jackson! !!
