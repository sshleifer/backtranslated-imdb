Yesterday was one of those days when we decided to go to the movies. We chose the "Ik ook van Jou" more or less randomly, but we were interested to see the state of contemporary Dutch filmmaking. The film is based on Ronald Giphart's book, and I have to admit that he's not exactly one of my favorites. The film features actors who are best known in the Netherlands for their shows in the series and / or afternoon lectures. At least one of them (Kamerling) did pretty decent things after leaving the soap world. So we decided to give this movie an advantage. <br /> <br /> And what was the mistake. This movie will fail on all fronts. Bad behavior (the best performance is actually a guinea pig, who very convincingly pretends to be dead). A flat, uninteresting story with an unexplained and uninteresting side (Why France? Why tell a story to a Uganda girl?) Mistakes (blacks don't have to use sunscreen as far as I know, and heating systems in the Netherlands don't produce steam clouds like New York, though great for movie, people don't wear T-shirts outside on New Year's Eve in Northern Europe). There's one funny moment that includes two little dogs, and that's it. So that's what I think, but more importantly, none of the people leaving the cinema seemed to enjoy it. I heard one of them was very disappointed because he liked the book very much. I haven't read the book, but my advice would be: read the book, you don't see the movie.
