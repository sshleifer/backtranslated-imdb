He watched this piece of ONDEMAND because the description was kind of eccentric. This film stinks with cocaine, the opening scene itself must become a film of at least five characters. It is a racist, homophobic piece of garbage that fits a good 1 hour and 22 minutes with absolutely no direction. I'm a little confused about how good it has reviews. I will not bother to tell you a conspiracy, because if I can say there is no conspiracy. I'm pretty sure they all showed that every day there are giant lines, dressed by Loretta Switt, who plunges on her neckline to show as much breastplate and shout action; Let the cast improvise in cocaine madness. Just like real beer, this film almost caused my liver to fail halfway. Save your money and watch 'Strange Brew' instead.
