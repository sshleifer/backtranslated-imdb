It's hard to be too hard on Brad Sykes, a hard-working guy doing what he loves, there's sincerity about him that seems to be often missing from other microbudget directors. Look at the tiny crew crew credits on Camp Blood, there's no usual thanks to everyone for the pizza they ate, his Brad and his friends and that's it, no demanding waste. Jennifer Ritchkoff is not your average horror heroine, but she does it well enough not to notice, Bethany Zolt looks like a star and Joseph Haggerty is so funny it hurts. The clown is hardly the original horror bad guy, but the design is good, Shemp Moseley does a decent job of bringing him to life and the picture is nicely clashing with the rural background. Camp Blood is a horror like a blue collar and basic as it gets, not a good thing, not a bad thing, just a thing.
