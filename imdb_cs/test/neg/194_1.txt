This film is an insult to the game on which it is based. Claude's character has been distorted beyond knowledge, leaving a painful performance that even vaguely resembles the original plot. Shame, shame, shame. They also reduced the fair number of the original context change score in which the songs are sung. This distorts the air of the film and causes the viewer who is aware of how it should be to avoid being the writer of the game on screen, gives Hud a wife, turns Sheila into a spoiled rich girl, characterizes Claude as a cowboy and kills Burg . instead, they sent him to Vietnam. If you are not familiar with the original plot, I assure you that it is not a bad movie for you to see, but if you ever wanted to see the original or you are, like me, a hard fan of the classic game, you would be best if the film entirely he avoided. One must hold one or the other.
