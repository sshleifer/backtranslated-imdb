The next day I showed my friend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie that I showed to many people and adored him completely, but for some special reason he didn't like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me he showed it to many people and loved him, instead I hated this movie. I don't think I hated the film so much for the time that this movie even has 6.6 ratings behind me. I couldn't keep up with five million stories: Billy Baldwin became a firing man, a random sibling rivalry, a random love story that is an arson story, an investigator, a fire who has his own personality. I just have a problem that this movie can't keep up with all these stories. I would prefer to have this film about a firefighter or an investigator and how he got to one or what he does and why. The film tells the story of the Chicago firefighters group, two brothers. Stephen "Bull" McCaffrey, an older brother, is obsessed with beating the fires he fights. Brian, a younger brother left the fire department school a few years ago, then embarked on a number of other failed careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is looking down on his older brother, who expects him to fail in his newly elected career as a fireman. Donald "Shadow" Rimgale is an arson investigator dedicated to his profession. He is called because of the number of fires that have occurred have a somewhat similar connection. Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the city council. He has obvious hopes of being elected mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to firefighters. Many dignitaries and writers believe that the cuts he has made threaten the lives of firefighters. However, Swayzak is initially successful in displaying firefighters as bloated and inefficient after firefighters repeatedly kill in flames. I couldn't get into this movie, I don't know how someone else could have been an incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighter. I loved how they have all the clich√©s of the action in the book to match this action. I also felt that it was a huge talent that had been wasted on such average roles, Donald Sutherland, a great actor, but a strange role that a lesser-known person who had talented at the time could have taken. I know Ron went to great quality, but I think in such a movie it was a mistake to cast such great actors in small roles. I even had to joke my way while watching this movie commenting on how the physician was in the background probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the film was there that I didn't use it and I honestly wouldn't recommend it to people, I would stick to the recommendation in my relationship from that moment on. <br /> <br /> 2/10
