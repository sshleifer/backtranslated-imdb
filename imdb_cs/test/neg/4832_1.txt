This is a Cellular rip-off. Bad casting ... <br /> <br /> Bad direction ... <br /> <br /> Bad music ... <br /> <br /> And the list goes Continue ... <br /> <br /> Well there was no direction because the story, scene and settings were picked up right from another movie. <br /> <br /> Combat sequences are copied. One with a mace was from Kill Bill and another with a fire hose was from the movie Jet Li or Jackie Chan (I can't remember the title of this movie) ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this cheap imitation and try see the real thing ... <br /> <br /> Can't expect anything original from any of Bhatts anymore !!!
