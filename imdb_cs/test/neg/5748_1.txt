First of all, I want to make it clear that I volunteer to watch horrible movies. I saw what I thought was the worst. In my mind, movies couldn't be worse than E.E.B.S., Leprechaun 6: Back 2 Tha Hood and Terror Storm. Until I saw this movie. Pirate movie without exaggeration is WORST MOVIE IN WORLD. I was informed before I saw that the movie was really terrible, but I didn't believe the accusation. Believe me, when I tell you that this film is just an abomination to film. It starts with a 3-minute clip of a pirate ship apparently in the middle of battle with itself. "The End" splashing across the screen. Unfortunately, it's not the real end of the movie. The film is about an unpopular, clumsy, stupid girl named Mabel, who is carrying a blaster around the ghetto and is attracted by ambiguous homosexual pirate boys. She drowns and has over-drawn hallucinations in which she plays as a scantily dressed skank who falls in love with Frederic, who has just been out of the ocean. In fact, he can be gay. The pirate king has a ruby ​​and diamond tip. It's tearing and scratches when it squeezes. <br /> <br /> Singing in this movie. You may feel that this is a merry musical. It's not so. Believe me. They are the worst songs you have ever heard, and at the end of the first original melody you will find objects that will allow you to penetrate the eardrums. There are links to other movies here. According to the references, of course, I mean "overt rip-off." The inclusion of Indiana Jones, Inspector Clouseau and the lightsaber was in fact contradictory. Dialogue is in its better moments painful to hear it. The direction is terrible, and in one place you can see the scene in a scene that is not very well hidden at all. Finally, if there is a shadow of curiosity in your mind about this movie, get rid of it. There are times when people want to see how bad something really is, but this film isn't worth it. Put it out of your mind and never think about it. If you value your mental abilities, please, please, NEVER HAVE THIS FILM.
