After the failure of "Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth", a chapter that served as a kind of "deadly strike" to franchises, another embarrassing left-wing cash-in was no surprise. An abysmal attempt to explain every Pinhead mystery and puzzle box, covering literally centuries of history, in a movie that runs under 90 minutes ... The display is a sub-par of poor playing, sup-par on poor B-movie special effects and ridiculous and offensive an attempt at dark humor while STILL tries to keep the whole project serious. I wonder how many scary directors it has? Poor Pinhead is currently on screen that every piece of the mystery and threat that this iconic character possesses is totally lost. After an hour of hearing long-lasting speeches and dramatic posture, we just want the guy to shut up! Slightly entertaining in the spots, especially in the first segment, this mess is beginning to look and feel like a cheap, ugly way to smash TV sprays after a while, ending in the most sensible way imaginable: Pinhead, along with his dog Cenobite, kill a lot of idiots ... in space! I'm sorry, but every real fan of the first two films in the series, which has given this film more than 3 stars, should be ashamed. On the side note, the film that follows; "Hellraiser: Inferno" is actually a surprisingly intelligent and stylishly made film-noir that brilliantly restores 'Pinhead' as a master of illusion and cruelty, and brings back the concept of natural evil in the human species, that was the peak of the original film, and the whole meaning of the story. For all serious horror fans, see Hellraiser I & II, skip the miserable III and this and continue with 'Inferno'. Don't miss the thing by skipping this waste ...
