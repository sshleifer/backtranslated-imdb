You know the story of "Sweeney Todd" now, most likely thanks to Tim Burton's recent film. You probably don't even know what happened on Andy Milligan's old story - the notorious merchant who gave Al Adamson and Ted V. Mikels money for their money. Finally, finally. In my years of watching horror and exploitation from the 1960s to the 1980s, I finally review Andy Milligan. You see, from 1964 to 1990, Andy gave us many exploitative and horror movies, none of which were good and barely observable. "The Bloodthirsty Butchers" is no exception. There is dialogue and well, there is talk, and this is one of the things that you will find here-plenty and plenty to talk about. The film sometimes reaches the level of "Manos The Hands of Fate" because you are relentlessly waiting for something to happen. Although I like cheap looking gore effects, the violence is too little and far, and despite its reputation, the "breast" scene is not so shocking. I like cheap and lean exploitation as well as another cinema devotee, but "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is the kind of bad that MST3K would ruthlessly tear. Sadly, Milligan died of AIDS in 1991, and if there's a movie of his, I'd say it should be, it would be a delinquent "The Gastly Ones". That's not "Gastly Ones", though - it's just bad.
