I saw the trailer for this movie before I watched the Titanic, and I must admit that it encouraged my taste. The volcano seemed quite spectacular and full of promises. But what about the wet smear. Corny is not a word for script, and characterization is often ridiculous. Stupid daughter is simply out of faith - she's supposed to be 13 no 4. But then scientists, firefighters and peripheral characters no longer offer. This movie is just in front of Cruise II and Twister, but just because these two movies are absolutely scary. It has some reasonable effects, but overall it's 1 out of 10. Don't waste your time
