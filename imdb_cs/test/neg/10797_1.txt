It seems to me that Joe Estevez spends most of his time hidden in the shadow of his relatively successful brother and appears in very bad movies. Joe spends most of his time dressing in black and looks pretty moody. He takes orders from the bloated face of the Angel of Death, which you might recognize as a bloated face villain from Tango and Cash and as a cocky face cyborg from Future War. Well, Joe and Puffy have a job, and it involves taking some of the souls of some children in a big car powered by a stupid galloot that asks Led Zeppelin. Well, the car crashes and the chase is on. Lucky Kids Escape Joe look like Tonya Harding and Rick Springfield. They are being persecuted by the city, breaking things up, and Tonya looks at her as she takes off her bath. The event ends in the hospital where we learned that heaven is a lift. Finally, the green lights come on, Joe shouts and Puffy disappears without a trace. I wish I could say the same for this movie. Watch it from the relative security of MST.
