A single word can describe MR MAGOO - a slapstick. Unfortunately, it's not AIRPLANE. Appearance can decieve, and that's exactly what MR MAGOO does. Based on an old cartoon, Leslie Nielson plays Magoo, an approaching blind man who stumbles over a few jewelry thieves. Now they must basically hunt them ... blindness. And this is the movie that is taking place. Blindness MR MAGOO. Now maybe if they had some funny jokes involving this, but pretty much it's just one of those "disheveled silly smiles on your face because you're too shy to admit you paid to see" movies. But it is not as bad as it was. It is at least some funny jokes and it is a good healthy entertainment for the whole family (Nielson tried to make "NAKED GUN" for MAGOO families, but it's not where it's so good). You see it once, you can hate it, you can love it, anything. I personally hated it, but I definitely didn't like it or even rated it "OK". 2/5 stars for MR MAGOO- <br /> <br /> JOHN ULMER
