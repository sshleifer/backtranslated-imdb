Oh my God ... where to start? "Chupacabra Terror" is one of the worst B-Horror ever made. This crap makes "Demon Slayer" look like "The Exorcist". Special Note: A B-movie horror must have at least one sex scene. Don't expect even a hot girl in this. With this inexcusable mistake I should start with a full bash. First of all, if you are going to make a horror monster, you should spend a large part of the budget when creating a "cool" monster outfit. The monster in this movie looks like a $ 10 Halloween costume. There is no way to Chupacabras (yes, that's how it says) looks horrible in the movie. He's an actor in Halloween clothes, please! it looks so cheap that it makes me angry. <br /> <br /> Second, gore effects are Spinal Cord Any Horror Monster Video Again, manufacturers have decided not to spend on decent gore effects .Blood looks fake! Please check out this guy who is cutting in. That's probably the best scene in the movie and it takes about ten seconds, the end is a very bad scene that won't leave you happy. <br /> <br /> Acting is the last thing you should expect to have the quality of these movies, but it's horrible in this movie. , who They do not have any acting experience, they make a fool about 85 minutes. The cough that fell is extremely ridiculous. He's probably the worst actor in B-Horror, no fun. Captain Pe√±a will also make a terrible performance in the first ten minutes of the swing. TRUE story behind Chupacabras is not even said. All you know is that the monster sucks goat blood. Why bother with that piece of crap? Ball, don't even look at it, even if you have a chance. Even if it is transmitted to the cable. As a rule, I support low-budget Horror movies because the people involved are at least trying to do something other than Hollywood, but that doesn't mean Horror fans should accept this kind of garbage.
