This is the biggest example I think to prove that when Hollywood runs out of good ideas, they make a scary sequel and destroy the first. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love the first Beastmaster; I even liked the third, but this movie is cruel. I am a huge fan of fantasy / sword and witchcraft and I hated seeing such a terrible sequel that became such a classic as the first Beastmaster. So why do I hate the movie so much? Where to start? First, the whole idea of ​​the movie is ridiculous. Dar and his evil older brother Arklon (who has never been mentioned in the first movie ..Hu?) They go to our world through a clever dimensional time gate. You see, the Earth is just in the same parallel interdimensional plane as Dar's world. While you are guided with the first film to think that the film is going on in the past, but with this, it turns out to be a completely different world ... that's just one of the many things I hated about it continuation. It didn't work with "Masters of the Universe", and it certainly doesn't work here either! Films like this should take place and stay in their own timeline and their usual environment. For Christ, what's next? Hercules in New York ... er, uh..bad example! Moving ... Arklon is after a device called a neutron detonator for use as a threat against his enemies to rule his own kingdom. It's up to Dar, his ferrets, his eagle and his tiger (not spray-painted this time) to leave and save the world ... but they have the help of a young, cool, side-by-side Senator's daughter who finds herself in this mess and show Dar in LA, take him on his way to his BMW and help him get out of tight situations back and forth. How convenient? And speaking of the bargain, I found out for Arklona that it was very comfortable and easy to sneak into a highly guarded military base and get with a stolen, very destructive nuclear weapon ... even with half of the US Army and L.A.P.D. behind him .... waaaaay easy, even for the evil barbarian wizard from another world. There are sooo many plot holes in this do not know where to start; as why Arklon got to the L.A. at the end of the movie?!? He has no reason to go there; and wouldn't that be the last place you would lure your biggest enemy to have the ability to control ANIMALS? And you don't love these kinds of movies, the police are portrayed as total idiots, and while there are half a dozen cops fired on one guy, they still can't hit him? Police in this film belong to the series "Police Academy"! They are probably as useful in this movie as reading glasses are for the blind! Even the title of the film does not make sense: "Beastmaster 2: Through the Time Portal" ... never really went through a "time" portal because the film is not set in the future of Dar's world, a parallel world is set along ours in the astral plane, so NEVER actually they do not pass through time, only by the dimensional world along their own; so it is not a real time-travel! This film is trying to be funny and that ... not because of the humor, but because it's just so bad ... and that's mild. Acting, dialogue, conspiracy, characters and the end are so cheesy that it's cheerful. What more can I expect from the guy who brought us "Return of the Swampthing"? Don Coscarelli is immensely missing here. Avoid this smelly piece of garbage, such as smoke plague and stick, which first and possibly third if on T.V.
