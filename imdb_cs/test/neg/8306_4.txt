Mel Welles, maybe you remember him as Mr. Mushnick in Roger Corman's Little Shop of Horrors, directs this somewhat intriguing yet completely twisted story about his daughter Dr. Frankenstein, who, after his father's death, continues and creates a creature that is not meant for his intellectual abilities or his likelihood of being / doing well, but rather for his sex appeal. You see, Tania Frankenstein, even though she is a doctor and scientist herself, is really worried about nothing more than the saturation of her primordial desires for a stable boy and making some super sexual slave using her body with the excellent brain of the person she does. not love. The story here is thin, and one gets what one would expect: a lot of fun and suggestive comments (surprisingly the most from female leadership), special effects that aren't so special, acting that lacks the depth of characterization and not much power or tension. And while this film is almost infertile in terms of good narration, Lady Frankenstein has strangely some aspects that make him attention - not too vigilant but attentive. Italian actress Rosalba Neri AKA Sara Bay / Bey plays Baron's daughter with some aplomb and lots of sex appeal. It exudes desire and seduction very well. Her performance is quite one-dimensional, but she's pretty beautiful and plays too well. She is also very open with her performance if you catch my drift. Poor Joseph Cotten, now regulated for European horror films for money, plays father in short but competent performance. It's a stellar attraction, but before the movie really starts digging. As for the rest of the cast, Paul Muller is somewhat effective as Dr. Charles Marshall, assistant to the Baron and daughter's admirer for some time. As crimes and missing persons begin to develop in a village, a policeman (this I didn't buy) Mickey Hargitay starts pumping Tania for answers - despite what you think not to her satisfaction. Where the film really loses credibility, there is a place in the last third of the film where the suspicious scenario, poor performance, and the lackluster direction go further south. Creation is revealed and looks pretty ridiculous. The film ends somewhat suddenly with one of the rash resolutions very common in the 1970s. Although not as bad and repulsive as some may wish you to think, Lady Frankenstein is really a very flawed movie with some perverted, though interesting, overtones.
