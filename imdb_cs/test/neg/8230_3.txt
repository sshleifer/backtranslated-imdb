This is a special movie. On the surface, it doesn't differ from many other youth films, but at least in a few ways it stands out. First, the main killer character is really weird. How the hell is this guy who always touches like a hen is completely out of me. What was the female member of the Bureau, thinking: "He is totally reformed and rehabilitated." Boys! Another problem with Luther Geek is the script / direction for women. The daughter is so pathetic and seemingly stupid that if she were mine, she would hit her. In an effort to untie her mother, she struggles with knots and does not seem to think: "I'll get scissors or a knife". Later, in a similar attempt to untie his mother, he wanders the stairs and begins to search for scissors in a box of scrap metal, and finally gets a knife. By the way, it's after the murderer apparently left for the car and just returned. Bizarre. On the plus side, the daughter did her shower set, so it was nice, though unusual again. In many of these films, d-grade gore seems to happily show throats that are bitten open with gushing blood, but the view of the female breast is somehow too strong for viewers. Overall, it worked, but it was annoying and ugly, even though the bare breasts formed.
