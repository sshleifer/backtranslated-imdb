Going to Mrs. Tingle's lessons, all I wanted was a fun, fun teenage comedy that would be fun for me to run. Despite the relatively good first half hour, the film quickly recedes into a boring, clich√© clutter that is about as fun as pulling out eyelashes with pliers. Rusty pliers. Scream Scenario Kevin Williamson has written and directed this film and proved that Scream can be a coincidence. Most of the elements of this film have been seen millions of times in other films; and while it was fine for him to steal elements from other movies in Scream, due to the fact that it means as a slasher tribute; here, it looks like his ideas have run out. The plot follows Katie Holmes's smartest girl at the school. After being caught cheating along with his two friends; three decide to take a teacher who has taken them hostage in his own home. But this is not just a teacher; it's Mrs. Tingle, the worst bitch in school. She does not take to be tied to a bed lying down one, as she begins to play mind games to turn her captors against herself. The storyline is very similar to the 1997 Suicide Kings movie, and a number of earlier films. In fact, this is not a bad idea for a movie, and if Williamson could reach the film with interesting characters; it could work really well. Mrs. Tingle's character is the most interesting in the film, but she is massively one-dimensional and like all the other characters in the film; is just a cartoon. The action is very devilish, with the exception of Helen Mirren in the title role. She is appropriately bad in the role, and when she doesn't have the power to get into her teeth; clearly plays the central character. The adult cast is not worth mentioning, only Katie Holmes performs; and that's just her star profile, not her acting talent. Williamson flipped almost every scene into dull soft rock music, which would be really uncomfortable if the film wasn't so horrible anyway. Frankly, this film has a few moments that are rather good; But basically, if you want to see a good example of teen comedy - it's not the movie you want to see.
