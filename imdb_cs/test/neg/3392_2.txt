This DVD is barely 30 minutes long and has blunt talk that shows that the average Slipknotian has an IQ of around 30. But these aspects are the least problematic here. The real problem is that Slipknot is one of the least talented metal bands that have ever sold more than 100,000 pieces of their crap. (The only reason I say "one of" instead of "the" is because System Of A Down is worse.) Like Ed Gein's girlfriend, the music of this band is composed of the ages of old clich√©s to be in their paintings, so in their ultralight music. In fact, their image is fun; their videos are excerpts from cheesy horror movies, so they have at least some fun purpose. But their music is not about quality - anything: just a bunch of tricks, heard - and-million-times-before-played-just-on-guitar-neck-riffs that are in no relationship to each other and yet being randomly grouped to form "songs" that have no consistency, no accent, no nothing. But if the riffs are really bad, then the vocals are even worse: Slipknot's singer has a stereotypical, uninteresting "evil" growling - that's 90% of all today's metal bands - but it's nothing compared to when this deceived hick is trying sing! What could be expected? Rule No 39 of "Nu Metal" says quite clearly: "You will alternately growl and sing. Ignore the fact that these two styles are not mixed up because most of your fans are so deaf that they will love you even if they do **** to "Slipknot is in its absolute worst case when their" singer "begins to churn out" melody ". But back to their picture. They stole, copied, torn, nicknamed, borrowed, taken without any other than Mr. Bungl. Have you never heard of them? Of course not. You only listen to nu-metal and Mr. Bungle is far enough away from it, as well as for every categorization. They could also wear masks - grotesque, horror, similar to those of Slipknot, I can add - in the late 80s and early 90s. This band, whose frontman is Mike Patton of Faith No More, has never hit her because their music was not directed to average music fans (to put it mildly). So, basically Slipknot aren't even original in image separation. They have nothing new to offer, so they will be forgotten in a few years: once the masks get bored in the legions of their zit-face fans, which is when Slipknot is forced to compete in the music market only with their generic music. Speaking of Mike Patton, it is interesting to note that many nu-metal bands often cite their singing as a major influence. Predictably - and fortunately - Patton is not flattered and denied being proud of any effect on one of the worst metal genres ... <br /> <br /> He said this short DVD and cheap excitement, which could provide an unclaimed ear and a bored eye ... And then polish Slipknot posters, because in a few years no one will care for them, poor friends. When I saw Corey in "Get Thrashed", I finally understand why he's wearing a mask: it's a blue-eyed ginger with a face that looks like Dave Mustain's younger brother! It's not completely scary. <br /> <br /> For more information about the music world, please visit: http://rateyourmusic.com/collection/Fedor8/1 <br /> <br /> Please punish me hard, by clicking the button "no" below.
