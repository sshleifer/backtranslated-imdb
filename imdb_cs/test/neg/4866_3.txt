This movie begins with setting a pedestrian before committing a standard thrill, where an official beats trained secret services, etc. <br /> <br /> I couldn't say it was wrong - there were some good "surprised" Hamilton Sheen - but then I really don't have to. Risible finale gave me at least a good laugh. However, if my life flashes in front of my eyes, I think I would advance 90 minutes. <br /> <br /> I have to write two more lines of text to make this happen. Yes, a very durable suit that shines. I made a special promise to never watch the movie so bad again.
