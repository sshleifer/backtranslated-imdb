If you haven't read Tolkien's masterpiece; Get Ready for the Best Movie Experience! However, if you have ... After reading the books several times, for many years I have come to love the characters and the story, and I feel that I know it intimately. I have my own vision of The Shire, Hobbiton and the Character Gallery. So the film was disappointing for me. Why? It dictates the appearance of characters (inevitably), changes events, removes an important story, removes the not so important storyline. Big bits of what makes the Lord of the Rings what they are is simply ignored. Even the special effects of 2001 cannot make Tolkien's (and your own) imagination of justice. Peter Jackson made a sincere attempt at the impossible and I don't think anyone else can do it! But the fact is, I saw the movie. The next time I read Lord of the Rings, Peter Jackson's limited vision jumps forward, not my own.
