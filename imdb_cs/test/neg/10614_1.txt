I love those awesome 80s summer camp movies. The best part about "Party Camp" is that it literally has no conspiracy. It just drops a weak dose of "characters" into place, and then happens occasionally. The clich√©s are unlimited here (SPOILERS): fools vs. athletes, secret camera in the dressing room of girls, tourists who are going on a nudist colony, at the end of the match, secretly horny camp administrators and embarrassingly stupid sex sex. an allusion came through him. The only mistake is the presence of Corey Feldman. This movie will make you laugh, but never intentionally. I repeat, NEVER. Final note, be prepared to bust the intestines to observe the nonsense that is the "dramatic" scene where Jerry Riviera and D.A. Share the beer late at night to spill each other. Dialogue does not literally make sense and is in high school. It's a classic.
