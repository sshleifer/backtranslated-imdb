For all of her beautiful paintings, for all her good intentions, it just comes as another disgusting one-sided, yet celebrated, glorified propaganda. The message is simple, "All the Japanese fighting at the Kokoda runway were sadistic, damaging f *** sticks who enjoyed coughing all the last Aussie soldiers, cutting their throats before they pulled them off. that Kokoda will pick up "Gallipoli's only mistake" (that the enemy is anonymous, nameless and seemingly inhuman), but he can prove that it is the opposite of Weir's masterpiece, instead of giving us a perfect one-defect movie, we have terrible mess with with one redemption function. <br /> <br /> Let's start with it: we are, without any comfortable adaptation to the characters, introduced to these seemingly carefree, two-dimensional people that never ... EVER can't sympathize with them. that even though we could be so easily related to characters, they will find a way to discourage us. it helps the terrible stimulation to leave us with a lasting impression, and it makes it much easier to see the contrast between the apparently sentimental end and the otherwise bland body In other words, it stretches us in a painful way (not just for us but apparently for them) and as if it should have ended, we are thrown into another eye war. a skirmish that ends faster than it started. So, for the hitherto uninformed: when it should end, it will start again, until the end, when we expect more. S ***! It's just a confusing and torturous pace! <br /> <br /> Which brings me to the ultimatum: it is to educate us on the events of the Kokoda track. It's not close. Not only does it detail the very small, negligible part of the campaign (sprinkling a little "camaraderie" up in the attempt to make it relevant), but it will do one thing that makes the film as important as it should be, does it US DISEASES. Honestly, my eyes have been stuck on my watch all the time. The audience around me, proudly Australian, bickering when they figured out how great the movie would be, groaned, moaned, and whimpered in disappointment, because each of the painful ninety-five minutes was parked (for a short time it was like the Apocalypse: the difference is that the Apocalypse was now a good movie and deserved the three hours it received) and to the point where suicide could be a whole-hearted alternative if the movie was watched. Although <br /> Although, as the TV advertises this waste, I would say it is mandatory, in the subliminal sense of the word. <br /> <br /> See if you like nice pictures. Although you would rather watch The Constant Gardener or Gallipoli because they have excellent cinematography and ACTUAL plot. <br /> <br /> Overall: *
