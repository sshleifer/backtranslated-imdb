The nicely radiated environment of the 1930s gives the viewer great interest at the beginning of the 21st century; unfortunately, "London belongs to me" has little to recommend it in addition to curious English charm. All the problems lie in a deeply unfocused story. The main plot concerns the actions of the young boy Richard Attenborough, the problems he gets, and how the community he lives in is being saved from the laws of society. Or something. The main question is that Attenborough's character brings everything to himself and, frankly, is guilty of almost every charge against him, so it is confused why the film (and all characters) has so much sympathy for him. He is treated like a victim of circumstances, if not really; What is more, it is not proven that he has too much remorse about his actions, just cared about getting rid of things he didn't want to do. Alastair Sim gets a lot of time on the screen in a subplot that has absolutely nothing to do with the main plot line and wonders what he's doing there (although Sim is, as always, excellent). You know there is a problem with structure when the main plot is constantly against the subplot, but not the other way around. And after a calm pace and careful build-up, the plot over the past 20 minutes has completely disintegrated with a deeply unsatisfactory and inexplicable conclusion that does not even tell us whether Attenborough's character has evolved in previous proceedings. The movie doesn't stop, it just stops. Negotiations, direction and overall impression of the film can all be praised, but unfortunately the story and structure of the work is constantly green. The Last Trivia Point: Alec Guinness based his performance in the much superior movie "The Ladykillers" on Alastair Sim's performance in this movie, right on both characters having almost identical first scenes.
