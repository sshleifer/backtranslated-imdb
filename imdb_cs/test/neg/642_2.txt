Alien Express is one of the worst movies I've bothered to experience. The chart is predictable. Foreigners look like rubber sock puppets. The effects would be average in the 1970s, but today they are just appalling. Could they take a picture of a real train instead of using the obvious model? <br /> <br /> Acting is not great, but dialogue is the worst. It will come into your mind. "She won't die of me. Not now." If you ever suspend distrust so long that it can be absorbed into the film, foreigners, model trains or clich√©s will quickly return to reality. I did not give this movie "1" it is that it does not deserve to be rated so badly that some poor shoots can watch it for pleasure owning a really bad movie.
