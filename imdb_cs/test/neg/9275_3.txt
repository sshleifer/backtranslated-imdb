I rented this TV version of Troilus and Cressida from my library last Thursday and I just couldn't believe my eyes. Where should I start? no effort was made to make the game look remotely, as if it were a Trojan war, all the actors wore Elizabethan clothes. In addition, most actors were too old and severely mistaken - Aeneas (with a white beard) looked older than Nestor, Troilus was at least 30, Hector looked a Spanish pirate, Ajax was equally ill played and Thersité was a transvestite. Br /> <br /> Likewise, the action is bad, the duel between Ajax and Hector is short and amateur, the camera angle is more focused on Nestor's face, so we can only see what's happening in the background, which is in itself frustrating . Not even a "battle" at the end, given that it is due respect. We do not see Troilus and Diomedes fight, nor does anyone else for that matter, Paris and Menelaus just seemingly mud wrestling before the Thersites. Even Patroclus's death was dropped. All this was a major disappointment because I woke up in the very boring 2 and a half hour drama of the BBC costume to get to that point. However, it wasn't all bad. I thought Incredible Orlando as Thersité and John Shrapnel as Hector were well played, even though they didn't look right. I would say the same thing about Kenneth Haigh as Achilles, because he didn't have a striking appearance and sometimes he was a bit dry. SPOILER: The peak at the end - the death of Hector - was perhaps the best part of the film, the Achilles dialogue is excellent and sums up the attitude of a cold, experienced killer. However, the scene gressomeness (when Achilles signs on what was Hector's head) sets it apart as well. Charles Gray as Pandarus was gorgeous as a sleazy old pervert and I thought the actress playing Cressida did OK. Troilus fighting the war, however, was annoying and I think the game would be better if he was murdered by Achilles instead of as a hector. Conclusion? Okay, but it might be better if he had younger casts and costumes that would at least try to look like an ancient Grecian, not to mention the lack of action. 5/10
