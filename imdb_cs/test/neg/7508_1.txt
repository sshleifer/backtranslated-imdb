I'm a big fan of Zombie movies. I admit that Zombie movies are usually not as good, but I like it anyway. Despite the miserable negotiations and worthless dialogues that occur in almost all Zombie movies, this is by far the worst. See, there are a few ground rules with zombie-movies. 1. Zombies are suicidal. Tactics are rarely used and NEVER behave like a boxer. They do not move the wound to the head, they take it with an ugly smile. They're not trying to hit you in the face, they grab your hand and bite! 2. Zombie does not speak. Only in Evil Dead. Otherwise, SPEAK. 3. You don't have to fight zombies with melee-ranged weapons. You lose yourself in the fight against zombies. Firearms are used. In this movie, however, melee is a path that is bad. Very bad. <br /> <br /> It had no redeeming features. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Zombie, check out a movie with an average score above 3 on IMDb.com
