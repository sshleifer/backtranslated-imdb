You wonder if his hungry co-worker is gay. On sale he finds a ray gun called "Gaydar". You point it at the person, you press the trigger and tell you how homosexuals are. It is trying, it works and he decides to find out if his associate is homosexual like him ... A promising idea destroyed by an unjust scenario (after a promising start) and terrible action. The entire cast overcomes and basically SCREAM its lines constantly. After a while it will be uncomfortable and really embarrassing. The saving of grace is that it is short, there is a scene that steals a cat (loves her fall from the cat bed) and Charles Nelson Reilly is hysterical in her short piece. But none of this will save the film. I can't recommend it at all.
