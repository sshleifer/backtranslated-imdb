Oh, dear. It's really getting nervous when a low budget, senseless horror affair is trying to look interesting in credits by having a lot of good names popping up in cast, just engaging each of them in the smallest, most useless possible roles. In this film, we have Richard Lynch on one scene, Martin Kove's current performance, a short place for Vernon Welles, a little more time on screen for John Philip Law and a little time for Karen Black. In fact, this lot of random portals doesn't add up too much, although Richard Lynch and Karen Black are bringing up some of the few smiles of this movie with their shows, and it's quite painful because none of the main actors are good at all. I couldn't help but think that if there were more scenes with one of the film's movie veterans, it would be a lot better, but it's just a few irritating glances of good fun without the film really having fun. One of the charismatic or sympathetic appearances, in my opinion, was Steve Wastell, because Axel and his girlfriend, whom I believed, played Elina Madison (she had never heard of her before, but has some degree of presence on the screen and is a good seeker). Rendering in this is a simple, evil undead miner goes after those who steal his gold, and it should do for good slasher fun, especially given that it is driven by John Carl Buechler who has made special effects for many of them kind movies, including working on all three major slasher franchises (Halloween, Elm Street and Friday the 13th) and such small gems as the Mausoleum. Unfortunately, the film is lacking in tension, sympathy and satisfaction. There are one or two slightly bloody moments, but nothing worth watching a movie, I wouldn't say. In fact, in addition to the portraits mentioned above, this movie is really pretty musty and turgid with characters who couldn't get fast enough for my taste and the unfortunate lack of real interest. I didn't even find it in the laughter of a bad movie that is precious to me because I love a lot of nice movies. I'd say avoid.
