What's wrong with American movies these days? Hollyweird still makes films that have men who act like women and women who act like men. An idiotic male director and writer of this film must have examined heads. The main problems with this film are its obvious extreme feminist gender portraits. <br /> <br /> In the bar scene, Eva Mendez and her beer bottle friend are swinging like you can find oilmen. tanker doing so in a bar in Iceland. Mendez constantly kisses every girl he sees. He also dresses every scene provocatively, but a curse like a guy. She gets very emotional when she fights Will Smith for a while while trying to 'defend' all women from bad guys everywhere. Men are not better in this movie. What we see is a bunch of idiots trying to do anything to win a date. The men in this film deal with getting sexual favors or failing to speak clearly when they are facing a woman. Men in real life act like this. What we see in this film is a product of a culture that has changed. Everything is flipped. Boys behave like girls, girls behave like boys. All of this happens while maintaining extreme gender prediction in the story. Men are shown as soft and stupid but only interested in sex most of the time, while women are shown as macho and overbearing but only as veneer for their emotional insecurities. This film would be good if the audience did not feel uncomfortable. Content is not the culprit. It's the way content is presented.
