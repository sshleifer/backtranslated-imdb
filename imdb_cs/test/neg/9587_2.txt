... why watch a TV drama (billed as a comedy) in which none of the characters is likable or interesting? I can see what the writer David Renwick was trying to achieve: wrong directions and surprises, which he brought to "one foot in the grave," etc. I admit that the script was slightly larger than most. currently on British television. But really ... who cares about these people? They are cold boredom. Another poster mentioned a scene in which a woman sits and watches a video of herself and her late ex-boyfriend. That was the moment I turned off the program, never returned. <br /> <br /> P.S. It is interesting to note that posters that do not like this series are all British, while those who praise them are mostly in other countries. This reflects the fact that when the BBC aired this series, it was ignored by the audience and sunk as a stone. <br /> <br /> P.P.S. Good news for those who liked it! In the autumn of 2007, the second series will be held - without a male lead. It sounds like the BBC has decided to turn it into a more common 30-minute sitcom.
