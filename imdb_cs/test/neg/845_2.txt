In 4 words, Captain Corelli's Mandolin was with the book "completely tuned". The novel provided a sufficient background character to understand the relationships and the personal challenges of the character needed to overcome; the screenwriter decided to ignore the details. Ignoring them (eg, the role of a priest initially as a boss, but later as a spiritual leader, the inability of the fianc√© to read until she was taught by socialist rebels, advice from Corelli's bomb experts and his eventual ironic demise), the story falls flat. It was the first movie I ever left. Interesting cinematography, great actors have no film; The story does.
