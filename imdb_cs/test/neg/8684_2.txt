This movie was a total yawnfest that lasted forever to get, but never really. It was just boring to watch, I could never really get into it. This movie is not a horror film of imagination, the cover of the videotape was one. Instead, it is a thriller with several horror elements thrown to make the film more interesting. Of course, it doesn't help this film at all. Mostly I remember that this film was like a 70's movie called "The Deep". A bunch of looking treasure, rival group that something like that. There are also supernatural twists, but to tell you the truth, I was bored when I watched this movie I zoned, so I can't tell you what the supernatural elements were. I remember the tracks at the bottom of the sea, so maybe it was some kind of walking dead, or maybe I'll think of the movie "Zombie" Lucia Fulcia, instead of being a horror movie that took place on a tropical island and so extraordinary that it was much more fun than this movie. That day we learned a valuable lesson, never rent a movie based on its cover.
