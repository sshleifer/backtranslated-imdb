He only saw this movie last night. I remember the hype, it's a release, and to be honest I saw it back, maybe I wouldn't be so generous. I hate the hype, it can destroy the movie. I think the film overlooked the characters and put too much emphasis on Woody. He was good too - though he wondered if he was stoned all the time. It was never too deep. Redford was dark, but not too dark, and his character finally left me. For me, he should be more confrontational with Demi - maybe throw her away or tell her she's paid for her. After all, he would have examined them before he made the suggestion - that is not shown in the film, but no one in his perceived position would make an offer to anyone. Was it cruel until he broke it and the last straw was in the house and Demi fell on it? Passages giving insight to Demi and Woody's relationship were the best part of the film. There was a profound deepness that drowned out the shallowness of John Gages. He could really be much stronger and, like other people, thought that the film cards were Redford and they didn't want to tarnish his "picture". I say what the hell was Robert in this movie old! Woody and Demi's characters were naive in some sense, but I think it was very deliberate to draw you to their situation and push their decisions. But the reality is that they lost their dream home and where did they go? Las Vegas? gambling with what's left and then accepting a proposal from a madly rich billionaire. I found their naivety when Redford seduced them a little unrealistically. The film could be much more and other actors would make a difference, but when they said late night television - that was nice and me, if you don't think too much - also tasty
