It was the first feature film for Clinton, I was there while this mess was shot in Adelaide around 98 ... <br /> <br /> Although I wasn't directly involved in production, I witnessed a typically erratic behavior, post set, it went down,: parties, drugs, illusory glamor, really an example of what to do when making a movie, but also a byproduct of young, talented people who are trapped in classic ideologies fame and secular position. I like Clinton, we had a special friendship, they deserve another crack with a more advanced scenario ... there were problems and I'm sure it's much better to be done the next time a round. Because, frankly, he certainly did not do him a favor in his biography and did not do it ... but hey, it was a paid job, in a country where actors regularly starve to death <br /> <br /> In short, fascinating to watch basically "do", not so fun to experience (unfortunately!).
