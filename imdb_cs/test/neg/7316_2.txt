The sudden blend of childhood humor with a romantic relationship melodram does not give this weakly made film any taste. As the event opens, Reno (AJ Buckley) enters her apartment, discovering her girlfriend in flagrante delicto with her roommate, who enthusiastically tells Reno "Well, at least it's someone you know", resulting in Reno's decision never to have another roommate, this decision was communicated to the audience through an early abandonment. The storyline then continues for ten months where we find out that Reno is really true to his word about avoiding roommates, though this seems to have pleaded the question due to his collecting of a loving lover, Holly (Holly Field), with whom he has created marriage plans. The story briefly moves to a slick Hollywood strip club, where Reno's uncle Charley, in love with the "dancer" he finds absolutely desirable, keeps herself over the dead at the top of the club bar after seeing the unadorned charm that appeared in the object by his affection. Obviously, Charley was aware of his heart's bad condition because he created a videotape during which his commentary left his big (and stopped) residence in Hollywood to Reno, and we see that the other is making an interview, unlike his promise, an interview with applicants for two roommates as tenants, with him and Holly they share a selection process in an organized way. Following a sequence of innovations involving bizarre tenant candidates, all of whom Reno and Holly did not find surprisingly to be able to live with them in their home, were unknown to each other, each choosing a tenant of the opposite sex, with the lovers obviously cool to choose. your partner. Newcomers (Chad and Nicole) seem to have a little recognizable point on their existence than a high-hearing fornication with a number of partners, and it is not long before Mars's jealousy is Reno's and Holly's harmonious relationship. Reno is focused on patenting and merchandising the type of sports travel bags, and as he has put an engagement ring on Holly, the potential success of this business adventure is of great financial importance if he intends to cede his marriage plan. Unfortunately, Chad and Nicole's delicate team, whose activity is seemingly laced with lust, is likely to disrupt Reno's future wedding intentions. The direction is unwavering, far from meeting the basic needs of the players, even though the erratically composed scenario provides limited material that actors can work with, and ad libbing falls awkwardly. As a result, the performances are indistinguishable, not supported by spot editing, while the method of camera-work work changes as suddenly and often as the tail light of the firefly. Low budget and on-the-spot movies, only a skill modic is needed to design processes, but a larger amount of value could be placed on the tasteless D.J. background soundtrack, generally blaring and almost always invasive. Much of the discussion was stimulated by the final sequences of the film, which the viewer apparently does not expect based on what has come before, but is in fact probably the only sophisticated part of the poorly paved scenario and fair tender. work almost traceable, despite the shabby quality of production as a whole.
