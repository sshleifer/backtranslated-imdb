This movie is very hard to understand why a couple wants to divorce? There is no reason, we know nothing about their life in Lisbon and nothing about Mary's work. We can only understand that a shout appeared in this life. We don't even know who took the divorce. The way of filming is something special: I didn't know the director's name before the end of the movie, when I read on the screen I understood why it was so slow, only 42 shots in a hundred minutes (I calculated them)! It reminded me of a few Japanese movies I saw in the 1990s, in fact we have to accept that it is an expression of another culture, even if the set is occult. I don't know if this story would suit a Japanese couple. One can see the logic of the scenes, but the result is boredom, yet I decided to follow it to the end because I wanted to get the spirit and meaning of it all. In fact, I understand that the story of these two beings is not over, because the train leaves the station without Mary. It's been a long time! I can't recommend this job.
