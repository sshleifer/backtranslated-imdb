If I could give this movie 0/10 I would, and this is the first movie I wanted to rate so low. It's worse than terrible. If I saw it in the cinema, I'd like the cinema to pay me for watching it (minimum wage). Some camera shots were quite effective, but there were many, for example, Garbage. The villains reflect in a mirror that separates his head and shoulders from his body (seeing them believe). Some utterly useless killing of innocent civilians. 2 murders that made me laugh aloud because of victim / facial expressions when they were shot. I saw it all the way to the end (fast 10 minutes of boring nonsensical dialogue) and I was hoping to see Seagal in some decent fight, but almost none of it (should know when he threw someone at the beginning) while the elevator went down was shown in slow motion with music - the end of the 'action' scene). In one scene we see Seagal pinching his neck in a slow motion, making his hand not touched. The main villain returns to life. He gets shot in the chest for 2 different occasions. The first time is with a shotgun that throws it into the 2nd and 3rd floors of the street. To sum up, this film is a waste of time and a complete joke. It looks a very low budget (even for Seagal). The color is matt and gray. I could go on and on ... just like this movie, but I'm used to it. Watch this movie if you have insomnia. It is guaranteed that you are asleep.
