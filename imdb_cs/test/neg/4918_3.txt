Oh dear. This sequel has a mirror, this time which houses the evil spirit of the psychopath who murdered the entire family with a shotgun in the Amityville home. The mirror caught the whole ugly incident of a terrified family who had no time to prepare for his uninvited guest. The mirror is given to the photographer, Keyes (Ross Partridge) bum (.. who will happen to be his mad father, and the man responsible for killing the family), and it is bad that soon terrorizes those who are in the loft. such as Keyes' painter's stick Suki, pictured by Julia Nickson-Soul) where he lives when they look into it. Soon Keyes has nightmares and looks through her father's eyes as he shoots the whole family into the cold blood, fearing he might follow his steps. Soon he sees more occurrences through the eyes of his father, as if the terrible day had flown the mother's head to the floor of the institution or experienced a moment inside the cell when the doctor handed him the medicine to immobilize him. Pretty solid to support the cast that deserves better than being stuck in junk like this, such as David Naughton (American Werewolf in London) as the loft owner with whom Keyes lives, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor / artist, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist -detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a cheerful ditsy, rather a strange secretary-nurse in asylum (.. the one who held Keyes' father) soon to be locked up. Rounding the film, sexy, long-haired Lala Sloatman as Keyes' supporting girlfriend, Barbara Howard (Friday, The 13th The Final Chapter) as Naughton's betrayed wife (he was on the verge of launching the Nickman-Seoul affair) , Jack Orend as a sadistic devil trying to provoke his son to kill innocent people like him, and Robert Rusler (Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge) as a refused lover (.. Nickson-Soul) who meets the unhappy by extinction while tearing images as revenge for his release. This movie is a bad special effects movie that uses Amityville title as cash. The series has never been so great as to start, but since each sequel was green, it was getting worse and worse. After the third movie, the furniture of the infamous house becomes the "obsessed" subject of human torture. However, the cast tries, but the material (.. the mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means) is lacking in quality .. and somewhat average special effects do not help matters. O'Quinn, what he's dealing with, shows why he's such a great actor, can even experience faeces like this. Everything is not lost, you see Sloatman always wearing a super short skirt (or her panties shirt), showing her legs all over .. .., you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE: NEW GENERATION was the seventh movie of the series! The most successful part of the film were portraits of demons, painted by Nickson-Soul artist, possibly inspired by the evil mirror when looking into it.
