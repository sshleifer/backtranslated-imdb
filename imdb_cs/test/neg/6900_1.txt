When my six-year-old fell asleep in the theater during this movie, it was all the confirmation I needed to make this movie smelly. It was boring. The frightening parts were boring. Maudlin parts were boring. Even the humorous parts - with minor exceptions - were boring. And predictable. And did I mention the predictable one? Examples: 1) Grumpy but loving daddy indulges his brother. 2) Grumpy but loving dad bought a farm (while singing a song?!). 3) The dude of a boy who decides to cut and run, but thanks to his friends who keep things because they need him. 4) That guy dude who won incredible chances. 5) A harsh character expressed by an African American actress. These filmmakers have to appreciate for such originality and for maintaining this stereotype. I mentioned two funny pieces. In both cases small figures contributed. The mouse jumped on the farmer's pulse. The farm dog, who had fallen victim to his dog's weakness while fighting for leadership, was funny. But the rest? Painful. Someone tried to make the Hipness-Thru-Committee movie and even make it a hipper by making it a computer-animated film, and that was the result. And why do the coyotes of Batman-villain stupid monologuing with their victims rather than just eating? Yeah, yeah. No blood in this movie for kids, already focused on fake alcohol consumption, destructive behavior and potty humor. A fuzzy thing-in-a-box? What exactly was that? Porcupine? Tasmanian devil? What, except for a really stupid plot device that will help Otis Cow win a mother of all battles? Barnyard is a bomb. And I didn't even have to mention udder.
