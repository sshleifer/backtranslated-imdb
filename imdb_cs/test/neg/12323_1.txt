From acting, directing, screenwriting and art, this film is totally ill-conceived and money would be better used for shoes for land mines. When we got so sad that they have to fill in a film for children with a sexual hint to keep their parents' attention. Dr. <br /> <br /> "a fake erection scene etc etc. etc. It's shameful as they trade in the name of Suess to get parents to their children, throw blasphemy to try for teens and a couple of sad parents who won't watch aa movie with their baby if not T & A. greed of greed and more greed. <br /> <br /> Compare it to classic movies for kids and we can get into a disturbing view of the world. got> 400 votes as perfect 10 is behind me (if his family of directors)
