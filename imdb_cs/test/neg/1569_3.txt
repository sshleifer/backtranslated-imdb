George & Mildred - The film lacks the talents of its television writer John Mortimer, who will bring a narrow fourth cut and a move of George's war with the Fourmiles alive. The land is carved out of a standard spun-hit material, and has as little tension as it laughs. Producers were to take a letter from Rising Damp, (also 1980) which was also bought to the big screen after the television series demise, and held much of the story in a familiar environment. Yootha Joyce died in 1980 but should not be remembered for this crackling piece of work that was burdened by being her illness. Mildred lacks the sharpness of her television incarnation; Cutting aside and drying looks pretty much focused on Georges lack of libido. George's mistrust is also lost in larger files. That doesn't mean they could scream a lot about them. The budget for these films looks marginal; The restaurant they go to is clearly the new semi-starched house with the Christmas lights that decorate the front door. For fans of British comedy 70 years or for those who want to return to an old TV companion from youth, this movie can't add anything to the experience and should stick to the first four TV series on DVD.
