This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I didn't expect high expectations, but once it started, I thought it might be o-k. It was not. Jim Carrey seemed to try, but he spoke all his lines as if he were a devilish cartoon character. Other actors seem to be trying their best, but they're wooden. The story has a good foundation, but the melodramatic lines make him stupid and stupid. I laughed during the second half of the film and after five minutes I got tired of it. Most plot 'twists' can be seen from a few miles away. It's just not worth watching. I really wish I didn't have time with that.
