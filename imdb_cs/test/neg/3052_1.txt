I've ever seen the worst movie ever! 90 Minutes of unbearable filmmaking. All the ingredients make this movie the real work of CRAP. Poor play, bad direction, bad narration, bad makeup, bad dialogue, bad effects and bad thoughts about certain actions the characters have taken. It also threw into a terrible naked shot of silly blondes, and boobs shot of silly Asian girls, and both attempts were just scary because these girls are ugly. Several good horror movies came out of the 1980s, but it could never be considered one of them. Kevin Tenney also committed one of the greatest sins in the narrative: he introduced the characters at the end of the film (old man and old woman). I would vote for her under 1 out of 10, but the voting system seems not to work like that. Right from the order of titles, I knew it would suck, and I'd return my DVD, but Best Buy doesn't return DVDs or consumer products as they call it, or so my income says. I have "The Dunwich Horror" and it was really terrible, but I still feel that "Demon Night" (Evil Dead RIP-OFF) was much worse than "Dunwich Horror". This is just like "Howling", how in hell the sequel could come from this anorexic cow ??? Save your money and get the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (just don't understand any of its sequels) or "The Evil Dead" or "Dawn of the Dead". "Demon Night" is a very, very, very bad investment. Every second it was just crazy, unbearable pain for the audience, because the whole movie was terrible everywhere! Do yourself a favor, DO NOT SEE! You will store some brain cells.
