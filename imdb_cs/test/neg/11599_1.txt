Good things first: I agree with another viewer who said Gene Raymond has an amazing drunken scene. She does - I was tickled to finally get a chance to laugh. And there were other moments when I found amusing - Raymond's parents in the bathroom with a faulty plumbing and a scene in a restaurant with Robert Montgomery who tried to make Carole Lombard jealous of playing a sweet note in a stranger. But overall, I was horrified. I love Carol Lombard and most of Hitchcock. And I understand the limitations on Hays Code production. But it was awkward and horrible to watch. Of course I knew they would end up together, that's a romantic comedy. But it didn't make sense, it happened too quickly. Moreover, I cannot believe in the professions of love when confronted with such vulnerable behavior, physical and confrontational.
