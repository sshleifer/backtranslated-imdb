This is a terrible excuse for the show. People say its funny and intelligence? I don't see how? Maybe because characters use fancy words? Perhaps because they are snoots, they use dry humor and have 2 dimensional personalities. I went to the Ivy League school and nobody was anywhere near as uncomfortable as these characters. In fact, I met someone like me, I would probably strangle them! Men behave like little emotional girls of preschool age and all signs of a minority are based on stereotypes ... Characters are NOT ALL AUTHENTIC. Simply put, it sounds like a family of trailers trying to be rich and sophisticated. This show is just another cookie-cutter hit that brain dead main time viewers eat regularly.
