This is perhaps the only worst movie I've ever seen - it has no good features at all. <br /> <br /> It looked like it was done in about 20 minutes, while the second time is filled with title graphics. /> <br /> The leading male has turned from the door of death to superman - what are you <br /> <br /> In addition to being completely predictable and uninteresting at all. I left the cinema feeling cheating. <br /> <br /> Needless to say, I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
