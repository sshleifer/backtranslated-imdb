Oh my God! Book II is rather a bad remake of the original than continuing it.It's not all funny, its plot playing too much <br /> <br /> as a rejection of the comedy pilot's situation, and using the slogan "Think of God" is another variation on the idea which worked much better in the original. John Denver did not return to this movie and made a BIG difference. George Burns, like <br /> <br /> fabulous as he played God, doesn't have the same chemistry with a little girl he did with John Denver. <br /> <br /> I would give this movie a rating of 3 out of 10, but only for <br /> <Br /> George Burns, the rest of the cast is nothing special. <br /> <br /> If you loved first, don't bother to see him.
