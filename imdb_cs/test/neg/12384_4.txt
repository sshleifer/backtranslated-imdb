Mitch MacAfee (Jeff Morrow) sees the UFO while testing the plane - but nothing appears on the radar. Then the planes and ships begin to disappear and report a UFO increase. It turns out to be a giant monster that attacks and kills. But what is it and why is it here? <br /> <br /> It has all the right elements for classics. He has a really fun script - I've never really been bored. Acting is good (for a fifties monster movie). Morrow did not exaggerate the act of the hero Macha and Mara Corday is quite good because of the desired female love interest. She is also strong and cares for herself - even if food and coffee are turned off for everyone during the movie. The problem here is a monster. Dear God - It's TERRIBLE! It looks like disheveled turkey! She has a long neck, a brightly stupid BEAK, several teeth, a pair of hair on her head and claws. And - oh yes - it collapses! No roaring - jerking! The actors had no idea how it looked - it was added after production. Morrow and Corday were terrified when they finally saw it in the theater. Morrow said his audience laughed and left the theater quickly before the movie was over! Producer Sam Katzman was responsible for that. He wanted to save money and give the world the dumbest monster ever. And you can also see wires that move it too! It gets 4 stars just because Morrow and Corday are so good and the script is fine. It doesn't get any stars for a poor monster - wait until you see that attack, what's of course a toy train! It's worth seeing if you're a horror fan to see what must be the dumbest monster ever.
