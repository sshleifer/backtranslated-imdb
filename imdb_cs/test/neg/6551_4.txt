Another of those poor stories associated with most forgotten music numbers. Powell and O'Keefe as fighting publicists are quite forgotten. But there are two bright moments. Hubert Castle is the most incredible pedal boat you'll ever see - his "drunken walking" on the wire must be the most remarkable piece of balance ever recorded on the film. He must be seen to be believed. The second is Sophie Tucker, who makes a turn near the end of the movie. Her magnetism, her professionalism, her absolute talent in being herself - well, charisma is not taught - you have it or you do not. Great lesson for all potential cabaret artists. Sad note: W.C. The field in his latest film is completely forgotten.
