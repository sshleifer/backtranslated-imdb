This train wreck begins with Brujem and Alma, who cross the Mexican border. Alma suffers from some terrible curse that causes her to vomit the garden snakes and Nickelodeon Gac every few minutes, as well as clenching her teeth and muttering nonsense. Apparently Alma has that uncle in Los Angeles who knows about her medicine. They hop aboard the train to get there and fortunately a friend of theirs pays their way. Alma and Brujo remain in the luggage trolley for the whole movie because they can't afford higher class seats. Meanwhile, in the upper class, we see a lot of people on their way to LA for any reason. A business man's bald guy, two girls, one carrying $ 5 and a pile of cocaine, three stoners, and a few Mexicans. The Mexicans are crushing it with Brima and trying to take his "weed", which is probably a sedative for Alma snakes that crawls in it. They realize that snakes are not attacking, entering their veins with their bodies! Very twisted and B-film. Brujo rescues a guy by tearing his heart (Temple Of Doom style) and snake. For some reason, he can't have snakes damaged or hurt Alma. While this is happening on the narcotics expert tries to bust one of the girls and gets a small action (topless) in exchange for not saying about their drug shipment. A mysterious man appears and has a shootout with him. As a grand finale, Alma turns into a vampire, bites her man, and then becomes a huge pathetic excuse for a train snake CG, eat a train and be thrown into a hurricane in a nuclear bomb and disappear. Everyone then goes to LA on foot. In fact, credits say at the end: "Any resemblance to real persons, live or dead or real events is purely coincidental and very strange. or with an aircraft ‚Äù. Odd, because the line in the bald guy movie is "Yeah, I hate planes!" Credits also say, "There were no snakes injured in the production of this scenario. Just a baby, but it's fine." In fact, there was a LOT of real snakes used in the film, and they are all very tame. In fact, there is no scene of CG snakes that attack someone unless you count the big one, but then it just eats a train and another fake snake is just a head and looks like a muppet. Snakes don't really think anything, they're just ... there. One is crawling out of toilet paper actually! The movie is not funny, not scary (because there is no real snake attack), and it's just a "quick cash" that is when a budget movie company hears about a big Hollywood release, then rush, Make a similar movie, or even a parody version, for release just before or simultaneously with a big name flick. The consequence of this is that many people either focus on one another and go to a quickie rather than a biggie, or want to see both for any reason ... like me. Avoid at any cost.
