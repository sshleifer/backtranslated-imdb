Based on the true story of two young Americans who sold national secrets to the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, "Falcon And The Snowman" wants to be both exciting and philosophical. It's less le Carré than who cares. Timothy Hutton plays as Christopher Boyce, a former seminarian who is disgusted with Watergate and the middle class values ​​around him, is probably a bad person to be hired. a spy satellite company for the CIA. Sean Penn plays his drug friend Daulton Lee, who makes Boyce's courier and delivers secret files to the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City. An unusual synth-jazz score, lack of sympathy or emotional ties for anyone, and lots of scenes of guys who get angry in the rooms will unite to destroy what might have a decent moral thriller dilemma. Penn's film despite the second bill; his character talks with the Russians to Turkey while Hutton plays with his home falcon. Hutton seems to have awakened him for five minutes before calling "action." With Penn, it's crapshoot whether you get a great performance or an over-the-top one. Here's a bit of both, but rather the second, especially in the second half, when Lee moves from coke to heroin. Shouts. He snorts. He encounters the Russian Embassy. She gets on the phone with phone books. He spits on himself in the mirror, the big stupid thing he has to save for the paparazzi. "I don't know who my friends are!" he shouts. It's just exhausting to watch him. Penn seems to be modeling Lee somewhat on Ratso Rizzo from Dustin Hoffman of "Midnight Cowboy", supplemented by exaggerated nasal data and constant eye movement. John Schlesinger directed the film as well as "Midnight Cowboy", but he seems to have in mind another Hoffman movie, "The Graduate", which picked up the scene after Boyce and Lee by the pool trying to decide how to live their life in their gilded cage. Too bad nobody designed plastics. From the initial footage, intelligence records of the US bankruptcy built by Boyce and his dick, "Falcon" makes it clear that this is a movie message, although the message itself is far from clear, probably because that the characters never get attention. Does Boyce Be An Idealist? Or is he just a mercenary? It seems that Hutton and Schlesinger don't know, which makes it difficult for us. Meanwhile, the opportunities to impose some tension, such as Boyce stealing documents from the most secret "Black Vault," where Lee works or plays Russian games, are interrupted by leaps to scenes from couples with their families and friends. It is the normality of a story that Schlesinger considers interesting, but it is the least interesting aspect for us. Good Things: It's interesting to see a film that works in the 1970s as early as this one, referring to Maria Muldaur and Tang. Unforgettable in "Full Metal Jacket", Dorian Harewood has a nice turn as Boyce's paranoid colleague Gene, who shows Boyce how to make margaritas with a shredder, but has some serious problems that are under his party exterior. Macon McCalman is also fine in a totally different way to being a nonsensical boss who gives Boyce a high level of security. As a representative of the Russian Embassy, ​​who deals with Lee, David Suchet is a fascinating blend of threats and friendships. But "Falcon And The Snowman" stands or falls on the question of two title characters and neither actors nor Schlesinger are able to crush many answers. Worse, after more than two hours in their alternately wild and catatonic society, you really don't want answers. You just want these credits to roll.
