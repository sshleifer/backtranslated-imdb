This is a film about a black man who bought an airline and turned the company into an African-centric company over a top-of-the-line airliner. They even display owners not only as control of the airline, but also control of the air terminal at the airport. One day this guy wins $ 100 million and the next time you see him, he walks around the airport as the airport owner. Everyone calls this movie parody, but nothing about this movie screams parody! This movie is a flop and will be forever at $ 4.95 bin on Wal-Mart. I can't even figure out why MGM would waste $ 16 million on this movie. Nor does this movie guarantee direct video status. Writers (one black and one white) should be shut down from Hollywood forever. Not only are they over-stereotyped blacks, they portray them as unconscious human beings. I would be ashamed to go to a movie that constantly humiliates me. Do not waste your time on the video store, wal-mart, pay-per-view or on Sunday afternoon when the movie is displayed on TBS.
