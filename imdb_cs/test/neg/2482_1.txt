Wow ... not in a good way. I can't believe people are digging this waste. Most TV shows are pretty bad, and it's been a running trend - they're getting worse, but Las Vegas will take it home. What a terrible performance ... <br /> <br /> Actors are a lot of defeated C + players who never went anywhere else (except James Caan ... who knows what he thought when he signed up for this position) ) so it's not their fault that this show sucks. They just can't help it. Guilt of producers and writers. I can't believe they shot it and were really proud of their work to broadcast it.
