Rebecca De Mornay can be a fascinating beautiful actress, but as far as the parts she has to play, if you can't say something nice ... De Mornay portrays a woman who had terrible trauma as a baby father barely stands now when she grew up and became a great brilliant scene. She has an affair with Banderas, who we suspect is (ouch! How original!) A serial killer. Sometimes she recalls Banderas's mother -in-Tippi Hedren's character in "Marnie." But I wouldn't count: Hitchcock died twenty-four years ago, and many regents desperately try to replace him. Here the director pulls out all the stops to make a thriller with an unexpected end, but the end is so appealing that it is absolutely impossible to buy it. The film includes compulsory "serial killer talks" in the tradition of "lamb silence", murders (human beings and cats), split personality, and an open end in the event of crowds should call for more. Apparently not, and were right.
