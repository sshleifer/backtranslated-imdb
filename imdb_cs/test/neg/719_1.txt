I have read all of Shakespeare's plays, I have seen most of them, and even acted and directed. I do not necessarily believe that Shakespeare must be done in "traditional" fashion, but I hated this film. It is nudity that is unreasonable and unnecessary. There is a grotesque that is far beyond what I believe, Shakespeare intended. Some of the dialogues are incomprehensible, and there are elements such as singing and dancing that will make no sense to the film, but they replace Shakespeare with the director's individual pleasures. I'm sorry to say I was wasting perfectly good money to buy a DVD of this movie.
