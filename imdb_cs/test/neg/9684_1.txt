How insulting! Those who liked this movie probably never opened the Bible. I can imagine those on NBC saying, "OK. Let's make a movie to calm those annoying Christians, but they never know the difference if we don't have anything substantive or in the right chronological order." Well, they were wrong. Anyone associated with this cruelty must find the Church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous cruelty. I gave this movie just 1 because I couldn't give it 0.
