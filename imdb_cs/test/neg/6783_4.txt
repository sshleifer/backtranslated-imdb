I watched this film with a group of friends at the 1999 Melbourne International Film Festival and no one had a good word for it. I liked Bluegrass and Country Music, so it's not as if I'm unsympathetic to the subject. But the problem is that in the heart of it is a very conservative film - a little more than a movie shot by Mills and Boon. Spider-ripper the simplest-minded and soppy species. It's not just that a love story in his heart that between Reece and Dr. Lily Penleric is more than tad incredible. (Why would every man be attracted to a nostril-burning man who engulfs Lily, is behind me, and frankly, Mike Harding as Reece seems to be in the process of moving). It's just that the whole movie is too tame and well-behaved for its own good. There's a rare little danger, dirt or drama. Sure, there's a moment of "excitement" involving a school run by Lily's younger sister, but this whole episode is more fun than it is dramatic (it's just so badly written and bred). And the film will betray its conservative agenda in the way that this subplot is resolved. As for the good old Reece Kinkaid (now, what's wrong with a name like Eberneezer Bumpass?) I ask you! Is the end of this movie believable? Adapting to the character this movie has created before? I think not...
