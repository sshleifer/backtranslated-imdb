In a quiet city, a few girls witness the murder of one of their friends by a strange young man named Milo who lives on the other side of the city. After the murder, his body is in the river and his spoken dead. Sixteen years later, weddings attract girls back to their childhood, and Claire, a school teacher, is obsessed with Milo not having died because she has repeated visions about him, and her friends die one by one and no one believes her when Milo is out it. So now, she sets out to find the horrible truth. When I came across this movie, I was quite skeptical, especially when it had "From the Anaconda Makers" on the front cover, but reading the weird little outline of the contour on the back of the video case, it sounded fine and rather refreshing for change. Well, guess what? I thought it was a good idea at the time, but it was a completely different story while watching the movie. He seemed to be very clever and very psychologically based, but the second element did not do well and was essentially a prolonged and largely unconvincing thriller. Hey, I admit he had his moments, but hardly enough to make it either effective or unforgettable. But bravo for the creator, at least the story is not rehash those slasher imitators who followed "Scream" and the shock of horror, is there no confident humor evident? in fact, there is no hint of humor. Maybe it was too serious? Especially since the plot is rather absurd, but it's not his main problem. What is a discontinuous conspiracy we have received, I did not know what was going on, as it seemed to be jumping a lot in favor of some supposedly shocking and disturbing sequences. No! More like irrelevant scenes and yawning clich√©s that we see from time to time. You can also see some influences from some "good" 70s horror movies, one is "Don't Look Now". This is when our main character still sees the character of his past in a snatch. The second would have to be one of my favorite "Alice, Sweet Alice" with a person who is having trouble with the yellow stub and committing terrible deaths. An interesting idea, but it is quite shallow and too many mistakes. I liked it more when the scenes dealt with childhood childhood because the performances and circumstances had something horrifying about it, but when they leaned back on their tired and unwavering majority and their performances weren't terrible, but incredibly mundane a good way to put it. Most of the dialogue let me disbelieve in how clever and inept it was. You will shout "no rainbow!" on the screen because you just can't believe what you hear. Police Detective is on! <br /> <br /> Good Wise - The movie is not bad, actually it's better than your usual direct video I would say. Very slippery stuff. With some imaginative and prominent camera angles and a weak score that works reasonably well. Another factor that excelled and was the key to building a moody atmosphere was the creeping sound effects and the fact that the bell leaves a ring in the ears. Setting up a quiet primary school was well done and the rest of the event takes place in the house. But don't expect any real tension or surprise because their realization doesn't exist. Deaths are not pleasant and are slightly bloody, and it is rather a consequence of what happens to those bodies that are trying to disrupt you. The thief in this work, the slightly spirited baby Milo Jeeder, was slightly upsetting, well that the voice and the yellow spot begin with a print, but it seems to lose its effect when we come to the conclusion of the movies. The cheesy line marks on the video compare him (move) Jason, (watch out) Freddy and Chucky (not a children's game), but you gotta be kidding! Right? It's called "New Face of Evil", yeah. All it needs is to learn some ways and solve problems. Overall, the movie just left me with a sour taste of how I could do it without seeing it. I guess I wanted me to do it. <br /> <br /> Don't expect too much in this movie blur. Or even skip it, because you won't miss it too much.
