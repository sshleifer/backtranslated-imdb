I am really in a loss as someone could give this movie 10 (or even more than 2!). It's full of bad lines, bad acting, bad slapstick, etc. I never thought I'd see worse acting than intentionally badly performing scenes at the start of UHF, but that was it. And just when you think it can't be worse, it does! Again and again! Did you actually see it in the theater? It's not worth it on TV! My 4-year-old and 1-year-old liked some, but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on.
