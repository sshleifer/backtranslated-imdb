Since Roger Corman added his name to this production, I had great hopes for this film. Corman has directed many unforgettable horror movies in the 1960s. I was especially pleased with his adaptations of Poe's stories, such as The House Of Usher and The The Pit and Pendulum, and The Raven, which played late Big Vincent Price. These films had solid acting, atmosphere, tension, strong characterization, interesting plot development, and brought some chilling moments. The "House of the Damned", for the most part, sacrifices these qualities instead of the special low budget effects, gratuitous nudity, and soulless gore that have clung to a cliché of quick adjustments and camera angles. <br /> <br /> `The House From The Damned 'starts interestingly with some beautiful shots in Ireland, but it's downhill from here. Unfortunately, instead of spending some time building the atmosphere, creating characters to care for, or building tension - the director chooses to start running into the body. After a brief introduction to the leading characters, the young couple and their daughter, the audience spends the balance of the film, which is reflected from one "spooky" event to another, which in this film replaces the coherent development of the plot. Leading characters are so poorly conceived and behave poorly - viewers don't care what happens to them. To make matters worse, the "spooky" events are either completely cliché or unconvincing due to low technological special effects. The soundtrack was canceled from "The Omen". The conspiracy that is few is hard to borrow from "Poltergeist" and "The Legend of Hell House" but lacks any of the qualities that have convinced them. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good haunted house flicks, I suggest you take a look at the classics like "The Haunting (1963)", "The Innocents (1961), or check out Corman's early American international films and go through House Of The Damned if you are not masochistic or mindless. <br /> <br /> 3 <br of 10.
