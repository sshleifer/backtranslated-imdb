I've always had this morbid curiosity about notoriously bad and unpopular movies. I've also always enjoyed such bad movies that you're looking at someone who liked recent cheeses filled with guys like Catwoman and Thunderbirds (2004). So I watched it and it turned out that all critics are right. It's a MAJOR flop, but unlike a lot of flops it is neither pleasant at any level, nor just to make fun of it. It's just one boring cringe-fest after another until the end. <br /> <br /> I was warned. I didn't listen. I am a fool. Don't be crazy, don't waste your time and money on this pile of garbage.
