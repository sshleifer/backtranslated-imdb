I can't get through this horrible thing that the movie was. My eyes want to jump out of my head and my ears are gushing blood from a terrible terrible soundtrack of one song. There are four children and a dog running away from the hospital and then getting rid of the theft of two cars and a bus. Nobody gives them any punishment or anything to repair them. Acting is so horrible that it sounds like an instructional video for the social studies class. I can't think of one thing I like about this movie. Nothing. Even the kid who loses his dog forced me to vomit. He gets his dog back without seeing the dog run out of the door. Maybe the dog tried to escape from this movie. Then there is some horse manure in the mixture. This film was followed by torture. At the end, the eldest boy will say something like staying together is not a crime and everyone will walk around and love him. Gas theft is a crime. The theft of two cars and a bus is a crime and should go to a juvenile hall or something. Avoid this movie at all costs and especially if you want to keep your family together.
