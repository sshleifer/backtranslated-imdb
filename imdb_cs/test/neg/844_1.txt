Senorita Cruz is wrongly mistaken as a cephalonian Greek girl (there are a lot of attractive good English speaking Greek actresses, so why choose a Spanish lady for one of the leading roles and with an English actor like her father, allegedly a Greek doctor!? and the TV series, the only foreign actor, to my knowledge, who successfully portrayed the river, was Anthony Quinn (as a Macedonian lignite miner Zorba in Zorba Greek, as a plutocratic ship owner in Greek Tycoon, and as a Greek colonel in Navarone weapons. <br /> The film reflects some historical truth, and the people who remember the Italian occupation of the Ionian Islands agree that the Italians were, unlike the Germans who succeeded, not even harsh, but also Mussolini's strength, outlined in the film, were defeated in the Albanian campaign by the Greek army and after The Germans intervened in the Balkans, allowing the Italian militia to occupy certain parts of Greece, so the refusal of the local government to surrender to the Italian forces, rather than the Germans. as stated in the movie, it is quite plausible, although I'm not sure it really happened.
