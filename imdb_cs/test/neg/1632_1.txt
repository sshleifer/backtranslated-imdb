Why no one but Ator was playing badly Miles O'Keefe. Surprisingly, I had the bad luck of sitting in Turkey in front of the Mystery Science Theater. I highly recommend to try the MST3K version because it is fun and one of their best episodes ever. The film on his own scene is basically a typical B-type movie that Italian filmmakers spew out in the early 1980s. This movie was apparently made to cash at Conan Madness, but it fails miserably on all counts. Beware of scenes where Ator fights a giant rubber snake and also manages to make a complete hang glider during the cut. <br /> <br /> "Thong, the fish is ready!" <br /> <br /> Rating: Movie itself-1 MST3K version: 10
