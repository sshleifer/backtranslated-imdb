It was a typical female prison film. I thought women were very sexy and the clothes were great. The whole camera focused on women and women were always in provocative poses for the camera and were always incredibly dressed (which I loved). This is your basic 70s jail / breakout movie. All I can say about this movie is that it's extremely cheesy, but women are beautiful and their asses are great!
