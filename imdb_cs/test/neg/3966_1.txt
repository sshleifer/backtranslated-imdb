For those of you who have a few kind words for this movie, I think you didn't see it when it was released as "Parts: The Clonus Horror". It was a very boring movie. He missed the mark at least three ways. It wasn't good enough to be scary; it wasn't bad enough to be funny (though MST3K took care of it); and, even in 1979, the plot was unoriginal. Earlier rivals are "Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler" (1971). It's the same idea (clones as spare parts). The film is fun and has a great casting. Another is "Sleeper" (1973). Yes, Woody Allen's movie. Remember the flattened nose? And "clones" (1973). The last two charts are not as similar to Clonus first, but precede Clonus. They are also a few decades ago, some of the feature books that deal with the idea, though often, the word "clone" is not used.
