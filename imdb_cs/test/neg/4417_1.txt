For me it is a case where you will never understand if you did not live it .. so read to know why I would have such unlimited anger .. <br /> <br /> I heard a lot about (Bruce Lee) .. my father loved him .. my mother who hates any lesser shot of violence loved him! and how he has been talking about his "Big Boss" aka "Fists of Fury" so far, and the experience of watching him in the 1973 Egyptian movies with all the tremendous successes ... next to watching a really good movie about him (Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story - 1993) .. so I found myself crying: where are your Bruce movies?! I went to a video store .. and it was a stupid move .. (you'll know why!) .. and waw .. I found a lot of Bruce Lee movies. Named (Bruce Lee in New Guinea) I did it for myself and watched that one .. OH BOH please forgive your servant. if I knew it was his bad damage! his mythical abomination level !! After that I did not understand what a big buzz about Bruce Lee as a great immortal star ??? .. why would anyone care if he's here or there. I was looking!) She's not so talented and not the genius, and of course she's not that sexy? As long as my father did not see THIS star and he asked me to stop at one of his close shots and after examining his face a little, he told me absolutely "this is not Bruce Lee"! I became too confused to ask: who is this stupid guy? <br /> <br /> It was in 2001 .. 2 years after my first entry into IMDb .. so I immediately came to know her Who is the man ... and I discovered the truth Bruce Lee .. Not my dear friends .. is Bruce Li !!! <br /> <br /> And what a huge .. so big difference !! know who can love that bad clone? Or god forbid .. love his repulsive movies .. I watched 2 of them and couldn't carry the third! <br /> <br /> Then I ignored all our video stores because of its cheap erasing (writing on the posters THIS IS Bruce Lee! ??) .. and I have the original .. The only Bruce Lee who is opr avdu so great star and oh boy, he certainly had the right to immortality.
