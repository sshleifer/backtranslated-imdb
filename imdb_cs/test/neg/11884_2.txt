My wife and I couldn't finish the movie. It really was somewhat painful. First, historical accuracy is not threatened by the events themselves as ridiculous one-dimensional characters. For example, Augustus takes the "burden" of power only with great reluctance. Indeed, he is portrayed as if he were some great humanist and believer in democracy. Second, Camp! My lord, the dialogue is very bad. I remember the soap opera my mother watched when I was a child who had a better dialogue than this. Permanent exposition and pontiff ears like nails on blackboard. Ugh. (Okay, I'm a little exaggerated, but the dialogue is really bad.) HBO Rome is superior to no other reason than its characters were at least believable, regardless of their historicity. Rome was also wise enough to know that they could not build epic battle scenes. The creators of this film do not. When Caesar attacks Mundu, the battle scene is practically farcical. I'll give you that the costumes are absolutely good. The kits are fine, though their CGI backdrops may be a bit uncomfortable at times. The sound is bad, though both in terms of music, foley work and dubbing so many of the side characters. <br /> <br /> By the way, it's totally not worth renting. As the main character, I hoped for an alternative approach to August than Rome in HBO, which I believe could not capture his overall "feeling" as well as Caesar or Antony did. Instead, I should stick to my reading.
