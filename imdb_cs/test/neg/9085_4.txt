During the eighties of the 1980s, when Charles Bronson made nine films, the company only released a non-Cannon Group: "The Evil That Men Do Doo", which is the collection of TriStar Films from ITC Entertainment by Sir Lew Grade. Bronson was already in the lead with his collaboration with director J. Lee Thompson, who went through numerous action actors until "Kinjite: Forbidden Items" went through in 1989. better funded clothing like ITC, but "The Evil That Man Do" is a big disappointment on many levels. While still out of a low budget, B-film form 1980, 'Evil' has the irritating potential for a great movie. But everyone in the production department went easily out and sold a hack job that didn't interfere with Bronson's print. 'The Evil That Men Do' had the concept and technical resources that could be used to create one of the best films of Bronson and Thompson, but instead they go down as one of their averages. This 1984 political thriller / actioner opens brutally with Clement Molloch (Joseph Maher), a British physician who holds his special class for political leaders in Suriname. The gray-haired passive Molloch is an expert in torture methods that employ numerous political regimes. In the first seven minutes, we witness Molloch, who uses electric current to cause the unbearable pain of Jorge Hidalgo (Jorge Humberto Robles), a dissident journalist. As you can expect, the scene is terrible to watch and has been cut out of the original VHS release. Hidalgo was none other than a friend of Holland (Bronson), a pensioner murderer who enjoys life in the Cayman Islands. Holland was approached by journalists years ago to get rid of mankind, but turned this offer down. A Mexican professor named Hector Lomelin (José Ferrera) a visit shortly after Hidalgo's death to talk to Holland about completing his work and bringing footage of The Doctor's testimony. While initially denied, the Netherlands finally agrees to dirty work aimed at Molloch and his spotted sister Claire (Antoinette Bower) in Guatemala. The Netherlands enters Guatemala with the help of Max Ortiz (René Enríquez); he presents as a tourist with Hidalgo Widow Rhiana (Theresa Saldana) and young daughter Sarah (Amanda Nicole Thomas) in a coup. As with most later productions of Bronson, his character collides Molloch's followers one by one, a passing path with a slippery American diplomat (John Glover) and his side hitman (Roger Cudney). The brutal ending takes place in the slits of an opal mine, where the doctor only receives the desert from several of his victims. "The Evil Men Do" is based on a forgotten novel by R. Lance Hill and jumps on American political talks in Latin America during the 1980s. Indeed, "Evil" is hard in every sense of the term because it uses sensations and doses of brutality to cover up the vast weaknesses in history and character development. For each plus of this film, there are three or four minuses, resulting from forged craft. While 'The Evil That Men Do' has a great concept, the movie is never more than an excuse for Bronson to wipe out foreign dirt. In the style of bad Belgian fiction, 'Evil' is filled with cardboard characters that we never know or understand. The Netherlands, despite the fact that Bronson played him heavily, never talks about his inner feelings or explains what motivated him to become a killer for rent. Rhiana, a terribly weak part for Teresa Saldan, is disgusted by the Netherlands for most of the journey, but later she feels affection for him. Where does her love come from, especially after watching Holland kill several people and just want to return home a few scenes? The most interesting characters are actually Molloch and his sister Claire because so many questions can be asked. Naturally, we never find out what brought them so close together, how and where their torture began, what is Claire's exact role in their business? These plot holes can go forever, especially with the painting-by-numbers story that seems to matter as it goes along. Why is Hidalgo's daughter brought into such a dangerous situation than Molloch can comfortably capture her? If Molloch's bodyguard Randolph (Raymond St. Jacques) clearly saw Holland and Rhian in the battlefield arena, why is he so friendly with them in the afterwords bar? Is his memory so short? And what was the goal, besides cheap theatria, of throwing Molloch's chauffeur Cillero (Jorge Luke) out of the window ledge when the murder could be more discriminated in Claire's apartment? The overall performance is decent and somehow Bronson is one of his strongest performances. J. Lee Thompson's direction is missing in points, but may be threatened by limited time on site. In addition to shooting Evil in Mexico, the presence of ITC is clear thanks to better production values, cinematography and music. Rural locations are well used to convey the hot and dusty atmosphere of Latin America, and cameraman Xavier Cruz provides rich colors and clarity. Orchestral Score Ken Thorne ('Murphy's War') is refreshing in the era of synthesized waste. Surprisingly, these positives only add to the frustration of a good movie that screams to come out. Peter Lee Thompson's cut is better than usual, though with more miscible continuity errors. 'The Evil Than Men Do' was the perfect material for the grindhouse in the early 1980s and it is difficult for me to recommend 21st century fans. The Columbia TriStar Entertainment DVD is a good presentation that offers a widescreen and standard format with four-language subtitles. While video quality is considerably above average, 'Evil' was originally recorded in plain mono sound. The theater trailer is offered and actually has a grindhouse feel, with eroded color and fuzzy sound quality. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
