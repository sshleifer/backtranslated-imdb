"Garden State" is another of these "indie" -type images that allegedly save on production values ​​in order to give the viewer real true to life human drama. Surprisingly, the production is very good, as is the performance (and some quite large actors). Where the image is missing is in the screenplay by Zach Braff, who seems to be mostly excluded from the situations taken from other films. <br /> <br /> When you are as young as Braff, you don't really have enough life to experience as a film feed. Braff's experience seems to be from watching movies, then repeating the same trite cliché in his own movie. At Garden State, he plays Andrew Largeman, a semi-successful Hollywood actor who returns to his hometown of New Jersey to bury his mother who took her own life after suffering in a wheelchair for many years. He seems to have nothing about it; he has no relationship with his father, who accuses him of causing a mother's paralysis in a terrifying accident as a six-year-old, and has no particular despair of losing his mother (in fact, he participates in a party right after the funeral he was invited by his friend who works as a graveyard graveyard, all this is a big blow to the "beautiful girl", also to the guy who returns to his hometown to "find" and hang up with his old friends, the little "ordinary people" thrown to the side It's really a miracle Braff has ever achieved in his life, given that his father and his useless friends (I'm surprised he didn't kill) who still live their "lives" as if they were still in high school, foolish bimbo party parties, drinking and drugstores, etc. None of them even recognize him from his television role as "retarded quarterback" (Natalie Portman, n The most interesting person in the movie, and says things like "Hey, I remember you since Junior." These guys are such losers, for them watching TV would be a cultural leap forward. Even a friend who invented millions of silent Velcro has no real reason to live because his entire reference frame is high school and party. And you don't need big money for a high school party. Braff, it is revealed, is heavily medicated, holding on to "feeling" and dealing with something, really, as an adult. Then she meets Sam (Natalie Portman), a lost girl who gives pet funerals and lives with her mother as a 10-year-old in a bedroom that looks like a pink doll house blown to life. Anyway, they fall in love and Braff learns to "feel" again. Clichés come quickly and furiously. Braff has a long delayed heart-to-heart talk to his cool, distancing father and tells him what it is and the name of the game. In one scene, Braff and Portman are in a millionaire children's house, playfully touching in front of a huge fireplace, and the piece is so routine, so the standard film-schtick, I swear, half-expected someone to go up and throw the sled into the fire. In another, Braff visits a doctor (Ron Liebman) to get his junk refilled, and Liebman tells him (in the easily worst line in the movie) "The body can play tricks on you. I once found my ex-best-friend's cufflinks in My wife's wallet and I haven't had an erection for a year and a half.It is obvious that no licensed physician will ever say it, but it's a crazy poem, a nod from Braff, I think, his wrecked friends to know that he still thinks of them as well as joke "37" in "clerks," Kevin Smith nodded to his friends. By the way, Braff finds real happiness and exits the drug, the story happens predictably, but if you have a movie that's a cliché from wall to wall, at least give him some glamorous show to breathe some life in. And Braff does it.It has the right kind of vacancies, occasional acceptance to make his role as zonked-out Andrew as real and annoying, and Natalie Portman (also beautiful girls) gives the film a big lift. With its tiny features and flashing signs mood only robs the image as his companion. Jean Smart is surprisingly good as Portman's mother, and Peter Saarsgard (though much better in "broken glass") is notable as a friend of the gravedigger. I would like to recommend "Garden State" if you can't get enough novel novels from movies, but when people start saying it as a masterpiece, they're just clueless. Braff thinks you can have the same old tired conspiracy, write in a few "f ** pieces" and "awesomes" and slap on an acoustic rock soundtrack and this contemporates the material. No.
