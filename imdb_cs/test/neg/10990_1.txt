I had a different experience with this movie - it never seemed to me, neither incredible nor funny. One big guideline that it wasn't your typical movie was that the label did not say that the language appeared in the film. another was the lack of choices and headlines. <br /> <br /> I found the lack of dialogue uncomfortable, especially when it was accompanied by exaggerated facial expressions, as it was almost always. The wild inconsistent development of the weak conspiracy was mysterious. Were there characters or just vague gestures? there was even a conspiracy? <br /> <br /> In a separate case, I am still prompted to correct the spelling "dialogue" with the suggested replacement "dialogue". Perhaps this film in its entirety, including the part of IMDb, is designed to quarrel or amaze, but I am increasingly irritated than amused.
