Terrible movie, poorly conceived and rude. Anna Heche and Vince Vaughan's talks are worse than those of Perkins and Leigh in their original version, which must be seen. There was no reason to make this image that just highlights how perfect and brilliant Hitchcock was, and how inimitable. There is also a creeping, ubiquitous numbness that is not in the first film. Hitchcock's Psycho was frightening and shocking, but you could really feel for everyone involved, even for the pitiful Norman Bates. There were moments of pathos, irony, and humor that the remake doesn't have. One of the best things about Hitchcock's film was his incredible and intuitive depth and sense of nuance, when to cut off and when to show something, whether to use a close-up or a long shot, whether to make a likeable actor to make him scary, and so on . The remake does not have any of these properties or attempts to do so. It's an idiotic exercise that I'm overwhelmed, even released.
