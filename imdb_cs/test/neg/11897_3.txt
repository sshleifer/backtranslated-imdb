One would think that anyone who embarks on a pioneering clerk 30 years ago would at least try to worship the original with some inspired eyesight, but not. Here we have some kind of biography of one of the most elegant people of the late 20th century, who boasts of itself without any style. It is true that the filmmakers gathered some excellent actors - and gave them a fissile mug of drab gruel with which they could work. Everything in the infrastructure of this film is bad, starting with a screenplay that is another of those big-screen TV condensations, where every other line is a "glorious quote" to the subject, and every other scene is in your introduction to another pivotal character of the subject's life. We get Swoozie Kurtz as a PR maven who promotes Crisp as a state entertainer; Denis O'Hare, as an editor of gay periodicals who hires Crisp as a film reviewer, has become somewhat alienated from him when he seems indifferent to passionate 80s activists and then returns backstage as a compassionate friend of the dying octogenist; Jonathan Tucker (in good shape) as a shy, uncertain painter of gay-themed canvas that is related to Crisp; and finally Cynthia Nixon as a performer and woman-of-Czech Penny Arcade, who, taken by Crisp's personality, offers him a place in her cabaret travel. Nixon is a persuasive and talented artist, but the scenario has no chance of embodying a ground passage from the ground and roof. Crisp spent the last 20 years of his life in a one-room apartment in an old tenement house in the East Village of Manhattan. He famously said he never cleaned because "after a few years dust doesn't get worse," or something like that. But looking at the view of this apartment in this movie you would never get the taste of this dust. He attended a local caf√© on a busy class and was seen every day of the week drinking tea and watching the world move. In this movie we get a restaurant that looks like something on 12th Avenue by the Hudson River. Most of the "streets of New York" scenes have a sterile, unreal look without a sense of the season. The soul of this movie is great John Hurt in the title role. After less than 35 years, he can still understand the nature of this strange Postvardean Englishman and put him in the third millennium. His every line, every gesture is excellent. In later scenarios, he even modulates his voice projection to suit a person whose life falls to death. Crisp wrote shortly before he left this empire that when a person grows very, very old, he has the character of a smelly coat that cannot be removed and longs for death. One feels the feeling in Hurt's performance. So for him and this film itself, it's worth a look.
