When I released this movie, I was in college and I never saw it until last night. Finally, I decided to watch it because I love good dance and because the film has a cultural impact. After seeing the movie, I'm totally confused about how it had some other effect than putting people into sleep. The story is quite absurd when you think about it. Did anyone really buy the idea that this gnarly beer-hunt of old workers and teams could keep their clientele with the high conceptual dances the girls did? Everyone would be faster in Zanzibar than one could say "performance art". Can you imagine the reaction of the real version of this viewer to the bizarre television viewing No Theatrical Dancing she did? Please. It seems to me that it might be possible for a woman who worked in a steel yard to be a dancer - after all, she is physically demanding. But I didn't expect the girl to work in the steel yard. And for a second, I didn't buy myself looking at a real steel yard. Steel works are dangerous. You don't keep your workspace looking like an unsolicited shipyard and wouldn't lose a limb. I love some of those paradise shots, like two welders sitting in large corrugated pipes. What the hell are they doing there? Or when cutting six inches from a rusty steel bar with a cutting torch. She was, of course, on board and was just starting to shuffle things up. But the story of a hole like this can be overlooked if the film is fun or at least stimulating in some way. Flashdance does not offer anything to balance it. Dancing Terrible. It's a spastic style of jerking and poses that destroyed the American musical until ... well are we really over it? The sensuality the film is attempting is destroyed by Jennifer Beal's total lack of personality. I think I'm a 42-year-old man, and when I was to eat lobster, my only reaction was to think she should get a lobster on her bib. Dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow. The dog had more than her. The love relationship is flat. It feels like nothing more than a boss with a hot fire for one of his workers. Zero passion. Even the last scene where he dances for Orville Redenbacher and some other lead graphs is unsatisfactory because the panel reaction is so unbelievable. What serious dancers wouldn't see the eyes of Alex's poor cheerleader? In short, the film had nothing but foot warmers and big sweatshirts. Yeah, yeah, there's a good piece of nudity when Alex "saves" her boyfriend from being a useless erotic dancer (laughs a little hypocrisy). Besides, the movie is a waste of time. I wish the MST3K crew were still in business. That would be good feed for them.
