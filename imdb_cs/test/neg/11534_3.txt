As a Henriksen fan (I liked him in the "Millennium" series) and of course Lorenzo "Renegade" Lamas, I expected at least SOMETHING from this movie. Sadly, the plot is predictable, acting is bad and the computer graphics used for most of the pieces don't work. Sometimes it even seems to have captured some images from Microsoft Flight Simulator. <br /> <br /> The camera also sucks. An unnecessary funky cameraman at the beginning just lightens (out of the cheesy dialogue) and gives the film a cheap, made for video-look. It works in the movies of hip-hop and Jet Li movies, but there's no place in this movie. I like this movie 10 years ago. I was eleven.
