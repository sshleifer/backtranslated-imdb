It was only a matter of time that the spoof would be made of sports movies! And there's a lot of movies you can notice. But the biggest problem I had was the fact that he was still with film recognition. The director and writers "The Comebacks" somehow forgot about creativity. Although I must admit that I laughed at certain scenes, "Comebacks" could have been so much fun. The actors forgot to deliver their lines seriously and have a straight face throughout the film. Spoof requires this and that is the main reason why silly jokes work in movies like this. Because the cast fails so jokes never hit their mark. Some scenes have forever and usually spoofs that may not be a problem. Take for example "Naked Gun". There is always something on the screen that is happening. The "Comebacks" didn't even bother to let things happen in the background. Just a few factors make this movie worth watching! It's still fun to watch movies that are fun. And Jermaine Williams as Ipod. His parody of Cuba Gooding Jr. He seemed to be the only one in the cast to get an idea of ​​what the spoof was about. It's not completely wrong!
