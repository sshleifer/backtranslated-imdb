I am very interested in animal kids and have read many Edger Rice Burroughs novels - but I could not be interested in this horrible film, nor could I take all the absurd, unrealistic scenes. I only managed to sit in the African part and John's first days in Scotland. Let's talk about "unreality" and "downright dumb"! Actors in monkey suits looked more like big chimps than big apes (there is a difference). They did not move with the grace the wild animal would have. (For comparison, see some of the better ape Planet movies where they trained their actors to move in the opposite mode). The Apes Eat a Great Meat Specter - Not a common ape practice as far as I know. I'm crazy about animal stories, but the script didn't interest me in monkeys. The great white expedition hunters who discover John Clayton are quite charitable. Clayton's parents have been shipwrecked on the ocean beach, but somehow it's a long way down the river to get to the coast - give me a break! Let's talk about "slow". Even people who think it is an excellent movie admit it's not an action movie. Far from it. He is trying to be a sign study - unfortunately the stupid part prevails! I haven't read Burroughs' Tarzan books, but many of his other series have been full of sensual action and heroic purpose! This movie just isn't there.
