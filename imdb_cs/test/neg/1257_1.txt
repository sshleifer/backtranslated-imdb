This film is an insult to both poker and film and can become the most dynamic, vibrant and fascinating character in poker history. Another fun movie that makes jokes, from the lame gangster clich√©s of the first half to the incomprehensible nonsense of the second hour. Fortunately, Stu Ungar wins all three World Series titles without playing on the screen. His infamous dealer abuse? 1 scene. His habit of coke? 1 scene. His incredible memory? 0 scenes. They couldn't even get any real poker players. What did they cover? Lots of high angles of shots from inside the house in the suburbs. Oh, and Stu's haircut who wakes up every day and buys meat that doesn't come anywhere near the meaning. Why am I so interested in this little soprano summer camp trying to make money? Because I think Stu Ungar still has a great movie waiting for someone to do it right.
