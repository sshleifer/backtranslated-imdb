(Only light spoilers here) Sinatra Theft is a half-grotesque comedy about dimwits, kidnapped victims, and a few other side stories to eat. Br /> In this film you will see bad performances everywhere. The drama is forced and humor makes no sense. Whether you're watching the kidnappers threaten a victim who won't shut up, or the victim's father who responds to the threat of the death of criminals "Taking care of tea?" This fits comfortably into the "wannabe film" category. You'll also listen to a repetitive goofy musical track throughout the movie. It's pretty unprofessional and doesn't add anything. It is really just a sad attempt to make the extremely rude movie seem somewhat funny. However, if you can look at it all and pause a lot of mistrust, you can have fun matching the story. <br /> <br /> I voted 4/10.
