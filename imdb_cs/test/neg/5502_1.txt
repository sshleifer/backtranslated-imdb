this movie was certainly broken in the studio? Maybe not, but I feel that there are serious shortcomings in the narrative that, if not attributed to the editing process, could only be caused by badly bad, criminal, writing and driving. <br /> <br /> I understand the burton effect that wished to achieve with a stylized action similar to the gothic fairy tale edward scissors, but here, unfortunately, falls and reaches no mythical depths of the tropics, but merely an offensive class of influence. bad behavior and shallow characterization even for fairy tales. Finally, not so scary, really just a little fun in his experiments. the use of the dialogue as a background tool was clumsy and unnecessary. the secret of a headless rider would be enough, he wouldn't need the myth of a German mercenary, although christopher walken took care of a lively figure, but not the more horrible one - seeing the rider's head makes him seemingly more friendly that a nine-year-old tall man who is headless. spirit as well as in the original legend. no real rhythm or universal tone has ever been proven and is not a classic in burtons. stilted and clipping like my farewell shot ...
