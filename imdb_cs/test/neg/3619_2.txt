Snake Island is one of those films that while a person is sitting and watching his amazing level of stupidity, he wants the movie camera to never be invented. The real reason Plan 9 From Outer Space holds the title of Worst Film of All Time is not so much because of how bad it is. It's because it's the funniest bad movie you'll ever see. Snake Island is another kind of bad. Snake Island is so bad that it's unbearable. A silly premise combined with a scenario written by monkeys by tapping a single-purpose transparent foil typewriter, which then overlapped to resemble dialogue, to make the most obvious problems. The spaces in which the film takes place are filmed solely on site in South Africa and are a single element that can be truly considered to be well realized. Many shots involving snakes consist of details of such a surrealistic appearance that one begins to wonder whether said snakes are CGI, puppets, or real snakes who have been fed really hard drugs. William Katt stars, if you can call it, as an author who travels to an island resort for what seems to be a river ferry. Coming with it is an assortment of very general, poorly defined characters. It's just a matter of accidental writing on the screen, who will survive to the end, but Katt certainly seems to be thinking of firing his agent. The rest of the cast seems to be from home and away acting schools, where any contemplation of an unpleasant plot of the point is accompanied by open mouth yawning and spreading one's eyes in every way. Foley effects are often worse, with one memorable scene where a double-shotgun barreled sound rather flat sound effects that used to accompany shots in such games as BioForge. Meanwhile, snakes constantly explode or jump randomly. It would be much more accurate to call the Holocaust Snake movie. Of course, none of Z-grade's horror movies or sci-fi films are finished these days without unnecessary scenes of women who are calm. As every woman in cast, almost, gets her clothes off, the movie starts to be less Snake Island and more Snake Island Orgy. But like all the worst piles, there is really in this case a lot of setups without real rewards. Sex scenes never happen and the death of the characters is so flat, so uninteresting that the whole movie becomes meaningless. If you don't think you're watching William Katt walk through the muggy woods wearing badly falling cricket gear and smashing snakes in all directions with cricket bat. For the record, I don't. Previously I thought Anaconda was the worst movie ever about predatory snakes. I was so very, very badly. At least Anaconda had at least one snake he might fear if they stopped believing for some time. Some of the snakes that have shown that they are killing the human cast are not larger than the laces of the pair of combat boots I have worn. So we have a checklist of horror movies available so far. Unrecognizable, lame cast are charged as well as bad sound and visual effects. The dialogue is so miserable, so badly timed that I have seen better writing and delivery during some of the school games I have been in many months. Unfortunately, where Snake Island has disappeared in this regard, the area is fatal to all the bad movies. Basically, he forgets to be so bad that it's funny. It's so bad that he ceases to be good after the opening credits and becomes a painful second to start talking. Compared to the performance of William Katt in Snake Island, Jon Voight's performance in Anaconda was as Oscar-winning as Russell Crowe in Gladiator. Not that Voight or Katt were necessarily bad actors, but with such material it is natural to say one word naturally. Listening to some of the lines here was like being a victim of violent crime. My mind tends to empty the experience, primarily as a self-defense mechanism. <br /> <br /> Given the abovementioned bad behavior, I gave Snake Island two out of ten. My special score for movies that are so bad they can't be good but not so bad to have fun. It's all just boring or absurd that a person can also follow a test pattern. The correct way to spell "crap" is S-N-A-K-E-I-S-L-A-N-D.
