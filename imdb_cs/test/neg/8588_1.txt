Another humble attempt to create a "brave" and "provocative thinking" movie - what the hell is that. They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - "Television killed football." Oh yeah. This is another movie that shows Oliver Stone's delusions of Grandeur. If Stone tries to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist that this sport with the romantic movements of the cameras and songs of Kid Rock? He even throws Cameron Diaz into a fight for purely aesthetic reasons. It's a pity that Diaz and Pacino have to meet in a movie that's so bad. His characters are nothing but loudspeakers - their voices obscure what would normally be superfluous and banal. He must reappear and show how he can act without shouting. Must stop sorry hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like "organized football is spoiled," and act a good story.
