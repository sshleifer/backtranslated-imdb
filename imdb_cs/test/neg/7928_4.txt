For the film that was most seen in his native South Korea for most of 2004, it was a huge disappointment. It shows that Hollywood is not the only place where people can make too emotional, melodramatic films. The film was more than 130 minutes long, but it didn't really happen and everything that happened was pretty much what you expected. It is true that if somebody was Korean himself, he might get more into it, but he didn't do much for me. Suffice it to say that if it is a case with Korean cinema, it revolves around the relationship between the northern and southern parts of the peninsula. South Korea decides to hire and train an elite prisoner of death to kill Kim Il-Sung. The sudden plot doesn't bother me if the characters are good, but unfortunately it's not about this one this time. They are stereotypes and most acting is average and too often just above the top because it is in Korean film. Too much time is devoted to numerous photomontages and characters remain distant, one-dimensional cardboard cuts. They should have spent more time building up characters and less showing us how hard and cruel training and soldiers are. One thing that reminds us is that the smaller of the two errors is still wrong.
