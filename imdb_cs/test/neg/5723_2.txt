Recap: As Queen Queen Gedren picked up and defeated most of Sonja's family, she trained in the art of fighting the sword. Gedren took a mighty talisman who threatened to destroy the world if he wasn't destroyed, and kills Sonja's sister. Now, Sonja is on revenge and save the world. Along the way, she meets Conan (but not Conan, no!) Kalidor, Prince of Target, and his bodyguard Falcon. Initially, Sonja rejects all help, but is later forced to accept her and go together to save the world. Comments: When you watch a movie like this, and you think it's a story that's the best element in this movie, the movie is in big trouble. Because 1) a movie like this one should draw its power on good swordfights and effects, and 2) the story is really, really bad. It's simple, uncomplicated, and actually doesn't offer anything in character development or even tension. It's a predictable and boring and obvious pair, Sonja and Kalidor, has no chemistry. And the boy is just uncomfortable. And most of the scenes are stretched so long they're bored. Although the film is not too long, it does not have enough material to fill its time. And so back to point 1). Fights are slow, unequal and really bad. This clearly shows that most fighters clearly block rivals' moves far from the opponent who even started a strike. In my sincere opinion, I believe that most of the children struggling with sticks create more exciting battles with knights than this movie. Overall, it's a really bad spin-off that everyone who likes Conan movies should avoid. <br /> <br /> 2/10
