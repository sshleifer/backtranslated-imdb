I don't know how this film received so many positive comments. It can be called "artistic" and "beautifully filmed", but these things do not fill an empty chart that has been filled with sexual allusions. I wish I didn't waste time watching this movie. Rather than being biographical, it was a bad excuse for promoting strange and obscene behavior. It was just another attempt by Hollywood to convince us that this kind of life is normal and OK. From the very beginning, I asked myself what the purpose of this film was, and I continued to watch, hoping that it would change, and was quite disappointed that he had continued the same spirit. I'm so glad I spent the money to see it in the theater!
