I like CKY and Viva La Bam so I couldn't resist when I saw it for £ 1.99 in Gamestation. It's the debut film Bam Magera, written by himself and Brandon Dicimaille, and plays the entire crew of CKY (Ryan Dunn, Raab himself, Rake Yohn, Jenn Rivell, Don Vito, etc.). Brandon is also in charge of the artistic direction - one of the greatest merits of the film - its pretty CKYish in its colorful style - but also shows progress. Basically, Ryan Dunn's (very loose) break with Glauren (followed by Jenn) follows. Vilo (played by Bam, named after Vilo Valo by chance?) And Falcone (Bran) play his best friends, who do a lot of different stunts. It's a bit like CKY movies, but with a linear plot (which is very basic) and bad behavior. His strange, usually super charmatic gangs seem to have life out of them when they know what they intend to say further. Playing and the script is largely scary for the most part. half of the film is much better than the first one (90 minutes is for film though) and there are a number of redeeming factors such as Tony Hawk's portrait, Dicimaille's sub-charts as' Futurstic Invention Awards' and 'The Diamond Bike, the soundtrack is also very strong (it's not ALL CKy and HIM - in fact Bomfunk MC stole the movie in terms of its use of music). In the second half of the film, the sense of fun is much more real - especially since Don Vito has a rather prominent role in the second part - and seems to have stolen every scene he is in. <br /> <br /> The film will appeal to those who like CKY antics, but only because of the basic material and not the fill or story line crap. Oh, and somebody tells Bam that skating mounts, especially in movies, is sooo 1998. <br /> <br /> The best part of the DVD package isn't the movie - but 40 min. 'doc. The last 20 minutes of documentary film deals with Raab's alcholism and the real feelings of the crew in a stunningly impressive way (as usual, Bam comes across as a little penis, especially for Raab's drink problem and Ryan Dunn comes as a really nice person to the ground) ). The last ten minutes of documentary film deals with a friend (who is rarely a member of CKY) who is trying to dig heroin while staying in a Mager mansion home - and the caring unity of the gang (espcially Ape and Ryan) really meets - a surprising jewel in otherwise boring DVD. I am very happy for £ 1.99 - though I hope Bam will stay on improvised and short parodies from now on.
