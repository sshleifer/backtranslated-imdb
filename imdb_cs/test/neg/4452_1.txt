This must be one of the biggest Cinema debacles. At that time I wandered around Europe, and I was unlucky to come across a crew that made the film in what was still one of the idyllic, intact places in the world. I was included as an extra and followed by an exhibition of modern daily debauchery. Forget all the allegations you have ever heard about the penetration of Peter Mayall into this precious piece of French life - Geoff Reeve and his cohorts went to the level of respect in the restaurant at Les Beaux, which left Maitre'd untied. They were simply, terrible, uncultured and undeserved French hospitality.
