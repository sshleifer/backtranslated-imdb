I was a fan of AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON and was so curious whether it would be possible 16 years later to continue with the French language and local repertoire, side and side characters. Tonight I watched the "edited for FOX Network" version, which was a curious hybrid of several hyperactive sequels. The screenplay and directors pay homage to some of the key conspiracy concepts: A tourist gets a wolf mouth, a full moon comes out, a boy meets a girl, a boy becomes a beast, a boy dies a heroic death after helping a ghost victim. For me, the strangest aspect of this "pattern" of teen horror is a special effect ride casting a school teacher-love interest in the television comedy "ED" as one of the clueless victims of a werewolf who is more or less completely unsympathetic to the written lines they have given her. I haven't seen another horror-movie that this movie is "fake" (a vampire fighting with the name BLADE), but I think parts of his plotline must explain how werewolves were villains (they are spoofish) threatening a "good" few werewolves during a long part of the movie. There is also a final conflict in Paris metro train, la SPEED. This 1997 studio product is a special hybrid of the film, as the considerable technical effects are shown for scary purposes, but in my opinion the authentic horrors of the original have been completely destroyed. Such a special rewrite of a werewolf legend and "film mythology"! My suggestion for those who take this into account in the video store - instead take the classic "top of line" Thriller instead: Alfred Hitchcock PSYCHO!
