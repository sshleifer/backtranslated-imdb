At the heart of almost every really big criminal thriller is a carefully considered, methodically planned super-crime that 9 times out of 10 is committed by a lot of likable, gray moral cheaters who have no life. a fair for which the return to man, well, something worth cheering for. The screenplay of the first screenwriter James V. Simpson for Armored gets this half of the right. He did extra-double-confident that we have nothing but compassion for the recently orphaned, Iraq war veteran Ty Hackett (Stomp Yard Columbus Short), who is about to have his house removed by a bad bank (brother, I 've been there). And he gave Ty a good family friend at Mike (Matt Dillon), who is super nice and gets him a job at an armored car company he works with at Baines (Lawrence Fishbourne) and some special French dude (Jean Reno). These guys like to have fun and play pranks, but they're also serious armored cars, so that means they carry guns and are tough. He may start thinking how I did that maybe - maybe - maybe - this will be some amazing, tongue-in-face, corn heist movie with some on-the-nose characterizations that move the story after its natural course, smashing personal bets all involved in the hope of revealing a really, really smart plan with lots of potential 'holy sh * t' moments. I think the music itself is a textbook of heist-film - bold, nervous beats overtime as we heal on close-up characters who say things like "I really do it," and "Are you crazy ??" 45 minutes or so, the film had some serious genre-flick potential. Then things start to stink. These guys, these idiots, have no plan. There is no "Ok, here's what we're going to do ..." scene, no plans, no explosives, no black van or ski masks (through their "trial run" as seen on the trailer). No, these guys will steal $ 42 million of their own trucks (which are only tracked by HOURLY through the radio, even though they are equipped with some fantastic, large-screen GPS) and they won't even sit and discuss it. Hell, Mike just tells you about the plan tonight, which is absolutely ridiculous. But of course, You have your house to think so long as Mike promises that "no one will be hurt," is on board. Guess what. Someone's hurt. Why? Given that, in addition to driving trucks to an abandoned factory to hide money, they have no plan. That was it. That's how they made it up. So, of course, things begin to crumble. These cats deserve everything they get for being so unprepared. This script, frankly, feels like the product of some bad improvised game: "Armored Car, robbed by its own guards ... GO!" "Despite some decent growth that might make a movie in a few interesting ways, the story is going to fall apart and pretty soon, nothing makes sense, or it is even remotely credible. When filmmakers don't have a cold" hook " For their robbery, their characters seem stupid and bungling, and when characters are stupid and shocking, it is hard for the audience to invest in them and their story, and when that happens, any tension releases the bottom of the film, leaving a laugh, hollow skin. <br /> <br /> Skip 3/10
