There's nothing wrong with softcore, but this is quite clinical - a lot of nudity, but it's all fake (of course it's always fake - it's a movie, but you know what I mean). There is no sexuality or eroticism, it's all random nudity and bad behavior "lust" and sex with each other. Of course your personal preference is included. These women obviously have some body problems with their piercings, tattoos and silicon - not to mention that too plastique & leather look, so if it's your thing - great, you get to see it all here. I don I think looking at a movie title like this, but for many people, the expectation of someone is very high, it would be almost like looking at cyborg fembots ... almost they seem real, but it's really scary.
