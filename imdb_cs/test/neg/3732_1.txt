J.J. Jameson (from Spiderman 2) Quote ... Crap, Crap, ... <br /> <br /> Mega-Crap Pretends to be a homage (not / intentional) to Coen's brothers ... done wrong. Br /> <br /> There is no real plot to conspire. Diaz's performance is completely unnoticed. Strange characters don't really work. There are many "duh" moments. <br /> <br /> I like black comedy, but this movie isn't fun. <br /> <br /> In my opinion it wasn't In this genre there are many movies that are much more fun. <br /> <br /> I hope this review will help you.
