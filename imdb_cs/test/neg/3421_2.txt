This film illustrates as no other state of the Australian film industry and everything that holds it back. Amazing talent, excellent performances (especially Victoria Hill), but basically virtually every other way. "Adaptation" of the kind, it brought nothing new to Macbeth (no, the setting is in today's Australia is not enough), and basically, completely failed to justify its existence, except (let's face, completely unnecessarily) pay tribute original part. If there's one piece of work that has been done (and done and done and done), it's Shakespeare. So any adaptation, if it is not to be a confident and meaningless exercise, must bring at least a new interpretation to work. And that's what Macbeth can't do. As it was done, this film has no current relevance. It's the same piece we've seen countless (too many!) Times earlier. Except weapons and in various outfits. In addition to the basic blunder (no other way to express it) to maintain the original Shakespeare dialogue, one of the most beautiful moments of the film is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion of the shoot towards the end, during which I completely tuned, as I looked at the screen. I never thought I had a brief attention, but you go there. <br /> <br /> I assume the film will succeed in its own very limited terms. But as Australia continues to produce world-class gaming talent, its filmmakers have to cease to be proud of having succeeded in limited deadlines, and in fact set enough standards to prove they respect the kind of gaming talent they work with. /> <br /> Damage. Absolute shame.
