Obviously, this movie goes straight to DVD. I didn't expect much, but this movie is so unreal that it's incredible. The only part of the movie you can actually find remotely is before they reach the island, where Eddie's son is fired from the bathroom with a stream of water and then it is! Why do they even bother? The first Christmas holiday with Chevy Chase was brilliant and cheerful. It is not. They rely on jokes about dog with bloating, and the character called Uncle Nick, who is about 80 and still trying to get his way with beautiful women. Approaching the island on the ship, the island in the background looks so fake, and while Randy Quaid is funny in the previous movie, he just looks overly and seems to be too funny. You were warned!
