In terms of budget 2.5m CAD is not much when you look at animatronics, puppetry in this movie, which itself is the reason for 9 weeks to shoot. I was really glad to see this movie and I was hoping to catch it when it came out. My main problem is that it's just not funny, it's better than Tenacious D, which doesn't have the body of a funny bone. But this was a really unsatisfactory movie. Trevor Matthews is a very powerful physical player, but his performance! Rachel Skarsten gives what is perhaps one of the most exciting and no funny performances I've ever seen. The only really big star in this is David Scott, who is artwork for the monsters' fab! His special work is the main reason why this film is worth watching, loved cycling and Troll and prof. Monster was right from Henson Library. Biggest waste of time, but if you're looking at this for the great Romp horror comedy ... Don't bother.
