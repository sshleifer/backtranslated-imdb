This movie was so bad that he looked like a home movie. In one scene, the camera moves very slowly and gradually down and then moves back to the scene. The sound is cracked and occasionally melts again. In another scene, the cameraman is only visible in the mirror. Then came the scene with instructions on how to build a tent ... which, believe me, continued for ages and was completely irrelevant to the land. Most of the scenes were dragged with conversations that were not entirely relevant. In my opinion, it was just filling the movie and making it longer. Even with these scenes it was very short. The only good thing about it was a separate head that looked pretty realistic.
