That's all I can say about this movie. It's DBZ ... like the Tree of the Might and the Strongest in the world, it's really ... it doesn't fit into the show timeline at all, even though it's supposedly placed just before the TV show starts. The event is pretty nice. The plot has a pretty good base, with a good background, why these guys hate themselves and everyone. Quite well, here ... The problem is ... there's a lot of weird stuff. Really weird things. Like the strongest in the world, there is really a really strange song that could only be created in a drug-induced haze ... worrying is the fact that Gohan, while singing, is pretty much into himself. Ghostly. Demons are strange and rather comical ... moreso than the usual type of DBZ - it looks more like a Dragon Ball movie than Dragon Ball Z. Generally, its fun enough, but ... just ... weird.
