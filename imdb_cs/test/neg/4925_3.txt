This show demonstrates the depths to which a UK television pre-waterhed drama sank. With these boring scripts, mediocre acting, bad graphs, horrible dialogue, one is forced to watch a DVD from any old ER episode to see an excellent hospital drama. It seems that none of the actors employed at this show are able to really act! <br /> <br /> If you want quality low-quality soap opera TV, it's a show for you. I personally like something with more meat on the bone. Unfortunately, as with all UK licensors, I finance this leap.
