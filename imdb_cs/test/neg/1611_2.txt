Braided in the Universe (1972) MST3K Version - Very not a good television movie pilot, for never being made a series in which an astronaut finds itself trapped on Earth's evil twin. Having a planet of the same size and weight circulating in the same plane as the earth, but on the opposite side of the sun, is well worn by SF Chestnut - the idea is more than 2000 years that have been invented by the ancient Greeks. In this version Counter World is operated as an Orwellian "perfect" company. Where, for inexplicable reasons, everyone speaks English and drives late models of American cars. After escaping from his prison hospital, a disturbing Earth man is being chased around a Southern California television and a bad movie that is a permanent Cameron Mitchell who, like his minions, wears double-busted suits and a black polo shirt - a stylishly bad combination I intend to take. If I had become a totalitarian ruler. Our hero escapes several times before he ends up looking at the three months of a foreign world and thinks out loud if he ever gets home - setting up one of those who are alone in the hostile world. Each episode shows such a popular industry in the 1970s and 1980s ('The Fugitive', 'The Incredible Hulk', 'The Littlest Hobo', etc.). Somewhere between 'Stranded in Space' first broadcast (under the title 'Alien') in the 1972 and MST3K version in 1991 it somehow gained some shots from the 1983 film 'Prisoners of the Lost Universe'. So in 1991, the initial credits for 'Stranded in Space' ran under several shots of three people falling into the mass transmitter and disappearing. It's a sequence that has nothing to do - even thematically - with something to follow. To add to the nerdy B film confusion, one of the actors in this nailed movie, Kay Lenz, later appeared in a 1994 movie called "Trapped in Space". Knowing that this fact could never save a life, but it might score you very big points and admire the views from a fellow trash film enthusiast - if you could ever develop a way to maneuver the conversation around to the point where you could accidentally slip in without looking like a total idiot ...
