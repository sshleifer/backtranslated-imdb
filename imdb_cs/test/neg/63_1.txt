We brought this movie as a joke to a friend, and could be our worst joke to play. The film is barely observable and acting is terrible. The worst child actor he ever used, and Hasslehoff, who performed poor performance. The plot is shameful, and in places where we were so boring we were wondering what the hell was going on. He's trying to be terribly out of place, but he's just laughing. Just awful
