After reading the reviews, I decided to rent a DVD version. <br /> <br /> I like classical music and wanted to learn more about Bach. <br /> <br /> I was disappointed. I think I don't know enough about Bach's music and the comments were not enough to understand the importance or the music that was being played. Perhaps it would be appropriate to lead a Bach music expert who can explain the film. I really tried and saw the whole movie as I jumped at being able to enjoy some of them, but I didn't. <br /> <br /> See at your own risk.
