Enjoy introductory credits. They are the best at this second-rate but inhospitable killer time featuring passionate performances like Eric Roberts and Martin Kove. The main part, however, goes to the newcomer Tommy Lee Thomas, who looks a bit small for this kind of action, but sometimes he manages to turn a crazy cock. We see him for the first time that he is a bare-chest, sweaty and involved in this favorite activity of "beef" - chopping wood. He then has seven other shirts without a shirt, including one in which he is hung by his wrist and is powered by la Gibson Gibson in "Lethal Weapon". However, he could use a better scenario because the way he reveals the truth about corruption and violence inside prison is never too convincing. We are also talking about millions of dollars that are obviously associated with this investigation, but which are never explained. However, there are several pluses. Posting "John Woodrow" secret as "John Wilson" is a fun presidential game, and co-star Jody (Ross) Nolan shows promise as an inmate who, at the beginning of the procedure, is shown hanged by his wrist and get punched by a stout guard. One last note: the low budget of the film is painfully responsible for the lack of "extras". Despite the impressive size of the prison, it seems to hold about 12 prisoners! (Note: the credits at the end are not very helpful. For the record, the hefty, bald guard who uses Jody Nolan as a punching bag, plays Bill Fishback, and the young, blonde guard who manages Tommy Lee Thomas' electric shocks plays Marc Chenail.)
