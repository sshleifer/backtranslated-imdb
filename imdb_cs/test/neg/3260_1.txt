Watch this movie ..... just to really appreciate how good the original is. I'm not very sorry, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It hurt me deeply because I like Chevy Chase, Jackie Mason and Dyan Cannon. Writing was just awful! I thought Chevy would have at least something better than him. Almost nothing was allowed to laugh in this film. I went into it and wanted to enjoy it. I wanted to laugh, but I almost cried. <br /> <br /> At the beginning he read the special look of Chevy Chase. That worried me from the beginning. Chevy is actually more than I thought it would be. It's more than just a "special look". Too bad the look wasn't special. Mason's character would be a good secondary character, but he grew old. I'd rather see more (much more) Dyan Cannon. At least her character was fun, if not well written. I also missed a gratuatis teen sex scene. Mr. Gopher went from being cute and innocent to the poisonous rodent who deserved to be fired up. Jonathan Silverman is the only character that has caught my attention and we haven't seen him enough. <br /> <br /> I'll take it back. Try to look at half of this movie, then ... remember Alamo, Maine and CaddyShack I.
