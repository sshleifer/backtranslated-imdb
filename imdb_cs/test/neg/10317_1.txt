My first warning should be that this DVD was on sale for $ 5.00. But because it was Sandra Bullock, which I generally like, I bought it. My disappointment with the film began almost immediately. Dialogs are slow and stiff. The color is distorted. I kept adjusting the volume to hear the conversations. Acting is amateur. Even the killing scenes are a failure. Twice the dead people moved their feet. When my daughter, with a lack of money, offered me a dollar to shut down the movie, I immediately and gladly complied. This is an amazingly bad movie. Tomorrow I put this dvd away in the company of white elephants Christmas party.
