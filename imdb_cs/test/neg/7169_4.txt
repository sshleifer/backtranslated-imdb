George Burns returns as Joshing Almighty after enjoying great success with "Oh, God!" In 1977, a fantastic fantasy that was successful in the sudden needs of the 1970s to move from the devil-driven thrillers to comedic redemption (though it made money), the original was more in line with the "Topper" of the 1930s return to a sense of good religious film). Here, God looks at a young girl (Louanne, who had previously played in "Annie") and asks her to expand her Divine Word, which only causes her trouble from adults in the process. A strange, family-oriented film seems to be warm-enough enough, and Burns gets to ring with nice fire wry jibes, but writing is half-slapstick and half-solemnity, with an adult piece considering giving little Louanne \ t which implies that God appears to be a conspirator than an older friend. Another problem is Louanne: an energetic little-eyed boy, untrained for screening, and sometimes seems embarrassing. Medium-budget production has a delicate, TV movie look, with some elegant details. The last scene mimics the culmination of the first "Oh, God!" It brings a sad mood to the mix, which is welcome. It's the finest moment in the movie. ** of ****
