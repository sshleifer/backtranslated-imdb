This is perhaps the worst gangster genre that has destroyed the British film industry since Mockney Guy Ritchie unleashed Lock Lock and two poorly controlled barrels. This Story of "Real Life" by Carlton Leach (which?) Has everything that is wrong with this genre, a really horrible typeface that consists of people who shouted "Cant", "Fahcking Cant" and "I Kill Ya, Ya Fahcking cant "ad nauseum. Acting is uniformly horrible, with the two most famous members being two former soap stars that are visibly visible from their depth. For some reason, the film assumes that we have heard of these people, and I can assure you that someone in the north of Essex does not have, and that we should be interested in a low-life story. Why? This is not Goodfellas despite the concerns on the DVD cover. The story takes place around a football hooligan who has become a gangster. Boo hoo. The fact that these people are totally unsympathetic is the only minor plus for this film. In all the action scenes, the camera seems to have been tied to a piece of string and turned while people pretending to fight, and the story of someone most people have never heard of, and nothing really interesting is a complete waste of time. People talk about how violent a movie is, as if it were a big movie sign, and even though they have many great violence movies, it's just an excuse for FX men to show what they can do. Overall, this film is a reminder of why the British film industry is extinct and the sooner we stop funding these pathetic abortions, the better.
