There are no - no redeeming qualities to this movie. They didn't check one thing - NO ONE ... nothing. I'm sorry for Larry Miller, and I'm even more sorry for his agent that he can't find him a better place. The adults are all idiotic. The effects are raw and have no sense of reality. Music is frankly cheesy. The plot is beyond faith. <br /> <br /> I want to see something good with my family, see something else. Take your time and look at the mold in your attic. My ten-year-old is taunted by this movie when we watch him. Unfortunately, they learn that not every film is worth watching.
