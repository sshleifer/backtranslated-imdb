36/100. This should not be confused with decent Arachnophobia, this film is a very low budget and cheap rip-off of this movie. This one is so bad it actually has some fun value at this level. There are numerous unintended (I think) laughing loud scenes. I didn't expect much from the movie and it was actually worse than I imagined it would be. It is a clich√© that is reflected and predictable directly to the video. Fortunately, he doesn't take it too seriously. Negotiations, as expected, are not entirely Oscar-winning. Special effects are bad, worse than I would think. Poorly adjusted and the score is distracting.
