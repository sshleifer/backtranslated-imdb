Macbeth is one of the most frequently narrated stories in the cinema and has been translated many times into many theater and celluloid environments. Originally written by William Shakespeare in the early 1600's, Macbeth tells the story of betrayal between royalty and one man's quest for power. Director Geoffrey Wright (Romper Stomper) tries to update Macbeth by placing him in the current underworld of Melbourne. The film, where characters replace swords for weapons (ala Baz Luhrman's Romeo and Juliet) and royal vassals for gangsters, Macbeth is a brave, violent but critically flawed film. Macbeth (Sam Worthington) works for King Duncan (Gary Sweet). After being king (as prophesied by Macbeth's three witches), promoted to Thane of Glamis, Macbeth began to gaze at the throne. One night the king comes to Macbeth's house, and Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hill) speaks to him to kill the King to take power. Macbeth kills his master and then takes over his crown. But success has the disadvantage that Macbeth soon discovers when he has to go into nasty lengths to protect his murderous secret. OK, first things first. The main mistake of the movie is Sam Worthington. His depiction of Macbeth is in the word ... boring. I honestly didn't care about Macbeth while watching the movie. I had more sympathy with Lady Macbeth because she bothered to act at least. Worthington sits through the whole movie sad and wood. I felt like he was making the best impression of Johnny Deep George Jung's character from Blow ... but without charisma. I've never seen Worthington in a movie before, so I'm not sure if it was his or his director's fault, but the glue, which should tie everything together into one cohesive unit, is weak. Dialogue is good, but when it coincides with the Australian gangster motif of Geoffrey Wright, it seems to be a little on the spot. Frentically stimulated action sequences mixed with long Shaksper reflections create a movie of stimulation. I understand it's Macbeth and that the director wanted to use the original dialogue intact. But hard, fast action scenes after three minutes of soliloquy tend to be annoying, if not a bit spectacular. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is highly stylized and largely works well. One thing I found uncomfortable was how the camera was slowly and constantly approaching. I don't mind the footage as if it was exaggerated. It's beyond being cool and stylish and instead becomes irritating. Other than that, art and cinema is pretty well-done. <br /> <br /> For all the good qualities Macbeth has; style direction, Shakespeare's dialogue, strong soundtrack, supernatural naked witches (weird sisters) and good relief brutal, bloody violence. All these strengths are forgotten when we consider Sam Worthington's uninspired image of Macbeth. Macbeth's role was necessary to tie everything together, and in this respect Geoffrey Wright and Sam Worthington failed miserably, so Macbeth forgot Shakespeare.
