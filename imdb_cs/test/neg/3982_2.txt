This movie had an interesting plot about clones and organ usage, but it fails because the main actor is so annoying and whining that you want to kill him. Not that there was anyone else in it, but when you hate a character who should be nice, the movie just doesn't work. It's pretty funny, it looks like a movie is coming up in the near future that has this storyline that reflects this one with more action and better casting, though I won't be able to think of anything but this movie when I was supposed to watch . This movie has a super stupid clone that is somehow clever to find that something is wrong with its camp, where people ride a mile an hour and struggle for no reason. The counselors tell them that when they are ready, they go to America, but our "hero" has doubts, so snoops and teaches the terrible truth that sends him away from the bad guys who shoot and hit the guy repeatedly. He goes to watch out for the man he was cloned from. Peter Graves is in, and so is Dick Seargent, but they don't add anything to this movie that looks like something that was made for television. On the plus side, when "The Island" comes out, the filmmakers can proudly say "we thought it first".
