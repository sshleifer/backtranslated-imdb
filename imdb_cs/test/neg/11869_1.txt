OK, wrong. This movie wasn't just bad, it was very bad, with line4s like "if you deal with the devil you expect to get on your shoes" you know your ugly movie territory. After watching this movie, I wanted to kill myself and my whole family, giving me such a huge sense of confidence that I wanted to do murder. don't watch this movie. I'll kill again. but when I do it, it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock taken for hiring action sequences and bad shirts. Fortunately, there's a flipside, his first action movie with a three-door Ford Sierra. unfortunately, ends garbage on its roof: (<br /> <br /> Ps: Worse than shooter
