This is a really horrible movie. Jokes are few and far and stimulation is the right endurance test. The only thing that is amusing from this production is the comparison with the classic film "It's a Spinal Tap". <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie as if it were one of the wounds of the Bible itself. /> <br />
