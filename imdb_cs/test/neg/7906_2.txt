"Soul Plane" is a terrible comedy attempt to reach people with thick skulls, bloody eyes and furry pawns. The storyline is not only disjointed, but also non-existent, acting is mostly sub-par with a gang of highly moronic and terrible characters thrown to the wrong, jokes are often spotted miles ahead and almost never even a little fun. This film lacks any structure and is full of racial stereotypes that seemed old even in the fifties, the only thing that really went is some pretty ladies, but really, if you want, you can rent something from the Adult menu. OK? <br /> <br /> I barely see anything I recommend you because you will probably have a much better and more productive time chasing rats with a hammer or inventing waterproof tea bags or whatever. <br /> <br /> 2 / 10
