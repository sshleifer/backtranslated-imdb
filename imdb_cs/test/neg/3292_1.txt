How is it possible that this is happening? Not Seinfeld, Arrested Development, Office, etc. Etc. Will this old-fashioned indecent crap not kill? Apparently not ... <br /> <br /> I'm actually quite a fan of Michael Rappaport, and I enjoyed his various portraits and supporting roles (Copland, Friends), but he's angry at this, but everyone would fight that scenario. <br /> <br /> My wife is enjoying it. But it's Brazilian. And if you've ever seen a typical Brazilian sit-com, you'd understand why it would be so fun. the next 3 or 4 land development / lines would be while observing it for a while and was the right almost word for the word! I felt very smug. This upset my wife as she hates it when I do (she can understand why, but I felt good, so screw-it!)
