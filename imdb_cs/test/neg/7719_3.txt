I can't get over how lazy the director is with this movie. Instead of creating scenes in a creative way, he relies on boring old zombie clich√©s. Where two unarmed executives have to get down the stairs from college to the van, they are surrounded by zombies, but neither of the leaders is bitten. He can't bother to direct a decent battle scene, so we can see them step down the stairs. Sometimes zombies limp and others run like winds. This is really beneficial for the director because he can create anything he likes without bothering the continuity of zombie behavior. This film could be much better with careful planning and much more inspiration.
