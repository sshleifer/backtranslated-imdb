This is rip-off already crappy Hollywood movies like Scream and I know what you did last summer. The story is classic, some high school pupils try to joke about asthmatic class failure, but something goes wrong. Terribly wrong. When you watch a movie, you know what happens before it happens all the time, it's not good when the movie tries to be scary. The actors are pretty fine and the girls are cute (after all, they're Asian), so I'll give him two out of five on mojave'o'meter.
