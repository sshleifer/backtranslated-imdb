This is one of the rarities of movies where instead of a bowl of popcorn he should watch with a bottle of vodka. To be absolutely honest, we are a group of people who really know the man, Mo Ogrodnik, and decided to go silently on this film. close-ups and breasts. The collaboration of Mo and Wolfgang revealed the passion of two actresses, plastic peers, who hold passion. There is also a bug banging. How would Violet say, "This (plastic peen) goes up the ass". Rats and other rat rats are amazing. <br /> <br /> Good. So if you're still reading, let's explain who we are. Mo Ogrodnik teaches at NYU and we are a group of her students who have decided to finish her classroom and decided to watch the directorial debut. She also wrote Uptown Girls. I can't tell you how much it was pushed into the skulls. So this movie is quite an experience. At the very end of this post will be the drinking game we created for this movie. About 13 minutes into this game none of us have seen directly. The very amount of Dido in the first thirty minutes created enough reason to drink to calm the elephant. There was something secretly gratifying when we saw two underage girls who appeared on the look of Kurt Cobain with absolutely no context except his mysterious scene in the store. where he was oh-so-naturally reading the local newspaper. Because we all do it. Heart-shaped glasses were beautifully a derivative of Lolita. And something about this provocative scene of a naked bearded boy proposes the director's history of homosexual pornographic experiments. We wish we had fun. Enough intellectual meditation. ON DRINK GAME! This will ensure that the viewing experience is positive. It's very simple and very likely to send at least one member of your party for immediate care. Mo Ogrodnik / Ripe Drinking Game: 1. Drink every time you see something related to pornography. 2. Every time the author's name Mo Ogrodnik appears, drink. 3. Sex. 4. (plastic peen) require two drinks. 5. Whenever someone points a weapon to another character, drink. - At this point you will probably have to refill / pee pee any remaining sobriety from your body. The unused girl hula-hoop requires one drink per second. 8. The unreasonable use of a "magical black man" requires one drink. 9. If you can't come to the line, KEEP DRINKING, Beyotch. 10. Whenever you are able to predict the line, take a drink. Trust us. It's easy. <br /> <br /> That's all, the internet! Keep drinking and try not to tear. <br /> <br /> -Hawaiian Smirnoff Punch, Jr.
