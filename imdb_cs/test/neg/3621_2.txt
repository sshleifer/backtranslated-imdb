Essentially, Zoey 101 is a girl named Zoey who, in her first year, takes boarding school for girls in which she integrates girls. The brutal plot is, I think, a good idea. Although this show was intended for children, a five-year-old could probably point out his fatal shortcomings. First, Zoey is a clich√©, it's super popular, super attractive, super smart and there's nothing wrong with it; No girl is like that. Looks like the show was focused on Jamie Lynn Spears and increased her fame. Dana, who appeared at the beginning of the first season, is simply plain. In my opinion, however, it was probably the most realistic character of all, which is sad to see that Dana is never pretty. Nicole is too spicy and acts like a complete airhead, but mysteriously gets straight. Lola seems to be able to deceive her acting skills she deserves Emmy. Quinn is supposed to be super clever, and while she is able to create the most realistic things, she's also strange and never gets any guys, even if she's beautiful and smart, while Zoey, Lola and Nicole get boys and they're all beauty and no personality. Chase and Michael are very similar, and sometimes I get confused. Logan is unrealistically rich and transmits millions like dollars. Nobody is so rich. I also noticed that every character on this show is for Stacy, a girl who doesn't do anything to them, but looks pretty good on them. It's not funny! This means that it only affects young girls to act for absolutely nice people. Finally, the school itself adds frosting to an unrealistic cake by providing students with 5-star amenities such as scenic location, sushi bar, hot lounge with free soda machines, pool and jacuzzi, cinema, and a post for boys and girls to freely go to dorm second sex. In most boarding schools, if a boy went to a girls' yard or vice versa, they would be excluded. In conclusion, Zoey 101 was poorly written and was supposed to spend several years in preparation. process.
