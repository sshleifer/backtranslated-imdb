The film, presented here as a 1980 movie, is not a movie available in the "Something Weird Videos" section of "Scare Films Edition 5". For one thing, the 1980 version is in color. The SWV has an older version (1972) of the film produced in b & w for WLWT Channel 5 in Cincinnati. In any case, this film is notorious. However, unlike most other driver ed movies, this was intended for television broadcasting and viewing by the general public. So the level of bloodshed was a ratchet down. It is still a grim exercise in the exploitation of bloody death for an alleged educational purpose. I live in the Cincinnati area and remember this thing, which is shown every year on graduation on Channel 5. If you are looking for one movie that demonstrates the tone of this unique American film phenomenon, "The Last Prom" is quite typical - morose, hyperbolic, extremely didactic , heavy on the melodrama. Whether it really affected all the teenager's rides at all, there's someone to guess.
