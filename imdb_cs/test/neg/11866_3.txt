Yes, it's your typical direct motion video. And of course they try to change it a bit, but they fail miraculously. Snipes delivers the perfect perfection it always does. Colloca proves you don't need any talent to play in the movie, but only sex appeal. Worst of all, it didn't cover my bad film basics: 1 ?? Cheap looking villains. 2 ??

OK, so I lied, it covers you, but it does.
