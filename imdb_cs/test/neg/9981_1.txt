Who really wants to see it? Disgusting violence, disgusting sex, for so long. I don't want to, but I have always remained true to my philosophy of watching any movie as bad as it can be. That was the hardest one (right after "next Friday"). It's basically just stupid. How do you call it something else? The story of the Roman emperor as an excuse for gore and T&A. Yeah, yeah, "Hey, it's realistic, they were like that." Okay, but why bother us? I don't care if it was like this (and there are lots of scenes where I really doubt it). The point is, why would anyone want to see it? The problem is that there is only one reason why you might like the movie and it would be that you like violence. There is nothing special about it, just cruelty. You can say "Cool!" as you would say in splash-slasher-movie. Horror movies with at least violence can bring you chills and excitement, maybe the characters you care about. But here's all dark, boring and boring. Every character is crazy. "The story of an emperor who cannot deal with his power". What? In the first scene, he runs naked through the woods with his sister! I have no problem saying that we saw a fool for two and a half hours. But maybe you turned to it when you saw Helena Mirren being pregnant and dancing. Or 5 minutes of hardcore scenes some people see as a movie message. Or castration, yeah, that was fun! Real birth scenes as cheerful! People, animals, who cares, let's treat them like toys. I don't care what anyone says, it's not a movie, it's just 2 1/2 hours of blood and sex, humiliating and disgusting. Go watch a porn movie if you want sex or watch a horror flick if you want violence. At least those films don't pretend to be a work of art. And they are shorter. <br /> <br /> [0/10] [6 (1+ - 6)] [0/4]
