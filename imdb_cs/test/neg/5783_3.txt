I am a fan of good, credible action movies. And I'm a huge fan of elite military units like Navy SEALs. Finally, I'm a huge fan of Michael Biehn. Unfortunately, none of those films at that time really knew how to enjoy this movie. I recently gave him another chance when I bought a DVD. Here's a problem with this movie in a quick list: 1. It's a bad mans top weapon, for example, including the SEAL team's virtual music video playing golf with the soundtrack "The Boys Are Back in the City" which closes with Charlie Sheen doing Inane Chase to get his trailed car back. 2. That's just Charlie Sheen when Sheen tried to be famous before he started doing things like Hot Shots. The news I have heard suggests that Sheen was a child on the scene and influenced the role and direction that other actors in the film received. 3. Biehn is the head of the SEAL team, but Sheen rarely listens to him. Any SEAL that shows the lack of discipline Sheen's character does, or who threatened the team, does not do it through BUDS training, let alone get into the team. 4. SEALs are trained on weapons. Yet in one part of the film, SEAL must "find out" how to use a Stinger USA rocket. There are several good scenes in the movie. Attack entry at the start, Bill Paxton as "God", and some shots in what was to be Beirut at the time. Overall, however, this film is defeated.
