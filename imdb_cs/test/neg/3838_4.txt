I thought Choke had the potential, but I thought it might be a much better movie. It had some interesting twists, but some of them seemed useless. When two main characters appeared in the background, some of them seemed horrible. Most of them were a bit unnecessary and didn't help the film at all. It was also not Dennis Hopper's best hour. The main saving of the film's grace for me was Michael Madsen. His performance was excellent. He almost makes Mr. Blonde a nice guy in this movie. All in all, it was observable. Still, I thought some things might be done differently. In my opinion, it would be much better.
