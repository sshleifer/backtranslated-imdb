What a boring movie. While it had funny parts, it was simply plain boring and lengthy (for a 90 minute movie). I believe the cause was a lack of action. When I rented this movie, I expected to see that white blood cells were fighting bad viruses, but no luck. There was more that the virus was thwarted than defeated. The film had a promise, but since I thought it was for young children, it didn't seem to fulfill my potential.
