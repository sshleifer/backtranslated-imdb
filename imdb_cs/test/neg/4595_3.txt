I looked at the unconventional version of this film and, as a person who studied Speck's life and crimes closely, I must say that this film is a flawed but ambitious view of the real story. While capturing the real horror of Speck and the murders, this film makes the following factual mistakes. 1. Speck did not inject drugs at the crime scene as depicted in the film. In fact, it was mainly an alcoholic and a popper pill that rarely took drugs with a syringe. 2. The Asian sister who survived the Speck massacre did not move down the stairs and under the couch in the living room as shown in the movie. That wouldn't be possible. In real life she hid under the bed, while Speck methodically removed 8 victims. 3. The film captures Speck as violent and brutal with women as soon as he meets them. Not true. In fact, Speck was initially calm and gentle, soothing women who didn't hurt them. That's the way he could tie all of them. 4. The real Richard Speck was not a deep thinker who captures the film. FBI Professor Robert Ressler approached Speck in the 1980s and said that Speck not only does not know why he committed murders, but that he was not interested in why he could not shed light on why. Speck was known to be below the average intelligence and not the king of the king who tells this film. If the story wasn't so tragic and scary, the voice would be ridiculous. All in all, Doug Cole's performance is sufficiently threatening and cold-blooded, though I don't think the real Speck was so forward in his violence. He was undoubtedly a very malleable man when he was under influence, but was also known to be a pretty slick man who was able to put people at ease before sacrificing them. Beverly Ann Sotelo's performance as a surviving sister is the best in the movie. She's a very good actress. If you're shocking in all cases, you don't see this movie. It's very graphic and intrusive.
