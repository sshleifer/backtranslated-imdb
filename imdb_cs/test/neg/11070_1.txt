If I could give this apology for movie 0 or negative rating I would. I was stupid enough to choose this DVD in the store, read the blur and I think it sounds pretty good, I spend 10 pounds and buy it. all I got at the end was 10 pounds. Absolutely awful, I don't even know where to start. I have no idea why somebody gave it more than 2 stars because I can't think of one good thing I would say about it. The land is basically 7 people who go to unexplored caves, one of them is a reporter. no one else knows they are there. When they reach the cave, they can't get out and kill the monster one by one. There was no reason for the reporter. One of the characters has several past demons, where his ex-girlfriend drowned in a cave 2 years ago ... it seems to be of no significance or the reason why it is, just an attempt at garbage in a character building I suppose? By the way, the monster turns out to be the guy who wandered into the cave like a normal little child and lived there all his life. For no reason it makes him a superhuman person, able to shine, see in the dark, take bullets, breathe underwater, be in two places at once, and have a mad power (able to move boulders, wear adult men like dead weight, etc.). In the final scene, there are two women who are still alive, waking up naked, just covered in some piece of carpet or something. Then they find a picture of a boy. The monster then bursts in the door, wrapped in a carpet with some animal skull above his head (he says in the director's comment that it was a crow skull if it were the biggest wave I've ever seen) and quite literally goes. "Raaahhh" as a child on Halloween. I watched it with my friend and at that moment he literally laughed. The guy then sees the image of himself as a child and has a memory of him sitting under a tree with his face burned and then getting up and wandering into the cave. This is the extent of the back story, why it cripples people and leaves you feeling a little cheated for the story. The monster then kills one of the women and brutally rapes the other who is terminated. I know the rape scene was designed to be shocking, but as a woman I just felt quite sick and was the thing that affected me the most in the film. He could have killed her and cut it into pieces and ate it and it would be less terrible than the rape scene. <br /> <br /> There are so many things left unanswered at the end. In addition to everything that was minutes when it was black and nothing else, it was uncomfortable and constant ill-considered camera angles, where everything is upside down, and you can't see what's bothering me in one place. I almost turned it off. Absolutely horrible movie. You can also get the money you spent on it and set it on fire, it would be better to spend money, as if a clever person who hung over me said you couldn't watch it when you watched it.
