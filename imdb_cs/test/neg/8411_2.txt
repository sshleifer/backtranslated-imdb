Sam O'Steen, superlative tension film editor, "Rosemary's Baby" of 1968, is a director of Quickie TV-made sequel, in which Rosemary Woodhouse (Patty Duke Astin, in for Mia Farrow) is missed soon - and inexplicably - likely to assist to materialize the more ghoully aspects of this flaccid tale of son's son on Earth. The most interesting is the return of Ruth Gordon to the role of Oscar as Minnie Castevet (with Ray Milland, who was cast by her husband, Roman), but she is not much devoted to her - and equally uncomfortable. . This script is strictly low-renting goods, and must have an embarrassed original author Ira Levin (who went on to write his own sequels). Fairly dark and dull, with poor photography and no tension or terror.
