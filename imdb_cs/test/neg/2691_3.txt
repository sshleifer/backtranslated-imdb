I have to admit that even though I am a Shakespeare fan, I have never really known this game. And I really can't say whether it's a bad adaptation, or whether the game is just a bad choice for a movie. There are some nice bits of business in it, but the execution is very clunky and the plot is obvious. The theme of the game is the character of debt, the use of the financial idea of ​​debt and justice as a metaphor for emotional issues. This is clear when the question of the rings becomes more important than the trade with Shylock, which unfortunately descends into the garden variety of antisemitis, even though Bard's best attempts to save him with some nice monologues. Outside of the dignified turn of Jeremy Irons, I didn't think there was any decent performance in the party. Pacino's Yiddish consists of a mild whine added to the end of each pronouncement, and some of the better Shylock scenes are reduced to variations on the standard "Pacino gets an angry" scene that his fans know and love. But Lynn Collins is absolutely embarrassed, to the point that I think they will be on the screen soon. When it comes to incognito, it is hard to laugh at all the things we don't laugh at. With Joseph Fiennes standing there trying to look sincere and complicated, it is difficult to make destructive comparisons with Gwyneth Paltrow's performance in Shakespeare in Love. The big problem that everything in this film is just a lack of emotional focus. It's really hard to tell whether this film is trying to be a rather serious comedy or a strangely silly drama. Good summer performance would surely rip more material laughter than this dark production. The actors seem embarrassed to be humorous and unsure where to place dramatic and comedic emphasis. This is basically the fault of director Michael Radford, who thinks the material is much harder than I think.
