Visually beautiful with some fine music, this movie otherwise has quite trite-made-for-TV quality. A romance between two characters, which bridges cultural and educational differences, is simply not acceptable. Of course, we knew from the beginning that our heroism that persecuted us was to lighten, win over the locals, and find true love, but that doesn't mean it was a bit uncomfortable that the film had to take the totally anticipated turns. This film had a lot of promises, which made it more shameful that the promise was not realized. Maybe a nice under-blanket for a cool freebie night on cable, but I would definitely not recommend paid rent or purchase. But I'm sure the soundtrack is amazing.
