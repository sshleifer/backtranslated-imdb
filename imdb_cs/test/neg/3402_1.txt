Basically, it was apparently designed as a promotional material for the film created by the same horrible director, which is even worse than this documentary and the worst movie I've ever seen, so avoid it at all costs. > <br /> As for this document, it's fun; fun and obviously misleading! Most of the "historical" shots are most likely just that the historical footage of totally unrelated events, which were unfortunately shortened and embedded in this document, to make it more dramatic than otherwise. There is no doubt that Waverly is quite an interesting place with a lot of its own fascinating history, but the production of documentary films in the place market and related production is unnecessarily unnecessary for lack of better words. And yes, I lived in Kentucky all my life and I visited the place several times. Waverly Hills deserves respect; and this lame document is nothing considerate.
