I'm very disappointed. First, German sync is bad. Maybe in the original version (with subtitles) it would be better, but the film looks like the director saw Luna Papu and Black Cat White Cat and tried to make something. But he failed in every aspect. It is a disparate mixture of a strange incredible story and very childish gags. No atmosphere, no life. Extremely primitive sex-humor. I voted 2 because 1 is the worst, and the second point for "Sybilla" is really cute. Sorry - I like 'Eastern' movies, but this is really useless.
