THANK YOU GOD, You're painful here, positively painful. The title is, in a sense, apt if it is aimed at a large studio audience paid to laugh, as if watching the second coming of Marx's brothers. And believe me, they're paid. As creatively infertile, as the entertainment industry has become, I refuse to believe that NBC brass really has faith in this Turkey. I think THANK YOU GOD ARE HERE is what all of you get, who didn't look or didn't appreciate the STUDIO 60, which had previously dipped into the Monday night peacock network lineup. You want to turn your nose into caviar, okay. Here are some beautiful Alpo right from the Foods menu for you to get started.
