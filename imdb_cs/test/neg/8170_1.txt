This film really shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society. What he is trying to show is just ONE side of the story. The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children, which this film does not show. "Indian parents" are guilty of the following: Destroying the individuality of children by being totally dependent on their parents at a very early age. Such children grow up in adulthood only in physical appearance, but they remain children in mind. Since they were all provided by their great Indian parents, children do not automatically feel the need to work hard on something or learn the basics of human communication with other people, except parents. B. I can show you so many Indian parents trying to prevent children from chatting with them, going out, or preventing them from doing anything that makes them grow into adults. The reason they do it is the same selfishness. Indian parents "expect" children to take care of them when they get older. They will make no savings for themselves and as soon as they reach the age of 50 ... They shout LOUD ..... We've grown old, so we're dependent on you because we've done a great service that brings you to this world and care for you and the mental weakness. Most 50-year-old Indian parents have dilapidated body and health and are financially completely insecure. Most of them feel they don't have to take care of themselves, because they "expect" them to take care of them. In the West it repeats itself. People are starting to retire at the age of 20 and are funded as soon as they retire. Indian parents of NICs of this kind of NIC because I said they brought the kids in the world and what better to invest on it ?. I'm a victim of my Indian parents (I'm sure there are countless other Indian children like me) who have grown physically but are still struggling with their lives at THEIR OWN and still have annoying 50 years old who are still loudly calling for HELP. This movie shows just one side of the story ..... UTTER JUNK
