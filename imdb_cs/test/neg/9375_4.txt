First, I must admit that I have never been a big fan of the Dutch film genre. Unfortunately, the observation of De Dominee has not changed me. It shares some common shortcomings, such as a plot that is too predictable and linear for my taste. Worse, however, the cast has its dialogues as if they were actors in the game. Unfortunately, this is also common in many Dutch films, and at least it is impossible for me to feel any kind of involvement in the main characters. The actor who plays Adri (I'm sorry, I forgot his name at the moment) is at least bringing a decent performance and is one of the reasons I don't rate this movie any worse. Another reason is the fact that at least they seem to have had some budget, and production professional. Ironically, the fact that acting is often overly formulated may not be so much of a problem if you don't speak Dutch, even though I have already warned you that the plot is not spectacular, but at least it may be acceptable movie watch.
