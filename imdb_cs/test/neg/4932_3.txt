I hate weapons and I've never murdered anyone, but when half the events taking place in the "shuttle" happen to you or loved ones, and you find a weapon, SHOT YOUR ATTACK. SHOT. FIVE TIMES. Whether the pulse stops on them and increases you. I think God would say, "Good call." In the very 'Hostel' type of movie, but more realistic ?? How can it really happen to anyone, well, if you're a beautiful young woman, is that? "Shuttle" was a decent movie, though on the long side. Some good shocks (always call AAA just to change the tire), basically just one surprise, but for the most part you can see the things that come. And besides the typical "tie him up" instead of the aforementioned shooting, the most unpleasant part was the revelation toward closing from one best friend to another. Getting around those, it's nice for what it is. Basically, we have two unsuspecting females traveling alone from a Mexican home (wow, that's the original) and one of them lost his luggage, which prevented them from leaving the airport until late. And, on the apparent foreboding scene of sign language, it enters "too good-to-be-true" half-price driving. The Clich√©d, who had previously introduced themselves to the shuttle to join what seems to be a double piece of Alan Ruck of "Speed". From here it is obvious what is happening (I mentioned that it was 'Hostel' knock off), but I still couldn't find it too terrible, but nothing spectacular. Although it would serve audiences better with about 15-20 minutes out, I would recommend if you have nearly 2 hours to kill and horror sick.
