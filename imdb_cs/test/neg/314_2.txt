Jack-O (1995) was a really bad movie, we speak snoozefest x 100, no fun value at all, no budget, no gore, Z-grade actors, etc. Etc. They weren't done !!! The only reason I bought this movie was that I knew Linnea Quigley was in it, and certainly she had her obligatory naked shower scene, which is a beautiful yes. But as for the movie itself. ...... I fell asleep in a 40-minute stage and I had no desire to finish it, it's just bigtime lame OK. I love horror movies, I am a passionate fan, a MASSIVE fan, I love low budget horrors, I love it all, but I hated the garbage so I think it will tell you everything you need to know about " O". I give this movie 2/10, "2" is for 2 minutes Linnea scene showers, the movie itself is total ZERO !!!!
