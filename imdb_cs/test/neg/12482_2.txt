This is just awful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this wood. I think it's supposed to be a comedy, but I don't remember laughing, except for a few blatant irregularities and totally blatant mistakes. An uninteresting middle-aged man named Lester meets rich, unattractive middle-aged women through lonely ads for the heart, and then murders them for the money they need to feed their gambling addiction. That's the plot, and that's really happening. There is an attempt at intrigue along the way when Lester starts to receive phone calls from a mysterious stranger who mocks him for knowing about his secret, but so badly done that you may not realize what's going on. The sequences in which Lester kills rich widows are all brutal, but also seemingly dressed as comedies. One succession has one woman who is grinded by a wooden stick and then pushed into the oven. It is very cruelly described, but it plays against the crazy bigband waltz music. The next scene has the victim murdered, while constantly singing piercing opera songs ... you have to see it to believe it! Actually - you don't have to see it at all, in fact I recommend avoiding this flop. It seems that Fulci does not know which hat he is wearing, and that in his earlier career there is no evidence that it is manifest. One succession proved to be particularly miserable: a revelation when Lester suddenly realizes that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to come up with a visual representation of this phenomenon on the screen, so from this point on, he just films actors as normal, shadow and all !! And so the whole angle blows. Either he had a zero-effect budget, or he just didn't care to make it up. Whatever it was, it should give you a taste of how this whole lame project is. I couldn't even understand most of the movie, and there was definitely nothing on the screen worth looking at half the time. Even the end was as flat as the pancake. A real fool.
