This movie doesn't even deserve 1/10 This movie was a scam. I swear that at least 30 minutes of the movie was copied from Carnosaur 1, 2 and 3. The whole movie "Raptor" was based on the movie and it was really a pathetic attempt to be "Thriller, Action Packed, Dinosaur" copy . I loved that movie series and seeing it be put on a movie that can't even afford or willing COPY to do without there own models is what America is coming to. I recommend seeing the movie Carnosaur FIRST (all of them) then Watch it and you'll know what I mean. Spencer
