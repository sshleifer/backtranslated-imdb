There was nothing distantly funny about this movie. It makes fun of various sports movies and clich√©s, but nothing about it is remotely funny. Most of the films that parody do not fit in the film and are just theirs, so they can be in it. The Non Main Actor was well cast in that, but that's really the only good thing about this movie. Also, various portraits in it were cool to see, but I have no idea why they would waste their time in this piece of garbage. Thank goodness I spent only $ 4 on it because it's not worth spending money. Watch if you have absolutely nothing to do or just want to waste an hour and 30 minutes.
