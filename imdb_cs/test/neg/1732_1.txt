It was funny, because the whole thing was so unrealistic, I think, come on, like a pop star showed up at a public college and fell in love with a girl who's obsessed with him? Come on, guys! Everyone, except the main girl, was terrible to play with. The dialogue was cheesy, the assumption was stupid, and the camera work was wrong. I felt I was watching a badly shot home video. I feel like I have almost two hours left of my life that I will never return. I have nothing to say except to throw myself into the face several times rather than watch this movie again.
