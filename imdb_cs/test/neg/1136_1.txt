God bless Randy Quaid ... his exploratory cousin Eddie stole the show in the holiday and Christmas holidays. Even made a scary Vegas holiday at least worth a look. <br /> <br /> I'll say you're trying hard on this for TV sequel, but that scenario is so NON funny that the movie never gets anywhere. Quaid and the rest of the returning veterinarians (including the original Audrey, Dana Barron) are lost here. Even Eric Idle of European Holidays can't save this show in a short portrait ....
