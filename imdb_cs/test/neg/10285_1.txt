There is a growing trend in the media to defame and mock men. We see it in TV commercials and program charts. Fraudsters are an excellent example, they could find a lot of female fraudsters, but the vast majority of them are men, why? The overriding threat to any government power lies in the male population, it is less likely to be governed by authority and will be more of a physical combat threat. The way to reduce this threat is that people in the media get rid of emotions. Other examples of psychological propaganda are criminal dramas full of self-confident policemen, including aggressive women with big jaws who blame anyone who is wondering how they trample their rights and make these men feel dirt. In Australia, many top male sports stars have recently been arrested for dubious attacks and accusations of drinking, another example of a male-dominated government by arresting its heroes and promoting domination. Fraudsters, in addition to political machinations, are invasions of privacy and violations, and most of these women are attacking men! If it was around, the men would be in jail! If it were a sincere demonstration that they would find women scammers because they usually do not get caught because of their men's lovers being quite happy not to get into any strings attached and get out without swinging the boat. Men's lovers want a man together and want to control and control a man, so just get a man caught.
