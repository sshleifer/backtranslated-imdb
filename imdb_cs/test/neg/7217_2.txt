If I've never seen the first Road House, then I think this movie can get one more star, but then it makes it a 3-star movie. To that I was really surprised by the relatively high ratings she currently has. In fact, I wasn't able to finish this movie because it was painful. Where it went wrong (at least the most obvious way) is that it is largely parallel to the original, even though the original graph is still referring. It doesn't make sense and doesn't work. Also, the performances are weak ... I never felt like I was in a movie, yet I felt like I was watching people behave. Even good actors like Busey don't work, probably because of the script, or maybe because of unpleasant modifications. The strangest thing is that the film feels like a movie from the mid-1990s, yet it is made in 06. I'm not sure why this is happening, but then for some reason it is often repeated. The music, appearance and overall overall feeling reminds me of the movies you saw 10 years ago at Cinemax late at night. The strangest thing of all is that I also expected Ja rule to come at some point ... often reminds me of more current movies with rappers as actors. The most irritating is the love of interest a girl who has a character, looks like a total trance of Lois Lane's character on Smallville, which is also quite annoying. And we must not forget the false sounding "Southern accents" I have heard from Walk the Line. I realize this is a common place in movies, but no accent would work better than trying to sound like you were from this versatile hobby site on TV, where anyone from any southern state (or KY and WV) sounds the same. Certainly, people in the desert cities of AZ sound the same as people in the southeastern states 2,000 miles away. That was thin 10 years ago in movies B, where technology came from. Why do such writers / directors make such decisions? <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: I wouldn't really recommend if you are a Road House fan or if you like good movies. If you haven't seen it, don't damage it first by viewing this version. The original Road House was one of those random classics that people love and still watch. It was an unexpected success like American Graffiti, Dazed and Confused and recently Office Space, Fast and Furious and Napoleon Dynamite. Why did it go wrong !!! ??? They should never do a sequel to Road House other than a high budget version with the right actors / directors. Sure, you can never finish the original (eg Bad News Bears, the longest court, etc.), but at least if you can do it right, it will be presented, as is the case with the examples. But in order to keep the budget low, out of the net, the Road House's own production is criminal.
