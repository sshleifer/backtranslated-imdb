I have rarely seen the work with literature translated so badly on the screen. The hysterical cast of b-movie and sitcom comedy simply make characters look like bad Jewish stereotypes. The worst of all is Melissa Gilbert, whom you hate from the scene and never do any sympathy. Such performances should be recorded and used against actors who want to work again. All in all, a tight, low-budget film made for television that gives films made for television a bad name.
