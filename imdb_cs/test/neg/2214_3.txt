That's just one of the stupidest things I've ever seen. Maybe it's not the worst movie ever, but if you haven't seen that much bad, it could easily create your Top Ten Worst List. Considering what was achieved in 1933 with the original "King Kong", you have to ask yourself why anyone would fall so low to produce this debacle. Taking it one step further and realizing that the quantum leap to Star Wars has reached a new level in science fiction the following year, this offer will make you laugh and cry. Now, let me ask you what a professor (Peter Cushing) might have to bring an umbrella as the main piece of an underground research facility for driving the Earth's core? OK, so it was helpful in repeling a parrot / tyrannosaur (parrotosaurus?) In the early go, but to come. Somehow I don't think Edgar Rice Burrough meant it when he wrote his stories about Pellucidar. He probably didn't mean Caroline Munro or Princess Dia, probably the only redemptive factor in this whole Escape. At least there was one piece of pseudo-scientific explanation that I got kicked out of; I'm always looking for one such movie. That would have to be how the earth's core was indeed the underside of the Earth's crust, explaining that the ethereal pink glow. But try how it could be, the story just couldn't hit me to find anything interesting about Hoojah Sly One or Jubal the Ugly One, much less of those wacky halves of man, half pterodactyl creatures. To paraphrase a good professor - "You can't seize me, I pay attention!"
