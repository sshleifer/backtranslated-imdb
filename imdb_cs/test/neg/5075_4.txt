Bank Robbery / Cop thriller sounds good? Chaos looks good: well framed, good production values, high action robbery concept ... <br /> <br /> But ... <br /> <br /> how to be clever and incredibly, ruthlessly unlikely in "how did we get money" mode and overly complicated in the "who did it and why" section. Besides, Ryan Philippe screaming isn't really serious or scary ... and he's particularly hard or scary to throw a tizzy fit. Frankly, his big explosion is the only really fun scene in the whole movie. He must be thrilled to reject the role of Anakin Skywalker and now he is doing it. they are so ridiculously bad that even he looks uncomfortable when he says that some of the clich√©s must have been needed. Does it seem most quiet? Snipes is actually fine, but another nail in the talented actor's coffin: he needs the role of an actor, not an action hero. Maybe this trade with his taxes will allow him to break this form and the public and critics leave him to vote for sympathy. It would be good if he hadn't been so typical all the time. The lines that these guys talk about when they're not plotting plotting and detective work can be summed up in one word ... .pheeeuuuh. The film feels like twitching and never creates a gel: The first 45 minutes I found it irritating, and the last part was tight. He could have been good, but he just can't redeem the horrible lines, stunning scores, and general level of irritation with levels of assurance. Overall, I hardly missed it: incredibly irritating, and Ryan .... please, please, get rid of the goldworms.
