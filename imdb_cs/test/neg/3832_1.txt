This film was very unsatisfactory and it wasn't even flying for a few moments. More than anything, it was just a stupid flippin. The music was bad and the plot was like the BYU Bowl game? very predictable (avoiding embarrassment by scoring, late gust of touchdowns, rally that falls and leads to loss). Essentially, half-childish / half-naive Will (the film's fetcher) and his religiously confused brother Danny (we'll just call him a Democrat), treat Kirby (the movie's "Sweet Spirit"), the third member of their \ t "boy band," as crap, until the man and father of the movie character (stage manager, Jill) has a conversation with Will and straightens him up. Will's personality changes 180 degrees and he is immediately a mature and confident leader of the band. That would be a cute, maybe funny, 10-minute concert performance, but the fact that the movie is 93 minutes long will really drive the life out of you if you follow it to the end. Moje rada ?? take the money you would normally spend renting this show and either burn it in the fireplace or flush the toilet? more fun with a much shorter time commitment. If you want to watch a better movie of the same genre, do you get Saints and Soldiers? not a comedy, but an infinitely better show (in fact, Kirby has more funny stuff in Saints than he does in SOP).
