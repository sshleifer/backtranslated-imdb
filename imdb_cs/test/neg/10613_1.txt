Young writers, young author, young cast, busload producers, what could go wrong? All. Even lame is a very good description that suggests that three of the four legs worked when none of them were actually. Hardly enough recycled land for a 48 and a half-minute television hour, gratefully stretched for ninety minutes. The audience spoke back to the screen, the story was so bad. Dirty cops steal drugs off the evidence of the locker. How many thousand times was it on TV? Bad cops frame good cops. How many times? There was no original piece in this whole mix.

A Note to a Cinematographer: Learning for a Professional for a Few Years - You Have Things to Learn.

It's time to get some professional management and start to actually read the scripts before logging in.
