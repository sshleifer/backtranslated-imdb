Well, great costumes and a wonderful feeling for Pre II. But what happened here? Great Actors ... Kristin Scott Thomas, Sean Penn, Anne Bancroft, James Fox, Derek Jacobi ... if you can't get an unforgettable performance from this "A List" list then the problem with this movie has be blamed for the pathetic direction and inadequate scenario. I rented it on DVD after I liked "Angels & Insects" (1995) also directed by Philip Haas. Yipes! I could hardly believe how blunt it was. He just dragged on and on, and no one could save the poor thing. This is not even an interesting-foreign-dudes-and-young-stuff-in-nice-chick movie! <br /> <br /> "Mussolini Tea" Gone Amuck! <br /> <br />
