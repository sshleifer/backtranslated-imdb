I was really looking forward to this movie when I spent a few (fantastic) weeks at a college in Barcelona. The presumption is right at the heart - a confused and disordered young person enters the world of equally confused and disordered young people. However, the director's weak swats on symbolism, philosophy, and social commentary were totally off the mark, leaving us, the audience, a sense of confusion and disorder. Bravo. Maybe if this movie was presented as the European film "American Pie", then I would be able to turn off my brain and go on the road. But right from the bat, the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted roads and the dichotomy of the "inner self" vs. the. "public self" (one's "mother tongue" versus one's "secondary language"). He is also boldly involved in racial / national stereotypes. For an interesting start, eh? <br /> <br /> WRONG. It's as far as possible. These interesting topics hardly mention, except for the ending of the epiplog, which seemed to be the director's way to return to the subject. It reminded me of a meandering speech that goes nowhere, but the speaker says, "So, in the end, I hope you see how it relates to my original idea!" that cynical jab reveals itself in stereotypes. If it is a mockery of using national stereotypes, then why did the director introduce an English-speaking rooster who talked to beer as a cartoon of prejudice? Why did the director portray the American as a Neanderthal (literally banging chest and dispensing monkey in one place), while Europeans tolerated him tolerantly? Why is a British girl who sinks to chase the slurs (calling French people "frogs" and cutting the French language) while everyone else is above it all? The answer is that it is not a deep or thoughtful film. It's just Anglophobe retort to Anglophiles. But in reality, they are no different from the prejudices they are trying to ridicule! Now there's a funny irony to consider. OK, philosophy, art and socio-political commentary aside, I was still very bored with this movie. There is one very funny gag that involves deceiving one of the girls' girls, but except that I barely had fun at all. The only reason I followed it to the end is that I want to clear my French and Spanish. (See, we monolingual Americans can be stupid, but we'll try.)
