I decided to watch this show and give it, but I found it boring, and more importantly boring ..... Dull. There are too many sarcasms and characters are all boring, there is too much to talk about and the character of Lorelai ... just keeps talking on and on and on .... During the second glance he felt like choking characters , joking doesn't work and the whole love and romance thing just ruins what's already bullshit the show .... I can't believe this show has survived around the pilot .... It seems to be a show that forces 'Listen to Your Parent's Rows'. .... <br /> <br /> He was to stay pilot ..... and the pilot himself ...
