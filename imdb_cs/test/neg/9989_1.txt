It is a rare feeling that you will encounter a film so embarrassing that you feel the urge to turn away from the screen. But when you see a noble actor like Sir John Gielgud surrounded by naked, couples, that's what you want to do. Add to that Peter O'Toole as syphilis-ridden emperor Tiberius and Malcolm McDowell hold your finger up the anus of the male victim, and you begin to realize that Caligula is merely in the interest of addicted to ill / inflammatory films. The film maps the life of the notorious Roman Emperor Caligul (McDowell), a highly disturbed individual whose story is told through a series of sexual encounters, decapitation, betrayal, murder, incestuous relationships and lesbian sex scenes. Although Caligula was absolutely crazy in real life, and probably subordinated his basic instincts more often than not, the film is still inexcusable filth. Sex in film is not used as one aspect in a multi-layered story - sex is a story. After a while, all the nudity, hip hip and nipple sucking becomes tedious for complete repetition. Performances are totally undisciplined, especially McDowell, who throws cautiously on the wind and gives a performance that's all wild eyes. O'Toole seems to be working on the contempt scenario he deserves (surely it's purely for money?!). It is said that other pornographic scenes have been added without the director's permission during post-production, but in fact there is no one minute of dignity or well done in Caligula. It is doubtful that this amount of time, talent and money will sometimes be thrown into a porn movie, so in this sense Caligula is a unique experience ... on the other hand, it's so monumentally horrible that maybe it's "one-of-a" -kind "is a blessing in disguise.
