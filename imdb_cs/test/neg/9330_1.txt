How does the film become a biblical epic? Simply by citing a few fonts and using some Bible names for your characters? The only thing that was biblical about this epic was the characters' names. I almost forgot that three kingdoms, Israel, Egypt and Sheba, were also used. Where did King Vidor take the rest of his story? It certainly wasn't from the Bible. It was complete and utter nonsense. If you want to read about Solomon's reign as king in Israel, read 1 Kings 1-11 and 2 Chronicles 1-9. You will even come across Adonijah in 1 Kings 1 and 2 Queen of Sheba (who will not appear until King Solomon was king for about 20 years, which by the way is long after Adonijah & Joab was dead) can be found in 1 Kings 10 and 2 Chronicles 9. One of the first things Solomon does is to take his daughter with Pharoah. Yes, King Solomon has engaged in worshiping false gods, and that is why the kingdom was split after his death, not a temple destroyed by lightning. I also think that Solomon was too busy providing the temples to the fake gods of his 700 wives and taking care of his 300 concubines to fight Egypt, let alone the dead brother. <br /> <br /> Like I said this movie was a total nonsense. If you do not use this story in the Bible, then it will say something else. This could be just as easily called Romeo & Juliet or Sid & Nancy. <br /> <br />
