There is a reason to call it a teen movie. Out of 100 possible points, I'd put it somewhere in puberty. It is predictable if it is a terrible act, especially smaller roles, and above all it is super predictable. The end is so hockey that I should have left early and maybe it would have passed. By the way, could you call a man to lead a pervert? I bet if it really happened, someone would say it in my school district. Finally, at the school I grew up with, even though the average class had more than 1,000 students, we could have chosen a cheater like Josie as a scam and we would have taken it out of the crowd. My last word is to save time when it comes to watching something better, like stock prices.
