I saw this movie (unfortunately) because it was the only option at that time and because the director was David Zucker. I saw his previous "Naked Gun" (both parts), Airplane and Top secret! I'm not saying the movies I mentioned were masterpieces, but they were fine. I don't remember any more stupid movie than this. It's incredible how the Hollywood industry is in total decadence. If a studio spends money to create this horrible image, it's no surprise that this type of history is more common these days. This is a clear reflection of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid conspiracies are made to keep ordinary people entertained. I have nothing to say about this movie. If you are going to rent or buy, please don't waste your money or your time, avoiding whatever. Even if you're a fan of one of the actors, it's not worth it. In fact, it could be a very good example of what a director should avoid. I won't see Zucker's film again. (He plans to drive the fourth sequel to the Scary movie, picture it!). Pathetic. Terrible.
