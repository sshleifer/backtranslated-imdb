The only reason I didn't sleep during this movie is that the seats were not so comfortable. Hannibal is BORING> BORING> BORING and BORING !!! This film is simply terrible, not because of any violence or graphic mutilation. It's actually pretty tame. The story moves at a lazy snail speed. I feel that director Ridley Scott just called this phone. The actors are fine, they just needed some direction. The music score is also very annoying. This is particularly evident because so little is happening in the film. It looks good, but that's not enough reason to see it. Anyway, I mentioned it's BORING? <br /> <br />
