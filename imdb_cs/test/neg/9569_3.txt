I saw this film during the last San Sebastian film festival. The reaction to that was ... let's say it's funny because the movie is unintetionally. It happened that they showed a copy with terribly bad Spanish subtitles. It seemed to be a translation from Chinese to English and then Spanish. It was all confusing, sexual alternation changed (the girls looked like boys and boys as girls) and my friends and I remember the great lines ... but because they were so absurd. All in all, it's not a good movie, but if it ever shows up on TV and you have nothing to do, and if you want to laugh (again, not so much with the movie), then go on, "Visible Secrets" is your movie.
