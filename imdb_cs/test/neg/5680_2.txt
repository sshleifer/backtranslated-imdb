Nothing that could go wrong here, but it could be SPOILER so careful. Special effects were at video game level - about five years ago, or perhaps from the original Star Trek. The meeting was just pathetic - some cheesy-looking blond trekking across the desert while the voice in the background came out. And further. And further. This was the trek and the drone half I actually did. Progress interrupts several battles. Ships are fired with each other, without any real reason, which is obviously episodic. Again, it's not that there is a real struggle you would expect from a movie, rather as a cheap video game. Boi-ing! Boi-ing! Ship explodes. Another ship. Apparently some ships are looking for a blonde. Here in the distant future, ships must be shortsighted and astigmatic because many of them pass directly over the stylishly dressed futuristic little girl in black but never see it. Then there are some choreographic fights that look like something high school kids took. Again, a prominent video game mentality is prominent. Fighters move to "Fight Mode" by turning something on the wrist and a loud computer voice and "Fight Mode" flashing. This must be a dandy design if you're trying to sneak someone. Then you go to a large power plant that looks just like the current power line and plug it into a charge. LOL, I'm not kidding, you can't do these things, it's like watching crazy 2000 video games just acting is better in the game. <br /> <br /> More trekking. Then he appears on "The City". (Lame sound trek gets still lamer here.) He gets into a fight with a mech robot of the future who can't hit her with his big gun, even if he runs right in front of him, about five feet ahead of him. Obviously, distant future robots are just as useful as a toaster. He throws sand into his eyes and beats him to death by throwing stones at him. rofl, I was about 95% tolerance, my circuits nausea flash red. In the next scene, he ends up strapped to a rocket with some rope. No, no, you're tied straight out of the racket. It is thought to be a modern form of transport. At that moment I saved. <br /> <br /> This film is a complete shame for the film made today. Just scary shame. It was a shabby story, but the film turned his attention away from him - someone was constantly arguing about the "mother". I gave him two because there were several scenes that showed some nice science fiction drawings as a background. Unfortunately, conspiracy, acting, action, cinematography and narration have been reflected and degraded from this work. No fun.
