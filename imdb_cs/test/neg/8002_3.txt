Mockney comes to Brighton; Despite poor income in the British press and state-funded British cinema, which was written all around, I was hoping to get a little dirty, hard London sea, Graham Greene. It doesn't even work. Characters straight from their clones' n crimp trailers reproduce Guy Ritchie types. The format looks more like a British TV series than the movie (Brighton is the background gold mine, wasted by plastic work in the studio). This movie I watched in pursuit of good performance by Famke Janssen ... She's a little smooth for this company, her brand of big screen impertability is more of a hitter like Deep Rising. As for acting (role i!), Search continues. The circus is boring. 3/10
