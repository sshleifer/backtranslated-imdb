This film was thoroughly unhealthy, disturbing and dissatisfied. Apart from a few nice shots from Italy, there is nothing to recommend this movie. As usual, Hollywood draws a bad conclusion from a broken existence - _next_ the guy you meet with who you sleep after you know a few hours must be Mr. Right. As for humor, there is something in the movie, but I don't see how anyone could call it romantic _comedy_, because about three quarters of the film is totally depressing! My recommendation? Skip it in the theaters, wait for it to come out on the DVD, then skip it there. I want someone to give me the two hours I watched unnecessarily.
