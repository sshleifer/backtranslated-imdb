210 minute version (extremely hardcore, or do I hear) or R-rated theaters released? Of course, both are terribly terrible. Peter O'Toole and Malcolm McDowell both claimed they wanted this movie to never be done (the other of the two men announced it in IMDb!), And I see why. Nothing but a pointless mess of an erotic pornographer and a half-attempted conspiracy. Nothing much is here except cheap tricks and stupid scenes. I liked what McDowell said about the movie: "It was like one moment I stared, admired my mule or something, and the next scene would go to two lesbians." <br /> <br /> As true. What a horrible movie. <br /> <br /> 1/5 stars.
