This film beats everything there. Depending on what you're looking for ... it could be 10 or 1 on the scale. This movie is all over its own league. I don't think a movie can get to it. I'm not sure what the director wanted to do as a thriller or a comedy. If he thought he was doing a thriller, then he was lucky enough to create one of Bollywood's best comedy ever. You have to see it to believe it .. matrix + terminator + a number of other films that are thrown into one, along with a story dating back to Hindi films from the 1980s, with icchadhari naag (a mythical snake that can turn into a human ) <br /> <br /> It's an ideal movie if you're sitting with a bunch of friends with alcohol on the side. I'm not sure whether to put 1 or 10 .. Based on flipping coins, I decided to put 1!
