OK, it was a "risky" move to rent this movie, but I thought I had nothing to lose. This is next to "Bloodsurf" the worst "horrormovie" I've ever seen. Miserable actors, lousy technical output, lousy story and so on. However, the soundtrack is not bad. That's why I gave him 2 to vote and not just 1. And of course, cats are a positive surprise. By far excellent actors in this movie ..... Don't borrow or buy. Stay away from this and hopefully this horrible, horrible film will disappear into some dark existence and not become a "cult classic". He certainly does not deserve any recognition.
