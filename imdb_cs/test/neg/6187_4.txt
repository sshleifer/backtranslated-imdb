This film has been compared to the merry British comedy "Fish called Wanda", although I see no reason. The only connection I can find is Monty Python (Eric Idle in "Nuns", John Cleese and Michael Palin in "Wanda"). Otherwise, the two are incomparable. When the escape is bad, they are both forced to take refuge in the monastery as nuns. bland humor. Again, there are occasional high spots, but neither cast nor crew can inspire driving. The attempt at manic completion of the "Wanda" type also fails, along with the pursuit of "men in the move" humor, which is hardly surprising. When you think about it, the men trying to be women are funny, the men trying to be nuns are ridiculous. Friday, April 22, 1994 - Video
