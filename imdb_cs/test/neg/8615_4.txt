I watched this movie tonight and I must say it's awful! I expected it to be great because you know we don't usually have many movies about Asian vampires mixed with Asian culture; but it started in the wrong way at the beginning: the introduction of the film didn't seem to end! The storyline is so weak and if you take the matches and soundtrack, you really have nothing useful! The director of this movie does not seem to have any important ideas about how much time to spend in the introduction and, for example, flashbacks (not to mention some other things). Watch '' Lost Boys '' or '' Interview with Vampire ''.
