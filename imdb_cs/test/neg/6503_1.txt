ABC will include another unrealistic representation of rural Australia in its repertoire. Yes, guys, it's all over there Baca Bourke (small talent actor) Fire hero, Lill (Libby Tanner plays Bronwyn Craig in the bush), Fifi (Nadia Townsend) urban slut, brother of Baca Joe (I think). Then there's Uncle Geoff, Big Daddy of Lost Springs. Uncle Geoff's scenes are similar to Tennessee Williams's speed. The only saving grace is the Russian actress Natalia Novikova as Bac's lonely lady. It's great. I don't understand why John Waters acted as the husband of Lilly's psychologist. He needed the money I expected! However, it won't take long for Lill and Baca to have it throw off their suit. Just watch this lemon to see how bad the Aussie show can be. Honestly, I'm ashamed.
