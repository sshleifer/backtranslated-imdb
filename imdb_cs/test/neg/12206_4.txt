Director Delbert Mann was a much better director than this film suggests. He managed ALL TEMPERATURES ON THE WESTERN FRONT CLASS THAT TOUCH THE COINS AND THE LAST DAYS OF PATTON among others. This average, made for the TV narrative of Duck's masterpiece, is so bad, even those who are unfamiliar with the often filmed story will be dissatisfied. In addition to being available only to two well-known suppliers (Brentwood) and BCI Eclipse LLC), poor transmission quality and scratched and muddy soundtrack make the task of finding this movie on video that is not worth the effort . I've always believed that if a company is to put a movie on video and charge public money to buy, then they should have at least a copy of the movie's descent and do a good job of converting. Unfortunately, none of these two vendors have such a work ethic, and the result is only suitable for a negotiated tray at a local discount store. Much of the rich details of the novel are lost in this translation. Martha, Traddles, and others have been cut out, and the relationship between young David and Steerfort is not well researched, so we wonder why David should hang with the guy. David Boy's relationship with young Agnes has never evolved and it's hard to see why he marries David. Since Martha is left out, it's a mystery how Dan Peggoty finds his niece. And the absence of Traddles makes David a very lonely colleague. Some have credited this film by doing a good job shortening a lengthy novel. I disagree, it is at best an ax working on a book. Anyone who has seen the 1935 version of George Cukor will agree. Fields' performance in this version, like Micawber and Rathbone as Murdstone, is definitely worth watching. And the newer version of Masterpiece Theater (April 2000) and Hallmark (2000) are excellent achievements for television adaptations of classic novels. Directors Simon Curtis and Peter Medak, who are responsible for these films, deserve the highest praise. My last comment to David COPPERFIELD 1969 is Don't Buy, there are several much better versions of the movie available. If it's on TV, turn the channel to something else. It's a loss of one hour and twenty minutes of your life. Sorry people, but I can't praise such a bad movie.
