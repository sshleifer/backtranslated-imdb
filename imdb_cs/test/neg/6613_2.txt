This movie seemed like a great idea in pre-production. "Let's make a film about one of the greatest and most controversial athletes in the modern era! And let's cast Brian Dennehey as Bobby Knight's coach!" This is where this movie went terribly wrong. Why cast an actor who doesn't have the appearance of the man he displayed? And why did this actor turn his character into Coach Knight, but Brian Dennehey in a red sweater? When I was sitting and watching this movie on ESPN, I didn't find myself believing that this man was actually a Knight coach. He didn't look like him, he talked like him, he acted like him, he didn't walk like him. I couldn't get through this, so I couldn't enjoy the movie. When Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, we didn't care if they were the exact historical models of their real characters, because most of us never heard of these people until we saw the movie. But with someone who is visible as a Knight coach in today's media, you need to do better. When Anthony Hopkins was cast as Nixon, it was the same situation. However, Anthony Hopkins convinced us that he was actually Nixon. Dennehey didn't even try it. What could have been a great movie has turned sour. In addition to trying to do the four-letter word that "Saving Private Ryan" did for splitting, this movie got stuck. Too little of the real Knight coach and the excessive blasphemy of the shock value has changed this film in the "season when it turned off halfway through." The only good thing about it is that it was a TV movie. I didn't have to waste my hard earned money on this piece of waste.
