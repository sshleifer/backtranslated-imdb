This show is terrible. I can't get through the full loss of the great talent this show has. This is not an amusing improvisation performance, it's just a cheap attempt to throw a famous comedy actor on stage and let them perform a badly improved scene. Actually, I did improvised work as an actor and this show is not better. What the audience actually laughs (if they actually laugh, it looks like a fake) is the embarrassment of the visiting star lost as a deer in the spotlights. Stupid, totally unrelated things they come up with are what people laugh at. And if it's not part of the scene, the actors tell them it's wrong! I found that this show is a shame for art, and makes me cry for a show like Whose Line's Anyway, which had great talent, great improvised games, and on top of everything else, didn't mean I wanted to change the channel.
