I would agree with another viewer who wrote that this film commemorates Melanie Griffith / Jeff Daniels, "Something Wild" in which an eccentric free spirit associates with a conservative and highly organized young man, and two positions represent pairs and essentially her personality he is gradually working on it. Losing and learning to enjoy her short life. That's exactly what's going on here, besides putting an eccentric neckline into the store, Alex (Rosanna Arquette) in the role of Melanie Griffith, and a super-careful teen, Lincoln (the name is not a coincidence played by Devon Gummersall) in Jeff Daniel. This movie even shares the same twist and sudden changes in the genre where a creepy, violent friend suddenly appears at the end and things end up pretty bad. It's just here, instead of Ray Liotta playing a return to the fifties movie killers, it's Peter Greene. The story is about a teenage child who is in her own little world. After her brother's suicide, he has some fascination with death, and his parents also disconnected, behaving quite strangely (mother is convinced Christmas will come soon, despite August). Then, at night out with "guys" (one of whom is played by Jason Hervey from Wonders for years) trying to buy them a beer, he runs to Alex who decides to kidnap him and his friends car (with his permission of course), and they They take off on a mini-adventure across the desert on the west coast, robbing the convenience stores in Robin Hood kind of fashion and of course indulging in routine self-discovery because everyone asks more about the life of another. But Alex has left a partner in the theft shop, and he's not gone. Although we are not constantly reminded of him, nor is he like anything in the repeated flash of memories or cutting to his point of view. At least this was done cleverly. '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' Do Me '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' '' ' the movie, but it will deliver the goods a little late until Alex and Lincoln arrive at her home in the middle of nowhere. Unfortunately, when filmmakers give you enough stimulation, the film is almost over. I would recommend that if this is the type of story you are in the mood for, and despite the fact that Rosanna Arquette has always done a good job (even in a poorly written film), I would recommend it at the very best, "Something Wild. "
