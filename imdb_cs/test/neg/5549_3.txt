Low-budget Schlockmeister Herschell Gordon Lewis reaches a new low (even for him) with "Gore Gore Girls", a "snicker" that has all his technical trademarks: poorly recorded sound, poor lighting, and OTT gore. That would be tolerable, even enchanting, if the film had at least an interesting plot ("Blood Feast", in all its ridiculous fame, it's a great example), but "Girls" are utter snooze. Totally unlikble pompous-butt private investigator Abraham Gentry (Frank Kress) is a recruited journalist journalist to find out who was killing out-of-shape strippers (you'll stop worrying about who the culprit is long before these two are packing the case)). As before, the appeal is not a conspiracy, but the creative method of bloodshed (including the girl's fanny who is trapped by a wooden mallet) and the occasional flashes of then-risqu√© skin ... but that is simply not enough to elevate material above the present.
