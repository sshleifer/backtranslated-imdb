The creator remained true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes the 1846 manuscript Richard Williams Bell (son of John and Lucy Bell and younger brother Betsy Bell) titled "Our Family Trouble". It is the only eyewitness he has ever written. The director should be honored for accuracy, but there is little about production and acting quality. The acting was theatrical and the sound and image quality were very bad. It seems that the filmmaker simply filmed scenes from the reported events that took place without including them in a woven plot or story. If you have to know the story, read about it, its much more appealing and convincing.
