With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this movie, I don't think Shakespeare is in great danger. This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy that has been deprived of liberty. His things have been accepted and this will really tick him off. He seems to know who he is doing, even if he is a crouching subject. I loved two dull men who talk about how Mum was found and a doctor who is determined to destroy the creature. All these scenes are in this ridiculous cemetery, full of cheap crosses and other junk things. There is a mausoleum where mum is held. I can't start reproducing this idioto, including the snake pit, where a good doctor is thrown (there is a door next to her to get out) to the robot, a lot of metal cans with a guy inside. Dialogue is terrible. There are long pauses among the manifestations, as if fed outside. I like the scene where two little kids blame their mother for going out at night (going into a zombie state or something). However, if your search for a movie that you can laugh at and never take seriously, watch it. First take a few beers. Like a straight line from the mummy's tomb: "Watch this and your eyes will bleed and your breath will stink." What more can I say?
