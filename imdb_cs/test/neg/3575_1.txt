I really enjoyed "Candid camera" with Dom DeLuis and I was surprised to see that after years Suzanne Somers became the star of the show. But that was the only positive aspect of the exhibition - the whole studio, the intro, the hosts - all this giving a new meaning to the word "pompous". Well, that would be okay if the materials weren't that cr * ppy - I think to come, the best thing you can do is show a couple of men having trouble getting ketchup from the bottle, Suzanne Somers walks with a Halloween basket in July, instead of an ice cream that only sells vanilla ...? I saw a couple of episodes and it was terrible every time. They presented it as if it were the biggest show ever, and then filled the time with scenes so boring that I really felt embarrassed to watch. Even the people in them looked bored and it just couldn't be good.
