There is no worse criticism for the film than the word BORING. <br /> <br /> Some "bad" movies are a lot of fun, some "fun" movies are really bad, but BORING means no one will ever buy a DVD to watch it again and again. The movie, which employed a class drama from Antartic, seemed too busy running around to stay warm instead of playing. The lead actor, the spoken voice is almost a whisper, a hoarse voice style, damn it, he seemed to seduce someone, and he didn't care about who. Boring, I hope this will die quickly, never see, death.
