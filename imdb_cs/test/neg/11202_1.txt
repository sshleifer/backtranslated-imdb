Gordon Scott, with his well-cut hair, hourglass figures, and strange English, must be the worst of all Tarzan. As for the other actors in this mess, they are on par with any fourth grade of the drama school elementary class. I saw a Used Car Dealer in TV commercials who can do better. They make Clayton Moore look like Laurence Olivier! And where does Jane (blunt Eva Brent) take lipstick and eyebrows in the jungle? I realize they were made for kids, but Wow! The plot line seemed fine, but the director wanted more from his actors. I realize that Weissmuller's films have several shortcomings, but this seemed to be a "low budget".
