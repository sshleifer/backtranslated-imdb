So I decided to watch the whole series of puppet master and I was just watching parts 1-3 that I thought were all excellent. They had a unique charm and a certain intelligence that I really appreciated. About a year ago I even saw puppet master Vs. Demonic toys that obviously were bad but still amazing feelings of guilt and fun to watch. From the very beginning of this movie, I knew it was in trouble. Cheesy Power Rangers in the style of an Egyptian skull villain who watches the puppets 'Rita Repulsa-style' through his pyramid glass came right out of the left field! All additions to this series in this story were absolutely absurd! Suddenly, we have a large selection of all kinds of new and random characters and conspiracies that are far from the first three films. I seriously doubt that when the first puppet master was written, writers had visions that one day they would see Egyptian Power Rangers, totem monsters, annoying twenty-two people who could not act seriously (and be brilliant scientists, but never say something intelligent), and lame "Decapitron" puppet, which head can morph into the spirit of Toulon. Another thing that disappointed me in this film was the fact that it completely ignores what happened in the last record (Part II because III was a prequel). Suddenly the puppets return to the Bodega Bay Inn, back in their case (minus Blade), and for some reason Toulon is willing to help his puppets again (betray them in Part II for his love for Else). This is not explained at ALL ... and so with that, and all, and all the other junk thrown, I was no longer amused. I'm a huge fan of funny B movies, connoisseurs if you want. I even collect laser discs from rare B movies that you can't find on DVD, so it takes me a long time to say it's one of the most absurd movies I've ever seen in my life. I still love those puppets, the original ones, Blade, Tunneler, Pinhead, Jester and the others, and if they just kept on what they had, instead of trying to fix something, it could still be. in good health. As has been said, although the reviews are not so great, I am very interested in controlling the puppet master Retro, it sounds like an interesting one that pays great credit to the original themes.
