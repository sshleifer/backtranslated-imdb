When I bought this movie, I expected to get a fun movie from the 70s. Instead, I got this boring festival by the amateur author Andy Milligan. Ah, Andy Milligan. With his tight fit, crazy stimulation and wonderfully known actors, you almost think you're watching ... one of his home movies! Seriously, I couldn't stay awake the first time I tried to watch him. Shots of boring people drag on, and when someone is killed, the film slows down. Sometimes it would also speed up, so the characters will sound like chipmunks, which was probably the best thing about this movie. The script seemed to be a little better than the movie, and it seems more appropriate to be in a soap opera than in the 70's granular pill, where actors are constantly hitting the lines. The envelope said, "Their initial cuts were curiously erotic ... but thoroughly brutal!" Believe me, there's nothing "erotic" about this movie. Oh, we see characters that resemble an extra piece of cottage cheese, but that's about it. And as for "brutal", the viewer is most brutalized with this film. And another thing ...
