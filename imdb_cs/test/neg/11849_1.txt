<br /> <br /> ********** SPOILER ALERT *************** <br /> <br /> If you like JURASSIC PARK 1 , 2, or 3: <br /> <br /> If you really appreciate really bad movies for their fun, if not their quality (DARK STAR case - highly recommended by John Carpenter) <br /> <br /> If you like dinosaur movies in general - <br /> <br /> HOW TO DOWNLOAD THIS CINEMATIC KRAPSTERPIECE! The shameless use of footage from CARNOSAUR 1 & 2 makes up most of this unfortunate attempt at dino / slasher flick. For some reason, he drops about 50 pounds and looks 10 years younger. Why is it? Simply because this scene was lifted straight from CARNOSAUR, which was a huge swing that started. The end was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2, for those who were so unhappy that they sat in that straight line. video loser. Again, we see Mr. Rex fighting against a bulldozer who alternately moves a forklift - a miracle -ta-daa! - footage of the above CARNOSAUR 1 and 2. Of course, the end is exactly the same - the animal falls to its death, just as the complex floats in flames. A real insult to one's intelligence. But it's still better than watching ROSIE O 'DONNEL SHOW. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of ***** <br /> <br />
