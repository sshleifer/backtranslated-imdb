I don't know how this DVD got into my collection - my wife suggested it was one of these "3 for £ 20" stores in a high street store. The thing isn't worth 66p, let alone £ 6.66! When I invested a lot in it, I felt obliged to watch it to the end just to make sure it was just as bad all the time - and that was it. The dialogue was terrible, the story line was impenetrable (I still don't understand what the hell is going on, even though I read the synopsis), working with the camera was incoherent and hopeless, the acting was wooden (it didn't help dialogue). In fact, there were no redeeming features - no, not even Sandra Bullock, whose shining follow-up career was likely to sell this pile of debris. She should get her agent to take all his rights and then bury him ASAP. As the last fun example of the director's insensitivity, the scene where the young people occupy with their father appeared. ex-army sidekick while driving. That was the brightest dialogue in the film - no engine noise! I look forward to the engine damping technique that will eventually lead across the pond to British cars!
