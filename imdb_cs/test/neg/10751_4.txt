The secret of a low budget ombudsman murder attempting to rid his client of the murder he was sentenced to twelve years ago. The complicated thing is that after his conviction he escaped custody, but PD believes the man is innocent of murder and is working to find a real killer. Gig Young as PD is okay, and James Anderson as a convicted killer is actually pretty good, but the picture as a whole is just swaying with little tension and despite some good cast actors, performances are generally under par. Director George Archainbaud was obviously more at home when he made Western films - at that time he played in the television series Gene Autry in Colombia - but even if he tried to bring any vividness into this picture, the hack script would beat his attempts. On average, at best, the movie culminated in the courtroom scene, which is directly from the "Perry Mason" episode and is equally predictable.
