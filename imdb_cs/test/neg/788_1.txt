maybe one of the (if not) the worst movie ever made, cast and acted in the history of film. Who would ever think of God's land to cast Cameron Diaz and James Mardsen as a couple? She looked like his mother. God forgive me, but I'm just honest. And that was the least of the many problems that plagued this horrible apology for the film. It was a terrible statement against women, but at least if you blame women for the world's problems, tell a decent story to anyone with so many annoying loopholes and pathetic excuses for tension and excitement. Everyone should get their money back, who went to see theaters or bought a DVD.
