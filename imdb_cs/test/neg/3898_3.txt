I consider myself a fan of Jess Franco and his films, but almost every time I see one of them, I see only missed opportunities and conspiracies that don't go well. Unfortunately, this film is no different. The film certainly had a lot of potential because Franco combined the interesting theme of the classic movie "The Most Dangerous Game" with its usual kitsch sleaze brand, but here the conspiracy loses too often and for Franco it takes forever. get to the main point of the movie. With this later film Franco, you might be forgiven for thinking that the director would get better, but in fact I found that the opposite was true; How It And The Terrible 'Killer Barbys' Are Two Of His Worst Films. The story focuses on the stripper and her slippery friend. The couple is invited to a private island by a rich woman and her lover. Soon, however, they find that they have not been invited there for social reasons because they are "released" on the island to be a rich woman and her friends can hunt for sport! What attracted me to this film was the front cover and the fact that it was directed by the dude king. Then you'd think I'd be glad that the movie contains a wealth of sexual scenes and general sleaze; but I'm not. The reason is mostly that sex and sleaze in the film are really boring and most of the time they were merely to give me a condition known as "itchy fast forward". However, my tendency to see everything until the end ensured that I had to crush it. There were times when I didn't think the girl could be boring, but since then I have turned out to be bad. The only positive thing I can pull out of the movie is that the soundtrack is pretty catchy and despite it's stupid foreign pop music; in fact, it blends very well with sexual scenes. I enjoyed the last ten minutes; How it is when the plot finally went, but it was a case too little late and unfortunately, it is a serious bland film. Overall, I recommend this film only to those who feel they have to see all 180 Frank movies ... everyone else should watch Vampyros Lesbos, Faceless or She Killed in Ecstasy instead.
