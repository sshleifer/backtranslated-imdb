Remember those horrible war movies your grandmother made you watch 25 years ago on your old VHS VCR? "Fallen" is just a bad executed remake of these movies! The story is terrible, the direction is terrible, the cut is terrible, the music is terrible, and all together make the nightmare unbearable. <br /> <br /> It's so slow! Very slow! I tried to sleep while watching, but I couldn't do it because I had nightmares. <br /> <br /> Don't Watch This Movie! It is bad! Ten lines is a lot, so I don't know what else to say. <br /> <br /> Press the eject button NOW and you won't regret it!
