In 1904, Tangier, a wealthy American woman and her two children, was abducted by Berbers, the murderous desert pirates who despise the Moroccan government and thus kidnap the "American plague" that attracts the attention of US President Theodore Roosevelt. The fictitious historical epic is a less spectacular adventure than a strange, somewhat exhausting return to the desert Sheikh films of the 1940s (with the addition of "King and I" I also appeared). Sean Connery and Candice Bergen could depict a veiled, mustachioed, bloodthirsty leader and his stub, a haughty prisoner, and could play in two completely different films (neither of them knows how to carry the camp elements of their characters and dialogue and both don't seem to that it would be without proper direction). Various (and anonymous) slashes and pieces that occur are arbitrary: we do not know any of these sacrifices, and the big action scenes become blurry, noisy montages of violence on sand that have swept over horses. Pros: a much-praised musical score by Jerry Goldsmith (Oscar-nominated, but defeated to John Williams's "Jaws"), the fine location of shooting and cinematography. * 1/2 from ****
