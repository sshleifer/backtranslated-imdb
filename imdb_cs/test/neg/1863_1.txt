Ghoulies IV starts in a museum store where PVC and leather blonde Alexandra (Stacie Randall) is looking for an ancient gem, after getting rid of various guards, summoned the demon Faust, whom she worships and wants to have sex, unfortunately lost her jewelry so she is not very happy and orders her to get the last remaining ... What belongs to Jonathan Graves (returning from the original Ghoulies (1985) by Peter Liapis) who has experience with demonic possessions and such things after the events of the original Ghoulies. Alexandra sets out to search for the jewel to bring Faust to Earth permanently from the "other side" to, and I don't really know. Erm, this is really about ... Direction: Jim Wynorski, whose name named Shakes My Spine when he is attached to a movie that is about to waste 90 minutes of my life on Goulies IV. is as I expected complete, complete and utter crap from start to finish & it's as simple & straight as it is. Ahem, 'script', cough, Mark Sevi, has virtually nothing to do with the other Ghoulies movies, except for the title, and they managed to persuade Liapis to overestimate his role, which also has the added bonus of a great one able to use the footage of the original, though it has no meaning. The story is almost no existing, the whole movie is a real chore to watch, it's incredibly boring and moronic, it's slow, it's predictable, it's squeaky clean when it comes to blood or gore goes & has two comic relief goblins that i assume They are supposed to fill the Ghoulies quota even though they look like they did in previous movies & are actually just embarrassing to watch, in fact, I think they were practicing being ventriloquist during most of the movie, like when they talk their mouth don 't move ... You know I don't want to talk or think about Ghoulies IV anymore, so please believe me when I say it's a huge piece of Elephant-sized elephants, don't waste your time or money. Dirctor Wynorski turns into a translucent rotten film at almost all levels, with special effects terrible as the whole movie. Ghoulies IV seems to be some kind of horror comedy, but they're missing both targets of proverb miles and it's neither funny nor scary. The best thing about this movie is actress Randall in her pvc and leather outfits running around trying to find a gem & it is hardly worth sitting through this waste to see. There's a half decent scene with a car crash with a few crashes, but it looks like it was modified from a completely different movie and gave Wynorski a record I'm sure. Forget all the gore because there is none. Technically Ghoulies IV sucks, it's obvious he had a low budget, but that's just not an excuse to make it so bad, right? Liapis is back in the cast, although he probably wishes to stay away, PVC clad baby Randall is on this movie easily the best he says a lot. Ghoulies IV is stupid, say nothing else. I honestly can't see anyone who can enjoy movies from it, I just can't. I can't believe I recommend the original Ghoulies over anything, but that happens now, because even though it's stupid, it's a hell of a lot better than Ghoulies IV. later. Things I sit with so you don't, honestly ...
