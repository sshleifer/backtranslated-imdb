I'm interested in this movie because someone made a beautiful video for Bj√∂rks "Bachelorette" with clips from it. I watched the movie. And it's really amazingly beautiful. Masterpiece animation. Unfortunately, the story doesn't stop. It starts well with interesting conspirators about people fenced to hold the Pink Bride, but suddenly the lifts are filled with water and lose their walls, people float, and finally for whatever reason, Utena turns into a car and follows a high-speed pursuit. I like the many Anime for its ability to create an alternative universe, but this universe is just stupid. If you watch this movie, it will be better.
