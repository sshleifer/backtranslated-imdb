Unintentionally hilarious melodies with Kay Francis as Countess Balakireff chases in her pants. At the beginning of the movie, the "stabilizer" throws it for being too young to embark on a chauffeur! The highly tuned English set in which it moves is such a clich√© of a harummpfers' bundle that it is ridiculous. But the topper is Basil Rathbone as an Italian violinist with a Chico Marx accent! "My violeen! How come I ever played eet!" "Patreecia, my meelk is cold!" It's an unrelenting camp.
