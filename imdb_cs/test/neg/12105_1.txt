Almost a masterclass in how to refuse a film. From a badly estimated, often incomprehensible, scenario, Dr. Rey builds on a number of bad decisions that make the film an unbearable viewing experience. Sadly, the film will never stand out over an old-fashioned, almost misogynistic gay camp, where women are overworked, OTT and middle-aged, and men are young, helpless, and forever hunting for sex. The director could not cope with the tone of the film or with the performance level. It is definitely an "acting" procedure. Dianne Wiest slips into the pale impersonation of her Bullet over performance on Broadway and the poor old Jane Birkin flounders in her attempt to give a comic show. Although you have to regret it because there is very little real comedy. The whole thing seems to be a very low rent version of Le Merchant Ivory's Divorce, which was not very good.
