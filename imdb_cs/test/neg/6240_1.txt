How are the two great actors from movies like this on film visitors. My only conclusion is that they and their director believe that ANY film in which stars just MUST be seen and applauded, <br /> <br /> Now to the movie - probably the worst "thriller" I've ever seen. Actors showed minimal emotions; the graph was reasonable for a 1/2 hour time slot (not 91 minutes). The FBI agent was almost a stupid parody - his partner was apparently struck stupid and didn't say a word. To paraphrase Robert Redford, the villain was a nonsense piece of crap! The film was stretched and meaningless - the only question was whether the hero would die or not. One really bizarre part of the story - The waiting family seemed to continue for several days; The hero and the antihero seemed to occupy only one day. <br /> <br /> All in all - a waste of time
