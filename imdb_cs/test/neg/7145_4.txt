There's nothing new in this movie. Nothing you haven't thought about before, nothing you haven't heard before. The story of a gay man who is brutally murdered in a small town and people's reactions can be explored in many ways, and this film chose the most demagogic and beautiful movie. One of the biggest flaws in this film is that it is neither a movie nor a documentary. The director used transcripts from the original interviews and the actors played them as if it were a movie. The result is weird. Finally, I read in the previous comments that say that people who don't like this movie are anti-gay. I'm sure these comments come from people who consider themselves to be tolerant, but do not tolerate that other people dislike this film. This is a funny world.
