I checked it for free in the library and I still feel ripped off. Yes, Sandra Bullock is in it, but only in five scenes that reach up to 5 minutes, and even those who watch them. The rest of the movie is so bad that you spend most of the time hoping it will end soon, but only if you are one of those people who have to finish the movie as soon as it starts. All the others just turn it off. Don't worry, nothing is missing. Bullock Lines (assuming you've been deceived to watch it because her name is plastered on the case) are basically just parroting other lines of characters like this dialogue: Lisa (Bullock ) - "Danny, please tell me what's going on." Danny - "I don't know. "<br /> <br /> Lisa -" Whadday means you don't know? "Danny -" I don't know - it's something to do with my father. "<br /> <br /> Lisa - "Whaddaya means your father?" Danny - "I don't know - he turned up or something." Lisa - "Why am I here?" Danny - "I'm sorry Lisa. I don't know. "<br /> <br /> (Later) Danny -" Some of my father's military friends ... "Lisa -" Whaddaya means army mates? "<br /> < br /> Do you know what I mean? <br /> <br /> The bottom line - Just say no.
