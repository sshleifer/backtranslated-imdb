Oh wow, the character shares my name first name! Nick! This film is as bad as the first, if not worse. At least this is a real octopus. A real octopus that makes a better look in this movie. Better, I think, "Longer" acting is quite dry and it's hard to sit. Just to inform you when this ninety-minute movie ends not only are you free from your couch, but you get the ability to breathe back. Not only that, but you realize how stupid you are and then commit suicide, you realize how horrible life is after watching this movie. Indeed, it shows how desperate the horror are today, more crap like this realized and where the hell do the real horror masters have lately? This film should be the last straw, so we can bring back movie geniuses back in the horror cinema, who could make some really modern horror movies, this movie bites.
