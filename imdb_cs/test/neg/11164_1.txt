I don't know what was worse, the viewer finished off, or the stars in this movie who look like dopes. Should I believe that this woman raised this child for seven years and never noticed that the child was a little dark? Shall I trust her mother, her father, and her husband how he never said this baby looks a little dark? I'm supposed to believe when the courts ordered the mother to look at the records of the adopted parents that Lisa Hartman had that face on her face when she told her that Christopher was half black! What! It was for the real, you think so. So not only my grandmother, and my grandfather seemed stupid and stupid when they never mentioned it, but I think we should have looked surprised and say ... hmmmmm omg is half black! A totally silly movie, almost embarrassed, even if you look at it!
