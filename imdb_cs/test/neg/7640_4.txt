The synopsis of this film led me to believe it would be the story of an unconventional woman who would question the conventions of the society in which she lives. I like strong female characters and I expected the movie to be in line with "Chocolat" with less fairy tale and more bites. I got a cast of despicable characters. <br /> <br /> To make a character-based film effective, I have to feel connected or sympathetic to people. There was no one I could deal with in the movie. Grazia (Golino, whose work I admired in "Rain Man") portrays a mentally ill, probably bipolar, female, who is often rude, aggressive and violent. Her husband is quarreling and screaming when he doesn't hit or smack someone. Children are rough brats. Screaming at each other and female in the movie. They attack other children without provocation. Violence produces violence. It seems to be an island of insensitive, aggressive, violent and rude people who are all around. <br /> <br /> The direction is not convincing. There are mixed scenes that try to be art, but instead bore the viewer. The place is extremely beautiful, but also that it fails to capture to the point that it could be on the film. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you avoid this film failure.
