First, no one with any law enforcement experience (Not ER or EMT, but real law enforcement) takes this show seriously. Walker would be drummed from any US police force because of his illegal and totally unprofessional tactics. In addition, it is a comic character - no acting skills, incredible trit lines, no character development. The fact that Alex Cahill loves him shows how stupid the blondes really are. And Trivett is the ultimate black clown. Come on - if you think Walker is a heartless show without distortion, then explain why JT is considered a delta, it's always the subject of Walker's jokes, never being the one who solves this crime, and never saving Walker who should Be dead 50 times for the stupid things he does. While it may be true that many criminals are even more stupid than detectives who follow them (and believe me that most police officers are stupid than dirt), intelligent Walker comes against the fact that he doesn't seem to get the point of being Walker caught, the jerk must be out of his misery. But then again Norris created the show just as he did in it, as he could willingly get rid of himself or even show how stupid his tactics are. As if six guys were waiting for him to take him one at a time. What a terrible series! It's somewhat humiliating than any of the hokey westerns like The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, The Cisco Kid and Wild Bill Hickock, though I imagine most of you are too young to remember these shows. As with these shows, as with those shows, Walker TR is just as insulting and just stupid.
