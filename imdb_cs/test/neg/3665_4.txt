8 days no script that is what the DVD says is how the movie was made. It's filmed in a blurry video that is sometimes used for a good effect, but it's really partially nude women who run in the room most of the time. This is a very good deal and it helps a lot. But the killer appears only once in a long time, and girls / women sit and hope not to try to escape or do something so interesting, so the whole thing falls apart after 20 minutes. It would be good short, maybe even powerful. Even eight days do very little. Why? Because they had no script. How many movies were made without scripts. Not too much. I wonder why it is? How many great movies were made from bad scripts. Not too much. Why is it? Working against this big problem, the direction is trying and doing some interesting things, but with what is basically nothing. Topless girls shot in a dark grainy colorless video sitting around will hold some go for a while but not for a short but too long feature length. Again, the actors deserve praise if there was a script. <br /> <br /> Also, the quality of the video, or its lack, is really low, trying to use it, and sometimes even some of them look. Miami Vice, The Last Movie That Is. But this is not meant to compliment Miami Vice or this failed business.
