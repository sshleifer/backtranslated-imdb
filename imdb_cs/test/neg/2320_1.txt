For some reason my father-in-law gave me a copy of this tape. I think my big uncle Buddy Baer was huge in this movie and my father-in-law thought I'd like to see him. I had years ago as a child, and then I didn't like it. My son, then two, followed him and was addicted. Every awakening moment in front of the TV played this horrible video. I went to work with those songs in my head. Two "leaders" were worse than junior high ratings. The dancers looked like a rejection of Ed Wood's horror movie and Abbot and Costello called their parts in. Fortunately, I was able to distract my son so long that I lost this videotape. Frankly, I think it was "The Ring" tape. <br /> <br /> To fix another reviewer, Buddy Baer is UNCLE Jethro (Max Baer, ​​Jr.) not his father. 0 out of 10.
