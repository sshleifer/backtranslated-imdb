Tarentino should be ashamed to join this horrible film. Acting, directing and screenplay are third - the film is played as an excuse for Larry Bishop's writer / director / star to get into the game. The only reason he was ever created is most likely his association with QT. The storyline of the film is quite fragile, and basically seeks to survive on the not-so-obscure references to older B-movies and some portraits of guys like David Carradine, Dennis Hopper and Vinnie Jones. Each of them is fruitless in their performance, especially Hopper, who is in full payout at this point in his career. The saving grace, if any, is that the script is so ridiculously bad that it can be fun. Bishop tries so hard to joke this trademark Tarentino and just fails, which can sometimes be quite funny and grating on others. If I liked bad movies ... or if you were really on biker movies, I'd check it out.
