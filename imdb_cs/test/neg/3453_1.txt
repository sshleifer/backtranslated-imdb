Making a film for less than 1 million could be a triumph for a producer or accountant, but nothing for the audience. The balance sheet could be nice, but the viewing experience was bad. What will be the triumph for Irish Cinema is when people realize that production values ​​and the scenario cannot be sacrificed. <br /> <br /> I don't understand why people spend the energy they need to make a movie together when the quality of production is worse than a low profile TV show. The shortcomings of the conspiracy were mentioned in another review on this site and I totally agree with what was written. I would add that the film was collected on the surface of several genres without settling in one of them. The film could benefit from going towards a straight comedy or social / political commentary. <br /> <br /> My overall impression was that the film was rushed, thematically under developed and visually not standard. The positive thing is that the shows and the music were very good.
