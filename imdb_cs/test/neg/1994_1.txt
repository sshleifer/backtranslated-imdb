I saw this stinking old boiler on TV. Best watched with a very large flying dragon Jurd's Jungle Juice at hand, this amazing cheese-fest is cheerfully bad. On the (very thin) plus side, Raquel was in her physical primacy, looks good, and you can look at her because she plays go-go dancers; she had big legs, that's for sure. There is also some less interest in screen enthusiasts in shots from Los Angeles ca. '69, and watching the actors in the smaller parts, who continued to do better things. Veteran Thesp Ron Rifkin ('Brothers and Sisters') performed an early performance at the top as "Sailor" bartender "bassoon junkie", who meets rats Raquel bad. You could also recognize the sharply protective security in the hit-and-run scene - it's a very early look of Gordon Jump who gave such a beautiful performance in 'Soap' as a piece of Chelief Tinkler. 'Flareup', such as it is, follows the exotic dancer's travails (Welch) on the run from her murderous ex-husband (Luke Askew). This turkey is a classic production line of Hollywood sludge - painting-by-number script, direction for pedestrians, hokey footage, editing and effects, ultra-cheese stock music, plywood sets and performances to match. The cast is just as awful as the script. Even though Raquel is capable of just performances in the right vehicle, this old hairy old clunker is so bad he doesn't really have a chance or an audience. One of my favorite moments comes when Raquel wakes up in the hospital, sees a Vegas cop watching her murderous ex, and asks, "How did you get here?" - to which of course he answers "On the plane". Oh humanity ... And you won't be able to turn your eyes off the doctor (Michael Rougas), who might be one of the worst walks in the long sad history of bad portraits. I don't think I've ever seen anyone standing in one place so bad before. Raquel's love interest Joe (James Stacy) meets the film with a fixed look that is somewhere between confused and embarrassed - - and no wonder. This bomb casts almost every clich√© made on television, from Raquel's tremendously terrible turn to a horrible nightmare, to the pure ride of "romantic" horseback riding along Leo Carillo Beach. A spoiler warning ** - Just a single interesting thing in the whole movie is the denouement, in which Raquel finally gets his own back, and cheerfully orders the title, by setting Baddie to fire. The one who really earned this stunt man earned this - going up like Yorba Linda in a hot air wave. Even this rather spectacular scene is threatened by the fact that one of the crew is coming to an end. 'Flareup' has so many miserable things that it's strangely convincing; I found it could be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The answer seemed astonishing 'Yes' ... until I saw the movie that followed, a mega-cruel "heater" that took place in Roger Corman's "The Big Doll House", which takes Horror to a whole new level. I highly recommend these two shakers as a double account. You will laugh.
