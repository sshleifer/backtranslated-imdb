This film must be one of the most boring films. The only thing I liked is the use of Argento-esquire lighting in most scenes. Music is terrible and the pace is so slow that you can watch it twice faster and even then it would be slow. The story does not exist. He doesn't even have shocking scenes. <br /> <br /> It is classified (at least on this site) as a horror, but it is not. It is a kind of artistic film that explores the dark side of human nature. If you're in such a thing and you can stand up to a slow pace, then look at it, but I'd rather recommend something Japanese (eg Ichi the Killer). they committed a collective suicide caused by the huge amount of boredom that this film created. These 80 minutes of length would be better spent watching the color dry. <br /> <br /> I gave it 1/10 just because there is no 0 in the drop-down menu
