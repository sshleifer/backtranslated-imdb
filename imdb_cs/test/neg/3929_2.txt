Yes Pigeon and Coburn are great, and it's interesting to watch them, though Coburn seems somewhat restrained and boring. It's nice to see Seattle, Victoria and Salt Lake City in the 1970s and vintage cars and clothing. That's all good in this boring movie. Dialogue is incredibly bad, like most actors. Ray and Sandy's motivations seem to be forced and unlikely. I have seen this "training be pickpocket" routine several times before. There's a long building that doesn't do anything. Better to catch the episode "Streets of San Francisco" or one of the many big movies about crimes / capers. Naming a few, there are Bedtime Story, reworked as Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Lavender Hill Mob, The Grifters, Paper Moon, Sting, and Best of All, House of Games.
