OK will contain spoilers. I've never seen such a big pile of poop because laxative / feed is being mixed on an elephant in the zoo! She has more conspiracy than a lace-eaten moth and a "realistic" line. Well sexual slavery is a terrible and very real problem all over the world and this pile of bottoms uses this plague as a plot device to titillate and tease, shame for all involved in this piece of dubious judgment. But back to the film, if by the way you kidnap people from the airport, some of the safest and most interesting places in the modern world, then why should a stoolie be put inside a car that has everything so far. the plot needs twisting. Just wait until you're out of the airport, pull out your gun, weave your passengers, go to the warehouse and kill the people you do. On the passenger side, at least three times, good guys have bad people who are unfit and armed, WASTE! Once in a movie it can be acceptable to make a bullet in the wrong people's skull, but COME ON THREE TIMES! And after he killed most of you. Also, the guy is willing to put down his weapon to stop the scarred face, but he kills the girl for a yeast infection that could be $ 20 for drugs. I could go on and on a lot of holes in this, but I won't waste more of my time. Suffice it to say that I have so rarely absorbed the drama so insultingly, and as far as the real problem of sexual slavery is concerned, girls volunteer for new "jobs" in distant countries and are abused, raped and often killed by a gang. a master who meets them from a ship / plane and takes his passports and freedom. It is an insult to everyone affected by life! Don't waste your time!
