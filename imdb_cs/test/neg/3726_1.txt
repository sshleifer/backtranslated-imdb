Losing time, talent and shelf space is a tremendous movie. What are great players like Keanu Reeves, Cameron Diaz and Dan Aykroyd, wasting their time on such waste? Petty Criminal Reeves turns to his brothers (Vincent D'Onofrio) for a wedding and ends up with the bride. Comedy?, Thriller?, Romance? I honestly don't know! Reeves is a wooden headed and casting Dan Aykroyd as a cop is so terrible that he must be seen to be believed! The only bright spot in the dark dark tunnel is Diaz and she's not that good either. Rent something else. anyone who deals with this mess should keep their heads in complete shame and loot, which will be lost in oblivion in the coming years.
