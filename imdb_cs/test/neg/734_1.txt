Now and again, the film comes purely by chance that challenges your common sense. We just finished studying the novel, "Northanger Abbey," at school, and we decided to refresh our memory of this relentless piece of humorous waste with BBC adaptation. The funny thing about Northanger Abbey is that you really want to kill it. The film is nothing like a book, for example, slightly evil characters seem to be turned into transparent stereotypes. John Thorpe looks like leprechaun on acid while Isabella plays the role of a slut. Catherine, the main character, is the most depressingly stupid and irritating actress on the divine earth (she looks like a coffee addict, her eyes are like balls), while Mr. Tilney looks and performs as a double pornographer. The story goes completely off the rails at certain places in the movie, I don't know what the hell the director thought, if for some reason, the 7-year-old black boy we've never met before will take the main character. Yes it is true. The nonsense of this kind is occasionally interrupted by the Catherines "fantasy" in which she is carried around the ogre cathedral. Northanger Abbey is basically a visual euthanasia so if you want to kill your boss or something like the BBC basically discovered a new way to kill someone. Northanger is barely a ridiculously bad movie. Do not look if you are not in a padded cell.
