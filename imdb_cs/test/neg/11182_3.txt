On the purely theatrical side, Last Stand was great, as reenactments and soundtrack are very fun, but there are better descriptions of this battle found elsewhere, while not as long or as flashy, being far more historically complex. Some small details, such as the misuse of the word "hoplon" for the Greek shield against hoplite and misnomer of different names and words, really ate me. My guess would be, because "Last Stand 300" was aired on the eve of the theatrical release of "300", the history of the channel just tried to jet the coats of the film's hype. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a view that is historically accurate in all respects, you'll be more lucky elsewhere.
