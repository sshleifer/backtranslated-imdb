A few men are shipwrecked on a remote island. They are then captured by a mad man who lives there with a small group of servants; while in the castle dungeon the Count of the hapless leper wife lives. Dungeon of Harrow is largely a hack movie work. All the amateur actors are moving through the film, while the uncomfortable score continues to play in the background. Various pieces of action are shot incredibly non-energy; in fact, the film is generally completely lethargic. It seems to go on and on. And even if the end is not too bad, you will be tough on this point. As an example of the 60s of Gothic horror, it is a strictly preferred example of a basement. Unfortunately, I can't really recommend it.
