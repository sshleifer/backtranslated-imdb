I found this movie at XXX for $ 1 on VHS. Interestingly, Camp Video bought the rights to it and slapped on the 1986 copywrite date in credits. Anyway, enough odd facts. This movie is not absolutely scary. Even calling this horror or "thriller" is ridiculous. In this 80+ minute movie it was only about 5 minutes what you would call horror, and it consisted of acting because it was HORRORible! All aside aside, writing for this movie was sheer garbage as well as special effects and makeup was laughing. No wonder this is such a dark film that the director spent the last 35 years in the country for all existing copies and fired them in one big pile, so no one else could subdue her.
