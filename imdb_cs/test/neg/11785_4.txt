I think Walter Pidgeon was wrong in this movie. I just don't believe in the role. Barbara Eden was beautiful and acted well enough. No one else was unforgettable. I remember that the TV series took place from this movie when I was a kid. I even think I had a plastic "Seaview" that was submersible and was great for playing in the bath. Long time ago. <br /> <br /> For some of the other criticisms I have read for this film: It is certainly unfair to judge special effects or science four decades ago with current standards. The effects were fine for 1961. It's not great, but OK. As far as science is concerned, it was ridiculous even for 1961. There is no excuse. Also sub was terribly spacious. I understand that the Navy has refused any help for this film, so the filmmakers might have no idea. Overall, the film bored me. (And I'm a science fiction fan.) I can't recommend this. Grade: D-
