"Ninja III" is not as bad as "Enter the Ninja", the first part of this "trilogy", but it's still a very bad movie. He barely delights fans of martial arts movies because there is not enough action, but the action scenes themselves are often spoiled by the laughter of excessive amounts and unnecessary violence. As if the film wasn't weak enough, the filmmakers would make him an "Exorcist" idiot. The only redeeming value is the victorious presence of an actress who plays a "controlled" heroine; She is a beautiful and athletic woman whom the director does not forget to exploit in various slimy ways - she is just an aerobics teacher. I do not mind a bit of soft exploitation, but I must not pretend to be something else.
