At this moment I watch this movie on TV here in Tokyo. Beautiful scenery, beautiful sets of biblical proportions, beautiful costumes, beautiful color, beautiful Gina. A great climate scene when God destroys Sheban's idol and much more with de Millean's lightning when Yul and Gina are about to fill their love. Yul does a decent job of halving when he delivers his lines, even though he sounds a lot like Yul who delivers his lines like Ramses or Taras Bulba. George Sanders sounds like George Sanders plays George Sanders. Gina is doing a good job, given the limited range of games she is supposed to play in this role, although she is completely transformed into a sneaky, regretful girl by the time the movie ends, and looks like she can play in her mother's biography. Teresa. I think lightning will do it to you, but it's almost breathtaking as it quickly throws its own beliefs about its new religion. Supporting players are mostly terrible, lacking credible emotions and timing. The usual big battle scenes, what was passed in 1959 for lascivious dances, and an orchestra that blew up a lot of trumpets, behind a huge choral song a lot of "Ah's", but none of that top Hollywood quality. The final swordfight between Brynner and Sanders is at a low-level high school game. The film is one big piece of eye candy, but not much more.
