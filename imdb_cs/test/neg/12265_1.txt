This film proves a theory I have had for some time - in Australia, if the film deals with the right subject, it will be a success no matter how awful it is. The Aussie Park Boyz couldn't be any worse - acting is terrible, the story is basically a poor Warriors knock-off, and the filmmakers probably have no idea of ​​ethnic gangs in Australia (the Irish gang in the 21st century! Irish gangs some Irish gangs, that was about a hundred years ago at the time of tinkers!) But because it is an ethnic rivalry, one of four themes that will guarantee success in Australian cinema (along with fighting families, minority groups), and the biography of the famous Australian ) has won several academic awards. I always suspected that Australian critics would get rid of all the rubbish that dealt with these problems, but part of me was thinking or at least hoping to have their limits. This film proves otherwise. So for all those Australian ambitious filmmakers out there, don't bother to think in your movie or pick people who can actually act or even get your facts right - just write a script about some poor family trying to meet or someone from a strange race coming to Australia and have to deal with racial prejudices and stereotypes, or, if you want to take a letter from the book of these people, any ethnic gang fighting with another ethnic gang that is not really acceptable in the movie is set up and your movie wins five Academy Awards regardless of how it is pathetic!
