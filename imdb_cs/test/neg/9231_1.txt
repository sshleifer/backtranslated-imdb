Sadly, some of this movie is worth watching. I'm Russian and I'm disgusted. There is nothing in this film that deserves praise except cinema. However, I am not one of those who find beauty in death or perversion. I think this film is poorly designed and directed. There is nothing more irritating than even blatant speculation in art (if you can call it this garbage art). Balabanov wanted the audience to be shocked by the ever-present evil and managed to create a hopelessly dark film. But the greatest shock is Balaban's primitive overhead. I would never advise any of my friends to follow it. Huge disappointment!
