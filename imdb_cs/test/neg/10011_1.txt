Great disappointment at what was offered as an incredible film. Incredibly bad. Very pretentious. It would be nice if only once someone created a high profile role for a young woman who was not a prostitute. Nothing we really learn about this nature, except that it seems to be a hopeless alcoholic. We don't know why. Nicholas Cage turns out as usual in excellent performance, but I feel that this role and this scenario left him. And how, after not being able to play for the whole movie, can he have an erection on his deathbed? Really awful and I felt like I needed a bath.
