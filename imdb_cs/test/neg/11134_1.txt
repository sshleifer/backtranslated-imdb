Okay, so I was cool in my room when my mother knocked on the door. I'll open the door and what will I see in her hands? "SLEEPY HOLLOW HIGH". I think it must be an older horror movie because now someone is stupid enough to name a movie that after a blockbuster hit "Sleepy Hollow" starring Johnny Depp. But to my surprise, the film is at least two years older than the original. That should stop me from putting it in V.C.R. But I had no chance, I had to believe that this film could have one little ray of hope. Little did I know the rays where she wasn't seen. Number one, the story is so ridiculous that it's probably true in some rural Bumpkin city. Two, the actors look more like people in real life who simply wonder about the scene when the director screams. Three, just about any movie starring director is always terrible. But funny is that it is another film by director Kevin Summerfield. I rely on his film to bring me to the floor with side-fissile laughter. <br /> <br /> Where to start this movie? I know let's start with a pram in the woods. Camera illumination was so bad that I believed the runner was standing and the cameraman was running. I love how a woman stops eating a candy bar. I mean, it's just about the darkness, or just about the light that could tell with the camera illumination. And he stops running to eat a candy bar, I want to say CANDY BAR WHAT'S HELL. So she ends up being the first victim of stupidity, and I'm already ready to stop the tape, find the director, burn his little hands. Then some guys like to try to repair a car that has been broken for several years. Then came the false Mack 10 and a very real prostitute who became part of our main charter cast. Some of the movies are about a group of children who get into trouble. And they are given the opportunity to pick up waste at Sleepy Hollow Park or stop their faces forever. There he was sent to the forest with one of the teachers (Mr.E or a.k. and Kevin Summfield), who assume that he will supervise them and make sure that everything goes accordingly. The funniest thing is how undeveloped the charters are. I mean, what's wrong with False Mack 10 and who heard that Hacker was trying to kill himself. And some, as one of the students had an affair with Mr. E, before the whole community service appeared. Yet the school still thought it was a great idea to let him go. Also there is one student named J who has in the film's goal to be annoyingly emerging from nothing, where he tries to make the audience jump when all he really does is add to the cheapness of the movie. The sound was so terrible in this movie. I think there was one seen when two guys are fighting, and the guy hits the other guy in the stomach, and outside T.V. comes this sound effect that sounds like someone punching stale wooden box. It started terribly and ended up dangerously stupid, even my taste. I will say it however, the background music has taken the scenes to look what is tolerable. But not so tolerant. My conclusion is this if you want to leave yet another movie that Kevin Summfield took seriously to buy "Sleepy Hollow High. <br /> <br /> PS I'am still wondering about shooting himself to remove those fake Mack 10 images. AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
