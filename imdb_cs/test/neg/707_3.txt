When the film begins, it is clear how old and ill the boys are. Though huge, Oliver Hardy is Stanley, who seems to be playing death. Apparently he was mortally ill during production and apparently lost a lot of weight. Although he would eventually recover and live for another decade and a half, he looks like a dying man here. Besides, when I watched the movie, I was shocked at how much pratfalls Stan had taken - half expecting his death to fall. I really can't understand why they came out of retirement with regard to their health - especially when the story and production values ​​are as poor as this movie. Stanley inherits the island and the ship. He and Ollie are ready to leave when Antoine, a stateless man, is literally thrown into their ship and begin their journey to find the island. On the way, they learn that Giovanni has postponed, yet four men become friends and land on another island. It looks like a paradise and they are very happy. A little later, a beautiful young lady joins them and everything looks great. Unfortunately, uranium appears on the island and riffraff floods the site. Finally, the crowd decides to hang four men and take over - at which point the island falls back into the sea and the men are spared. <br /> <br /> I'll give the movie some credit for being original and interesting. However, one thing that's not the case is FUNNY - and it's unforgivable for Laurel and Hardy. Even if it's not a bad movie, it's definitely not good. The sad end to their brilliant career. All actors, except the duo, are dubbed into English, as the film was made in France. Although it may not be the worst movie they did (that would be BIG NOISE), it's definitely close !! Watching this movie is painful and like watching people after a severe accident.
