Man alive, is this game wrong or what? The graphics are below par, even though they were on playstation 1, do not mind Gamecube. The game is pathetic and camera movements disorient. What is a worthless game! <br /> <br /> I love Warner's Batman animation and it's cool to do all the games this way. Batman: Vengeance could have done well when they set off to a good start by keeping all the Gothic visual and voice actors but stumbling seriously when it came to gameplay and graphics. The result is a boring game that looks incredibly cheap and not fun to play at all. I really have to emphasize how bad the graphics are. Don't let color schemes deceive you. I saw better things on the Commodore 64.
