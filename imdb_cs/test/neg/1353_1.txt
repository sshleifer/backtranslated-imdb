First of all I should say that I have seen the '39 version at least 100 times; they know the whole dialogue, and have read "36", which is different from "39" and contains its own nuggets. This version is as flat as a lifelong film about adultery. There's a reason why you didn't see an expensive TV ad campaign. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the cat's tone of the original and how women spent all the time going to war wearing. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intention. It was a neat, theatrical shot of gossip, adultery, and rebounding between the socialists in Manhattan. The crowd who made this new version did not intend to honor the original source material. They pick it out strangely, so they're half-imitating the scene that comes from the first version. Bette Midler (who is only in a few scenes and keeps the old countess in a wide style) has no context in this version. She mentioned that she was following "Buck", who is a key element of the original - then he never mentioned it again. This movie is so boring that I won't analyze it too much, but here are a few things I found incredibly:> Mary Haines boasts of her homeworkers: "I can suck nails off the board!" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could do line reading on that & got Oscar nom, right? > COMPLEX Sylvia Fowler !!! ??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie was kind of a tap away. Claire Booth used Sylvia as a comic engine to play the game. As Rosalind Russell portrayed immortally, she was an unconscious, malevolent woman who rattled through a tiny, ridiculous, irresistible dialogue that is still classic and citable. She wasn't above Paulette Godard's ankle biting. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character must die. They killed her and killed the movie.
