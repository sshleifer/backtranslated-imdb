I was hoping I heard the movie wrong because I was a big fan of Rugger Deodat and I really didn't want to see how he could get up; But unfortunately this supernatural load of Giallo-style nonsense is just as bad as I was convinced it would be - and that is quite awful! The plot doesn't work at all because the film is trying to mix murders and a supernatural theme over the phone and all feel very forced and stupid. In addition, the plot doesn't make much sense at all, and you have to ask yourself "what's the reason" many times throughout the movie. The story focuses on a young woman living in an apartment building and a terrorized phone. The best thing about the film is undoubtedly the presence of beautiful English actress Charlotte Lewis, and unfortunately there are good points to stop there. There are several death scenes, some of which are bloody; But all that are incredibly stupid, one who sees someone who is killed by coins, stands out especially in this regard. Overall, I really don't recommend it to anyone; It is unlikely that fans who are not Deodato will be impressed, and Deodato fans will probably find a film that depresses them. Avoid!
