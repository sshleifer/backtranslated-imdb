I saw it in a preview screening and I have to say that this documentary is the biggest cost I've ever seen. the whole audience (young and old) was sitting in a movie coma without laughter for most of it ... it was literally just about 2 places to laugh in the whole movie. The blame is ... I kept thinking that the movie was going to rise, but it never did, and I'd like me to leave. Humor was really lame and I'm surprised it happened on the big screen. I'm not someone who is offended by the adult content of this movie at all - it just wasn't funny. People who made this movie really don't deserve your money, so please don't pay to see this movie. It is not even funny enough to be featured on television, let alone in the cinema. .. <br /> <br /> I wanted to give him 0 out of 10, but the system won't let it ...
