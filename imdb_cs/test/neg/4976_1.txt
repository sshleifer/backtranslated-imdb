Unforgiven is Clint Eastwoods' last tribute to the great West. But even though I thought it would be good and would raise the bar for future Westerners, I was, unfortunately, mistakenly wrong. Unconditional, though simple in conspiracy it falls flat on characters and emotions and I would definitely say that Unforgiven's Eastwoods worst movie so far. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play acting and directing, which also adds a drop to the overall appearance of the film. <br /> <br /> All the characters seem to hurry and rip around the edges, especially Eastwoods. Acting does not seem to go through and does not contribute to what the characters feel. The direction is badly confused with unpredictable footage. So overall Unforgiven is not the best Eastwoods and by far one of the worst westerns in the area.
