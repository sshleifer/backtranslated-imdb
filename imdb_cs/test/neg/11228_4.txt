"Crimes of Passion" is a film that is disappointing at most of the actions. Where do I start? Plot? It is desperately simplistic and full of loopholes. Direction? It reminds of a cheap B-movie. Playing? John Laughlin is utterly terrible in his role as "well-aimed-husband-and-frozen-wife" Bobby, Annie Pot is unconvincing as "Frozen Wife" Amy, and it is only Kathleen Turner (above average), and \ t Perkins (Super), who gets open-air acting marks. More specifically, Antony Perkins gives great performance as perverted Reverend Peter Shayne, while Turner manages to portray the role of sexy China Blue and fragile Joanna Crane satisfactorily. Unfortunately, the performances of Turner and Perkins alone are not enough to get the film to a level higher than 4/10. Watch this if you want to see Turner in some sensational scenes (although the film can easily be adapted to the "Basic Instinct" contest), otherwise you will avoid it.
