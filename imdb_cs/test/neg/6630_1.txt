Should I have expected anything other than rotting from Carrot Top? That was on the worst movies I've ever seen. It's by far the worst comedy I've ever seen. "Chairman of the Board of Directors" did not add humor to my attitude, but rather infuriated me. That's right, Carrot Top is such a bad comedian that I'm angry that this guy is making movies.
