Dear Readers, I found in film studies that whenever Michael Bay makes a film, people watch and hate it, yet they see it and it's about $ 100 million. Why? Because Michael Bay is one of the top five directors of all time. Michael Bay stood next to Ridley Scott, Spielberg, Kubrick and Miyazaki and became the best director of Hollywood action. This point is proven with his most panned film, Armageddon. Asteroid of Texas size is on its way to the planet and the only way NASA can think it is to land a men's team on an asteroid, drill into its core, and drop the nuclear warhead in and blow up asteroid. Only one person is qualified enough for this: Bruce Willis. Willis portrays Harry Stamper, a frantic hardened oil who tries to keep what's left of his family. It doesn't help that his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), has an affair with his best driller, AJ (Ben Affleck). Employed by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), NASA chief, Stamper and his tough machines team, they train to become astronauts and save the world. Armageddon is a two-part film. First of all, there are funny parts where we encounter gang and obscenity. Then they get into space and the whole comedy is sucked out of the window and replaced by stunning special effects, great music and great serious acting. Murphy's law is crazy in the second part, which means that everything that can go wrong actually goes wrong, increasing the film's tension to an excellent level. With cool cast and crew (Michael Bay as director, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gale Anne Hurd as producers, and JJ Abrams as one of the screenwriters), tons of special effects, great humor, amazing music and intro alone Mr. Ben-Hur, Charlton Heston, Armageddon Rocks great time.

The F-bomb is used several times and lots of other swear words are also used, plus there is a strip bar scene and an extremely intense second part can be too hard for the baby to handle.
