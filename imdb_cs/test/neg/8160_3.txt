"San Francisco, Oh, you're a marvelously deserted city, thank you, God, for destroying it, and dropping bricks on our collective heads, and throwing tens of thousands of your innocent, obedient sheep into oblivion, O Lord, who are so merciful in your heavenly ways ... "They should have been lyrics to the title track of this oh-so inspiring and totally thoughtless film. The film starts pretty well, with Gable discovering Cinderella with a very annoying but highly valued opera voice, and she soon shoots to fame. One of the many problems with our Cinderella is that it is played by Jeanette MacDonald, who, if she "takes the time" to see all the make-ups and the 30-year-old facade, realizes that she is a bit ugly. Too ugly to play this role. But Gable and everyone else was noticed as if there was some damn beauty or something. Another problem with Cinderella is that her character is so humble, healthy, innocent, loving, loving, kind and generous - all you have to do is throw up for an hour. MacDonald plays her (certainly one-dimensional) role with the kind of "ahhh", "oh", and "ooh" that serves to harass rather than make her sympathetic. Tracy was better, and had better roles than playing this cliché, a heart of gold, a god-loving, non-child-harassing priest (who boxed in his "free time" - as if priests have what to do - how cute). Even the still reliable Gable is not at its usual level; he is too animated and his character is too selfless for someone who is to be an aspiring western "villain" (though, this, of course, is a script error). The storyline is basically this: Gable and his opponent Holt play ping-pong with Cinderella - use it as a ball. As? He works for Gable first, then works for Holt Square, then returns to Gable, only to return to Holt soon. (And, of course, they both want to have her as a girlfriend.) And if the earthquake did not break this table tennis, it is a safe bet that it would be ten more back and forth. The wise-goofy little princess is. There are many, too many in fact, music numbers. It's almost as if they were trying to make the first "catastrophic film musical". How stupid. The stuff she sings in Gable's "common" is okay, but when she leaves those high-ranking, annoying whores during opera segments, it is when I felt my ears were inadvertently and unjustly attacked by hostile sound. In fact, there is an opera number that lasts 6 DAMN MINUTES. 6 may seem small, for those who have no firsthand experience with Vietoperanam with such horrors of sound torture, but it is like dog years; The year of the dog is equivalent to seven human. The opera minute corresponds to 100 minutes of Chinese torture (or dog's acidity on the foot). <br /> <br /> I thought it was a disaster movie, but it's more like a catastrophe movie. (I read that some of the dialogues in this film were written by SILENT-ERA FILM DIRECTOR. Jesus ...) The real star of the film (specifically, the earthquake) broke the melodramatic and occasionally entertaining collections only after half an hour. When the Joe earthquake finally shook the city and our clichés in it, I almost felt glad to say, "Thank God, death and destruction are finally here!". Unfortunately, Joe comes too late for the movie to save him from his growing mediocrity; The scenes of devastation are very good, but even the quake part of the movie gets destroyed (pun) by a very unpleasant, religious ending. You see, Gable, who professes to be an atheist all the time (without using the word himself), finally finds MacDonald alive - after looking for days - and suddenly transformed into a believer because Cinderella is alive?! How stupid! All that says to me is that the character Gable is a weak-sighted moron. The film ends on a very silly note. Gable, who said "thank you" to God for "saving" his girl (and he makes his knees) "finds" God (seeing the light), and the movie is an old old devil Gable transforms himself into a believer. How much the American end, afraid of God ... Of course, no one thought he would ask this "God" why earthquake was the first place in hell! The sad and unintentional irony is that Gable eventually becomes a "fool"; all the while he was kidding "infants" who fall for the holiest scam of all - namely religion - and eventually becomes one. That's what I call the human spirit triumph! Another irony is that the end was to improve Gable as a person, but I see it quite differently; on the contrary: it took only one great Joe to turn to Gable, a humble, humble, small, obedient believer - who joins the sheep family in the world. And as if this intellectual downfall of Gable was not pathetic and unsatisfactory, this first ever "earthquake musical" ends in real hair (take this word as you wish), a noble and hopefully inspiring beautiful mass choir. Scene: Tens (or hundreds) of earthquake survivors and proud, proud citizens of Frisco spontaneously (or "God" perhaps arranged?) sing together a title song in the hope of a better, brighter, no future Joe-less. Hallelujah! If you're a "sucker" for Hollywood sentimentality, don't miss this movie.
