This movie is an average, low budget movie. I saw much worse on MST3K, let me assure you, but that's still a pretty crappy movie. The film is about Clonus, a top-secret government facility in which clones are used to give authorities to politicians. It is an almost Orwellian society, actually: almost (but not entirely) effective. The film starts downhill when the head clone (Tim Connely of Emergency Fame) falls in love with a female clone (Paulette Breen, who appeared in this and at most four other films {and that wasn't her first movie}). They start to suspect something. After finding a beer in a nearby river, a conspiracy begins to crumble. The clone does not receive any answers from the lead scientist (Dick Sarenta of "Bewitched") or "Confessional", a computer that allegedly knows everything, so he returns to the main building of Clonus and (on the scene merrily destroyed by Mike and Bots) finds out the truth (including a clone video that, as incredibly, shows exactly the same method that was used by Dolly cloning five years ago ... and this film was made over twenty years ago ...) about Clonus. They break, two guards watch him. He has one hell of a time to break the two-foot high fences, though he has a much harder time climbing up any boulders. From there it continues to slide. Also appearing are Peter Graves ("Beginning of the End", "Conquered the World") as Presidential Candidate and Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Piranha", "Once Upon a Time in the West") and Lurleen Tuttle ("Ma Barker Killer") Brood "," Psycho ") as an older couple who helps clones after escape. <br /> <br /> The MST3K version was priceless; one of the best episodes ever. Four Stars for Movie, 10 for MST3K.
