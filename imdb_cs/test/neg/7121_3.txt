I loved the first Grudge, I watched him in an empty theater and I was scared with all my sincerity. I had never heard a single sound of chilled sounds before, it was really a grip. Grudge 2, however, had some good jumps, but the story was really messy and not entirely believable, and everywhere, with several scenes (like a woman urinating out of fear, or another young woman who drinking a jug of milk, then it all vomits again, which really did not make sense and did not contribute to increasing the creep factor of the film. During these scenes and several other people, the sold-out audience laughed out loud. This was a good indicator of how this film lacked excitement, chills or horror. The behavior was decent, the emotions portrayed were believable, so the hats outside the actor, but the crowded story and its lack of direction was something I couldn't shake the whole movie. I was more angry than anything else, the same old hoarse sounds, a few quick, unexpected scenes that made me jump, but overall I was very disappointed.
