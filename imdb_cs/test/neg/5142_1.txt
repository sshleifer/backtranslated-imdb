OK ... so ... I really like Kris Kristofferson and his usual easy line delivery in his movies. Age helped him with his soft spoken low-energy style and steals the scene effortlessly. But the disappearance is his wrong step. Holy Moly, this was a bad movie! I have to give cinematography a way and actors, including Kris, for trying to make this goofy, confusing story meaningful. None of this made sense, and Kris probably didn't understand it and was just going through the movements hoping someone would come to him and tell him what it was all about! <br /> <br /> I don't care that everyone on this movie was doing out of love for the project, or some such nonsense ... I saw low budget movies that had a plot for good! It had nothing, zilcho, nada, zippo, no sense ... a complete waste of good talent, scenery and celluloid! <br /> <br /> I have rented this piece of waste for a buck and want my money back! I want my 2 hours back I invested in this class F wasting my time! Do not watch this movie or waste 1 minute of your precious time while browsing the rooms where you play or even open a case that holds a DVD! Believe me, you'll thank me for your advice!
