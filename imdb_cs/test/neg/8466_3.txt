- Includes 1 spoiler, market with: ***** - <br /> <br /> Not featuring as another remake of "The Interview", five fingers actually is. Unfortunately, apart from being a heavy suffering of physical torture, it never contributes to the success of its predecessor in terms of tension, conspiracy or performance. In fact, five fingers never get anywhere near its level. What I found to be particularly painful to watch was not the torture itself, but the way Martijn (Ryan Philippe) handled his suffering. For me, it looked like Philippe was trying too hard to get his accent, and his performance was crazy about amateur, which in turn pulled off the performance of the otherwise big Colm Meaney. Phillipe's accent btw, which is far from the Dutch, sounded more like Eastern Europe. In addition to playing Philippe (who in my surprise has changed from poor to really decent to the end), it depends on the memories of the mysterious Dutch scenery. (If these scenes took place in Switzerland, they should eat the plaster in the mountains with endless pastures with grazing cows wearing expensive watches). Scenography aside, The way these flashbacks pushed the story didn't work for me. It made it to be served as fries at the entrance-and caused a building-up tension straining. It is true that the movie became more fun as Phillipe acting improved, but I couldn't help with being bothered at any moment with scenes that were too unlikely. Eg: <br /> <br /> ************ Start spoiler <br /> <br /> At some point (after days) Philippe is almost gently washed by a female terrorist. This should be followed by a rough cut of another finger. Why give a man to wash if he is tortured? Breaking this last finger seemed to serve just the title of this film anyway. Didn't make sense ??? <br /> <br /> ************ End spoiler <br /> <br /> What followed me was the Fishburn performance that once again turned out to be a great actor , but who also had the best part of the script for work. <br /> <br /> Everyone in all is just far better off seeing "The Interview" with another Matrix icon: Hugo Weaving. And when you do that, I believe you won't find this review so unpleasant. 3.5 / 10 Interview, 1998 www.imdb.com/ title / tt0120714 /
