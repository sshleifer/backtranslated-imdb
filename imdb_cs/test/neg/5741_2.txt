I like vampire movies, I like B-movies, I love vampire movies B. But this has almost nothing for it. Some of the acting are terrible, especially 3 of the male leaders. The story is not particularly interesting. In a relatively short 88 minutes it seems too long and you will find yourself fast. There are plenty of kung fu vampire attacks. Sound cool? It's not when it's on a low budget. This is repeated very quickly. There is some tiny blood and gore, nothing that would be excited. There's some good wire work where you can see the wires. It has some good landscapes that have been shot in Puerto Rico. <br /> <br /> Not worth renting
