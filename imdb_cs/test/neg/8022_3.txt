Three young college women, Simon (Iva Krajnc), Alja (Tanja Potocnik) and Zana (Pia Zemljic) embark on a canoe adventure along the Kolpa River, which divides Slovenia from neighboring Croatia, in this Maya Weiss Slovenian film from 2002. What could have been the East European version of the well-known and exciting film "Deliverance" of 1972 was for me that I was totally missing with flat characters that deny the likeable identification with the characters. Alja and Zana aren't convincing as students at all, although Alja expresses the desire to be a writer, and both use what seemed to me to be too bad a language. Alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to carry away in life. Zana, even less a scholar, is a self-absorbed adventure seeker with attraction to other women. I had a little sympathy with the relatively innocent Simona, the conservative and starry eyes. The very idea of ​​these three passengers just doesn't work for me. The contempt that Zana and Alja point to Simon doesn't make any sense - why would they choose her as a travel companion to be sure she had to know her behavior and attitudes? Three begin a carefree journey down a river on two canoes, not discouraged by the news of the disappearance of a woman along the river. Things become somewhat darker with a mysterious appearance, sometimes a real and sometimes perhaps a hallucinating, angry conservative fishing policy (Jonas Znidarsic). I enjoyed the scenes along the river and the small villages visited by the trio. . It may be due to a lack of cultural understanding, but the film has not moved me differently. I was surprised that the film won several awards.
