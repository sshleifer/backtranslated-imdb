After killing a big dog, a stray cat thinks, "Why can't I be a skunk? Then everyone would leave me alone." He looks around the junkyard and gets an idea: white, black and some Limburger cheese and some garlic ...... hmmmm. Another thing you know, we have the predecessor "Pepe Le Pew", although in this cartoon is still a cat, she's she, and just a skunk in disguise. The cat is also looking forward to taking full advantage of its new condition as a smelly skunk. Now he's a happy, happy boy ..... when a real skunk appears (with Charles Boyer's voice)! I appreciated the cat who wore Bugs Bunny clothes. However, overall, I never cared about these French-takeoff characters, about finding a stereotyped dialogue exaggerated and not about fun. But I do it for morale at the end of the story.
