There are many distinct problems with the film "KillShot". There are too many coincidences for one. The husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day the killer appears, with someone the killer knows. Okay, I'll take it. The boy is calling the real estate agency for which the wife is working, asking for the money to be ready when it comes. Well, I'll take it too. Before going to cash, he decided to rob our killer who didn't kill him, but decided to go to work with him. It's getting really weak. Then they appear on the same day the husband has a conversation with his wife's boss. No one is there, but a wife and a husband who decided to go to an empty office. They get to the office and a professional assassin assumes he is talking to the right guy. This is only in the first 15 menuets. <br /> <br /> There are many more holes in this movie that I care about. Why the killer didn't kill everyone in the real estate agency I don't know. Why didn't he shoot a woman on the porch, I don't know. Why did that stupid guy let all those stupid moves and mess up a lot of crap, I don't know. Why was this girlfriend in the movie, I don't know. Why he decided not to unload the gun and leave it on the counter, I don't know. Why did they even go to the witness protection program, I don't know. What I know is that the director of Casting did a great job, the director of the photo did a very good job, the scout location picked up great places and the production designer was worth every penny. So my advice to anyone who chooses a scenario that works so well for the crew is to make sure that any attempt to kill someone who is hit is not overcome by the top of the open window.
