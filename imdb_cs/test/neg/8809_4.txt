Eh. This is a popcorn movie, nothing more. I watched it with a lot of friends (and although it may not be the best way to see the horror ...) and most of the dialogue and action was ridiculous. It left me a desire for a real movie. :) <br /> <br /> The main problem is the lack of tension in the film. It keeps flashing back to the 'explanation' of the scene that will dissipate any recognizable voltage. And the relationship of 'twists'? Yeah, suck. I won't say what they are, but they just don't add anything to the film / story. <br /> <br /> (According to the relationship I mean two main characters.) <br /> <br /> Eek. My recommendation is this: watch this movie if you can't think of anything better. At best average ... Maybe not.
