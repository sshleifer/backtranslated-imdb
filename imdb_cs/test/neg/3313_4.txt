White spots and different shapes, beautiful nude, random pictures. This is what this little experimental short film is. It's pretty interesting to think about how such paintings can be transferred to film in the early days of the film, but despite my love for the many unreal images and movies and the bizarre fascination, this movie just didn't do it for me. I'm sorry I followed it, but if there is any basic meaning in it, I don't do it. Visually, it's not so great in my humble opinion. As an example of Dada, I think it would fit quite well because it seems to reject any semblance of logic or reason, even if I would rather do it in a more visually interesting way. But to everyone.
