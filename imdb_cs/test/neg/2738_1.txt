The script of this film is indistinguishable from others, most notably The Core, another bad film. It's pretty clear why Luke Perry doesn't have much to do, but to see his beloved Lieutenant Worf (Michael Dorn) resign from something like that, it's just sad. I really can't think of one plot that can't be seen a mile away. This is not exaggerated. <br /> <br /> Special effects are very bad, even TV standards. The lava flow at the beginning of the film signaling the upcoming global disaster begins at a very amateur level. And from that moment it is no better.
