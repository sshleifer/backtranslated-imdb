This pretty poor Italian film, which boasts very good special effects from Rick Baker and Deran Serafian, deserves some recognition. Cerchi gains recognition for still doing gore flicks, while most other Italian directors (Ruggero Deodato, Sergio Martino, Lamberto Bava and Enzo G. Castellari) are turning to lower-priced TV movies. As far as plankton is concerned, it is half Piranha - half The Thing, where people turn to monsters, rape women and cause general chaos. The ultra-filthy, slim and exaggerated feel of the film makes it more enjoyable. Available only in Italian-language works prints floating around.
