With horrible action, terrible dialogue, a lot of bad humor, a miserable storyline, and a horrible movie. It has to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I'm the king of finding bad movies. For effects, they just threw fake blood on people and things, didn't spend time creating blows and making special effects worth something. Most people who make low budget horror flicks at least do something like tissue clads or something to do a blow. The dialogue was far from decent and the acting was without direction and effort. They just threw several actors on the set and said they got it. I swear I saw better movies from my first class movie at school. How did it ever get a DVD release?
