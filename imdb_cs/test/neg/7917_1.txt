I loved all the dogs to go to heaven so much that I went to see the sequel to the theater, and I can't remember that I'm more disappointed with the movie. The story disgusted worse than an exaggerated bag of dung. I mean, come on! How could Carface imagine that he could avenge himself on an animal much larger than him, no matter how angry he was. Plus showing Satan as CAT?!?! How can you get a cliche? So much for the story. No wonder Don Bluth, Burt Reynolds, Melba Moore and Vic Tayback would have touched him with a 10-foot pole? The animation was totally pathetic. All colors were washed out and I can't count how many times I was able to see through the objects that were supposed to be solid. It must have been the worst animation I've ever seen! I usually like animated movies but not this BOMB!
