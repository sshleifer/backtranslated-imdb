I tried to watch this movie 3 to 4 times, but I can't get through that all that is on it is just terrible. I'm sure it was a brave move by someone to cast Jack Palance as a protagonist, but there's no one thread of my being who believes he could act at all, much less act against the type. Yes, I understand that Clifford Odets was a brilliant author, but here it is not evident. This peculiar and forced mish-mash of the 50s lumbar dialogue seems to thwart any true meaning that explains why none of the actors, even the good guys (Steiger, Ida Lupino, Shelly Winters, Everett Sloane), knows how to be able to deliver their lines - It's like they don't understand the meaning of what they say. And meanwhile, Wendell Corey and Palance cut an amazing match to see who can be more of a stone face. <br /> <br /> The direction is amateurish and completely crowded. The physical interaction between the characters is just as dialogical as the dialogue. Can we discuss this nasty file? It is so busy, ugly and fanciful that it contributes to robotic, disconnected character quality, dialogue and display. It seems that this film is sucking in energy directly from me. It looks like each of them overdose Valium every morning when they arrived on the set. It takes a pretty lousy movie to make Rod Steiger and Shelly Winters look bad, but this succeeds. I see it could have been effective as a game on or off Broadway, where intellectuals and beats could congratulate on appreciation of the power of conspiracy and the artillery flourishing of a pseudo-lateral dialogue.
