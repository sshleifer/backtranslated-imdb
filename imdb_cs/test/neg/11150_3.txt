To sum it up, skip the End of Days and watch the location of the Roman Polansk√°. This film is the perfect stereotypical American film vs Ninth Gate as a perfect stereotypical European film. Ninth Gate: Noir-ish, intelligent, pretty scored, atmospheric, superb performance (Johnny Depp, esp), beautiful scenery, good cinematography, funny one-liners, intellectual, minimal harsh language, provocative thought. The only mistake is that a few people did not understand the end-end and said the movie was "miserable" and that was why there were several dubious scenes. End of Days: Too violent, liberal use of bad language, no musical score, except for a bad commercial soundtrack that was only heard when Gabriel Byrne walked past NYC as Satan (but everything, what could he choose, was Korn's Jonathan Davis unintelligible shouting), sex, had nothing to do with the violence, the incredibly predictable, the violence, and I mentioned much more violence? I think some of the special effects were good, but that's about it. Well, maybe I'm wrong, but I thought the Ninth Gate was more interesting, more unpredictable, original and intelligent. But maybe the Americans don't need it. * Drip Cynicism * Even though I'm an American, I sometimes wonder.
