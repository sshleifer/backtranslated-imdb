No Holds Barred is a movie that should never be taken seriously. It's sucking hardcore as a serious movie. Look at it more in the way you plan 9 from space. They are one in the same in that they are both so bad they are funny. Funny moments in No Holds Barred are usually the ones that aren't supposed to be. When Rip (played by Hulk Hogan as just he can play) he catches the limo driver from the front after his first encounter with Brell (Kurt Fuller) merriment follows and that is one part of the movie that everyone should see. It can be the funniest scene ever, I swear. Anyway, as someone thought this movie would make money that I never know, and that man would probably be defeated into submission. I hope they were at least released. This movie earns 1 out of 5 on my scale and it is just for inadvertently funny parts.
