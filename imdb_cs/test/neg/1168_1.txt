My thoughts on watching this movie (despite the fact that it was free) was more or less out of curiosity ... mild, mild curiosity ... It wasn't all that I was familiar with this biographical "biographical" video of Mr. Gein's description and discovered during The opening credits that it featured were the horror icon Kane Hodder in the lead role. My emotions have changed not only from curiosity, but from a glimpse of mild expectation, as Geina would show. Also in credits (among some grim photographs of Ed crimes) was Michael Berryman and Priscilla Barns. "Okay," I thought ... "That can be a little fun". As the film began and progressed (slowly), my microscopic self-confidence (or, as I say, "micro-hope") faded completely for this film, and I was stuck in a staggering sense of humiliation as I died a little inside to watch the dung. Hodder, widely known and respected for his past work as an unstoppable serial killer, states inaccurately that it is here - the rotation of Eddie Gein from a slightly praised murder, into a massive, full-fledged killing machine. At night he lurks, kills cemetery guards, his tombs and teenage girls, leaving Plainfield in panic, as the local sheriff's department does not seem to do anything to minimize the dangerous situation. The deputy and his mom have a warm little relationship that gave me a fuzzy feeling inside (or it could just be a cyanide pill I spent in half this turkey). I'm not sure what the movie was and the director didn't know anything about the subject he was working with. There are already so many films about Gein's story that if "Ed Gein Snuff Footage" doesn't appear, I don't want to see them anymore. If you want a more authentic film of this nature than look at the 2001 "Ed Gein (aka in the Moonlight)".
