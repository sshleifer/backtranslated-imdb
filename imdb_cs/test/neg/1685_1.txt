Lets be realistic. This is one of the worst shows I've ever seen. My wife and children showed a real promise in their first season and then only dropped. It's so bad they don't describe words. Impressions and writing are so horrible on a consistent basis I wonder if Damon Wayans produced such a terrible show for purpose. From top to bottom, every performance is ridiculous. Damon Wayans makes a phone call and George Gore II is so terrible that I crouch on every exaggerated line. Can anyone really watch this show and find it fun, let alone funny? Please, I beg you. Don't watch this show. When TV affiliates stop picking up in syndication, we can finally get rid of this absolute waste.
