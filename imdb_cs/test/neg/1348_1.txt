I was very disappointed with this movie. Mrs. English, who says she is a fan of the original film, seemed to have a great deal of art work and transformed it into an apartment-lined "ho-hum" you came a long way to child production. I tried to remind me of Mary Haines, but she was just boring. She didn't feel anything about her husband's relationship. There was no emotional struggle, no deep pain. In the original 1939 movie, Mary Heares felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. Production in 2008 was more about some fake sister theme (actually my wife's words) and didn't make you tear or laugh. The only performance I noticed is that we're from Debra Messing and Bette Midler. (I wanted more Bette.) There was no protagonist in this movie. Sylvia Fowler's character had too many subtopics. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The remake of the department store meeting with Annette Benning and Miss Mendez was Luke warm. Also, stimulation was also slow. Obviously, the 1939 version had to be updated, but it wasn't. The reason why the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "human" problems. Subject by the way, which is not outdated. The magic of the original film was that the film is about both sexes, while men have never seen it.
