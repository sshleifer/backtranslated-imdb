God, I never felt so offended in my whole life than with that stupid thing. There are many ways to describe this piece of bullshit that I think if I said everything I thought this site would forbid me. <br /> <br /> How do I get started? Well, for one, it doesn't take the knowledge of the original series to know that this movie is smacked into the faces of the people who have seen it. The biggest defeat of the theme song ever made is here, from the metal version to the crazy RAP VERSION, what did they think? How does Underdog and Electronic Heavy Music Style Suit? The story is so basic that I do something I usually don't do, nor will I give a summary. I just think: a dog gets a superpower, fills the rest. This is how this movie is predictable. And then comes the jokes ... please kill me now. This style of humor that couldn't even get kids laughing, it's so bad, well, expect to punch the line after sneezing. That was a little funny. But what surprises me is why Jason Lee (Ny Name Is Earl), Patrick Warburton (Emperor's New Groove) and Jim Belushi (by Jim). In the shows / movies I mentioned, the actors, in my opinion, are doing a good job, and besides Lee they are the best actors in this movie, but it says very little. The rest deserves the Golden Rasberry nomination for this crap. I am very sad to see such good players buried in this disaster. All in all, it's as bad as Doogal, which I also reviewed. nothing worse than this.
