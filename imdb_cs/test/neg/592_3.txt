All those in PC culture are horrified by the dogmatic Christian view of this film. He claims to contain racist ideas and / or religious intolerance. Those who do not care about it but are oriented towards neat production values ​​and competent actions are appalled at the lack of such here. Those who adore both are apoplectic, that this production has been released to the general public, as the comments here show. Br /> <br /> What is an interesting premise that is not original, but a combination of GHOST and FROM BEYOND, is in this film somewhat immature, but with a touch of taste. What the crew and actors lacked sensitivity, professional abilities and technical knowledge is somewhat compensated by the intensity they display. It's not as bad as many think, and it would be fine. Hands of someone with maturity and common sense, and it is enough under mediocrity to provoke laughter and moan. However, it develops with sufficient intensity to maintain interest throughout, and is close to par with Corman-produced entry of his earliest period of work, or material by Arkoff or Sam Katzman. If you do it for $ 2 (or less), like me, you won't feel disappointed, but you'll want you to have the word as it was done.
