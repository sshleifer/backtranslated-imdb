I just wasted my Saturday night watching this crap! I saw the names of Chris Noth (Mr. Big, "Sex & the City"), Robert Patrick ("X-Files"), decadent Elliot Gould, Colm Meaney and Mercedes Ruehl on credit; very sensible evaluation of IMDb (5.6); and many good reviews in IMDb. For my total surprise, the film is terrible: the characters are badly built; the story tries to be funny, but it's totally stupid; the character Mercedes Ruehl is amazingly stupid for Professor Princeton. So I decided to explore the credibility of good reviews and found that most of them are IMDb users who only have a review, hence relatives or friends of cast and crew, or people hired to support this waste. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Sem Retorno" ("No Return")
