One of the reviewers wrote: "Good acting, good special effects, great <br /> <br /> location. Even better." All I can say is: "Ugh." This film was painful to watch. Let me start by saying this: I'm a lot of people I know, very conservative. So what I'm about to say is not distorted by the "Christian content" of the movie. I won't be bash because he's a Christian. I'll give him 2/10 because he's a horrible movie. Writing is bad at the top, WAY too prophesies, and much of the "preaching" thing is simply irrelevant to the story. It's just for a bad scenario. Whether I agree with the screenwriters' conviction is irrelevant - making a good scenario that flows well, stays on track and is credible. The meeting was at best amateur. But hey, when you cast amateurs, you get <br /> <br /> amateur performances. Dirk Been can be on "Survivor" but the show <br /> <br /> requires ZERO's acting skills. Playing on his name and saying sell units is in bad taste. The cast of unknowns who can act and have a much better film. The effects were HORRIBLE. The scene with the hail and the subsequent fall of the stars was awkward to watch. And what was so great at the end? That didn't make sense. Yeah, I know what Tim Chey did for you, but he missed the time. I bought this movie and expected much more based on reviews and misinformation on my website. And while I was hoping for another, I got what I always get when I look at "Christian" movies - under the budget, a badly written, pathetically bred, poorly made piece of ka-ka. Maybe someday someone will finally get to the end-of-film movie so well written and as good as Gibson's "Passion ...". 2/10 stars.
