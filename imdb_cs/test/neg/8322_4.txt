This film is terrible, not the fault of Jesus Frank, because his is not his fault. This movie was shot for many years by Welles when he got the money to get the crew and actors together to do some shooting. It's not clear how much Welles isn't actually filmed, though not all movies or all the sequences are here, because several "key" sequences, such as Quixote in the cinema, are in the hands of collectors or supporters who wouldn't surrender. The film is only less than two hours long and it would be hard to imagine that it really worked in any length. I am of the opinion, based on some remarks Welles made before his death, that he never really intended to release the film, but put it together as a personal toy. <br /> <br /> What exists here is largely beautifully shot, but dramatically dead. Very little happens in the first hour than Quixote and Sancho, who wander around the country. Blunt would be a kind description of the material. In the second hour Quixote ends up in modern Spain and in a series of not very good sequences deals with everyday life. This does not mean that there are not a few nice moments, the windmill and the chicken sequences are pretty good, but most of it is a huge waste of film and time. "Completed" Jesus Franco, who was the director of Welles' assistant on the much superior Chimes at midnight, has a lot of movie fragments that have been put together as best as possible. Many people crucified Franco as the reason why the film stinks, but frankly one cannot make a good crap movie. One critic noted that in the 1970s he saw another film cut, which meant that Franco had created this version on his own and destroyed it. While this may be true, I ran across Welles' stories and re-cutting the film many times over the years, because it never succeeded. This movie is horrible no matter how you split it up. Finally, I was wondering how good the film producer Welles was. In addition to Kane's citizen, almost all of his films were plagued by lack of budget or interference, so we had the excuse that many of his films "would be better if only ...". How do we know? How can we know? Perhaps Welles was a man with less talent than we thought, and many of his frontier films are not so good and would never be. While this is not the place where Welles can be argued in film history, Don Quixote's surviving material, assuming it is close to what Welles intended (I think it does), is a good reason to re-evaluate how we see it. man and his work. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 for good sequences (although 2 out of 10 is probably closer to reality)
