To save some very early Norris, "Breaker, Breaker" has nothing to offer that cannot be found ten times better on any broadcast channel. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. In spite of this, I watched it, pushed a quick forward button because the acting was so terrible that it was comic. Of course, the film is supposed to be an action / drama, but it has proven to be a treatise on how NOT to make a film. All that could be wrong with the movie is on the screen in this "dog". If this happens across, let him see. It's so bad, it's funny.
