I saw this movie purely on the fact that it was on the DPP Video Nasty list, and when I'm glad I saw it because it's now 'another Nasty Down Video' - on its own merits, Andy Milligan's movie isn't really worth it to bother. Of course there are much worse films on the infamous list; But that doesn't mean it's easy. The film was apparently filmed on an extremely low budget that was translated into a script; as Blood Rites is working on an idea that often appears in horror movies, and does nothing new about it. Basically, the plot focuses on three couples who find themselves in a house waiting for the results of the will. It's not long before they get picked up ... blah blah blah. Nothing happens to most of the movie; and then when we finally get into scenes that justify a forbidden movie, they're so amateurish and stupid that it's impossible to take it seriously at any level. It is a very good thing that this film does not have a very long run time, otherwise it could be used as a particularly ugly method of torture. It all boils down to a suitably boring ending that also succeeds in being a non-epic event event. It seems that this film is still banned in the UK; but somehow I doubt it's because of his shock value. Basically, blood ceremonies are not worth seeing and I personally don't see any reason to recommend it. Of course, if you haven't made your business to see everything on the Video Nasty ...
