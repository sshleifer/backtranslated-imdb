Once in a while I will watch a movie that will surprise me completely. The one who comes out of nowhere to be a little exciting fun. The one that is pure fun from start to finish. Well people when a stranger calls not the movie. It is an incredible stupid and far-off remake of the much better 1979 classic horror camp. Every clich√© in the world is used here from a silly cat-jumping-out-of-a-hidden-place car that doesn't start a killer anywhere at any time. This movie is bad ... not bad at "so bad it's a good way," more at "so bad it's a boring way." Skip this goddamn movie and save the movie for something else. You'll thank me later, believe me. Grade: D-
