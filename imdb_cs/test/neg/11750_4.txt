The most appropriate film in the history of cinema is a strong rival, why waste so much money on such unnecessary useless work? The only difference between HItchcock classic and this poor imitation is color, widescreen, and Leila Walkman !! The film, which is to generate excitement and fear, leaves me completely indifferent. Don't you say it will urge the young generation to see the original? balderdash! This "psycho 1998" is a giant spoiler. They could have done something else, for example by throwing the actor closer to Bloch. with Bates, an obese man. They contain unpleasant rehash and smallpox on it, and Alfred Hitchcock has lived for a long time!
