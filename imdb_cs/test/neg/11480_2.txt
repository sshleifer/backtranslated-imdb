This should be named "Everyone Loves Sebastian". The 1983 rural city high school (or older? - seemed to flip the flop on this one) with strange hair and a good look "Leo-like" has a big plate full of trouble. His step-dad announces definitive plans for a sex change operation that his mom calls to end the marriage; Sebastian is called "f" by everyone and their mother, while everyone is "kissing" with various girls who are preparing for a high-level Ready-Whip at the supermarket and saving the "strawberry" prostitute from the clutches of her ruthless pimp. Sebastian "Friends" Eddie Haskal looked like a choir boy; bad association won't get worse. Sebastian seems to be a "Harold" suicide attempted suicide (even if he doesn't allow suicidal tendencies). No obvious reason why the genius level SAT score Sebastian has to pass a year early, even though he has no idea of ​​the future, nor does he want to attend college (what does he give with this nonsense?). The movie is a look into a few weeks in the life of someone who is PRETTY MESSED UP. The final scene suggests that things will be fine, even if HOW is entirely left to the viewer. <br /> <br /> The creators of this film seem to bank only on the undisputed appeal of a very attractive male lead. "Story" leaves much to be desired. Looking for "what will this wonderful child do next ...?" not satisfied. Outstanding production values ​​simply do not measure to other films, independently or otherwise. A low budget and a weak story need more than just a pretty face. The "results" of this project are forgotten and insulting intelligent cinema fans.
