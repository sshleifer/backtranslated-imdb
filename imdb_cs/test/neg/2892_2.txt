This movie is honestly one of the biggest movies of all time ... if you suffer from insomnia. It's a crazy way to guarantee your sleep time. As the film progresses slowly, viewers slip into a state of unconsciousness and gradually lose sight of any conspiracy that the film might actually contain. This effect is certainly created because of the lack of sweet action / sweet girls. Of course, Mr. Eisenstein was able to master the art of assembly. An example of this is the scene at Odessa. For whatever reason, an event that would take a few seconds in real life would turn into a seven-minute nightmare for every healthy viewer. This editing bug spoils any kind of realism throughout the movie. Frankly, I saw more realistic adjustments following the cartoons. Some individuals who commented on this title celebrated the Potemkin battleship as: "One of the greatest films of all time" and "A Really Masterpiece". Well, I'm writing this comment to convince the reader to avoid watching this movie at any cost. My best guess is that my Potemkin critics simply wrote the wrong words in their summary. Certainly what they wanted to say was: "One of the greatest snooze-fests of all time" and "Really Epic Failure". Finally, don't waste your time. If you're interested in watching a movie with a much better quality, go to www.youtube.com and watch the Halo 3 installation. then tea bag his dead body. PEACE!
