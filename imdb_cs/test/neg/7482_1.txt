Carson Daly must be the only hostess who is not a comedian. What was NBC thinking! Not funny! Writing is terrible! All sketches are painful to watch. The current new karaoke is not funny at all, especially because it tells you what they will sing before they sing! Escalator talks are just stupid and needless to say they're not funny at all. All the jokes, especially during the monologue, are the least clever, stupid, not funny jokes that have ever been on TV! I mean, whenever she makes a joke to Jessica Simpson, it ends with "because he's stupid", which cancels any joking that was already very low. Every 3 years old could come up with some of the jokes and sketches that made this lame apology for the show. Seriously, don't look at this show if you're on the edge of suicide and don't want anything to push you over the edge.
