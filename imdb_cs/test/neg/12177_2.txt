If this movie were in English, all critics would have thwarted it. The language is very bad, the scenes are terribly directed and it's not funny at all. After the film, I thought this movie could be written by a 8th grader, at least if you were thinking of a lack of credible characters and fixation on a certain part of the male body. (Oh, also on dogs ...) The story is simple nonsense compared to the more advanced Vingar and glas, which premiered almost at the same time. Of course, the public chose Jalla! Jalla! while Vingar and glas received little attention. <br /> <br /> It was really worrying for me that the movie looked really bad. Probably because the first director Josef Fares used really cheap camera equipment and then decided to play with him for fun. However, the result is a film that can be easily divided into 12 short films with a new directorial style in each of them. That was very frustrating. Perhaps Josef Fares should have stayed with his short films because it seems to be the only art form he can handle. Another worrying fact is that it does not hold the story together. The story has to move very quickly in the middle of the movie and the characters get in the way so that it's incredible. And then I didn't mention two-dimensional characters, especially those in support roles. Although I consider it one of the worst Swedish films of the 1990s and one of the most overrated, it's kind of understandable that he likes the public. I mean, bad taste has always been a trademark of the masses. I'm more surprised that the critics enjoyed it. They should have known better ... <br /> <br /> Level 2 of 10 <br /> <br />
