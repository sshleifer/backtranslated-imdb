At the opening night of the Silent Film Festival in San Francisco, I was very excited to see films that are historic and not common. The guest speaker, who opened the film, created a sense of hype to the dark and how this film is underestimated. The science fiction part of the movie was very interesting and fantastic for the time, but I'm not sure if it was because of the fact that it was right after Brilliant 1928 "The Wind", or if Russian filmmakers seemed to be after what Russian novels are famous (hundreds of characters, convoluted plot), but I know for sure that dramatic parts, like in parts on Earth, made no sense at all, were boring and I got lost in twenty minutes. Maybe it was acting, but I was convinced why this film is "unknown and underestimated": it's boring, there's no storyline or a basic story and acting is terrible. This is definitely not a "Potemkin battleship," but I will say that Russian films do not make life in Russia really good.
