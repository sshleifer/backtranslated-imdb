Mount Godwin-Austin (otherwise known as K2) is the second highest mountain in the world and if it is to be believed it is the hardest mountain that could be successful without being killed. "K2" is basically a buddy movie that takes place in the amazingly dangerous world of mountaineering. While outdoor photos are in some really amazing scenery, the characters standing in front of all these wonderful landscapes are roaring drilling - and that's the fault of the whole movie. Cocksure Taylor Brooks (Michael Biehn) and his quietly married friend Harold Jamieson (Matt Craven) spend their free time climbing. During one of their trips, they meet another mountaineer bundle funded by wealthy mountain enthusiast Philip Claibourne (Raymond J. Barry). Claibourne's team is in training for the upcoming shot of the infamous K2, a mountain that Taylor and Harold love but couldn't afford. But during their training run, two of Claibourne's teams are killed in an avalanche. Taylor and Harold showed themselves as potential substitutes. Despite their initial reluctance, Claibourne nodded, and the pair joined his team in the Himalayas. Harold's wife Cindy (Julia Nickson-Soul) is upset that her husband is going to such a dangerous climb, especially since he recently became a father. Tension in the Mount Taylor climbing team has repeatedly encountered another member of the band, just as brash and arrogant Dallas Woolf (Luca Bercovici). Meanwhile, Claibourne himself grows increasingly sick because high altitude sickness levies a tax on his body. Will the guys reach the top of K2, or is their search destined to end disappointment or even death? <br /> <br /> "K2" spends an extremely long time introducing its somewhat unfavorable characters. Particularly difficult is Biehn as a nasty, ambitious, adventurous type, as well as Barry as a stubborn mountaineer. But on the other side of the coin, Craven is so boring that it is hard to believe that his wife could give a damn about going to climb the K2 - damn, it would be better if he never came back !! The main characters are Bercovici, whose character as Dallas Woolf is like campy and over-the-top like any other role he has ever played. The story itself is absolutely tame and one-time? just a straightforward yarn about the guys trying to get to the top of the mountain. There's a bit of male ties, but the whole subplot about Harold and his wife is zero, and the personal clashes between Taylor and Dallas ring are totally false. "K2" deserves little of the stunning cinematography of Gabriel Berastain? during the Himalayan sequences, the extent and horror of the mountains are very nicely captured. I am totally in touch with critic Kim Newman on this one, who said cheerfully in the Empire magazine: "On this evidence, K2 climbing can be no harder than sitting in it!" Pretty true, Kim, that's right!
