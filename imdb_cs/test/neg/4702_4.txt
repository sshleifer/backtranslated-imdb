Five years after the American Civil War, Western people are more concerned with the age-old war between homesteads and cattle farmers. Cattlemen their herd of goods, from Texas to Trail City Abilene, Kansas. Cowboys will find here not only big money, but also a great confrontation with the settlers. Tall in the saddle Marshal Randolph Scott (as Dan Mitchell) seeks to maintain peace in the city. Mr. Scott has experience as a mediator between paths and patrons. He also juggles with the city's most beautiful looking women: sexy saloon singer Ann Dvorak (like Rita) and pretty lady of the church Rhonda Fleming (like Sherry). Rich County Sheriff Edgar Buchanan (like Bravo Trimble) offers more comic relief than helping with sharp shooting. in the church; The camera then switches to Mrs. Dvořák's sexy singing of her salon number, which causes the man to fire his weapon out of joy. After that, it really becomes quite standard west; This is somewhat boring than it should be, but not quite terrible. Young Lloyd Bridges appears as one of the settlers. Dvořák's costume is the greatest benefit of the film; in it is the real mover. **** Abilene City (1.11.16) Edwin L. Marin ~ Randolph Scott, Ann Dvorak, Edgar Buchanan
