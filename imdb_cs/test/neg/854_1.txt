technically, this movie would have everything: decent actors, nice landscapes, no obvious sights of budget shortage, celebrity like richard attenborough. the summary of the conspiracy also sounded promising, suggesting a satire of silly bureaucracy and ordinary people who outsmarted it. nevertheless it never gives. the plot is simply too illogical. throughout the film, not one person does one reasonable thing. mad politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain dead villagers - all just from one incredible situation to the next. what everyone doesn't make sense in outside context of the current scene. Of course, this kind of film must be absurd and exaggerated. however, it is also supposed to have at least one example to point out the madness behind the division of the city in the middle. in fact, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who does not seem to have a clue about what is going on with him, and "writer", who occasionally bursts jokes from off that might be an audience composed of only 12 years old. What I found most impressed is that the film is trying to be funny all the time, but didn't make me laugh once. I've seen some bad "funny" movies, but by then, each of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs. So in this sense, "puckoon" is really remarkable. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot, check out "Brazil". Don't waste time on "puckoon".
