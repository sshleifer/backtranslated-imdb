I really should give this stinker more credit to that 1 star because the film has so many eye-rolling lines that it's almost worth the rental price. Acting, if you want to call it, is so hot and fanciful that it makes Ed Wood the actor's life. "Sammy," a lone black character, must be Mimi's husband in real life because he appears in his other movies, but he has no acting ability. His lines are invaluable because of his absurd delivery, although I suspect the intention was to create a likable character. His old man forms in his next turkey ("Pushed To The Limit") is a no-budget, junior high school quality, with a cotton ball eyebrow and white spray painted hair. I can't understand anyone actually buying this video if people don't like throwing their own Mystery Science Theater and need a copy of something like that at hand. It's really Beyond Fear - it's actually Beyond Funny.
