I haven't seen this movie when it originally came out, but there were a few songs that share the title and the term is still used from time to time and I thought it must be something for the movie, so I dug it and gave it a look. Now I would like me to come back for about an hour and forty-five minutes of my life (it seemed much longer). There was nothing particularly bad about the movie, the acting was good, no big conspiracy, of course there wasn't much plot to have holes. There was some chemistry between the two, but nothing about their relationship was anything convincing; There's nothing interesting about their story. Near the end, as he tries to chase a train to catch his fleeing romance, neither my wife nor I wanted him to catch her. We honestly thought they'd be better off with them, and if they came back together, we really wouldn't care. So what does it say about this love story when even a 25-year-old sappy romantic like my wife had no emotional investment in the relationship. I should have left this one in the "missed" category.
