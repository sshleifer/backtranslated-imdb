I do not review the IMDb earlier, but this document is so overrated that I felt compelled to bleed. I wouldn't even finish if I wasn't a guest in someone's house. The film was bad at many levels: First - Treadwell's video was created. The more I looked, the more he seemed to act as a person desperate to be famous, instead of acting out of conviction. Second, the others in the film, with the exception of Treadwell's parents and the Airline Pilot, were as resourceful and frantic as he was. God, he knows how. Third - Treadwell's mission to protect bears makes no sense because he has done more harm than good by getting used to the human presence. I believe Treadwell really loves bears, but there are many researches that suggest his efforts were misleading. Sometimes we have to sacrifice our wildlife pleasures to really help. Fourth, the fun value of the film was not half that of other wildlife films, such as "March of Penguins" and "Winged Migration." The filmmakers, in my opinion, did a bad job of sequencing the scenes and gave little incentive to observe. As a person who loves Alaska, bears and other wildlife, I'd like to see more people dedicated to protecting our wild. Hopefully their efforts will be less focused on people.
