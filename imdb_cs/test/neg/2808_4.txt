I didn't expect too much from this movie, but I was still disappointed. It's supposed to be a comedy, but there are only four or five scenes where I actually laughed, and I think it's pretty poor. There is no real plot, I always felt that most of the scenes could be placed anywhere in the movie because there is no connection between them. But the worst was "playing" Kim Franke. Throughout the film, ONE facial expression is as if a retarded guy should play, but I do not believe it is. All in all, I rate four out of ten, I saw worse movies than this, but I wouldn't spend money on this again.
