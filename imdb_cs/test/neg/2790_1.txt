The first introductory scene, which lasted about five minutes, showed the potential to become an instant classic, progress to good acting, a good movie, a story that keeps the volume up and in the corner of the screen a scary "you saw it!" br /> <br /> After setting the history quickly, it would be as if someone else wrote and directed the rest of the movie, and the next scene is the basic outline of how the movie goes downhill as a truck. that the rest was shot in the video, with the miserable "porn star actors", the scenography was a lawyers' office on virtually shelves or in the office, nothing at all. I remember watching just horrible horror movies to see some nude "teens" girls, there weren't Victoria's Secret magic everywhere, and didn't follow things that make great horror movies of today like gaming, terror, suspense, intregue, and so on. <br /> The first person died almost fifty minutes.When he did, my friends and I were so shocked by the worst costume of "monsters" EVER, we are through our popcorn on the TV screen.
