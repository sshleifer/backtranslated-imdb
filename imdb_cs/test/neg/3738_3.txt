Celebrity singers have always had a hard time breaking through movies (the cinema is dotted with failed attempts), and one can go on and on speculation why John Mellencamp never made it great as an actor. Instead of taking small parts in small projects, Mellencamp dove directly into "Falling From Grace", which he also directed, and the results are as inappropriate and inappropriate as this title. The story of a famous singer returning to his hometown in shaving, opening old family wounds, boasts Larry McMurtry's script, but the meandering film doesn't go anywhere. The support cast is decent, including Kay Lenz (who is always nice to see), Mariel Hemingway and Claude Akins (who share one really strong scene in the picture). Regarding John's actions, he does not look particularly good, despite obvious efforts to look at him at home; It seems that most of the time the stove sticks to the camera, and never joins the audience immediately. * 1/2 from ****
