After a humiliating experience on the plane, Nashawn Wade (Kevin Hart) sues the airline and uses the money he wins to establish his own full-service airline. His difference is that he has sexy flight attendants, a dance club aboard and no less than Captain Snoop Dogg in the cockpit. Soul Plane is a very racist comedy with the exception that it is only occasionally fun. Soul Plane has been described as an "urban" version of the aircraft. The problem is that Soul Plane will not even come close to achieving the laughter of the plane. The jokes in Seoul Lord are too offensive and are mostly unoriginal. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't laughing because there were some funny moments. But I waited more and I left the theater disappointed. I'd compare Soul Plane with Airplane 2. The other one was just rehash the first movie, while the other one is just rehash outdated, crude jokes. There is really no creativity behind the film and there are just a few fun places. But I don't think Soul Plane is "bottom 100" bad. Right now, the movie is ranked number 82 and it's a bit cruel. I'm not saying it's a good movie, but it's not terrible either. Running time is just 86 minutes, so it's not much attention. For silly comedies, you can do much worse. Nobody in the cast is very good, but everyone seems to be having fun and it helps. Kevin Hart was very annoying as Nashawn. He had a few funny lines, but he's a very poor leading man. Snoop Dogg, who was slightly witty in Star and Hutch, disappears here. Tom Arnold was actually tolerable and it was the biggest surprise of the film. The most unpleasant person in the movie was Ryan Pinkston. He wasn't funny at all and would never be funny. The funniest members were Missi Pyle and Mo'Nique. They gave the best lines and they laughed at me the most. Finally, Soul Plane can fit into your account if you're looking for a silly comedy, but it would probably be better if you skip the movie. Rating 4/10
