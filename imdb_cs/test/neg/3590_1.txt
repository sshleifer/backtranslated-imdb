I rated this movie 1/10 and did it in good nature. This movie doesn't seem to and I don t get point it. Take for example the first joke. The beginning of their sign at the beginning. well that it was okay but then they start having some boy talking about the hood and then dying then their other guys who speak then dies after the other says people don, t get on their birthday with the dying. and now he gets a cake. then he dies. Jokes are just stupid, they're that smart and I'd think they'd be better off from someone like a scary movie director: Shawn Wayans (wrote) and Marlon Wayans (wrote) & Phil Beauman (wrote) <br /> <br /> but it sucked and I hop next time want to do other comedies that make some good jokes not lame you.
