I can't believe I actually created a "season" on my TiVo for it, apparently had a good preview or something. After seeing for about 5 minutes, I wondered why I was looking at it. really. ACTING ... (if you can call it) is terrible. The only ones that are nearly 5% decent are girls who are tasked with drawing viewers for the show. this train wreck .. if they had more lines, they would probably change my mind because they probably don't even have the talent. It is clearly a very low budget production with "actors" who are probably very cheap. There is no way they could get a job in something else. Someone has to direct these people to work in a food service. And by the way, Parco P.I. already takes up space on the TiVo or TiVo season cards. Definitely the worst show I've ever seen.
