I had a chance to see the movie the next day. I didn't know what to expect because I never saw a trailer and so on ... but what I found out simply by watching the first 10 minutes is the movie that's the worst I've ever had when I saw the disaster. > <br /> I wish I gave him this movie 0 ratings. The first 10 minutes were bad, but once it happened at the party, I just wanted to enter a coma, which was really wrong. The actors had no direction, there was no real story, I read some reviews that state its good if you have a small child entertained for 90 minutes, etc. ... but why should we expose kids to this type of movie? He got bad humor, rude and rough comedy at best and focuses on bad special effects that fill 80% of his time. I'm sure a few people in Hollywood will be down the streets after this movie bombs. Also How can 39 people give this movie 10. I mean the real someone who gives this movie 10 either has a mental problem or works for a film company. This film should have a diameter of 1.5 / 10 instead of its current 2.3 / 10 relative to the people who rated it 10. Really sad.
