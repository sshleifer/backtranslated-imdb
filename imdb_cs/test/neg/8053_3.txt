Todd Verow's unexpected turn into a sentimental outgoing drama delivers a predictable outcome. An attractive but unconvincing leadership - these 20 members should be in high school? - Dribbling banalities on confused, adolescent sexuality didn't make me the best way to explore Anonymous's promise, which was just as confident, but honest, raw, and compared to not everyone who was. I have no idea what to do with this dull and uninspiring film, rather than hoping Verow will find another career. Sure, it's easy, but it's Mike Huckabee. But no single attribute is as bad as Jim Dwyer's chintzy, an electronic score that spans non-stop all along. of this movie. If I saw it and heard it in the theater, I'd go out. Fortunately, I could scrub and shut up on my laptop.
