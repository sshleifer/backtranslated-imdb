Third in the series, Paul Kersey (Bronson) turns a vigilant into revenge on the criminals who murdered his old friend. I don't know why the movie pushed me into it, but somehow it did. I found that prey for Bronson to wipe the floor with those punks. Every time one of them fired, I felt good. This film is not taken seriously, but what if it did? There is a good build-up to the finals of the fireworks in which Bronson goes on the rampage. But in terms of acting and conspiracy, he just doesn't measure it. If I lived in this neighborhood, I'd fall out as fast as I could, but people seem to be asking for trouble. I know there's the kind of mentality we need to save our streets, but here's the limit. I had to give it. 4. Sure, there are good "blow up" scenes, but that's about it. At that time, Bronson was 64 years old. I'm sure these criminals really wanted them to go with Bronson. Bronson takes the place of Schwarzanegger or Stallone in this film. This film gives you a feeling of joy. An ordinary man can save the environment, save the day. To sum it up, it's far from being the original Death Wish, but it's pretty good if you're looking for just an hour and a half of a shoot.
