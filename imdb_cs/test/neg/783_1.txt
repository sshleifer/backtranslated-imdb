How sad it was that it emerged from the same mind as Donnie Darko, perhaps one of the best films in this genre. Where should I start? I think one of the necessary angry aspects of the film is that we are to be criticizing humanity, and yet we see no humanity in the film. No more than 5 minutes of film is digestion agonizing about the possible death of another person. It is a terrible one-dimensional cardboard cutout of human beings. Sadly, they play with what can only be described as a terrible act. Is that how Kelly sees humanity? Judging by the audience's reaction, it's a terrible encapsulation of humanity. Why are the characters in the film not asking questions that all viewers have? This is not humanity's accusation. It is the prosecution of straw men that Kelly is preparing, who in this situation did not know almost any resemblance to real people. ? Armageddon? I even saw someone who compared it to the work of Kurosawa. How do you really have to be to think that it would support a good existential debate? For the love of everything that is good in the movie! Even the hateful proposal is ten times the indictment of mankind that it is. There we see people who really worry about greed and the human situation. Yes, even Indecent Proposal shames this film for a philosophical discussion, yet it gets 5.3 vs 6.0 for this mindless audacity. on his face. It has a depth of film project in high school and poor. Indeed, this is about the level of discussion supported by this film. If you want to see a GOOD psychological movie, do yourself a favor and check out Das Experiment. If Box got to this end, I'd be willing to forgive some of those horrible games, yawning conspiracy holes, and a totally absurd story. Sadly, she can't do it. The real indictment of mankind is that there are people who think that this film is a deeply humiliating view of the human state. This is not Sartre! This is not even the version of Cliff Notes Sartre! This is a hastily conceived and hack-written 9th grade term paper about Sartre based on some Internet news ramblings. If Sartre were alive, Kelly would have sued for defamation.
