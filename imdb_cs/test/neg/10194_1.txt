This film was poorly designed, misspelled, and misbehaved. All characters were two-dimensional. It was a real amateur attempt. The film was fundamentalist Christian propaganda. Christian figures are holier-than-thou and are without a bit of compassion for the skeptic or undecided characters. The film was a real "coach" for both a skeptical character and for himself as a viewer who put us in a very unpleasant situation. I complained to theater management and got free access to another movie. I remember another movie on a similar theme, "The Rapture", starring Mimi Rogers, which was much better and professionally performed. I think I'll watch "The Rapture" again. If you attend "Unknown" and don't like it, don't say I didn't warn you.
