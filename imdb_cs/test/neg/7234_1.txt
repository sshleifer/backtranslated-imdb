Greetings, viewers! Watching Octopus II, I contemplate the natural backdrop of the Octopus / Croc / Dino Horror genre. Many viewers may blame poor playing, a pointless script, or a badly constructed plot as reasons that cause the OCD film to pay. These reasons may actually be floundering factors, but this is the actual difficulty of filming an OCD film that is in the heart of the lameness. You see, there is no technology yet to make realistic, OCD-based living and CGI technologies that currently use studios lack the ability to blend seamlessly into the real world and characters. Even with cinematography, you can only shoot half-dark depths of the sea / semi-dark forest / semi-dark cave / semi-dark corridor many times before a science fiction fan gets bored with the genre completely (OCD). sub-genre, that is). <br /> <br /> What can you do, ask? I wouldn't say that the genre would give up cheesiness, but we need to explore another way. We can't really go back to the days of the "Fade-to-Black" cue somebody killed. Or can we? If we cannot achieve the goal of realism, we must compensate in other ways, such as plot plotting, innuendo, and photo-ingenuity. It will be cured through ingenious and alternative methods that lameness disease, so common to OCD sub-genre.
