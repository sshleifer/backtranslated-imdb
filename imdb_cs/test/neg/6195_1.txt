Well, I felt that the Mormons movie, Mormons, for the Mormons, would be a catastrophe waiting for it to happen, but little I know how much it would be so painful. A little known fact is that Mormons have always made exceptionally fine propaganda films. The Church's official film campaign created precious and enduring gems that transcend the Mormon community, including the splendid short film "The Cipher in the Snow", which ended in the late 1970s as an educational film. Then there is Neil LaBute's disturbingly masterpiece .... However, the success of these films depended largely on the fact that they did not focus on Mormons or any specific Mormon theology. Instead, they decide to focus on a universal theme and deal with it at a basic human level. "The Army of God" abandons any excuse of universality and stretches into a remote and short-sighted world of Orthodox. While this may be enough to alienate anyone but the most dedicated Mormon, director Richard Ductcher is a filmmaker and his youthful approach to telling enough to judge the "God's Army", which is essential to almost all standards. The Dutchman's scary wooden acting game sets the tone for his army of the least interesting Mormons you'll probably meet. Of course, the literary performance of the cast does not help the Dutch pathetic scenario. He should be given credit for not avoiding some of the controversial aspects of the Church, but as can be expected, he appropriately divides these controversies into compassionate light. It should also be no surprise that most of the answers to the darker side of the Church are addressed by little faith. At one point, an African-American missionary is cursed by a black couple to join a church that was segregated until 1978 (about ten to twenty years after almost every church in the most degenerate parts of the deep south has already done so). Instead of solving the actively racist history of the Church, perhaps the most brilliant place of Mormon theology, which even church leaders no longer oppose, the Dutchman's restless character is thinking instead of the murder of Joseph Smith - an obvious and perhaps outrageous allusion to lynching. Embarrass this syruppy milktoast with third grader jokes as a comic and you have a strong reason to revive silent movies. <br /> <br /> If you didn't know about Mormons before you look at this movie, you may be prone to avoid them at any cost. If you're a Mormon, this movie offers absolutely nothing to boast of.
