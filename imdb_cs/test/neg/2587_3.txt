Debra Winger's 1987 "Black Widow" is much better. This is like a lame version, and Jane Seymour usually does better. Chad Allen is pretty poor in this too. Just play your usual role as a boring rebellious child. Maybe both of them were from Dr. Quinn to wake us up. <br /> <br /> If it's up, go catch a copy of "Black Widow".
