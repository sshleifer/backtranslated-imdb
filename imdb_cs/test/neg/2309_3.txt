To speak my comments on the film, I know that this topic is horrible and words cannot express enough sympathy as any decent person would have for people who deal with the post-horror of the atomic bomb that came close to them. However, this movie doesn't really deal in a scary way except for the first 10 minutes. Some of the images are scary and should be a reminder of what nuclear weapons can produce. The vision of the burned people who were walking around aimlessly, or the man who was combing his hair and clumps of hair, wasn't going to look nice. However, after the first tens of minutes, this Japanese film concerns people who deal with the effects of Hiroshima in the mid-1940s. Actually, I found that the story is rapidly developing into boring soap operas. Almost the whole story comes five years after the bomb and deals mainly with the problems of one family at this point. Therefore, it became more of a melodrama than some shocking story of a nuclear disaster. Is it simply a story of how these people have come to life since 1950, whether one of the women has been permanently damaged, and if so, should they marry? It could have been a real crash movie, but it wasn't in that direction
