I'm waiting for Peter Fonda to act. For someone who comes from such a talented family, it is a mystery to me why Peter Fonda can only play Peter Fond, who is trying to play someone else. And that's good news in this disappointed dog adaptation of The Tempest. A series of loosely coupled ideas that merely suggest a relationship with Bard's great play is what serves us. The setting's Civil War and Prospero's (Here Guideon's) Wicked Brother looks like an 1890 melodrama villain, complete with Whiplash Sniffles Mustache. I waited for "Uh ha hah!" which would be the highest in this gloomy presentation. None of the supporting casts were memorable and the lack of Peter Fond's expression and the wooden movements of the body made the imperfect story go on and on. Tempest is Bard's statement about the rage of unfair treatment of man and man. The only believable character was Gator, who was a Caliban counterpart. The transfer to the swamp had options, but setting up a civil war just didn't do it. All in all, very unsatisfactory production. I saw it on the video and I would advise you to save Willy Shakespeare's money. Rent something else like Branagh's Much Ado about nothing, or Kevin Kline in the Midsummer Night's Dream.
