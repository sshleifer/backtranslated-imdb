Director / screenwriter Allan Burns seems to have put together two different scripts before coming up with this smaller trip: comedy about infidelity and melodrama about loss and sabotage. The result is an incredibly unreal movie. Christine Lahti plays a harsh, cynical television news reporter who makes friends with aerobics instructor Mary Tyler Moore and soon has dinner with Moore and her family - just to find out that Marie's husband (Ted Danson) is Lahti's secret business! Burns has a strange, stop-and-start rhythm of its dialogue, which is neither realistic nor effective (just getting more annoying because nothing important is said to be at all). The iron thin Moore, who looked uncomfortably fragile in his leotard, had a brilliant smile, but did not convince it as Danson's wife, and Danson was stuck with a lousy, ungrateful role (it's just cad). The film attempts to cover all the basics of a classic overlapping role (the role of a woman in the workplace, television news, a cheating family man, a working woman, and a mother who wants more, a woman's need for female friendship, et al.) , Because Burns is only half researching these questions. As a writer, he is surprisingly freed from punching, but he has no sense and heavy conspiracies just go wrong. * 1/2 from ****
