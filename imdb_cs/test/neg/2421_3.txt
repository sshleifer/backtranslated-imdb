I'm from Australia and I watched with respect the extraordinary culture around rugby in New Zealand. I can fully appreciate Kiwis comments on this movie. It was an utter insult to the race of people and their beloved sport. Anyone involved in making this cruel movie should be formally excused by anyone who was unlucky enough to watch him. Note: people don't kneel down and cry while they slowly recite Hakku. What was a pitiful scene? Should we feel some sympathy for this idiot who almost killed his girlfriend who refused to listen to any advice from someone who has half the brain, and then apparently saw light? What thorough character (with visits to children's hospitals does nothing to redeem his contemptuous personality). And why do people make a film about rugby Americans? They hardly even appear on the world stage in sports, not so much as to justify making a movie (yes, Rugby is a "world" sport, unlike grate and baseball)?
