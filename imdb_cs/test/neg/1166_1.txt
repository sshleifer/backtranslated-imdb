When "Deranged" was created, the filmmakers saw it appropriate to turn Ed Gein into Ezra Cobb, although the resulting film was actually quite close to the facts of the notorious case. I suppose it was pretty much thought that they should change names and stuff like that. "Ed Gein - The Plainfield Butcher" is a true story that tells the Gein case, but actually has very little resemblance to history. It's a travesty as a bio-type movie. If there is ever a need to change the names of the film, it doesn't matter much more than "Deranged". It's as close as possible to the true crime story because "Dirty Harry" was about a real Zodiac murder story. OK, so the excitement aside, how horror it looks? As a horror movie, like a movie in general, it's pretty scary. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in months. Problems run like this: 1) Kane Hodder is quite surprisingly miscast like Ed Gein. Hodder is totally unsuitable in this game and just pervading brilliantly menacing. Very bad. 2) Kane Hodder is the best actor in the movie! The rest of the cast are rather "amateur playwrights" and totally unengaging. It is painful to testify that some lines are delivered. 3) The occasional efforts of stylish filmmaking come from the book "The Great Book of Muds". You've seen it all before, better done. In addition to the effort in style, the rest of the film-making is very clumsy: cameras shake, framing is bad, there are excessive senseless shots holding up the ... which leads me to ... that it continues forever. It is under 90 minutes in length, but sitting over it is suffering. You swear it took two and a half hours. 5) Ed Gein seems secondary. The film mostly deals with the family affairs of the newly supported deputy sheriff. The deputy played a helpless actor with no film on his shoulders. Is there anything good about it? Well, gore FX is very good. Some compelling wounds are exposed and make-up is generally excellent. None of this, however, replaces the massive failure of the film. It has no kitsch value, it's just bad; Not too bad, not "so bad that it's good", just really bad. A film to avoid and despise.
