What can you say about a movie whose funniest episode sees a fat man struggling with a garden hose? Acting, especially what leads the lead man Jerry O'Connel, is embarrassing. The dialogue is so fanciful and unjust that it makes you angry. In fact, the idea for this genre (infantile teen comedy) is not bad, but the director does the least. I rate it 2 out of 10.
