With Pepe Squad, who received an average of 4.7 on IMDb.com, it is no wonder that Steve Balderson slanders this page. But the fact is that Pep Squad is a badly created "black" "comedy" (both words in quotation marks for some reason). It's a film full of exaggeration (Cherry, Beth's mother), coupled with several lethargic performances (Beth and Juliet's friend). A movie where you can watch cars twenty meters away in the gaudy red Jeep and never notice it. A film stone full of not-so-attractive clippings and nudity shots that interest you: "Does the director think it's funny? Or clever?" Most of all, the characters are so paper-thin and poorly developed that the film becomes quite unpredictable, but probably not on purpose. Pep Squad can't decide whether it's a comedy or a drama, or a satire (patriotic music, getting it ...). The film fails to be serious because the idea of ​​killing for any school position (this is Prom Queen) crosses the line into madness (not to mention the shots of burning flags and drive in shooting, wrong controversy and nervousness), and fails to be a comedy , for all forced and awkwardly placed jokes (big butt mommy, "funky" black director, and excessive cussing added badly by the main cast). Watching the documentary "Wamego: Making Movies Anywhere" just made this movie worse-worthy, praising it ... the director and the director's father ... hmmmmmm. It's not a black comedy or something for it. I think Kansas will have to wait.
