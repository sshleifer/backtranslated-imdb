My friend once rented it because he thought Peter Fonda was playing in it, it couldn't be bad. POORLY! It's bad what can be. There is so much laughter and it's not jokes. For example, in one scene Hawken goes to the woods and when he comes out, he's suddenly wearing a completely different outfit! Where was the "director's" brain when he was shooting the scene?!? Probably at the same place Fonda when he agreed to do it. It's really a pity that one has to see how in such a poor apology for a silly actress movie. Nobody in this movie can act as an actor. Jack Elam is brought just to take the number of stars, but everything he does is terrified in a very dark and terribly shot scene at a bar. Not to mention "Indians", the girl was so terrible that I wanted to shoot her to end her suffering and also mine. If I could give this 0, I would. Too bad the brand doesn't exist. It really reminds bad joke or amateur footage made just for fun. This should serve as proof of how bad B-movies can get.
