Randy Quaid, Miriam Flynn, Dana Barron, Jake Thomas, Sung Hi Lee, Eric Idle, Fred Willard, Ed Asner, D: Nick Marck. An embarrassed flop with direct video access has her boss on her way to a paid vacation in the South Pacific Ocean for her brother Cousin Eddie and his family, hoping the dune will not sue her company after a smarter lab monkey bites her! Idiotic rotation cannot measure any of the holiday movies (even European holidays!), Asking if the creators thought the script was actually fun. Even Quaid, Willard, or Asner cannot remotely watch him. 83 min., Not rated yet. *
