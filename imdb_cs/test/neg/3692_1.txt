In Moscow, priest Owen (Vincent Gallo) hires a team to lead him to the underworld to find his friend Sergei (Rade Serbedzija), who is missing in exploring the legend of the existence of demons and entering hell under the city. <br /> <br /> I bought this DVD based on the name of Val Kilmer and interesting pictures on the cover. I'm totally disappointed because this movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don't understand how Val Kilmer has taken part in this production. There are two shameful reviews in IMDb promoting this movie and are usually fake, written by users with only one review on this site. There are two possible ways to see this boring and horrible movie: my wife and I have dozed many times because of the monotony of this nonsensical story and we used the DVD rewind button to repeat every lost scene. The right way to do this, however, is to use the fast forward or stop button to stop this crap faster. My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Cidade Sombria" ("Dark City")
