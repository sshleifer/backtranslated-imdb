It is disappointing to see that he is a talented actor like Amitabh Bachchan in such a weak role, especially when he was out of sensation in BLACK (which I highly recommend). One line in the movie states: "Sakar is not a mere man, it is an idea and a philosophy." Director Ram Gopal Varma attributes GODFATHER as an inspiration for this film and maybe it's a problem. It looks like a badly broken American movie in India. Seven elements of filmmaking - acting, continuity, conspiracy, character development, dialogue, art and production kits - are considered in the left elbow register on a scale of high 10 to low 1, with 5 being the average score. The continuity of the film seems tall, 8, by maintaining a violent tone filled with drama in places, and using justice outside the legal system as motivation. However, there seems to be a lack of emotions associated with organized crime. Acting heads 4, it seems too weak, even if someone is defeated or murdered, it seems to be a hoohum. For example, when one character is shot in the lead, I wondered if or when it would fall. He did not, and ala Ronald Reagan he is placed in a car, with his bleeding face rocking ala by John F. Kennedy. The plot evaluates 5 as an example of American-style gangsterism, with a family oriented Robinhood at his head. The evolution of the characters appears static, and the figures appear to be chess pieces on a deserted chessboard, earning rank 3. Dialogue appears to be embedded and seems to be forced into a Bowery speech - 4 for dialogue. Production files seem to be below average - 4. And the art is mysterious, with too many close-ups, too fast panning and too many group scenes where the actors seem to be rehearsed - and 3. For me, the camera's movement is disturbing. The left elbow index is 4.4 and moves down to 4 with a slight deduction based on poor derivatism. There are two questions in the film: one, why are so many people eating so often: and two India don't have their own organized crime mark? Do such films have to be so dependent on Western cultural examples? Like Amitabh Bachchan, I can't recommend this movie.
