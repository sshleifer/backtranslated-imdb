I don't know why all previous comments agree with this movie. IT IS, NOT BETWEEN, but ..., SUCKIEST MOVIE I SEAT LATELY, full of clich√©s, bad acting, not really ... very bad behavior and has a stupid conspiracy ... If I saw it in the cinema after the first 20 minutes I would leave. If you hate someone, watch this movie ... it's so bad. A girl who has an imaginary boy / friend who gives up the relationship with the real, because her imagination is jealous .... but I think it figures ... she takes from her parents who also have some mental problems ... plus a figure which is supposed to be, I think the laughing song, the thing that should make you laugh is a friend of your buddy, a serious mother and I'm just sorry ... and the whole movie
