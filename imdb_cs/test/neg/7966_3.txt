There is no doubt that Alfred Hitchcock was a seriously gifted director. Many of his films are undeniable classics that have stood the test of time and are still very attentive. This list could include 39 steps, rear window, north after northwest, M dial for murder, vertigo, birds, shadow doubt, and several other movies. "Suspicion" is not well aging at all and it is indeed so unnoticeable that it seems to me that it was probably a bad movie in 1941. A list of scenes that work well may be on the recorder with crayon. Most of the time, the script is free and ridiculous, but acting seems so forced and wooden and borderline amateur that it's almost incredible. Joan Fontaine is trying to set things up, but she's on a slippery slope and Cary Grant doesn't help much. His acting is so bad when I saw better performances in high school games or theater experience classes at a college where a chemical engineer performs for the first time without formal training. <br /> <br /> After about 30 minutes watching this movie, you'll find yourself in the dark to get your sleeve on the DVD to see if you picked up a version of a special edition that was tiled together without any modification . <br /> <br /> The subject is serious, yet the film has a stupid and trit feeling that it just looks like from where you become numb with embarrassment. "Suspicion" is basically imperceptible and another very highly overrated BAD movie.
