I don't see why anyone would do such a movie. From start to finish, this movie is really, really bad. <br /> <br /> The characters are very shallow, they behave terribly and are completely uncomfortable. Nothing happens beneath the surface, be it characters or conspiracies. 'Humor', if you can call it, is aimed at the adult audience (assuming language and nudity) Although it is mainly toiletry humor and has trouble drawing a half-moon smile. <br /> <br /> I would recommend avoiding this apology for comedy. He has nothing to appeal to a movie fan. The absence of laughter and conspiracy that hardly exists leads me to ask, "Why was this film made, why, why, why?" I expect in the fullness of time to see this movie of the 100 worst films.
