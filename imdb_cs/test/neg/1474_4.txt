I'm sorry, guys, but everyone who says it's a great documentary ... and the award that won at Sundance ... well, you've all been deceived. For years I have heard how I have to see this documentary and finally watch it. Perhaps in 1999, when it came out and reality TV does not have such a dominant presence in the industry, this film would seem fun. But Mike and Mark apparently play alone, Mike and Mark. Sometimes they are funny and some of the lines seem to be out of cuff, but they usually don't vote truthfully. These are the real versions of Jay and Silent Bob. Yes, people are real, they are not actors, but it is, it is an exaggeration of themselves and it is so obvious that it is hard to believe that so many people think it is a real solution. I wasn't confused, so it was actually boring. Slightly amusing, but not too much when you miss it.
