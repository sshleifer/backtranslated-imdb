OK, let me start by not being a horrible movie. It's just not good. I remember one poster that says acting is not campy, it's just nuance. No. I have seen the nuances of Japanese and Asian acting. I'm sorry, you're wrong. This is the camp. The characters are absolutely unsympathetic, the deaths are completely random and absolutely meaningless. Writing is wrong. I'm fine with the suspicion of suspicion, I'm fine I don't have everything that has been handed over to me in terms of conspiracy. But this film has no plot. One reviewer said: "This film takes place in a small town where people throw themselves on beliefs and spirals." It's not a blur, it's a crazy movie. Congratulations, I just saved you for almost an hour and a half. There's nothing more to it. No character development, no fence development, no explanation, no resolution. And even "Acceptable in J-Horror" lack of resolution. Just nothing. In addition, the music score is done by someone who apparently wasn't actually watching the movie at the time because it's random enough to cause a whiplash. Cognitive dissonance is one thing and it does well, it can be brilliant (see Dark Water), but here it looks as if the score was designed to go with another film together. <br /> <br /> The best example I can give is how the Japanese reworked Evil Dead without any clever piece or good gameplay. It just falls. It's a horror-free J-horror movie.
