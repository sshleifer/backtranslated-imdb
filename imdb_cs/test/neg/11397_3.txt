They said it would be a movie bigger than the Turks' fruit. How dare they <br /> <br /> they? It's not even 10% of this classic. Bad behavior. The only person I felt sympathetic was Angela Schijf. Her acting was best throughout the film. The story could be interesting, but it wasn't. Some scenes were very beautiful, filmed (lights and camera) (for example, <br /> <br /> the opening scene), but bad gaming made magic <br /> <br /> disappear. I really don't understand why so many people voted for this movie, so good.
