I rented this movie because I like Kristanna Loken and I watched it on many TV shows, and because she has 15 minutes of fame with her new T3 movie, I wanted to see what other movies she has. She is fine in acting. Neither good nor bad. It balances everything by being extremely beautiful. Rodney Rowland was a surprise hero. He provided the only solid good deal in the film. He is a very good actor and should probably be an action star. Apart from being Kristanna all right and Rodney really good all the rest of this movie is waste in its purest form. The computer hacker breaks into the aircraft system from the ground and tries to slam the plane into a nuclear power plant using a joystick ... or something. And of course there are heroes who stand in his way and destroy his game. <br /> <br /> This is one of the worst scripts I've ever seen, and it's no wonder it's a low budget. What is shocking is that this film was made in 2001 and has too many similarities to the September 11 tragedies. Why do they make movies like this in the first place? Panic * - one star (loss of too good actors) (also a waste of time) (also known as Air Panic)
