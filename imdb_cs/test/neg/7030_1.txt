I didn't think this movie was good at all. Basically, they took a lot of one-row from different Shirley Temple movies, threw them together, and Orr acted like Shirley Temple on screen. "Oh my God!" it has been said many times. If you are familiar with Shirley Temple movies, you will find several lines directly from her films. The problem is that Orr said it in Shirley's everyday life. Finally, what we get is hodgepodge re-created Shirley Temple movies, instead of any real look into Shirley's temple life. Save your problems and rent Shirley Temple movies, it's much better than watching Orr and re-creating Shirley's acting style.
