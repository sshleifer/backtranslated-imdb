Sometimes you get exactly what you expect. The film, which was created and as a means for a rock band in the middle of a comeback, is not expected to be placed high in artistic merit - and certainly not in this case. In fact, as expected, the soundtrack is a much better investment than the film itself, which, like the 1970s rock and rock lifestyle, is being portrayed, is characterized by abundance, drugs and over-the-top antiquity, but unfortunately it is not nearly as much funny. The use of the screenplay by Carl Dupre terrible enough to make fellow screenwriter crouch, and the waste of Edward Furlong's talents, the only top of this rock, and the role of season piece Bad's music, most notably the elaborate re-creation of the 1978 KISS concert.
