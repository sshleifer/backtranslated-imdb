This is by far the stupidest thing I've ever seen on celluloid. We started to look at it, assuming it was a "skin-Tax A&A", but besides a few breasts, that was it. I mean, I have a sense of making silly movies to show some sex scenes because they're the only reason we need to make a movie of this kind. But this film has no sex scenes and it makes no sense at all. There is no linear time, scenes move like fart in the wind, people do not appear for any reason, then they leave, and it is never explained, the story never goes on and nothing happens. I've never been so impressed with how bad the movie was until I saw it. Was the director even at a film school? Has he ever seen a movie? I don't know, but from that point of view, he seems to have made some moron proud of this piece of crap when he's still working. I have literally gone away from this movie, but I still recommend watching it because it should be shown at every film school in the country as an example of what to do when we make a film. Move over PLan 9 from Outer Space, you have a new candidate for the worst movie ever made.
