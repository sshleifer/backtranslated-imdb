I like the "Star Wars" series. I also like good, cheap sci-fi flick every time. Damn, I and Roger Corman-produced nickel-and-dime work. I don't like "The Ice Pirates", though. <br /> <br /> It just looks too cheap for one, you know? For the film to be held in space, it is cramped and closed, as if it were filmed in the front seat of one's Mazda. And special effects, while appropriately cheesy, look more than anything like metallic gray foam rubber. Usually I won't be allowed to be bothered by such things, especially if the story and characters pay off <br /> <br /> They're not. The whole story of these neer-do-well spatial pirates who choose to find a planet loaded with ice can melt and sell like water (a hot commodity in the future, I think) is probably just as original like jokes, which is not a compliment. Humor comes about at the crotch level (like castration). the machine you will see soon), and everyone seems to have a bold attitude. And who told John Matuzak that he was funny? Who did it, shame on them. Good old Robert Urich is trying, but he is a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship (or starship, in this case). This was what I watched about three times and every time I felt the same - shanghaied. <br /> <br /> No stars. Despite the presence of Huston (one year before "Prizzi Honor") and Carradine (at the end of the tail end of the once noble career), these "Pirates" should go through the board.
