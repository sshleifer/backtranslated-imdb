Jim Wynorski strikes again with the literally minded KOMODO VS. COBRA. No guesswork. Giant Dragon CGI Commodo - It Looks Like a Dog Minus Fur - Takes a humongous CGI royal cobra, with lots of tree huggers and others caught between them. Tree huggers get charter ship captain Michael Pare (who else?) To take them off-federal island limits. Experimenting a mad scientist in growing very large vegetarians has become an experiment in growing very large animals, thanking our walnut army. Now all that remains on the island are big animals and a little crazy scientific daughter. The group rushes to her in the old plantation lab, the monsters arrive and the chase is on. If you watch enough of the Wynorski / Sci-Fi Channel's fluctuations, you will recognize some sets and locations from many other movies. Acting does not exist, as does the plot. At the very least, you can enjoy watching a poorly animated compo / dog stomp down on his intended victim just before sewing. Cobra just strikes and swallows. No imagination at all.
