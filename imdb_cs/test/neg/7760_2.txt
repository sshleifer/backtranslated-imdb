Yes, I couldn't stop yawning and I couldn't even partner. Incredibly boring - 90 minutes seemed to be stretching for at least 3 hours - and I'm not even a fan of action movies, but it just falls asleep - if you're not a 70's neck fan! <br /> <br /> ** SOME SPOILERS FOLLOW ** Do not hold your breath if you have expected something to happen - no! But seriously, he can't completely convince or engage the guard. It's like a long, boring and somewhat discontinuous dream. Frederic sails through it, able to leave the job whenever he wants, and with attractive secretaries bringing tea and news constantly. Of course not real life! And an office with virtually no paper or files - just a huge calendar to let you know that the movie really takes 6 months. Frederick never seems to touch any real emotions, nor does his wife and children act like rag dolls - in stark contrast to any real life. Even Chloe, despite her strong views, never gives the impression that she really feels anything. The only 3 seconds of any real feeling occur between the couple in the cafe and have nothing to do with the chart. Okay, so maybe there are some moral considerations, but if it's fun, or even the good cinematography you're looking for, I think this movie is incredibly revalued by most other viewers.
