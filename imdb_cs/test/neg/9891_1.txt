This devious piece resembles a novel like a cucumber slice. The filmmakers took the Alamo section from the book, made it into a movie and said it was based on a book. Cha! Wondering what they did to get Mr. Michener to support this piece of fluff? It was just another Davy Crockett, a flint rifle, a Santa Ana, 13 days of poppycock fame collection. I almost began to take root in the Mexicans just to be damned. And what was the scene when Stacey Keach tried to get James Bowie to look at the knife? The sexual cues he used were juvenile and unnecessary. They could use the film they lost unnecessarily to engage in some real dialogue. This show was embarrassing for Hollywood. Or can the clowns be embarrassed?
