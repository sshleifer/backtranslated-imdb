From boredom and great curiosity, I decided to check this show today because my four-year-old niece loves her. I should have known it was a show that could only be four years old. The show was pretty bad. First, the show was just not funny. The Mixing Track came out at the most appropriate times, which were very annoying, especially since none of the jokes was fun. The Mixing Track started at some point when a guy who was a cameraman said, "I'll go get a lens." How the hell is that fun? The parts in it (like meat drumming), which were supposed to be funny, were just stupid for anyone older than eleven. Now I feel like four years is not a target audience. Since I had a four-year-old niece watching her, I was concerned when I looked at her: she doesn't show very good behavior. In the episode I watched, it shows that Sam steals Carly's sandwich and pushes her to the ground, so Carly can get up and do the same. I don't want to see how my niece behaves so rough. I also don't like the idea of ​​two young girls having a web show where they give out personal information ... If it were real, all the freaks would be over her. This show would probably be good and funny for someone who is eleven or younger, but someone older than that, just stay away from it. I'll give these two stars because I think I can see how it can be fun for a child.
