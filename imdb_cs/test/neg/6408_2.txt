Not just because of this subject in the film. That was one of the lame excuses for something like a conspiracy. No. I watched it because I knew I wouldn't like it. I HATE Numerology. Whenever somebody starts dealing with number patterns, I feel the urge to hit them. My own brain is starting to suffer from empathy. And to fully realize that this is a film about the subject, I couldn't resist the urge to watch it and maybe laugh well. But it wasn't fun. Exactly the stupid kind of "Isn't it completely scary and yet amazingly cool?! I was afraid of dialogue. Once the son began to chase, I knew this movie was turd, no matter what happens. But I hardly ever stop watching the movie I started. I sat down. I enjoy pain. The film pretends to pretend numerology under a disguise that shows how obsession can end badly. But he rides on the wave to crush her. I can't see the message. I can only see the characters leaning on that stupid number. Upstairs with the usual "surprises" - trying to give you another twist that discourages you, it makes no sense, and you almost believe it because of the quality of the narrative so far - and you get one hollow piece of film-making. It just happens around the subject I despise. If it wasn't going to be serious, and it would be a hilarious movie with actors that I wouldn't give a damn about. But I was starting to like Carrey ... while it's not his fault, he's trying. It's not even good to watch a lot of friends and hell out of it. <br /> <br /> My expectations were low enough for anyone to go, but this movie was one of the worst I've ever seen.
