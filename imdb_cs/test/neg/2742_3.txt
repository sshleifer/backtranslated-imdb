That was absolutely inevitable. This film borrows from "The Core" and from the movie he borrowed, "Armageddon" and the films he borrowed and so on. This time, Luke Perry is here. This film version of the well-known savings conspiracy includes a super earthquake beginning in the Pacific Northwest and expanding the entire fire ring. He soon discovered that everyone on Earth could be doomed. And so the army and some scientists are building one of those high-tech drilling machines that go inside the Earth and fix things (that wouldn't be so fun if they didn't have to go somewhere inside or inside the planet). There is even a line that tries to make the journey to Earth much more impressive than the journey to space (as in "Armageddon"). It's a Sci-Fi Network movie, so the scenario is to paint by catastrophe numbers. There is in-fighting between scientists and military guys, there are rock-melting lasers, people die and sacrifice themselves for the good of all, and above all, there are (weak CGI) special effects. It's not original and not all fun. This is a movie you have to watch when you have nothing to do, especially if you have a beer.
