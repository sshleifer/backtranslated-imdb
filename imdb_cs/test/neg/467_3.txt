I wish I could tell you that this film is as exciting as the theory in question. But I can not. Another species could come and mutate while I waited for some action. For such a controversial man, Darwin lived the most conventional life. If you didn't know about those crazy theories, you could almost confuse him with stamp collectors. The filmmakers have cast Darwin as the perpetrator of the service. Although he briefly loses his mind because of his tireless theory, it was not interesting to watch. Maybe great thinkers are boring people? I don't know what I expected: a forehead that slammed eccentrically with wild hair and eyes that liked the love of all things, a filthy madness that emerged from the forehead? A long-haired hermit who babbled animals? A madman spreading his head with eyes lit up like beacons of truth? All this would be great. These are Scorsese movies. But none of this was. No lightning, no thunder, no wonder, no horror. Just Paul Bettany and Jennifer Connelly fresh from Subtle as a brass school methods act. I imagine that someone with Darwin's ideas had a brain like a train with a disproportionate speed, so why did this film just get chug-chug-like a slow winter? Disappointment is immense.
