Yes, the voices are in. This movie can be a very good plan 9 from space for our generation. But while Ed Wood's film, for all its flaws, retains a certain spell despite everything, this film defines the word "no magic" to the nth degree. In fact, I would suggest editors of the Oxford English Dictionary quote this film as a key example of defining this word in the next dictionary update. Carrot Top is the artist of such an enormous ability that the normally rational people I know when he hears his name become murderous maniacs who want to kill Mr. Top as soon as possible. Indeed, if someone goes to Amazon.com and check out customer reviews for Carrot Top movie and other DVD performance, one will find a few that could be considered a threat to Mr. Top's death. One more curious one about this movie, I remember that Mike Nelson, the main writer for MST 3000, said in his Mike Mega Cheese book of movies, good and bad, that he saw this movie and soon after he couldn't remember what would be about him. title. Mike apparently suffered from a classic trauma response. Mike Nelson, looking at this atrocity, was so insensitive that he had to block it. (Apparently, in a later chapter in his book, Mike Nelson recovered from his film of this movie. From the review he offers, Mike Nelson was definitely not grateful for the restored memory.) <br /> <br /> One Comment I'm Offering a Movie and it's not a spoiler, it's just God's true truth, it's not funny. None of this is even a nanosecond.
