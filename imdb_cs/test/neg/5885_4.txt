This is technically a very competent film technically. The camera and direction are excellent and the performances are also fine - especially Daniel Auteuil's fine acting as a marquis. I really thought there were no problems with these aspects of the film. Instead, I was a little annoyed at the way the marquis was depicted because it didn't seem to be honest and it seems to be a very revisionist view of history. In fact, in recent years, the marquis has undergone a little transformation into a defender of freedom with a great eye, not a fat sado-masochist rapist has really been. In a way, it is very reminiscent of lime, which is given by VERSUS LARRY FLINT - where these men are promoted to hero status. Although you don't think that marquis perversions were so bad (including rape and extreme violence), his portrayal in this movie as a "sexual social worker" in this jail seems pretty stupid. Instead of violent and selfish Sade, she spends a lot of time caring for a young virgin and slowly helping her explore her own sensuality. What a nice and nice man. In fact, now that I'm thinking about it, this performance is reminiscent of the man Maurice Chavalier who played in GIGI (but without singing) - a cute older man who loves ladies. I strongly doubt that the real Marquis de Sade would recognize this character at all! The film surprisingly doesn't have a lot of nudity, although what it does is very explicit. Only a maniac would let his children see because he is a very adult drama. It's very well done and quite fun - just not everything that is true. The director admits that the film is largely fictional in the interview between the special features on the DVD I watched. So go ahead and look at the movie if you like - understanding that it's not very good in history. During the 18th century, sexual libertines were fairly accepted in France as they were quite broad-minded, so despite what the movie means it wasn't SEX it was a matter of violence and rape it was (and still is) a problem.
