Is that "realism"? If Rivette tried to give us a country-level study at some point and time, and she was able to influence (and be influenced) the world around her, she failed miserably. Most notably, we never get a clue why thousands of men would follow her into battle. Surely there is not enough exposure to a cultural-historical context that would define the need for such a savior country, and God knows that there is nothing special about Joan, as presented here. Unless Bonnaire's wooden posture and straight reading suggest a transcendent belief and determination. The use of the landscape is particularly uninspired - we never lose the feeling of watching the actors of the twentieth century wandering in the supposedly medieval landscape. And as for the battle scenes (which, unlike some commentators, claim to take up a good 15% screentime) - they look like they look like some kind of historic high school club that restores the medieval siege, even though children would undoubtedly embed it more passion. I will give Rivett credit, but for the fact that I imagined Joan, who has been dropped by other films: about who is a grumpy, naive and narcissistic adolescent (playing a woman too clearly at least twice in the age of a character to be apparently unable to to understand her place in the movement she is helping to create, or the world outside of her own passion, Joan's outrage at her own cursing soldiers and the astonishment of the enemy for their lack of respect and obedience are hot spontaneous and believable remarks (you realize that such moments Unfortunately, it also serves to point out what is not addressed on the screen - what has Joan SPECIAL done? I have to say that I was still confused and frustrated by certain foreign film lovers who compare boredom and lack of dramatic engaging with “art” and “seriousness.” Does this film really increase our understanding or involvement in the subject? Or does it matter? 4/10.
