What can we say about THIS? Really one of the most sensitive experiences of my life. Your brain will try to close it as part of the primordial impulse of self-preservation. I lost my experience with watching this movie and it took me two hours to fully recover. This film is now associated with the Revenge of Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the infernal trio of horror films. It certainly does not mean that difference. I mean it. Terrible way. This film has no balancing features. Everything's scary. The formless camera-work gives us endlessly the ugliest setting imaginable, ie Lots of corn, plenty of mud. The story is stupid. The script is? Was there a script? The thief is heavily uncary and wears yellow boots. Children are uncomfortable. The leading man is without charism. And it has the audacity to go for 100 minutes. It is absolutely without merit at any level, it is similar to torture. Normally such a statement would be exaggerated for a comic effect. Not in this case. Will I say it again? this is torture. At the end I was in a state of paralysis. That was fortunately brief. But once I recovered, I decided to have to watch 'Making Of' featurette. I had to understand. Maybe it would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity. Was it all a complicated joke? I watched the first 2 minutes of 'Making Of' featurette and found that the writer / director was, to put it mildly, somewhat misleading. I also found that because I took the time to watch the first two minutes of 'Make Of' featurette of Dark Harvest 2, which I was an idiot. It is not a pleasant journey of self-knowledge. Life sucks. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended.
