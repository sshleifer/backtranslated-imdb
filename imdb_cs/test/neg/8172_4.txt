Ravi Chopra wrote this film 40 years ago, wanted to cast Dilip Kumar in the lead <br /> <br /> The film was finally rewritten and made in 2003, and therefore the subject looks from time to time and too shallow at times <br /> <br As well as the reason why Amitabh-Hema is separated, it is too shallow, even though young people are being portrayed, it is too bad, like Gulshan in AVTAAR <br /> <br /> A message that comes well, but things they are presented in a clich√© Salman's character is the worst, looks straight from a fairy tale, while Bachchan's peak speech is good and also the final unforgiveness of sons is good <br /> <br /> Ravi Chopra does a good job Music is decent, songs sung by Bachchan excel <br Amitabh stands out as always, playing an older grandfather sooner, but here the victim plays and depicts him His last speech is great Hema is good in his part Aman Verma stands out Samir Soni is fine, Naseer and ost other sons and women are polite, although Divya Dutta excels with Salman Khan's fa Mahima is fine Paresh and Lillete are nice
