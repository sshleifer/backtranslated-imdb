Overall, it's a pretty bad movie. But for $ 5 on PathMark it wasn't a complete waste. The whole scenario has to do with a guy who is infected with this lady by snakes, supposedly from a magical curse. Actors / actresses aren't names that are big (though some look from TV shows), so I'm not going to do my usual Troy McClure thing. For a moment the film keeps your interest as a couple of hop and train to LA to see the shaman return the curse. There are also many more conspiracies; like two smuggling drug ladies. But the last 20 minutes will turn out to be an overall downturn. As violent and cruel as the movie is, the grand finale is simply completely computer animated. I saw an unrated version that had a lot of language, gore, blood, violence, everything! Bonuses were fine. <br /> <br /> Total score: D-
