This is the worst movie I've seen in looooong. It reminded me of the Cirque du Soleil show I saw in Vegas six years ago - without athletics. By this I mean a few striking, artsy, images that appear randomly, without any framework. A fake sepia toned film is really cheap. This device is almost never justified and definitely not in _Tuvalu_. With apology to Abe Lincoln: you can sometimes fool some of those people.
