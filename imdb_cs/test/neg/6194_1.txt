The director / main actor of the Dutch is looking forward to this film, in which he attempts to gain secular recognition for dishonesting the otherwise very positive world of Mormon missionaries. Some actions are fair. But some roles are unrealistic, ie a sinister (rather than paternal) president of the mission, etc. The film gives a fair view of how some missionaries can fight their faith, but the real missionary program they claim to be is far from its pojet√≠m. that they are positive, coherent and inspired. The only inspiration I see in this film is Dutchman's own inspiration. The film is slow and boring and shooting and screenplay look like a college student project.
