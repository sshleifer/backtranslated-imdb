That was the worst movie I've ever seen. The only concessions are that we didn't pay for seeing it in movies as we rented them on a video store DVD. Simply - No land worth mentioning (I just watched it 5 minutes ago and I forgot), annoying characters who played badly two actors, and if it was a comedy, I'm still waiting for laughter. The only laugh we got from the movie was that we joked together that we agreed that it was really awful. Simply put, this movie was totally pathetic and I warn others not to waste their time. Surprise National Name Lampoon, Rating 0/10.
