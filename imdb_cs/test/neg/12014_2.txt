The only good way that caused a troubled movie was joining Amy Yasbeck and late John Ritter. In addition, flickering is as demonic as their hero. In this basically unnecessary sequel to the freshly separated Ben (Ritter) and his little hellraiser Junior (Michael Oliver, who never needs a screening time), move to a new town infested with willing freelancers. Ben eventually chooses Lawand (plays the most useless original of SNL-er Laraine Newman), whose Blanche DuBois tendency doesn't suit Junior at all. This town seems to have a younger girl with Trixie in her youth who has the same sweet, free mother, played by Yasbeck, the same actress who played the first fearsome mother. From here you can see where the plot is going. Finding my favorite scene is like pulling teeth, so I think I'll go with the "cherry bomb in the toilet" gag, which makes Back to the Future James Tolkan one of the many adult victims (the guy always plays school authority) numbers). Jack Warden and Gilbert Gottfried are returning as their first film, but unfortunately, Bow-tie Klansmaer doesn't look like Killer (Michael Richards) who made Problem Child all the more fun. On a serious note, I'm sure these movies, whether they were abusive parents or not, did wonders for children in the Red Heads of America. Let us also say hello to these proud American movie shots for their amazing acceptance support. Oh, and dog poop jokes - must have dog poop jokes .... Shmucks.
