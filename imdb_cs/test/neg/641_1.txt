"Eh-heh eh-heh hey, buddy - look at these aliens. It's like - biting people and things! Eh-heh eh-heh eh-heh" This must be among the worst movies of all times. It's a total drivel for everyone with a modicum brain. Sure, you have reviewers on the payroll who give bright reviews and vote on this abomination, but it's easy to tell who these sales are. Their reviews are good. To give a movie like this and an average review claim it had some B-movie corrective appeal would be a glowing review! Calling this great movie hand tips corporate shills. But enough of it. <br /> <br /> This movie had all the bad qualities a movie can have without being so bad it's fun just laughing. Old Japanese monster movies were of a quality that lacked this film. At least in those 60s, you can laugh at how badly a rubber monster looked. Or laugh when he saw the strings that held the spacecraft as the models hung on the strings and the flames curved in the back. The movies talked about how BADs are. It seems that Alien Express (aka Dead Rail) actually thinks it's a GOOD movie - which makes it incredibly absurd. The effects of today's standards were terrible. Terrible. However not as bad as the 1960s monster movies therefore they lacked comedy appeal. The storyline and dialogue were about as sophisticated as I had ever seen, which was even worse because I was a bit predictable as you would expect. I will not even point to conspiracy and logical holes in this; It would not be fair to make this pitiful plot (and it would take a long time to get started). Most games were terrible; Lou Diamond Phillips must have been very desperate to agree to touch him. <br /> <br /> The SciFi channel is fast becoming a "cheap thrilling channel" that produces a film after the film without any concept or intelligence appearing in the lottery. I can only wonder - why bother? <br /> <br /> Don't bother with this audacity. It's not worse.
