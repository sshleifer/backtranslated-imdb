The story is simple: an American couple is on vacation in Thailand. Somehow they are attacked by "almighty" Chinese vampires, and the girl is kidnapped by the great vampire boss. It's alright. The girl's partner let her look. And now the horror begins. He comes to a strange group of semi-vampires or something (they just drank animal blood). These vampires are at odds with a bad guy for about 800 years. However, with the help of 'good vampires', this guy starts looking for his girlfriend. <br /> <br /> Now the battle scenes will start, what about a film without karate without a fight? Another thing I noticed is that vampires are very ugly guys. A vampire is an old-fashioned guy (he's alive because ... forever), he has style. There are also modern vampires, but in this movie, vampires are ... weird. Like, come, ride a bike, they are all dressed in leather and destroy everything in the way. The worst part is that you can clearly see that this movie is a low budget. . The script is boring and the actors are not very talented. The music is pretty good, but the effects aren't that great. <br /> <br /> To summarize the movie it's not that great, but if you have a free afternoon, watch it and tell me if I am or not.
