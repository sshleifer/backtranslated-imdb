TV GUIDE Excerpt: <br /> <br /> This week at LOVE BOAT, Captain Stubing is full of hands when the cryptozoologist gets aboard with an unexpected load! Join Captain, Isaac, Gopher, and Juliet in a fun Halloween special. Guest play guy in a really bad lizard suit like Chupacabra. <br /> <br /> This is a typical lame Sci-Fi Channel cut-rate fare. Cruise ship captain, once a respectable John Rhys-Davies, is in charge of a carnival cruise along the coast of Mexico. His daughter is on the way, and she is earning her retention by being a boat kickboxing instructor. Pay attention, everyone that kickboxing comes in handy later! It should be noted that the captain's daughter is quite uncoordinated and painful to watch. It would be good if she took a few kickboxes before trying to play the instructor in the movie. and a dark, mysterious stranger in this 90-minute drive to boredom. That's right, I said cryptozoologist. He still mentions that he brought on board some precious cargo he needs to check. Needless to say, the box contains Chupacabra, which someone decides to release. From this point, a man in a rubber suit of Chupacabra runs around the ship, killing people. Captain Stupid is helpless to stop it. He decides to call the Marines, but tells them there are a lot of terrorists on his ship. The Marines will respond. It is said that everything the Navy speaks is "Hooya" and "Get Some". But the stupid Marines are not for Chupacabra. In fact, they don't tell anyone where they're going, so there's no help in sight. I think no one will miss a lame battalion of lost Marines. But don't forget ... fortunately, Captain Stupid's daughter is a Kickbox instructor. Yay for little Stupid! He comes at the right time, beating the bloodthirsty Cossack and saving the day. Chupacabra means Goat Sucker. Therefore, Chupacabras suck. But Chupacabras can't be reached anywhere near this movie.
