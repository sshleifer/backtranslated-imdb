On a scale of 1 to 10 I gave it 4. I thought the movie wasn't very good, with too much violence and not one character I liked. On the erotic scale, I give it a 6. Many sex scenes have been colored with basic ugliness. I always enjoy nudity and Nancy Travis and Faye Grant pass, but the sex scenes were humiliating than erotic.
