The 2002 version of "The Time Machine" is just the last of a series of terribly unsatisfactory Hollywood remakes that, despite the extravagant special effects, are falling on the face. What a lousy, uninspired story, no fantasy. Why so completely rewrite such a wonderful sci-fi classic? Are today's film viewers too hips for H.G. 1960 George Pal version told a much more cute story, even with clumsy low-budget effects, beach-party looking for Eloi, and Morlocks, who looked like Smurfs for steroids. Version 2002 Must Have HG Wells Turned In Grave: <br /> <br /> 1. The idea that time travel is motivated by the desire to change the past and trapped in a time paradox is old science fiction cliche. It totally distracts from the love affair with Mara (what happened to Weena?!), Which made the 1960 version so enjoyable. This causes unhappy and distracting tones soon to do the whole movie dour. If Guy Pearce were so brilliant, would he or his friend Einstein realize the paradoxical time dilemma? does it have dawn for 800,000 years in the future? by Morlock no less, Doh !! What's wrong with time travel just for fun and adventure and curiosity - as stated in the 1960 version? <br /> <br /> 2. Only if you saw the first movie, would you realize what Pearce is doing with the timer when you first see him. George Pal carefully explains the whole strange idea of ​​"traveling" even though it is the 4th dimension. 3. The director goes out of the way to make Pearce's character a geeky, worn out old stereotype of scientists. In the 1960 version, Rod Taylor was also a little stupid (at least about Weena), but he managed to attract, playful and charming. 4. Among the key themes of the 1960s version - abandoned in the remake - is the idea that the endless war leads to the bifurcation of humanity. Blowing the Moon to destroy humanity is unnecessary - and it does not mean scientific literacy. For more than 4 billion years, the Moon has suffered much stronger asteroid impacts, causing any nuclear device to look like a frog. Yes, sci-fi needs an artistic license, but it's just stupid and insignificant. 5. Destroying the time machine is also stupid. Over time, our traveler seems to have invented a neutron bomb that drives this thing. Blowing a machine to kill Morlocks is like a cop-out 'machina ex machina' Disappointed, Pearce never returns to the 1800s to tell his story to his unbelieving friends, a key part of the Wells story with the irony that he travels to the distant future and back in the week. 6. Having Morlocks run by day completely destroys H.G. Wells' wonderfully spooky, ghoulish portrayal of them like the dark creatures of the night. A real film opportunity has been lost. Also, Wells depicted Eloi as fragile and childish. These guys in the movie looked like they could take to Morlocks if they weren't so big baby wusses. <br /> <br /> 7. One Smart Morlock? kind of bleached emperor Star Wars Evil - had the potential, but is so lame and reserved that he tells Pearce to take the machine and go home? Boy, this is a dramatic peak! They steal a machine in Morlocks because they are so fascinated by it and fight to keep it. 8. The hologram of a public library wand is too much. This clarifies the idea of ​​human cannibalism. the 1960 version had simply "speaking rings" that gave humankind a chilling eulogy. The derailed evolution is a serious thing. <br /> <br /> His sad amazing effects in this movie will never replace a tired, resourceful script scenario. Save the cost of your ticket and popcorn and go rent a DVD when it comes out (soon no doubt), at least you can quickly think through the blunt parts as well as our traveling time.
