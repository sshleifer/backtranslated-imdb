I was expecting to see more film style, but unfortunately it turned out to be just a poorly done, low-budget action that just doesn't have the talent to do it. The story is about a very beautiful woman named Teri Marshall (Heather Thomas) who is a friend of Rick (Jeffrey Combs) working for a secret agency and invented a motorcycle that is bulletproof and can shoot lasers and rockets and has a helmet that can fire lasers as well. Bosarian's chief executive (Martin Landau) made a deal of $ 5 million to sell it and sends two hired thieves to kill Rick and Teri and collect the bike. A tall blond thief named Rolf (Dar Robinson) and his partner Hanna (Dawn Wildsmith) manages to kill Rick, but Teri survives. While at home, he finds a videotape that Rick has left to describe his invention, which Teri is helping, what to do next. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Teri is haunted by several agents, and she is captured and tortured, but does not talk about where the piece motorcycle which is needed but gets help from a federal agent named Waters (Martine Beswick), where he ends up using a bloody shot motorcycle. This film was directed by Fred Olen Ray, who made his career in making ultra-low budget movies. and trying to create an action movie. In addition to the quick shower scene, there is no nudity and the usual titling that audiences are accustomed to seeing in Ray is not where it is. I don't think anyone would expect Thomas to get naked but not wearing sexy clothes. Not that it stopped me from drugging her in those tight jeans and admiring her near the perfect form, but Ray really fired it in this case. Like all his films, the cast is fun to watch and many famous faces have roles like Robert Quarry, Huntz Hall, Troy Donahue, Tim Conway Jr., Michael Reagan and Russ Tamblyn. Stuntman Dar Robinson died shortly after he was made, and it's his last acting effort and the film is dedicated to him. You have to wonder why Landau would have him with junk like this, but I was interested in casting Combs in a very rare romantic role. Is Thomas good at this movie? Who cares! I think she showed that she could become a popular star of "B" if she wanted to, but it never happened. Ray is wasting his time with this effort, even though the cast is fun to watch, but has missed elements that make him a fun filmmaker.
