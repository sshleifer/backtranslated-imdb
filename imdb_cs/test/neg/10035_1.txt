If someone tells you that this picture is just amazing, they probably have something to do with it, or it either benefits or benefits from it. This film is a real loser and copies the situation from the big budget horror movies and not to mention the soundtracks. I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. It's a low budget movie with amateur actors. Looks like she was filmed for a film competition. Acting is terrible and I wouldn't be surprised if the script was written by Hee Haw. My family laughed at it. Degree ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ all the way. You won't be afraid of it. Here is one small taste of the horrible elements of this movie. When that guy gets his finger upset with a silly portrait of Ric White Reverend James Johnston. The boys' reactions are as though they have an amputation without a painkiller. Watch DVD add-ons after watching a movie. When you see Ric White and others talk so seriously about the movie, you'll laugh until your stomach hurts. How people will stretch the truth and what they will do to earn a dishonest grandmother. Don't be fooled as we did and buy this failure.
