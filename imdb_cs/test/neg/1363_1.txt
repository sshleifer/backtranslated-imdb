This mess begins with a real tank running over the car, captured with pictures of a toy tank. This is followed by a family going home from a birthday party without saying anything. An unexplained tank and an unobtrusive family occupy, swear, over 10 minutes of film. Eventually, the family sees the car after it is in ruins and decides to report it to the authorities just to find out that the citizens of the city are hiding in their homes and the cops are hiding in the police station. Interesting? Nearly. When the folk populations come out of the presence of the family, we find that both the writer and the editor conspire to replace tension with incomprehensible storytelling techniques in the hope that viewers' inability to tell what is happening will bring riots to the audience. and it works! ... but not as they thought. I was very dissatisfied with how bad this movie was, but I'm not afraid of it at all. Dialogue consists of things that don't make sense. Not in the fun David Lynch way, but some sort of I-walked-in-during-mid-of-boring conversation something like that. During the next hour they learned that filmmakers were trying to frighten us by showing us boring secular scenes combined with the aforementioned "what's going on?" type of scene. The storyline includes something that is in the spirit of the subtle people who put the children into trance through the power of Satan and then bring them to the party to play with toys, and even more sinister intent and depends on a group of white men (all white in the movie) to take weapons and save the day, and a woman with a long eye candy who whines at a drop of hat. They are looking for kidnapped children by searching in random places and shouting the names of the children. This is a great horror movie for anyone who has never seen a horror movie, because the man is frightened by the mere thought of Satanism, Paganism, Wicca, or even Catholicism due to a lifetime of brainwashing from Trinity's broadcasting network. This represents satanism as older people in Halloween costumes with candles while mingling at a party, in front of the Ankh. Repeat with a priest who has poured out completely nonsensical nonsense about the Satanis while you call them "witches". A message that anything that is not Protestantism can all be thrown into the same category for easy condemnation. Make the Teens Goth Vermilion, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up of words. Highlights include a guy laughing at the idea of ​​small green men for a fixed 3 minutes, the family staring out the windows of their car without speaking for 10 minutes while listening to the musical elevator. A priest studying Satanism for 4 minutes with ooh-so scary drawings of demons to frighten the church crowd. Random shots of dolls. Random shots of children. Color instead of blood in every chance. Film school dreams sequence. It represents insignificant characters who do nothing before they leave. Sometimes they behave as if they were doing nothing big. <br /> <br /> Direction is negligent at best. An example of directing involves a scene at the beginning where a man and a woman kiss and a man pulls away to look lovingly into her eyes and a dark red color has fallen on her face. Looking up, he sees that it is not blood but drops from a girl's snowman. Snowcones are icy and colored / flavored waters and would not create drops of the same texture as color, not to mention that her snowman was bright red-orange. Hackneyed writing, sure, but even worse bad overhead. Then he cuts himself into a shot man, a woman and a girl, and shows that he is about four meters away, so a snowman wouldn't drip on a woman, even if she took a snowman on her wife. face. The way to go, editor! Of course, it's a blah. The entire cast could be built on a scale and perfectly balanced between overclocking and imperfect action. The director's most abhorrent technique is to give the actors no motivation, and then go out for lunch as an immobile eye. cameramen will notice that the actors themselves are crazy. Finally, after all, we get to the end, which would be great if competent people could handle it, not Jerry Falwell.
