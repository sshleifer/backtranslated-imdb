I thought this movie was terrible. I understand that it was a shot on a small budget, but the acting was terrible and the film itself was just stupid. The plot was predictable, and the central figure was the unsympathetic morgue. In fact, all the characters were unsympathetic and no one was fully developed at all. There is no audience in the movie. It should have been tense, but if you don't care about characters, it's hard to get into the movie. I felt like someone from outside was forced to listen to someone who told me a stupid story. All the plots in the end were just a little too much - actually I laughed when I was supposed to be "shocked". All in all, I thought it was just a bad movie.
