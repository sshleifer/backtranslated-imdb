This film has some good lines, but observing Dillon's less than mastering Rourke has let me want to see the original. I like Marisa Tomei, but she's not Faye Dunaway. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the rule of the number one is to make the main character something you care about. You don't need a LOVE character, but you should take care of what happens to it. This is accomplished in Barfly with a cheerful running gag about fighting with Eddie Bartender. The main struggle in Factotum is, when, completely unprovoked, he traces up to Lily Taylor's character at the bar, blows her to the floor and calls her bitch. The whole thing just didn't work. Again, some great lines - some laugh-out-loud funny - but as a film overall, it's a failure. The average attempt to rediscover something that was brilliant, and you can't get it. Other? Let's have a Tiffany breakfast with Kate Hudson.
