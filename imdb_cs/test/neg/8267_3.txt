I found it terribly disappointing! But I have added a better similar style option at the foot of this entry. This "Felicia Journey" is interesting. She has a drama. But it's full of stereo types! So they serve only judgmental temperaments without interest in just justice and justice and truth, beyond the black "white" judgments that fit the 30-second "NEWS" ads that complete our daily multimedia experiences, especially news bulletins, true or misleading in these views! It is so EXAGGERATED that it reminds me of the fairy tale "Little Red Riding"! Let's take an innocent young girl who has no identification that goes beyond the guardian's challenge, but free of any evidence to embark on a search for her "Romeo" who has not given her the VERSUS address with a pathetic lack of substance in the hoarse voice of "helping hand" has joined her with his unlikely story, which has been created by the layer! It seems to suit directors and the management team that no one has faith or prays to God, even in times of despair! So in these early settings he organizes and tells much of what's coming! A nightmare journey that betrays the substance of a substance without a fabulous solution, without truth or integrity or credibility! ... Then he turns around and it's over. What a disappointment! If you want to see a much better film that explores similar topics with much greater credibility, with a much stronger insight, watch the 1983 movie Paul Cox / Norman Kaye "Man of Flowers" !!! <br /> <br /> Unlike here, you won't be disappointed!
