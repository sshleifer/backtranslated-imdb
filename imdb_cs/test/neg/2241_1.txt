Countless historical and cultural errors 0/10 <br /> <br /> (1) Jewish guy named OMAR !!! Hahahaha (2) A brilliant detective chose the least intelligent guy in the movie! (3) Jewish suicide bombers !! That was funny. (4) Hitler and his best weapons went to watch a film in the center of Paris !!! Two guards at the door. !! shoot me. (5) Brad Pitt stopped and it was painful to watch him. (6) Mr. QT re-writing history, "Hitler was killed in the theater? Really!" The funny thing about this is that people "and I think stupid people" will actually believe this conspiracy. Finally, someone can tell me how this movie got into the top 250 movies of all time !!! Shame shame shame, still wondering how can someone like this movie.
