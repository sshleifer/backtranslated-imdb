I'm sorry, but I don't understand how this study escapes. The film is just not worth it. Maybe like a play, but not a movie! And why do they call it a thriller ??? Offcource acting is good, but I didn't expect anything from these perfect actors. Robert Redford plays very well and Willem Dafoe is convincing enough as a soft "evil man". Helen Mirren can play almost any role and always (still) looks beautiful to me;). I'm also a fan of her British detectives. I just can't save this boring movie, I'm sorry. I hope that we will not get into many films from this director "Pieter Jan Brugge" because he clearly does not have the meaning of "suspicion and thriller".
