German emigrant and uber-hambone actor Paul Muni, who has never seen a scene he didn't want to chew, goes "blackface" to play a humble Mexican immigrant living in Los Angeles and working in the world. If this wrinkled vehicle is reminiscent of the almighty performance of al Pacino as a non-cultural Cuban in the SCARFACE remake, don't be too surprised. The characters are very similar, and both are wildly pop-eyed when the script calls for it. Hispanics everywhere should be extensively offended by Muni's over-top-performance, as this dizzying Mexican living American dream, the consequences are damn. I think Benicio DelToro wasn't available. Young, bleached blonde Bette Davis plays one of Muni's interests; she eventually goes insanely for the love of Mr. Meh-hee-can Muni. Davis is an absolute rush, the only reason to watch this racially offensive cocoon. When Muni is asked to marry his dreams, it's a totally crazy ending when his son asks him to marry him. wild and rude, "another tribe". Muni immediately turns into Mr. Hyde and chases her with premature death. In the final scene, penitent Muni tells his sober priest that he is returning to his own people, his own kind. End of film. Finish. That's all she wrote. Muni was said to have hired gen-oo-ine Mexican as a chauffeur to study this exotic speech creation pattern and physical habits. Yowza!
