Witchcraft / Witchcraft / La Casa 4 / and whatever you want to call. How about ... Crud. The mass gathering in Massachusetts Island is surrounded by the black magical power of an evil witch who kills every individual with cruel, torturous methods. Gary photographer (David Hasselhoff) takes pictures for Linda (Catherine Hickland, whose voice and performance resemble the EE-YOR Poo Bear cartoon), a virgin witchcraft student, at an island resort without permission. Rose Brooks (Annie Ross, incredibly harsh bitch) is interested in buying a resort and together with her husband Freddie (Robert Champagne, who is always ogling other women much younger than he), pregnant daughter Jane (Linda Blair) and grandson Tommy (Michael Manchester , which only looks bored throughout, probably want to look at Sesame Street instead of playing in this trash), going by boat to the resort treated to look at the property by Tony Giordan's son Jerry (Rick Farnsworth), \ t . Along with these people is the architect Leslie (Leslie Cumming, whose character is nympho) who could help Rose re-design the resort. The ship's captain is killed by Lady in Black (Hildegard Knef, wearing her makeup and lip-stick extra thick) and the storm is boiling. The ship leaves by itself (... led by the invisible force of The Lady in Black, I think) when everyone is stuck in a crumbling resort that is in dire need of repair. Most of the victims, before they meet their horrible fates, are passed through a red wormhole, whose vortex leads to another dimension (... perhaps to hell or something) where they are tortured by these devils dressed in disheveled, miserable clothes. look. One victim has his mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney, baked like the others lights up the fireplace. One poor soul is tormented by the cruel speed of a rope that is tightly wrapped around her body before it is pulled from the muzzle of a swordfish penetrating the neck. One guy chills slowly as his veins bulge (... and bleed) and the blood vessels of the neck burst in Hasselhoff's face! One guy is crucified with nails drawn into his hands before hung upside down over an open flame. Blair's pregnant victim becomes obsessed with the hair standing at the end of another woman's voice. One is raped by this demon man with a "sick" mouth when hellish hobos stand nearby cheerfully. The film, in spite of its excesses, is mostly boring food for those who really want to see the lowest point in their career as Hasselhoff and Blair, who deserve it better. Sometimes almost unbearable, building little or no tension. Clumsy execution of death sequences that look cheap and ridiculous. Sure, some gore is fine, but most of the movie shows victims after they've been ringing. We get a chance to see pregnant women (.. who look just like stunts in costume with bad wigs) and jump out of three windows. Oh, and the reflected face of the lady in black often appears in inanimate objects that the characters see. Tommy has a small Sesame Street recorder that records The Mumbo Jumbo Jumbo Chant, which is probably used later. For some reason, The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy. She is not scared at all, because Tommy is too bored to express her face, much less fear. Do I need to say more? This one is really stinky. Ugh.
