The DVD version released by Crash Cinema was very poorly executed. The champion engineer had to be either drunk, asleep, or even in the room when it was done. It looks like it has been mastered since about the tenth generation and about halfway through the movie, audio sync disappears. The dialogue is about 10 or 15 seconds behind the sound. If you are considering buying this DVD, please save your money. I remember seeing this movie in the theater in 1973. Also, a copy of VHS of this movie under the title "When Taekwondo Strikes" looks better than a DVD, but the remaining few minutes of the movie are "missing. Where is the original camera negative?
