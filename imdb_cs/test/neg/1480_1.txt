This is really one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Rod Steiger, acting as grandfather ornery, Charlie, is in full mode, hoping that the more charming he is, the better his performance (Cue buzzer sound). Rod Steiger is one of the last legends about the film and seeing it in this movie (although the end of days is the second worst movie I've ever seen) is really heartbreaking. From the wrong story to the non-existent direction, it is clear that the only reason this film was made was that the producer's surname ended in DeLaurentis. The only good thing about this movie is that it's so bad, it's really hysterical. Check out the flashback scene where Rod is where the Jor-El wig from Superman and the big black mustache. The only one hopes that his subsequent film, I Believe in America, by producer Uber Kevin Arbouet, will redeem him and leave a good taste in everyone's mouth.
