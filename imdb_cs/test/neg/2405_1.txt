This film has the honor of being the worst movie I've ever seen and the only movie I ever awarded 1 out of 10 to imdb. I was confused to rent it because of the art of H.R. Giger. This envelope art is the only thing that is on this smoking saw ... <br /> <br /> It was about a frat that fought "madmen" in a strange but not so interesting post-apocalyptic world where cities are in The ruins / chaos, but apparently the suburbs are still a safe and beautiful place for young men to be able to scold other men into braindead frat organizations. The most uninspiring presentation of boring characters, not so special effects, harsh, unoriginal scenery and only generally poor quality in all production aspects make this lemon all the time on my losers list. <br /> <br /> FINAL EVALUATION: 1/10 I wish I could give zero.
