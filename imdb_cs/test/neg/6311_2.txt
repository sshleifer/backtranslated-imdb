It's really awful. Quaid beats more than Shatner. The part in which Elvis walks and says "You can have it all" kills everything that might be good in this movie, which is bad enough as it is. Drug use was completely covered with snow, the only thing that had to do with his life was a little about his cousin's wedding. Quaid also doesn't look like Lewis and has dark roots and eyebrows. I wish it could be re-created in the future with someone who doesn't. A bigger budget wouldn't hurt and maybe more about his real life. I was very, very disappointed in Quaid. Don't look at this movie or you'll be too.
