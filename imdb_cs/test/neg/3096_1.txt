I'm not afraid of bad movies. I like bad movies. I enjoy taunting my friends' company. In fact, we're pretty good at it. I'll tell you how much I hated this movie. At first it was incomprehensible. Rob Lowe attacks some people, catches him, but escapes in this big shot. There's this singer we think he died, just she didn't, if maybe not a few of them behave and look the same. Cue Burt Reynolds comes in and asks the singer. Looks like he just threw himself into this Walker, Texas Ranger movie, and he's damned confused. Then Rob Lowe dies, only he doesn't ... And the worst thing is, there's not enough dialogue or action that doesn't involve killing people or trying to make fun of this movie !! And don't even start me on a random chihuahua. Then came the fact that it is an old power structure in Eastern Europe that is falling apart. We didn't know where we were, all the accents were probably "Eastern European" and what was Burt Reynolds and Rob Lowe doing in the first place? I desperately wanted to tell people on the Sniper what I thought about this movie and get my money back, but since I got it as special (just $ .99), I decided against it. But what I want to know is HOW TO DIRECT GREENLIGHT to make this damn movie, and what 'stars' wondering when they signed up ???
