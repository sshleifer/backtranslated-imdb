This experimental silent film, made in Switzerland by an independent British film company, is primarily remembered as Paul Robese's first film. It's very artistic, with shots often seem nonsensical for a story that's hard to understand as well because lack of enough inter-titles. From what I gathered is Robeson's wife, Adah, in an interracial love affair with a white man named Thorne. He does not bother the owner of the bar / hotel where Thorne lives (and seems to have a lesbian relationship with the bartender), but the old lady expresses the city's opinion in the inter-title: "If I had my way, we wouldn't allow the blacks here." at the bar, Adah tries to put up with Pete (Robeson), but eventually leaves him, Thorne's wife, Astrid, goes from the deep end, bends the knife, cuts Thorne's hand and face, and somehow dies. When it comes to Pete, he gets a letter from the mayor, who tells him that it is best for anyone who leaves the city, so the film is more about racism than anything else, but Pete's owner says: "The sad thing is they think they're right. This is the way we are. "The meaning of the name is a mystery. It can refer to Adah being a light-skinned (border negro) or to the borderline behavior of the main characters.
