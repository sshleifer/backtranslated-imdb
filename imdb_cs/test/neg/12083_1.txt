This film had the potential. If it were dealt with differently. He needed another director. That's for sure. And maybe another leading lady. I can't understand the character of Minnie Driver - or at least how it played. She was absolutely incredible. I can't believe she would enjoy her performance in this movie. She probably left the director or couldn't bring what the director was trying to do to her. I'm writing it because I'm still watching it. I think I would hate being in her shoes and trying to "act" something I didn't understand. Well, we've just approached the issue that starts with his son (I'm still watching). I'm getting deeply embarrassed for everyone involved in this business. If you like watching movies that miss their brand in a big way, then watch this.
