Yes, this movie contains a gallery called Jessica that says everything is bad and causes trees to land on people (but it just causes the tree to fall once, but she says everything is bad). This film is about a farm that apparently rents rooms to people but offers little space for entertainment. Jessica finds things with her wand and finds the head of an evil guy. Of course, they do not know this until the owner of the farmer's assistants opens the box containing the head. The head progresses to hypnotize everyone that can so it can get to Jessica and use her powers to find things to help look for his body. This film has a rather interesting story, but it plays very badly here. Anyone who gets nervous at least once in this swing.
