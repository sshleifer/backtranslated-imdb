I want back 99 minutes of my life, wasted by this pathetic apology for the movie. Acting was scary! I used to be a fan of Cameron Diaz and Vincent D'Onofrio. I'll never look at them anyway. Keanu Reeves and Dan Aykroyd were not surprised. Everyone knows they could never act. Fortunately, only Dan tried an accent. His accent was expected to be a disaster. I think he was either confused about the location of the film, or never spoke to anyone in Minnesota. I hope this review will help anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time. The only reason I was able to go through the whole movie was that I was somewhere without having to watch or read.
