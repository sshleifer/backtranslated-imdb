I read Stuff Magazine about the bloodiest, bloodiest movies that Asia had to offer, and immediately jumped on Netflix to quench my thirst. The boy I did. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First and foremost, no conspiracy I expected to be a storyline (see: "Revenge") has turned into a series of events just happening to spend $ 14.89 of special effects budget and wasted study. They should have kept their money and not wasted their time or yours. <br /> <br /> When a major conspiracy occurs, Tetsuo II: Body Hammer gets a new identity and I didn't buy it. There's a flashback that should answer our questions, but I thought I was at Showtime at 3:47 and dropped ACID. The film continues and spirals get out of control with shabby graphics and special (Olympic) effects. It seems to me that this film is bitter? Yes. Have I seen Iron Man? No. Was there a conspiracy? No. Was it so symbolic that I didn't understand it? NO. Was there a Hammer body? He beats Hell from Me. So take my advice and STAY away !!!!!! <br /> <br /> (I have to admit that I wrote a lot of fun and laughed about this movie that if you want to laugh, WATCH IT !!!)
