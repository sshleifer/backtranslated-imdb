I watched DEATH MACHINES as part of the BCI Eclipse 'Drive-in Cult Classics (representing Crown International Pictures) on DVD. When I work on several DVDs, I love many Crown International movies - especially those scary, erotic psychological thrillers! DEATH MACHINES is not one of them. <br /> <br /> After watching movies like MALIBU BEACH, CREEPING TERROR and PINK ANGELS it's hard to say it's the worst movie ever made; but he doesn't have much to do. No Conspiracy; really no story to talk about. Acting is not clear? only the actor responsible for the terribly played Tony (with a thick false Italian accent) tried to "get into character." <br /> <br /> The score is annoying and pedantic. The only thing on this film is why ... what made the filmmakers create this movie? They thought about the story: 1) three ninja, 2) two competing bosses, 3) a bartender / karate student character; and 4) his pitiful love-interested sister was so convincing that the world would not be complete without this film being made? It is a complete waste of time and money for you, me, the manufacturer, the writer, the actor and the director.
