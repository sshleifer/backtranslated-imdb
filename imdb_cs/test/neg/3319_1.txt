This is definitely the worst vampire flick of all time. I started watching it right after talking to a vampire and I was completely disappointed. Not only does this film scenario have craters as large as a large canyon, the film seemed to have jumped from one scene to another, making the audience confused. Vampire Lestat played Stuart Townsend was a terrible-having a good body doesn't mean you're an actor! The queen's end was too easy and sudden, and insulted viewers by intelligence. I'll give it one star, because Aaliyah really tried the best in this movie and the soundtrack is pretty good. Otherwise, I'd advise Anne Rice to marry an ax and start hacking those who destroyed her brilliant story.
