This film cannot be serious because it has a nerdy-looking baby named Curtis killing people. The other two psycho kids are a little cute, but that Curtis baby is so ugly because they wear these huge, brown, ugly glasses. The actor probably wandered the wrong set and should really go to the Revenge of Nerds. Another thing I hate so much about this movie is that Curtis takes his sweet time shooting people. I held my finger on the quick button because it took too long and what was wrong with his voice? It sounded like fourteen and not ten. Another thing I hated was that he was still smiling like an idiot and that it didn't make sense. Then they put the sullen baby in the freezer and somehow found a flashlight. It didn't make any sense, not even music. The music didn't fit into any scene. This movie is slow, boring and wasting time. Watch another movie on your birthday.
