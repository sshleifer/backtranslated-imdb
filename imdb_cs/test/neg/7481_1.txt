Nothing that Carson Daly said at this show or did, EVER made me laugh or even smile a little. I don't understand how this show has survived so many years. Even a "funny" band member, like one of those high school kids who thinks no one is good enough to look at him. They gave and that dude is just arrogant boys. Looks like they're not even trying to be a little funny. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL show. It's my soul crying. Just can't stress enough how amazing this show is. Don't look at it. But if you are absolutely necessary, I recommend that your eyes pull out and clog the ears with cement.
