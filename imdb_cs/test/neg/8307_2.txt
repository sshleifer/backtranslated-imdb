What a terrible movie! Acting in this film is about the quality of a high school game, or a story driven pornographic movie. This is not pornography in this movie, but there is definitely a lot of gratuitous nudity! This is one of the few redeeming features of the film, one of the few things that saved him from receiving a star rating. Also in this movie, a million cops die. Hardly offensive because violence is so unrealistic that we can only laugh. But the breasts will pop up and be exposed to the most surprising and cheerful times, if you are enjoying really bad movies, check it. This is the Bonnie and Clyde story where the mother and her two daughters are on revenge. This movie also has a sex scene with two of the oldest people I've ever seen rolling naked!
