So much for JUDGE AND JURY who lives up to his pointless title. What's good there? The lighting is so foggy! Ask another horror movie? Well, that's perfectly explained. David Keith actually does pretty well in camouflage clowns, cooks and other shenanigans while he is the killer who escaped the death line. But overall, despite some new twists, it is reasonably stupid. Unapix has recently released sad productions and that means only so much. We, the jury, find this film guilty for its indecent exposure of many of us who believed it was the total loss of our time!
