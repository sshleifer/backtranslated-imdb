I work in a video store, so every week I try to see the movies we're about to release. I do not have a problem with it; I actually feel that it is a privilege. Not with this movie. . . After an hour and a half of our hero who screams and growls around the scene, I was really wondering if they were planning to get to the point. I felt like I was supposed to get paid for watching it at home in my spare time. And if I knew there was another hour to last, I might have given up. I wasn't interested in the characters, the shooting was remarkable, and Ford kissed like a chore. Even the score was inconsistent and violent. What a shame.
