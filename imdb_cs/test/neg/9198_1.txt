If you pack all the clichés about city firefighters within 105 minutes; you have a ladder 49. It has a story but is heavily shrouded in all the clichés. It makes him a movie with every event; it becomes so predictable that it's not worth watching. There is no depth to the story and even acting seems superficial. It seemed to be a tribute to firefighters, but in the end it was boring and arrogant. The parallel between Jack Morrison, who was mortally trapped under the inaccessible part of the building, and the firefighters who were trapped under the Twin Towers wreckage was too obvious. It's not compared to movies like Backdraft and is certainly not an example of future firefighter movies.
