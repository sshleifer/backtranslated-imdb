This is a horrible movie from almost every angle. Since many of them have been mentioned in previous reviews, let me focus on the "Serbs" and "Delta Force" boys in this movie. 1) Uniforms worn by "Serbs" are not Serbian. And helmets are also bad. 2) Actors who play "Serbs," don't speak Serbian, or a language close to Serbian, as opposed to "Beyond Enemy Lines," where Czech actors played the best language and add at least some credibility to the film. 3) The gray-bearded "Serbian general" looks and behaves like a moron, shoots his weapon whenever US soldiers call his name: <br /> <br /> - American Soldier: "Gravic ! Give up!" <br /> <br /> - The Gray-Bearded Moronic General: (Burns His AK47) <br /> <br /> - American Soldier: "Gravic! Come Out!" GBMG: (Burns your AK47) <br /> <br /> - US Soldier: "Gravic! You're surrounded by" <br /> <br /> - GBMG: (Burns your AK47) Prop guy: "Excuse me, Mr. Gray-Bearded Moronic General, we see that we are empty and I sent the boy to buy something more, but he's not back yet ..." > <br /> - GBMG: (click) <br /> <br /> 4) Since when does the army release AK47s Delta Force? I think they couldn't find enough M4 jobs in Bulgaria, but there were a lot of old AK47s and practical blanks; 5) In a scene where a DF officer hangs on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist, he keeps his finger on the trigger all the time. No sensible person with weapons training or common sense would ever do it. I think the actor thought his cold level was rising the longer he held the gun. This film is so an insult to common sense.
