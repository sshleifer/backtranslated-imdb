I'm not going to tell the story of the movie, as some people do. I'm pretty sure people who read it will know the story. I will not go on and on everything that is wrong with this film, because I will be here forever if I will. The storyline is typical and special effects are below today's standards. This is not a movie you should watch if you are a serious movie enthusiast (as most of us are here), little things will annoy you with the whole movie and destroy the experience. If your casual movie watcher who likes to spend time watching a movie, then this movie is perfect for you, a lot of fun. It would also be a good movie to take a partner. Just not movie enthusiasts for us. <br /> <br /> 5 of 10
