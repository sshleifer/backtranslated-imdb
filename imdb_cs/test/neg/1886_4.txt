Okay - The "Frankenstein House" title was a reference to the original Frankenstein film. When it follows a movie called "House of Dracula" that has no real meaning, you know that it is just starting to turn into a franchise. Without explanation, Dracula is back and is called by Baron Latos himself. He infiltrates the home of Dr. Edelmann, with the claim that he is looking for a cure for his vampirism. Edelmann has a hunchback sister who helps him (what is it with hunchback assistants in these movies?), But what Dracula is really interested in is his next, more beautiful assistant. At this point, Larry "Wolf Man" Talbot returns (again without explanation) and just happens to be looking for the same doctor to cure his lycanthropy. And then it just happens that it falls into a cave in which plants can be grown to help him, which also just contains a Frankenstein monster. Dear God, when it ends ... sure, the other universal sequels of monsters were stupid, but this is just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Good things first. There are some great settings, and vampire bat effects are slightly better than usual. Some of the other effects are also nice. John Carradine is not as bad as Dracula once you get used to him, but still nothing like brilliant like Lugosi. In my opinion, Onslow Stevens plays a much better vampire in this film, although he has exactly the opposite problem to Carradine - all ghost and no class. None of the performances are so big, but it's more of a terrible scenario than anything else - the female parts are particularly badly written. But stupid, as it is, remains largely amusing. The best part is that it's a short length. Now it's bad things ... it's not scary, it's badly written, and it doesn't work. I was hoping three monsters would start some supernatural power struggle, but it wouldn't happen. It focuses almost exclusively on Dracula, which is not particularly portrayed. On the other hand, this is the only film in which Dracula infects another man, but it is done through blood transfusion rather than bite as Universal was always uncomfortable with possible homosexual overtones. Larry Talbot is decent as always Wolf Man, but he plays a relatively small part. Again, part of Frankenstein's monster is reduced to anti-climatic closing moments. For God, Glenn Strange was fantastic as a creature! Why give him more time on the screen? It's unfortunate that the series had to end up on this note (it doesn't count the classic comedy "Abbott & Costello Meet Frankenstein"). Eventually she just lit up in the sun and died, just like Dracula himself.
