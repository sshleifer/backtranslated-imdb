Okay ... for the most part, and all his cheesiness, this movie was actually pretty good for MST3K movie ... but then they decided to destroy what it was about 15 minutes before the end. * SPOILER ALERT * The film is very basic ... A rich mom's boy named Danny meets Bix's ass and they both travel to a small town where Bix meets a pretty girl named Carrie (who's so much.) it seemed promising. All they needed was to watch a simple chemistry of a fiction film ... Carrie loves Bix ... Bix loves Carrie ... a haunted guy in town, lust for Carrie ... Now I know what you think. Bix fights creep and finally decided to settle with Carrie and Danny returns home and everyone lives happily ever after. POORLY!! Because Carrie is murdered by the city because Bix is ​​too gay to commit. (There are so many homosexual undertones between Danny and Bix.) And then the whole city decides to lynch Bix, even if the town stream is perhaps the main suspect. Then the city creeps that Carrie kills without much hesitation ... (it must have felt bad, bad dope.) Then Danny brings Bix home with him ... that's a movie "happily ever after". Sad, huh? All I can say is thank God for Joel and Bots. Because this hockey hockey turned into one of my favorite MST3K episodes.
