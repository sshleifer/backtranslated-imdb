As a flying and war movie enthusiast, it ranks at the bottom of my list. It's historically completely inaccurate and casting sounds and acts as if they just got out of high school. Activity, scenario, direction, production standards and castings are all garbage. The only salvation grace is some of the flying sequences. If the people they portrayed were fictitious, I could rate it 2, but if there is one thing that annoys me more than anything else in the movies, it pretends to be history and that the great people they're trying to do are actually doing it ! Its almost as if they were trying to write as many remarkable WW1 personalities as possible. There are many good WW1 flying movies, and it's NOT one of them.
