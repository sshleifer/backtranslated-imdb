It was hard to find words to explain how much I hated this movie. The historical process with Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and Duc de Praslin is a tragic and convincing story that I believe has had the potential to be a fantastic film but has failed. Although cinema certainly had something to say to itself, it could by no means replace the horrific film structure, the poorly written script, and most of the terribly overworked characters. The worst of them were Duc's children, who were so exaggerated and excruciatingly false that it was almost painful to watch. In conclusion, this film let me feel more than irritated and deeply disappointed.
