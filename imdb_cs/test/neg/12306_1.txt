No balancing feature, this film is waste. His jokes won't be funny. Children's humor is miserable and attempts to reach adults only add a cheap smell to the whole crappy package. Sitting with him with my kids just worried me what might be next. I couldn't enjoy the film at all. Although my child, for whom the DVD was purchased, enjoyed having a new DVD, neither she nor her sisters expressed much interest in its re-display, unlike Monsters inc, Finding Nemo, Jungle Book, Lion King, etc. record requests.
