This is a below average "whodunit" with a clich√© that everyone in the living room routine. Charlie Chan is a secret service agent who does government work and has to find out who killed a bomb scientist to defeat German U-boats in World War II. Nothing is recommended with this film because neither the bomb, nor the scientist nor the war has anything to do with the conspiracy. Charlie Chan fans will most likely find this movie disappointing. Who's dunit? Who cares?
