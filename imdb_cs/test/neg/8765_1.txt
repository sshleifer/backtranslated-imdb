This movie was terrible. The behavior was terrible. The script was terrible. The camera's pictures and sound were even worse. Half of the time did not match the actors' lips and the different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different. The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge cross-shaped building. The building had to be 50 stories high and about 100 meters wide. However, when the actor was at the top, in the next shot, they had "over" the top of the building. The width of the building was reduced to about eight feet. How could a building be hundreds of feet eight feet wide? I know the film was low but inexcusable. The film itself only pushed thoughts about "trance", then actually have a story or point. This reduced the script to mere waste, the characters appeared to be selling ideas in their lines rather than imparting emotions and moving the film in the direction. It was a complete waste of tracking. The film gives Christians a bad name if it is one of the best Christian films ever.
