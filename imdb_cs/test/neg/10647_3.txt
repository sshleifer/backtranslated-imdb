By the time the Hellraiser franchise had reached its fourth film, this assumption was a bit thin. Dr. Paul Merchant (Bruce Ramsey) is a future scientist whose prisoner is returning to prison for his story of how his ancestors (all played by Ramsey) first built the criminal Lament Configuration, which sets the evil in the world and how his bloodline followed box. The film is tremendous with a lack of continuity in other films and lack of coherence in this film. Yes, it could be due to a combination of transcripts, massive cuts in the original movie version or what you have. But I watch the film as it is, not what it was or could be. And because it's a mess now. Of course, the franchise will continue indefinitely with a direct continuation on DVD, but this was to some extent the death of the nails, it's a chance of getting a new one that was reissued theatrically. <br /> <br /> My class: D-
