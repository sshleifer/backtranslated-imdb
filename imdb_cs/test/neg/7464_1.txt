Linda Lovelace was a victim of a sadistic woman hating, Chuck Traynor. I don't understand how it is possible that sex with a dog (which is also animal abuse) is fun or entertaining. Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these movies. I know that some people criticize this commentary, but I feel that these types of films stimulate fire of hatred and other misogynist feelings towards women. This society still displays women as sexual objects as opposed to human beings. We call ourselves "civilized," but I feel we have a long way to go before we can scratch the surface of civilization.
