It's okay ... a few years later, Chayefsky's classic "Net" will be his real BIG home run ... but for now, this dark comedy is not the classic he is trying to be. It's mostly horrible, though it has several good scenes: the first murder victim was found, an ER clerk responsible for billing patients who discovered a surprising discovery, Drummond's vicious confessional and the last scene where Scott's character gains his professional integrity and self-esteem. It also has some sad scenes: Scott's character is an angry monologue during his early visit to hospital psychiatrist, Scott's character raping Rigg's character, Dysart's terrible ambush in his short scenes, and O.R. a doctor who has set on the operating table to resuscitate the wrong patient because "I already have one trial". Chayefsky is also trying to throw TOO HARD every conceivable obstacle in this one hospital (ie murders, administrative mistakes, poor people protest outside, etc.). It could have worked better by looking at the industry as a whole. Breed-wise: Scott is open, Rigg looks bad, Hughes is inspired and Dysart mugs over his short performance. The casting residue is TOO one-dimensional.
