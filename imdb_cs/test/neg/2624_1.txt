Lazy movie from a lazy director. The characters are grotesque. Despite the tragedy of this war, there is no emotion at all. The symbolism is artificial and ineffective (and the old Bosnian woman who took pictures of her son Arbor, "concretizes" her willingness, awakens the super-mother sleeping in her, the corpse eaten by worms to show the horror of genocide ... too much is sometimes worst than not enough) . This film is merely advertising, an empty elegance for a woman who is not a hero. She worked for the United Nations. Remember, the UN was unable to protect the civilians in Srebrenica. Who are the real heroes of this war? A Canadian judge who post-mortem court for atrocities, which mostly happened because their organization could not prevent them? Where is the criticism in this movie?
