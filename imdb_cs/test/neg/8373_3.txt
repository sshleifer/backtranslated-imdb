Maybe we have Aussies just a completely different sense of humor and that's my only question. I have a database of all the DVDs that I own (including the ones I received as gifts - which was), so when I enter a new one I always refer to IMDb for such information as genre, runtime, director, supervisor, etc. When I enter this I noticed that it was a comedy, so I decided to watch it when I wanted something light and good laughter. Well, it wasn't! There was no laughter at all, and a tremendous amount of unjustified blasphemy (are there really radio broadcasters who can send out the filth that Steve Jones is giving away food? What if a decent kid tuned to his station?). > <br /> Rather than enjoying a good laugh (or even a little laugh) I found the whole thing thoroughly depressed. I gave it 3 out of 10, but to be honest, I don't know what these 3 are for! I suppose the basics of lighting and sound were not too bad! <br /> <br /> We have a seemingly stone broken loser (Giovanni Ribisi) who is still able to drive a reasonable car (who pays for fuel?) and lives in what might be a nice apartment (who pays his rent?) To be able to create what might be some meaningful relationship with what turned out to be a nice girl, he even blew it up! Maybe it was her (Lynn Collins) who won this movie 3 points! The fact that she works as a stripper rather than a hairdresser is one of the few aspects of this film that makes sense ("I do what I do in one night, as I do in two weeks of hairdressing"). <br /> <br /> If you don't want to get depressed and get bored of your teeth, forget it!
