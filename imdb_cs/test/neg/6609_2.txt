the movie is just awful (2/10). Although the actors are trying to do their best (sometimes it's not much), special effects are ... let me tell you that it would be better if there were none. The script is based on Sapkowski's prose, so it should be the biggest advantage of this movie. Unfortunately, it is the other way around. There was nothing left of the original atmosphere. And it's all very chaotic. Maybe they just had too much material to show up at 2h. Anyway, if you would like to see this movie, I would recommend that you look for a TV series (the same name, the same actors, even the storyline stays the same) that was done at the same time the movie did. It's much better (9/10) and the story actually makes sense :)
