I decided to watch this movie because it was labeled "the scariest movie ever" so I expected it. Unfortunately, what I found out is that the film didn't have a single frightening moment in it (and I'm the kind of person who jumps very easily). The film was nothing but a terrible clich√©, and every time there was a leap moment, it was incredibly clear. The benefits of this movie would be music and a strange scene that is actually well filmed (like the last scene when it opens the door and you see Tun in Reflection and when it turns to see a ghost on your shoulders). Overall, this movie really adds nothing new to the J-Horror genre and there was no creativity and scare around.
