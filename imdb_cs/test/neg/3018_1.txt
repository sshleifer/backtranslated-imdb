While it bothers me to some extent that I bother to baptize a comment table for this new series - mainly because I do not like to make a false impression that there is in fact any semblance of public interest in it - I feel compelled to throw My Chips in this place . Simply put, I have never felt so convinced before to take root in the quick and merciless abolition of TV shows based solely on promotional promotions. And if you're curious, I'm dude. Listen, Comedy Network: Although your original original programming is already, we have to politely say "dubious" quality (I ') m looking at you, "Girls will be girls") you really outperformed yourself on this one. The one who couldn't keep in touch with this green-lighted thing with what's fine now. Good luck.
