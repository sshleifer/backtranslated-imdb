I sat all 2 hours. I don't know what was worse, a terrible conspiracy, a lame character, or a Hawaiian hottie that Eddie's eleven-year-old boy and an 80-year-old grandfather made sexual advances toward.

The only bright spot is that it is such a bad assessment that we will never see it on TV. Avoid all costs ... RENT ERNEST SAVE XMAS or something else.
