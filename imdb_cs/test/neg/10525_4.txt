What I wouldn't do to write this film again. Extra disappointing because of the big start, Solo Dios Sabe degenerates into a mess of superstitious bull after halfway and ends up on the note so ridiculous, soppy and melodramatic I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie I started. The film had numerous elements in its favor, such as the chemistry between Diego Luna and Alice Braga so tangible I thought the screen would sparkle, a great soundtrack, and beautiful places. Instead of ending with a cumbersome religious mumbo jumbo, the film should keep the focus on being a foamy road movie with perhaps some undertones of fate and superstition versus. I understand that the whole director's intent with the film was about religion, but the fact is, it just didn't work, so he threw away so many great things from the beginning.
