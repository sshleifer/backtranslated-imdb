A disturbing film that, as it does, with intense intimate encounters between a naked man and his young son, but in its confused structure contains a poetically visualized visual survey of the innocence of idealized amnesia. The story follows two threads, the weaker of which is the gradual revelation of the Graham / Pablo state. An injury through this, though, is a beautiful account of his condition, and his meandering path to partial awakening, driven by his affair with Irene. The thing is a strong thread, while the specifics of the plot are carried seemingly attached to a collection of characters: Graham's best friend, who can reveal the cause of his condition in a clumsy flashback, his manipulative boss and his comic mad scientist psychologist: all of whom they are keen to keep him lost and addicted. <br /> <br /> Film failure is a conflict between two threads. One is visual, meandering and sublime, while the other is structured as an irreversible thriller, all interpretative dialogue, and unsolved patterns of symbolism. Nevertheless, I enjoyed Novo. She flirts with the abyss of taboo and avoids something beautiful, like a quarry, with a double bassist and both women, when setting a scene of cheap pornography becomes a segment of peace and rejuvenation. I still don't get a tooth. Weird, clumsy and narrative failure, but with almost redeemable beauty.
