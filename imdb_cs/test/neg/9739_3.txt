Most of you didn't really like this movie there ... you were right. A small minority really loved the movie ... can't say you're wrong. For me, this movie was too stupid. I've seen many stupid, stupid comedies, but each one overcomes them. As I watched, I couldn't stop wiping my eyes, believing what I saw, and trying to decide if I should laugh or scream because things were on the screen that were on the screen and people were leaving the theater. <br /> <br /> According to leading figures, time travel is accomplished, just enter any museum and you will actually travel to the past. In addition, if you're looking for a post-death experience, go to the nearest planetarium where you will meet the Lord - sorry, Loydde, and get important orders ... Everything above makes no sense, right? Well, go ahead, watch the movie (I almost never regret the movies I'm watching), you probably won't like it, but you will be interested in the writer's ability to create the STUPID ... <br /> <br /> 10, it's not good, by far the worst ...
