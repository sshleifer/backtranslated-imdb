Talk about the creepy. If you really want to sit down and watch this episode where the girl who was in Firefly later gets kidnapped there is fun for you but only if you like something like that. I didn't think I'd be honest, this episode was scary. Fortunately, it's one of the few duff episodes of Season 3, and the only episode of Charles Grant Craig, so you won't get so much in Season 3. Just read the summary above. That's a strong opponent (Hell Money says hi!) For the worst episode of season 3. To be honest, I didn't expect much. I wish I could completely transform this episode. That's one thing they were right about: the title.
