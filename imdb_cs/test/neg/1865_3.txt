This is a pretty bad movie, but oh well, this movie is at least not as lame as the third movie Ghoulies. Yes, this is a bad movie in terms of writing, directing, playing and basically everything in between. It has such a weak, simple and mocking story, that besides has little to do with the previous Ghoulies movie items. He's been trying to combine the film with the first film, "Ghoulies," since 1985, but on the other hand, if they really wanted to join this movie with their predecessors, then there were Ghoulies in this movie? Instead, we have a few small people playing Tony Cox and Arturo Gil, dressed as demons. Not that the Ghoulies from previous movies were any classic characters but they were nonetheless the heart and soul of the film and also provided films with a certain amount of fun. It's like having Gremlins without Gremlin. The film is not really interesting to watch because it lacks tension, good humor, interesting characters and basically everything else you can think of, because people who are apparently not the most talented in their business have come together. As with director Jim Wynorski, continue with movies such as "The Witch of Breastwick" and his sequel, "Alabama Jones and Busty Crusade", "House on the Hooter Hill", "Screaming Queen Hot Tub Party", "The Bare Wench Party" Project " and continuing "The Bare Wench Project 2: Scared Topless" and "The Bare Wench Project 3: Nymphs Mystery Mountain" and "The Da Vinci Coed" on it. <br /> <br /> Yeah, the movie is pretty stupid and campy , but it's not really enough to encourage this movie and give it a little more fun, you know, it's a kind of cheap movie with some lame special effects, costumes, make-up and actors no one has ever heard since. <br /> < Still it is not the worst movie of the series because of the fact that "Ghoulies III: Ghoulies Go to College" is by far the worse movie because it had some terrible humor attempts. although the end result is far from dock Bad movie creation and maybe just observable for those who saw previous Ghoulies items. <br /> <br /> 3/10
