The figure of Empress Elisabeth of Austria (1837-1898) is in fact mostly associated with Roma Schneider and Sissi trilogy Ernst Marischka (1950s), where beauty, gentleness, sweetness and history are present. This was Sissi, maybe a myth for some; however, strong display. The spirit of Habsburg grandeur, as well as the spirit of Bavarian simplicity and straightforwardness, influenced many of these films. They just had a soul. However, Jean Daniel Verhaeghe's film, though made 50 years later, seems to be a bad depiction of the Empress and her life. It seems to be an attempt to show something else, to reveal some realism as a cure for sweetness; however, it does not occur to add much but rather prepares the whole story a lot. Let me analyze this in more detail. September 1898 Sissi goes to the port of Geneva. Accompanied by her court maid, she visits Dr. Mayer (Didier Bezace), who tells the whole life story to find herself in this tragic life. The event consists of memories of important moments in Sissi's life, but these moments are chaotically presented, and therefore someone who is not sufficiently familiar with Austrian history can be completely confused or confused. Great attention is paid to the poor marriage of Sissi to Emperor Franz Joseph. The scene of her wedding night is a failure. No one has treated such an empress (I mean undressing and paying). The focus on Sissi, which is misunderstood, is historically correct, but points that are different from other courtiers are not true. Where is her desire for peace? Where is her love for the nation? Where is her charity? Sissi appears to be very elegant, modern, liberal (from the perspective of the 21st century). Above all, she looks after her appearance, which is not historically true. Sissi had an inner life that wasn't in the film. "Once Women Wear Pants" is a sentence told her and there is a picture of Sissi introduced in the movie. Sissi attacks the monarchy, a critique of the film against the Austrian empire. In addition, he partly accepts anarchist movements and, to my surprise, accuses his husband, Emperor Franz Joseph, of the death of their son Rudolf. Where is any mention in history that Sissi was present in Mayerling? Sissi's relationship with Sophie, the law's mother, is better shown, but the scene of Sophie's death seems barely authentic and the conversation a little clich√©. Sorry to criticize so much, but another crucial aspect of the film, which I consider to be weak, is performances. Although Arielle Dombasle has her moments like Sissi, she is generally unsuitable. She looks more like a "femme fa tale" than a tragic empress. Her make-up is really inaccurate, like most of her gestures like the Empress. Malik Zidi is slightly better than Rudolf and can generally be considered a person who increases the value of the performance. Yet, Stephane Audran has no special work as Sophie: you just don't feel like hating Sissi. She despised her for Sissin's young age when she was crowned because of her behavior, her lifestyle, and her believers. Partially appearing in the movie, but it's not enough. But I think the biggest mistake is Julien Hans Capua as Andrassi. Andrassi was with pride, honor, patriotism ... here, he seems to be a kind of libertarian thinking, just to love his queen. The image is so weak that this performance is very pale. The exact choice is Tatyana Ivanova as Catherine Schratt, she really fits into the role of her looks and gestures. Unfortunately, her role does not require much time on the screen. The good point of this movie are some costumes and quite authentic places. The port of Geneva is well presented and the moment of Sissi's death is a good surprise from the film. It does not seem to be the case; But the moment is symbolically good ... the Empress walks and knows nothing about her last moment. So she had to feel it, that's how one mad man destroyed part of the world. Another good moment was when Sissi talked to her son Rudolf at Corfu. But these moments are rare. In short, it's not a good movie. It disturbs a very significant historical figure, a significant historical time, tries to cure the sweetness of the Sissi trilogy, but it seems to offer nothing creative. The charm is gone, the grandeur is gone and history is ignored! It's not much worth looking for! 3/10
