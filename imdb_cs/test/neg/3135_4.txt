First of all, Chokher Bali was not my cup of tea. Apparently this film was not aimed at the masses. It is a type that critics would like to watch. Humor and publicity were quite misleading. I expected something very dramatic like Devdas. Understanding that the story and the time period required, I found the film to be very slow. I'm a fan of Aishwarya and I regret that I thought it was wrong. Chokher Bali's role required an actress who may prove subversive, not innocent and naive. Everyone else was doing well. Tagore's portrayal of the human condition encounters celluloid so that the film gets an interesting subject.
