I like bad movies: Showgirls, Plan 9 from Outerspace, and so on. And this movie fits right in. Don't trust anyone who tells you, it's a good movie. It's totally awful. Tim Curry's accent comes from German to Portuguese into Hungarian. A gorilla suit is a person who is supposed to be able to communicate using a glove that interprets the sign language of a monkey. There is a scene with a hippo killer who moves around the river like a great white shark. There are people hopping up and down Mt. Kilimanjaro as if escalators were installed on it. The thing is ridiculously ridiculous. So ridiculous I rolled on the floor. It's totally unlikely. I loved every minute.
