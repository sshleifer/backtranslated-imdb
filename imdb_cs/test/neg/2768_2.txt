I couldn't make the heads or tails of this horrible noir movie. The story was confusing, the acting was fine, but the picture quality was terrible! Although I bought it on "Gansters Double Pack" (8 films on two disks) on WalMart for $ 5.50 and when you put the DVD inside, it apologizes for the horrible image quality that some movies may have. The storyline was a flip flopping wherever I couldn't understand, and had no idea what was going on ... then "The End" jumped up and the movie ended. <br /> <br /> What a waste of time! <br /> <br /> I say don't waste any money or time on it! Or if you also bought that Gansters Double Pack then just skip this one ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
