Kindred opens to Porsche shots on the highway, runs down the old pickup truck and rises. As it goes past the pick-up driver (Benjamin J.erry as Ben Perry) screams obscenity and sticking out his horn. Distracted, he did not notice the obstacles that threatened him, and would break the Porsche. He is quickly freed from debris and taken to a hospital. On the way, the rescuer (Randy Harrington), who is trying to save him, suggests that he probably won't. Then the ambulance is attacked and taken out of the road by a van. The van driver, Jackson (Jim Boeke as James F. Boeke) defeats Paramedic and steals the patient. Ambulance driver, Harry (Charles Grueber) is not trying to stop him. Once placed in the van, the wounded man turns his attention to Harry, who seems to know. Harry asks Jackson not to hit him because he last broke his jaw. Jackson shoves Harry on the floor and throws a pack of money at him. The film then makes it absolutely clear that we are in San Fransisco by showing a shot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Sharon Raymond woke up by calling her friend Dr. John Hollins (David Allen Brooks) to inform him that his mother Amanda (Kim Hunter), who recently had a heart attack, regained consciousness. Hollins works for a company called "Geneticell Corporation" and is delighted with the news and goes to see her. Once there, he asks him to return to his old children's home in a small town called Shelter Cove and destroy all his notes and experiments, especially the "Anthony magazines" that Hollins never heard of, and also claims to have a brother. named Anthony. Back at Geneticella, Hollins Talks to Dr. Phillip Lloyd (Rod Steiger) about his mother because they both worked together before they dropped out and asks her about her research and if she knows whoever was named Anthony. He claims he knows nothing. When Amanda dies after visiting the sinister Dr. Lloyd, Hollins decides to make his request for his mother and try to find out who Anthony is. While at the funeral she pays her last respect, a woman named Melissa Leftridge (Amanda Pays) introduces herself to Hollins and says she was a great admirer of her work and research on Mother after she helped her. Since Melissa seems to know so much about her work with Mother that she invites her to the house because she could help find some answers to the various questions she has. Hollins, Sharon, Melissa and three lab assistants, Brad Baxter (Peter Frechette), Hart Phillips (Timothy Gibbs) and Cindy Russell (Julia Montgomery) and Melon Girl (!) On behalf of Nell Valentine (Bunki Z, the great name that was her parents think!?). They get to the store right away, but they find they have no interest. For some reason, nobody at this point thinks he should look into the basement, which is as good as something down there, something big, slimy and has a lot of tentacles. First he kills the duke, the dog. Then he moves to a larger prey. When Hart is attacked by something in the barn, Hollins decides to destroy all traces of his Mother's work and anything is Anthony. Together with co-author and director Stepehn Carpenter and Jeffery Obrow he also worked as a cameraman and Obrow as a producer. That's a pretty bad movie in my opinion. The screenplay is credited to five (!) The authors, Carpenter, Obrow, Earl Ghaffari, John Penny and Joseph Stefano, and the five people who work on it, would like to think they could come up with something better and more cohesive than this one. Nothing so well explained why Amanda created these monstrous sea creatures / human hybrids? What is the interest of Dr. Lloyd and his motives? Why did he steal the back of the ambulance? Why has a basement full of mutants? Why didn't any of these so-called genetic scientists think about checking the basement? Could Melissa act suspiciously, even if she tried? Why doesn't any character have any background? Why are people still referring to a substance found in sea creatures called Hemocynine when 99.9% of viewers have no idea what it is about? There is also a serious lack of blood and gore, only one person dies on the screen, only one! And all the scientists will survive in the vomiting that provokes an angry "happy end". It's horror guys, all we want to see is that slimy monsters are killing and eating people in different ways. The one on the death screen is actually pretty cool, someone has slim tentacles inserted under the skin, in the ear and in the nose in the movies just decent horror sequences. To try and remember, there's a scene where Dr. Lloyd is experimenting on an animal animal, but it takes only a few seconds, and in the context of the rest of the movie it means nothing. Melissa will also turn into a fish, don't ask. No nudity exists, which is no surprise. The film looks professionally with decent production values, but is so boring and climbs along the snail's pace, not even seeing a giant monster in the basement until fifteen minutes before the end, which is too small too far. late when it makes the look effects are fine and it makes it even more pity that it was not used more. Overall, I was very disappointed and I expected much better. A horrible movie with only one death on the screen and a total of just three, what's the world?
