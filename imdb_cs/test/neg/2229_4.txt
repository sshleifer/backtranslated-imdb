Several of my fellow writers cover this movie's fence features, so I'll keep some of the cuff notes ... <br /> <br /> 1. That's fun - but not for the reasons you think. It's cheesy, but still visible in some way. 2. Tamra, Daniel's love interest must be about thirty. The Christian girl that Dan ignores is the way she can. 3. Muriel stole a shirt from Mr. Spock. Also, if my guardian angel looks like Muriel, I'll have to ask for a transfer. 4. Well ... so obviously ... Dan is responsible for divorce! What a terrible guilt? Muriel says it was Dan's prayers held by his parents. I thought it was totally ridiculous. Listen, I can pray for my parents as much as I want, but the only way they stay together is if they decide to do it. 5. I will repeat the atheist's comments on how this film portrays non-Christians. They seem to be ubiquitous bullying. 6. For Something Positive - David White is a decent actor. The film gives a little credibility, even if it's the only one. Quite holding this movie alone.
