No blow, no blood, no satisfactory scene of death ... stupid stupid stupid stupid. Dear God, sitting through this movie me wrong. Sick ill. Very boring ... extremely boring ... <br /> <br /> This movie has no funny aspect! I can't find a good thing to say about this, except that the main man had a nice body ... I mean. Definitely not worth fifty cents I paid for rent.
