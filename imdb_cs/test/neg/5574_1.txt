this movie is so bad. But it's so bad that I laughed my ass. for people who like movies, don't look for this. for people who like good and bad movies, I recommend this one. story stories uncertain, script is severe, acting is a terrible average. the soundtrack for the whole movie was scaly, but I loved it. the cool phrases were plus tho. ha ha. "If it can bleed, it can die". the fighting scene broke me. it seemed to me as if they had spent more time on those parts than any other cuz combat scenes for the most part were quite clean. I almost feel like this movie could be good if it wasn't for f / x .... not that it was still crapshoot. what was in sight was oblique. and as the cat stomped the stomach of the boys in the kitchen, they could do something that the shed could actually eat, or at least give her more false blood on her face. and the beacon blast disappointed me. I thought they could get real fire instead of lousy computer synthesized things. and the end was so predictable, which surprised me when they actually did what I could. so overall. id to say it's classic when it comes to crappy movies go. its in my day 5.
