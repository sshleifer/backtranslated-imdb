Usually when biopic television is released on a celebrity, its, at least, campy (ie Cybill Shepherd as Martha Stewart, Lauren BaCall as Doris Duke), this is the most terrible, inexpensive, and BORING television movie ever made. If a VH-1 is going to make a TV movie, they have GOT to spend a little more money on them. Flex Alexander - although gifted by Michael's voice - is not a great dancer, he is not a bit like Michael, nor does he have his mannerisms down. VH-1 would do better by hiring a real publisher, so when we see Michael go to plastic surgery, he doesn't really look exactly the same. Why should we be taken aback by the shrinkage of Michael's nose when he is exactly the same size as the beginning of the movie? A woman playing Elizabeth Taylor can't act and doesn't look like her, nor did she want to start me as a Janet Jackson woman. A terrible scenario and a serious miscasting case must keep the VH-1 from producing more movies. Flex Alexander would have done much better JERMAINE JACKSON than Michael. Costumes? Trashy ripoffs. Neverland? Joining footage of news. Don't bother with this ... its not worth it. One good piece of casting - an actor depicting Joseph Jackson and an actress like Lisa Marie Presley, though she should be more savage than a girl.
