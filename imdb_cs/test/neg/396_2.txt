Kazuo Komiz, who did not make a decent movie, directed this "notorious" shock and should be ashamed that it was a hit on his Japanese release. Yes, it does rape, gore and split scenes, but what? She has a bad American porn movie filmed and poorly photographed by Ed Powers ("Dirty Debutantes") and is incredibly slow. He seems to have earned his notoriety on the basis of his list of anti-social acts. There is a huge difference between this and the horror that is well created. Just because someone likes their cinema a little bit wet doesn't mean they're bullshit like that. On the contrary, this kind of fan (eg, alone) tolerates even less bullshit than the average diver there because he has seen so much and has become too demanding. It's a shame the production companies don't realize that. One reviewer here (ZombieKilla81) noted that the film's "obsession with gang rape" is one of the factors he killed. I disagree. The subject is never a problem. The question is how this subject is handled. She is treated so unpredictably in ENTRAILY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN that it is boring. Personally, I like the graphical representation of psychopathic behavior (with an interesting context) if the material is well directed, freshly photographed and aesthetically pleasing. This Nikkatsu horror / pink hybrid is pathetic.
