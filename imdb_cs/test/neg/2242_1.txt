This film is not worth a downward review, I just decided not to go to another Tarantino movie. And I loved Tarantino's movies. Not artsy, not fun, not funny, not funny, nothing, just boring and stupid. If this movie was first Tarantinos, it would also be his last. Tarantino must grasp, otherwise his next film should be 3 hours of insignificant, boring and unfolding dialogue. He seems to have fallen in love with his dialogue - and his love is blind. After completing popcorn, there's no reason to sit in the theater anymore.
