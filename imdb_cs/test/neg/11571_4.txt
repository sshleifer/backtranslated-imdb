28 years before September 11th, another September 11th was the key date in the history of Chile, South America and the world. This was the date in 1973 when the bloody coup in Chile deposed Salvador Allende's first Marxist president elected democratically anywhere in the world and ended the Chilean experiment of democratic transition from capitalism to socialism. Allende committed suicide when armed forces attacked the presidential palace. Unfortunately, this film is too biased and too nostalgic to the time when Allende's rule was an objective representation of man and his place in history. Times were concerned and Allende was a controversial figure in the history of his country and around the world. It is true that he was democratically elected, but his policy has thrown Chile into an economic crisis. He was deposed by a coup and right-wing dictatorship followed by repression and flagrant violations of human rights, but he was also an ally of Castro who saw in his policies another way of making a revolution. We will never know whether his attempt to build a socialist but democratic society would succeed. The filmmakers have taken an entirely pro-Allende position, there is no opinion or opinion to try to explain the other side, to answer questions like why the middle class opposed it, or how its democratic views could go along with support or supported by Castro . The commentary tone is nostalgic and apologetic, almost propaganda. People who want a better understanding of this episode of history must wait for a more balanced and objective film or book in the future.
