Ray Bradbury, run! This cheap film version of his 1950s short story about traveling in time and influence that might have on de-evolution is not known from a theatrical run (had it one?) And now exists as a DVD on shelves released during a slow week. <br /> <br /> What seems to be a fantastic sci-fi thriller in the form of introductory scenes that will quickly fool us, because computer-generated graphics are re-launched unchanged throughout the movie, which is about to be different. tours back at a time when a major company sells macho guys in 2055 a chance to hunt dinosaurs by paying exorbitant fees to travel back in time to prehistoric jungles. One foot / butterfly slip, while on one of these businesses and evolution, it changes with the resulting time waves that roll over the planet and change everything into humans and plants. Of course there is a nice lady who knows how to reverse this process and a hungry man risk his life to act on his orders and everything is finally OK. Yes, this is the story ... and the most surprising fact about this poorly written, hopelessly messy movie is that it has attracted some fine talents to portray the comics' flat characters. Edward Burns (all buffy and hunky) is our hero du jour. great actors and should know better than with this flop. And the saddest thing is that for those who like this genre of sci-fi monster thrillers, the creative department has sold out some of the most exciting animations on the long screen. Must be missed.
