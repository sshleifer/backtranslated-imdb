Normally BBC Jane Austen's production is pretty good, but Northanger Abbey is just special. What did they think? This film has few Austen's spells and ironically mimics the gothic novels Austen so taunted. Not only that, "gothic" sequences are cheap, over-the-top, and frankly stupid. Miss Morland's actress is poorly cast without obvious appeal to attract the attention of a qualified bachelor, and although I liked the scary Peter Firth as Mr. Tilney, it's not a bit like the novel, even in a direct interview. books. Robert Hardy as General Tilney turned in one of his several "scary" performances. This movie was so bizarre and weird that I watched it again, just to enjoy how terribly bad it was.
