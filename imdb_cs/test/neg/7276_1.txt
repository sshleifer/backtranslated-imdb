I have never really been interested in cannibal movies before and only a few months ago I have avoided this genre of film. Recently, I had to undergo knee surgery and found that I had a lot of time on my hands because I was unable to work, so I decided after our almost every horror movie, our local video store he had to offer me a chance. Christ was a mistake! I have never seen a film so bad in all my years when I was addicted to film. This is just a heap with ** t inserted on a DVD and sold as a horror movie. <br /> <br /> I have a lot of respect for other horror fans who can switch their brains for as long as they can enjoy this crap, they are more dead brain than I ever will and that's some success! 0/10 and it is generous.
