Flesh Feast starts at Miami Airport, actor reporter Dan Carter (Harry Kerwin, he is also credited as a production designer) calls his friend Ed Casey (Phil Philbin) to tell him that he has just returned from South America, where he investigated Carl. Schuman (Doug Foster) & that he was on a big story, but when he was still talking on the phone, he was stabbed in the back and killed. Schuman Meets Dr. Elaine Frederick (Veronica Lake, who is also a manager), recently released from a psychiatric hospital, is discussing her grisly plans together. Casey's reports of his death and he decides to do the story himself and conduct some investigations, but in fact gets his secretary Viginia Day (Marth Mischon) to do most of his investigative and reporting reports. Virginia informs Casey that she has someone on the inside named Kristine (Heather Hughes) because Dr. Frederick leases his replacement nurse rooms, Kristine reports to Casey about the grotesque attempts of young people to restore Schuman & Dr. Frederick with human bodies and specially grown worms. ... <br /> <br /> What he wrote, co-produced and directed by Brad F. Grinter Flesh Feast is a pretty bad movie on all accounts. First we start with the script Grinter & Thomas Casey, who was also responsible for cinematography (you feel that most of the cast and crew had more than one job), basically it's terrible. The character is one dimensional idiots and has no personality, I didn't like anyone in this movie. For what it is worth I like some of the ideas here, meat-eating maggots, basement lab, stealing the body from the hospital and this unforgettable 'twist' end that is almost worth sitting over the rest of the movie for on your own. Unfortunately, the dialogue is so badly written, stiff and unnaturally sounding that it is untrue, I think there is one scene in which the nurse says they will "leave us out of the house", which is fine except for the fact that she speaks. EXTERIOR in the garden to someone. No thought has been put into the story because no explanation is ever given for why the chicks that feed on the body are able to restore youth, in fact, at one point near the end when asked about this matter. Frederick says there is no time to explain at the point that seems like people who wrote it, they had no idea! Even in extremely short 68 minutes Flesh Feast is very slow and boring, bad adjustments do not help with scenes and shots that take too long, for example there is a scene in which the ambulance rises outside the hospital, drives to the door, the guy comes out, they go to the back door and open it, etc. Did we really need to see every single detail? There is also another sequence in which Dr. Frederick enters the room & puts some gloves on, then takes them from walking to the opposite room & puts another pair on! Personally, I think that Grinter probably did not shoot enough material, so he will load every scene as much as he can to run time. I like the bizarre ending, really. Technically, Flesh's holiday is complete crap, I'm not sure what that budget was, but had to be small, very small. Almost the entire film takes place in one house, the Dr. Lab. Frederick consists of a table, some plastic beakers and test tubes, some ancient electronic medical devices and a strange screen with funny colors (don't ask). Cinematography is poor, music sucks, and the whole movie looks dubbed, badly dubbed too. The exploitative elements are also disappointing, there are a few shots of worms, but in reality they do nothing but twist, there is a short scene where the dead body has a leg cut off. on hooks. Behavior is terrible from everyone involved, and I think really bad, which makes the rubbihy dialogue worse. Do yourself a favor and avoid Flesh Feast, yes, there are one or two unintentionally funny moments and the end is, unique, at the very least, but for the most part it's a real amateur movie that quickly becomes painful. I doubt that most people can do it, it's one session, I can tolerate anything, but I was thinking of turning it off. Certainly one avoided, you will be pleased that you & if you really have to see it don't say you weren't warned!
