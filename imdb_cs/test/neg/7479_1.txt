It seems to be a strange controller. I heard him commenting on "losing control of the show" and telling another guest who brought live animals that he had one rule - "no snakes". He needs to hire a comedy writer because his jokes are lame. The only reason I watch him is that he has some great guests and bands. I watched Craig Ferguson for a while, but his show is worse. He likes the bull sh ** to burn time.I don't think one man has much of the future on late night talk shows. He also has an annoying habit of keeping his tongue out licking his lips every day. It has to do at least ten times the show. I love Joe Firstman. Carson Daily must lighten up before it's too late.
