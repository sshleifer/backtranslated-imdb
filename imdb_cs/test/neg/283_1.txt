Unfortunately, I think it's one of those movies that, if you took it to the studio and said, "Can I make a great movie with my friends at Mary, Mungo and Midge?" However, if a bunch of massive Hollywood names say, "Look, I have a taste for Italy with my friends, how is it with that?" We'll head out with the casino chief out of the 11 oceans watching the bandits who went out with his money, and then Brad Pitt throws down Catherine Zeta Jones and then there's a couple of monkeys around in Amsterdam and Italy, then it all ends. The film, however, includes the stupidest moment of Julie Roberts' career and Bruce Willis, a movie gem. I almost vomited in my lap and pulled my eyes out when Julia Roberts, who played Tess in the movie, pretends to be (you guessed it) Julia Roberts! Bruce Willis stands by clearly wondering when he can leave and how much will be a check. Oh well, to be fair, I did it for cash, so I suppose I can't really criticize poor love, but I'm penniless freedom is not Hollywood legend. I think that what really annoys me is not that it's boring and pointless and has a terrible story, but I think the actors probably all had a good time! I think the whole role of the actor is to project outward emotions ... I feel like I paid for going to a party, but I had to go out in the rain. Booo! Watch if you like Como or fancy CZJ or something, but go for a walk.
