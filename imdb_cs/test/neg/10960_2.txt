I am neither a director nor a writer, nor anything related to film. But watching over 1 movie every day gave me an idea of ​​what a good movie is or not. So here it is: Fast and undead is a rip-off from Fast and Dead. I thought it might be a little parody of a great movie with lots of starts in it. But oh no, I was really in for a very big disappointment. <br /> <br /> To make it easy the movie sucks. I'm a big fan of gore movies, but this only gives you this one here and there, but it's not that consistent. But I have to give them credit to create horrible characters that have given me a little curl. <br /> <br /> If you're a big zombie fan, watch it. If you're not ... you better look at other zombie robots.
