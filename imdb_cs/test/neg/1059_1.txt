This film shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we're all idiots. If not, how should we understand it: <br /> <br /> American pilots take off on Mig-29. Suddenly all the aircraft turn to F-16. Ha, magic! After the action ... Migs land. Magic again! Oh, I mentioned that the F-16s had Israeli denominations? Another charm: apparently unarmed L-39 coaches bomb enemies. And another spell: while all the movies are in Europe, we can see the desert in almost every flight scene. Maybe the director has wasted his magic on things because the action scenes are incredibly chaotic and the explosions look terrible as if the pilots bombed molotovs. OK, OK, this is a movie. I should write about his story ... wait. Story? Yes, there is a SOME story in this movie. And also terrible.
