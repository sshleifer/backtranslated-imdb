If you see this movie on TV, just ignore it. If you're looking for something scary, you'll be better off tracking the repetition of X files. It's almost unnoticeable. The total sum of its range includes 'whiny and fear' and 'whiny and not fear'. I'm the kind of movie that has a good 'bad' movie. But that's ridiculous. There is no direction. The storyline is as simple as a set of numbers throwing at you, and like this set of numbers, it finally makes no sense. <br /> <br /> Your time will be better spent turning your TV and giving your dog a bath.
