This is what Disney Channel shows to kids who are more stupid than posts. They fit well. It's not funny, acting is the worst I've seen in many years, there are more stereotypes than the actors, and all about this show will make you angry and turn your eyes. You want to know why? Not only is it a waste of time, the main actress Selena Gomez looks like a pig. Jake T. Austin's character needs some Ritalin. David Henri's character must visit a strip club and be wasted. Also, the show's writer is inconsistent. In one episode, a security guard is called "Sir" by one character and referred to as a woman by all others. <br /> <br /> Hello? It's called proofreading and editing. Do it sometime, Disney. Did anyone see a promo for the new "four-piece sled"? Disney wanted their own version of Twilight vs. Harry Potter thing. Up to a million times lamer. The Wizards of Waverly Place Movie ??? Think about that minute. The family goes away on vacation and a 16 year old daughter wants independence from her parents. SAME PLOT from Proud Family Movie etc <br /> <br /> What's worse is all Emmy and ALMA. And most viewers are 4-13 years old (and lifeless teenagers). how many more years? Before Selena Gomez Shows Her Breasts? <br /> <br /> And Disney shows are all crap .. hack writers .. hack shows..destroying minds and purses today's youth ..
