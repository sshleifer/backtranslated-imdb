the photo is good, the costumes are good but the cut is bad. Different scenes are cut out or stopped in bad times and conversations are s-l-o-w and boring. This slowness continues throughout the show. It's a very tedious show that looks. . . . I believe that more scenes should have been added, but that would make it a longer show. It's very slow. Writers should do this just a 1-night show, and not extend our agony night after night. There is nothing else to do, otherwise I would change the channel (first night). I feel bad for the Indians of that time, and I'm angry with the whites they did to the Indians, but that's our history.
