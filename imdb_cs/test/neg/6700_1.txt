Badland is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Most of the time it's okay and I can continue with my life, but I feel the need to warn others in this case. As a war veteran in Iraq, I think it must be said that the story, storyline, acting, and depiction of what soldiers are going through after returning home was a clean garbage. It was as if the director / writer / anyone committed himself to anything clich√© about returning soldiers and ran with him and ran with him and ran with him. The "Marine" uniform seemed to be fresh from a redundant store and was a model that had not been used since the first Iraq war. I'm not going to go on forever, this is a horrible movie. If you are interested in the stories of returning soldiers, there is a much better alternative. I recommend going to the local library.
