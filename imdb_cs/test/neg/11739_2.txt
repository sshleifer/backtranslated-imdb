A remake of a successful film can be a complex matter at best; To remake a true classic, especially one that is truly the ultimate film of a director like Alfred Hitchcock, is something else. And after watching this version of "Psycho" directed by Gus Van Sant, two things immediately come to mind: What is it about and what they thought about Earth? Especially in light of the fact that Van Sant used the same script (Joseph Stefano, taken from Robert Bloch's novel), which Hitchcock used. The end result here underscores some of the finest features of filmmaking: First, the 'remake' should be just that; reformatting the original rather than a "copy" using new players; and secondly, that shooting in color, using more blood and a little more graphics, is only a little more than it would reflect on the impact of the film. Although this was a noble effort by Van Sant, ironically at the end it suffers from the same mistake with which Norma Bates was affected: the "mind" of the film was split; half was Hitchcock, half Van Sant. Twain, though he met, will never be bound. Van Sant, while working from the original script, would rather make his own film - all the way - instead of trying to copy exactly what Hitchcock did with certain scenes. For example, the opening film of the film, especially the "shower" scene, is probably one of the most famous scenes in the history of cinema. Copying Hitchcock, from shots directly into the shower head to the drain, and using the same `skree! skree! skree! sound effects - even as a tribute to Hitchcock - again, just distracted from the story. And if you're a factor in the performance of William H. Macy (like Private Eye Arbogast), you still have another split in the movie's psyche. Macy is an amazing actor - one of the best actors in the industry - and his performance is excellent; but as good as it is, attitude and delivery are clear of David Mamet (with whom he has worked many times), and seemingly out of context with what Van Sant does. The film ends with a triple personality disorder: Hitchcock, Van Sant and Mamet. I felt like I was looking at "House of Good Will Psycho Games". In terms of performance, Macy is as solid as they are, and Anne Heche (Marion Crane) did a good job of creating an original character that escaped the trap of attempting to emulate Janet Leigh. Weak lines were Viggo Mortensen (Sam) who made Marion's friend so emerald and unnatural that you wondered why he had something to do with him; and Vince Vaughn, who - just as kindly as possible - was just as horrible as Norman Bates. His entire performance was acting (and not very convincing); influencing effeminate mannerism and his intermittent speech with "spontaneous" flashes of manic laughter made his Norman more caricature than character, incredible and arrogant. It gave the film a sense of reenactment of "true incident" you would see in a television show; it would be perfectly in line with the film's feelings to break away from Norman, who sat alone in his drawing room, to the sober Peter Graves, intoning: "That was Norman Bates' mind on this fatal, rainy night when Marion Crane stepped out of her cars and into their lives - 'Support is Julianne Moore (Lila), Robert Forster (Dr. Simon), Philip Baker Hall (Sheriff Al Chambers), Anne Haney (Mrs. Chambers)), Chad Everett (Tom Cassidy), Rance Howard ( Mr. Lowery), Rita Wilson (Caroline), James Remar (Patrolman) and James LeGros (Charlie the Car Dealer). If nothing else, Van Sant's "Psycho" is a curiosity that shows that having a good director, mostly an excellent cast and a scenario that is a proven commodity, does not necessarily ensure success. It is true that today's psycho-babble era, "American Psycho" and Hannibal Lecter, has effectively taken the edge, such as Norman Bates; however, in this particular story of the relationship between Norman, his mother and his victims, there is still a unique intimacy that will forever remain intrusive and frightening; but Van Sant is unable to convey the horror feeling, the fear of his neck, with this film. If there was a movie that should be dedicated directly to the video, it is. Even better if she was never born. I rate this 2/10
