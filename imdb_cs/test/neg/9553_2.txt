Boston Blackie movies have some strengths - mostly in that the stimulation is fast and the hero is cheerfully inexplicable even in the worst circumstances. However, drawing is often cruel and relentless comic bits often kill stimulation (if the plot is atypically good) or are simply rude and inappropriate. This includes Blackie's asylum-hunting refugee (Steve Cochran in a very poor performance) who has become fixed on the beautiful Nina Foch (who gives a nice, somewhat gentle act). Farraday inspectors, of course, believe that Blackie has left the murderous maniac (he has at least some evidence in this one for it), and is incompetently trying to imprison him as Blackie goes after the real killer. The storyline has options, but whenever there is some real tension, we get a funny comedy routine. Someone from Columbia does not seem to realize that in the film about the pursuit of a truly dangerous maniac, a cute comedy scene about how to hide an uncomfortable body from an inspector, they disrupt any willing rejection of infidelity. (The only one that ends is that our clever hero is an idiot - deadly for such a movie.) <br /> <br /> It's not worth the time. For a well-drawn episode of this series, see Alias ​​Boston Blackie.
