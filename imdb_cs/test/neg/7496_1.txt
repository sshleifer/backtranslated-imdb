I was ready for the Crouching Tiger movie and all I got was the worst movie I've ever seen in years. It was almost as bad as Baron Von Munchhuasen. Dead script. Dead meeting. Dead everything. I have granted that there were some good combat scenes, but the positive side ends there. If this movie comes to your house run screming to your phone and dial 911 and say, "Please help there is a movie in my house like to make people commit suicide"
