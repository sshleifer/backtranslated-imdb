This is one of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. I can't believe who wrote the above review was serious. Maybe he was connected to it. There's nothing on it. There is no tension, acting is terrible, hopeless. Musical score (?) Is three trite sheet music played ad nauseam. Writing (?) He had to write all five minutes. Dialogue is what a 10-year-old would come to if he was asked to do a home project. The only (slightly) healing feature is a psycho actor who grimaces, shakes and glitters magnificently, and is sometimes entertaining. The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you suffered from a weak bladder. Don't waste your time.
