Well, you know ... Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick are really good actors. But WTF with this movie? The story was lame and the script was just terrible. Poor actors did not have material to work with! <br /> <br /> The DVD package has invited you to a flight event. Would you expect something like a Top Gun ... Huge disappointment! The flight action in this movie is so cheap that it spoils you. The air scenes are clearly taken from documentaries and some other footage sources that were not created for this film. And they were not interested in the brands or the models of the fighters, of course, the viewers would not notice. As I said, the story was lame. With a little effort from the writer and the director, it could have been very interesting. In short, it seems to be a film B made in the 1970s. I'm very sorry for the actors who gave their names here. She must be ashamed.
