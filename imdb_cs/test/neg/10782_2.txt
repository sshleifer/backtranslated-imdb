In the event that you have never read readers, this film was the main inspiration for last year's Samuel L. Jackson-Eugene Levy clunker The Man. This 80s-crushed buddy action-comedy pairs short 'n stubble Billy Crystal and late Ethiopian Shim-Shammer Gregory Hines together as some funny Chi-city cops who don't play by the rules. This is largely the extent of the film. Interest is somewhat supreme by Hines' liner, which is terribly similar to Will Smith and portraits of more famous actors like Memento Joe Pantoliano and "NYPD Blue's" Jimmy Smits. My favorite scene is, I don't know, car chase on tracks, I think. Basically, I just saw this film as a major helping hand in the demolition of the action swing. Well, this and the deadly weapon 4 ... and the Rush Hour 2 ... and the Man ...
