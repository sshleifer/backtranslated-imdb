I always wanted to see the movie because I loved the novel, but I was warned because I heard the movie was smelly. It is. Fowles wrote the script and I could watch it well, despite the fact that I read the novel over thirty years ago. <br /> <br /> The audio track is executable. in mystery or mood in the movie. I think the director must take a lot of blame because even Michael Caine is terrible about it, and he did a great job at ALFIE a few years ago. <br /> <br /> The "secret" -shared book is not well translated on the screen. I'd like to see someone remake it.
