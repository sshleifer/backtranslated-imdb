Oh boy, it was really bad. <br /> <br /> I saw it on videotape. <br /> <br /> It was hard to hear dialogue in the scenes that had a soundtrack. When people were on the phone, it was hard to hear the person at the other end. At least two different kinds of movies or video recordings seemed to be used because the colors and focus had shifted drastically between adjustments. And there were a lot of focused shots that didn't seem deliberate. <br /> <br /> One of the budget indicators (one of many) was when the news appeared on TV. There is only a "news flash" title card poorly superimposed with video effect on the TV screen, and voice-over announcer. They couldn't shoot shots from the announcer, and then actually show it on TV? The film begins with a killer wearing surgical scrubs and masks, controlling a scalpel. It is probably a paranoid schizophrenic who escapes from the hospital to prevent the lobotomy that is being performed on him. <br /> <br /> Students are on a break at school and three young women opt for a party. Three boys decide to break a party and a geek named Science decides it crashes too. The party is quite boring and the guys are just accidentally wearing masks, removing masks and then disappearing. Mother and father (a surgeon who was supposed to do a lobotomy) of one of the girls are still appearing. The killer kills people's throats without being noticed. Apparent film run more or less sleep over the film. Maybe it was a bad deal, or maybe it was deliberate, because much of the movie is a nightmare, and some it a nightmare in a nightmare. The end is really horrible too. The best thing about the movie is the United Home Video VHS box art box that has been animated for the DVD release (double feature with Terror on Tenkiller). I honestly can't say whether it's a photo or a picture or a combination of both. The women in the picture are not in the film and the clothes they wear are much more revealing than anything women in the film wore. Cutting the throat on the cover is more frightening than those in the movie - where people tend to affect a goofy pop-eyed look. This is what the killer has most of the time: the head tilted and the eyes peeping out, sinking the camera. The scalpel was often focused near the camera in focus, while the face of the mask covered by the killer was close, but in the background it was in focus.
