SPOILERS AGAINST: <br /> <br /> Not good. The film was completely different from the book (Not that the book was a classic, but it was really good.) <br /> <br /> I think Demi Moore was fine. Actually, I really don't remember her performance in one way or another. However, great disappointment was not with Mrs. Moore. Why did he who rewrote himself decide to make a millionaire's heart suddenly? (I'm talking about him as "millionaires" because he had a different name in the film than the book version - just another change.) <br /> <br /> People who didn't read the book seem to have won I don't know anything but in the BOOK version, this person is much more ruthless and more complex. It's also fascinating. The fact that there has been such a big change in the film is changing the whole story. It was almost like seeing a completely different film. <br /> <br /> I know LOVE movies are very different from books. But I also thought Redford's character was a bit cruel. This ISN'T Redford bug (He is a great actor and could play ruthlessly well), but without these qualities becomes just another brilliant man in love, so the story becomes just another clich√© of a love story that includes 1 woman and 2 men. This was not essentially the aim of the book. That could have been a lot better. Even if I didn't read the book version, I wouldn't like it very much, but it will definitely take a few points down for me to change around.
