The most enjoyable part of this film were clips from the original film. The behavior was wrong, and the assumption of sexual scorecards was rebellious. The effects were marginal at best. There have been no excelled performances, Amy Irving has been put into this movie to try and get part of the Halloween H20 audience. The original was much more enjoyable and pleasing. I'm sorry it's not going to be one of the top 10 years ... he's at the end of my list yet. Don't bother with this one person!
