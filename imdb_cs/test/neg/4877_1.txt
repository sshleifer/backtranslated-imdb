Where should I start. First, list the good things about this movie. 1. Mikael Persbrandt is great as Gangster Thomas. That's the only character you care about, and he's a bad guy! (Allhhogh has never done anything wrong, and is generally quite a nice guy) 2. Kjell Bergkvist is always great. Here's a little bit stiff, but it's pretty funny. 3. The film looked pretty good by Swedish standards, using depth of field and light well. Now it's bad. This is by far the worst case scenario to get into the big screen at all. The actions of all others were bad enough and upstairs. The direction was terrible. Absolutely absurd story, totally unrealistic characters and events and 1.5 hours long. Almost everyone in the theater laughed during the emotional scenes. People went out during the projection. There's no way to really put the story into something coherent, so I didn't even try it. Every clich√© ever created is there and in all the wrong places. I'm sorry it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my whole life. <br /> <br /> Watch it for a good laugh, but don't pay any money for it;) <br /> <br /> .R
