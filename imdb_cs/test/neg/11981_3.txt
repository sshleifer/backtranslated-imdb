I was actually quite surprised to find that a film based on Far Cry was created. The story here is not something I consider a strong point in space in the game. No worries, though, as in a typical Boll fashion story in the movie has very little to do with the game it is based on. Now I understand that certain freedoms need to be taken in order to convert from one form of media to another, but it does not really just try to create a connection. Not only that, but the acting and action sequences are so sloping that it almost makes the whole project feel like one big joke. It has been said a million times before, but why couldn't anyone more talented pick up the video game rights to create a movie ????
