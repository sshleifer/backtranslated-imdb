this is the second time I have been moved enough to write a review. Unfortunately, both times were for movies that can be described with a few 4 letters that can be defined as feces or feces. another movie of such caliber was masked and anonymous. anywa, for review .. there are a few key things wrong with this movie that i will describe below. 1) Steven lost the plot (ie, in all his other films, family / friend kills. Steven angry. steven kills people. end). 2) Steve lost money (there was a good start-up scene, but I think he threw his budget on it and couldn't afford a decent scriptwriter or editor. <br /> <br /> 3 ) steven no longer seems to do it alone. instead, (out of memory) 2 combat scenes were shot by the neck down and from the back so you couldn't see his face. most likely double. I think chuck norris. <br /> <br /> In summary .. the worst sea movie ever. The second worst movie I've seen in recent history, and I've seen a lot of bad movies.
