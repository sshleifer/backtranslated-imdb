and generally speaking, you will have to explore this little gem. When I describe I Changed My Sex, or Glen or Glenda, as is better known, I have to repeat Andrew Smith's thoughts, which hit the nail on his head when he wrote: "If you haven't seen any more Ed Wood movies this is a totally stunning experience if you've seen some of Ed's movies, it's still absolutely stunning. The film is both hilarious and tragic, but it moves with its own strange rhythm that leaves no doubt that its author knows and means every word he says during his length. Wood, bless, had some of the noblest ambitions as a director who wanted to promote peace, understanding and even acceptance in the 1950s. When Tim Burton created viewing Glen or Glenda by studying execs for his biopic, he showed execs laughing and telling each other that this was to be put-on. More than fifty years later, there are still people who fight just to be given such a respect that "normal" is commonplace, so it certainly isn't. No, the real Glen Or Glenda comedy is the utter disrespect that Wood portrays in composing his report. Directors often use footage when they find one that suits their purpose and can be customized to fit on their own record. Ed Wood used stock footage without distinction, and biopic Tim Burton celebrated the fact with a scene in which Wood as played by Johnny Depp bet he could do the whole movie out of stock footage. Sad that real Ed Wood had died before he had a chance, but Glen or Glenda is the closest he ever came to. IMDb states that twenty percent of this sixty-minute film is footage footage and it's never hard to guess which footage. Shots of busy roads, overhead aircraft, bad lightning effects, soldiers doing their thing are all used randomly, sometimes repeatedly, and often only have a loose connection with the story Wood is trying to say. If the wood was able to sit and think about what it was trying to do for a while, it didn't say what he could reach. Wood appears in the film as a titular character, a confused transvestite who imagines himself as a woman named Glenda. In addition to the courageous way in which he tries to express his opinion, Wood makes one nasty woman. When I was on the edge of a society that thinks I am "disabled" and I have to be "cured" myself, I sincerely found myself hoping for the best result for the character of Wood. However, in order to express his opinion, the wood is woven in the stories of two other transvestites. One of them will make an extreme step that will endure sexual change to become a woman, the other find himself so firmly convinced that he is afraid of being arrested again by committing suicide. The scary thing about this movie is that if you cut out transvestism and replace such disenfranchisements as my position on the autistic spectrum or things like schizophrenia, very little film would have to be changed. This is how a small company learned because Ed Wood was a boy. Another prominent person at Glen Or Glenda is Bela Lugosi, who Wood crouched into the movie. Speculation differs according to Wood's motives, but the accepted theory is that Wood wanted to help revive Lugosi's career, and would do something to achieve this. With the exception of your time, carefully compose a good movie, that is. In Glen or Glenda, the wood used by Lugosi was best described in Flying Saucers Over Hollywood as "bizarre". Lugosi plays a character charged as a Scientist, but comes rather as an all-powerful puppet master. People who have not seen Ed Wood movies before biopic will think that Tim Burton formed "watch out for a big green dragon who sits on the doorstep" speech. If anything, Burton was restrained by the bizarre speech that is used in displaying Wood-Iian's dialogue. Nothing can prepare you to see the manifestations in their original context, nor Criswell's cheerful cry during Plan 9 from space. Observers also notice the presence of Delores Fuller, Wood's girlfriend. Burton once again dramatizes his response to the first time he sees the script, while the film captures it as acceptance and thoughtful thinking. I can't help but feel that Burton's image is more accurate because Fuller looks very uncomfortable in his role. It only appears for about fifteen minutes, but her childbirth seems so mechanical, so lifeless that in some way she can seem less talented than her friends, if that is the case. Whether Wood's direction in this case is better focused than usual is difficult to determine, but if the ability to support casting to leave the stars (with the obvious exception of Bela) in the dust is a guide, then it should come as no. a surprise that Fuller would only appear in a very small role in one other Wood movie. That she went on to write a series of hit songs tells you she made the right decision to stay behind the camera. While Wood reappeared in front of the camera, it was never more than portraits, walks or bits. I gave Glen or Glenda one of ten. In general, I only give this rating to films that are so bad that they become fun. Brave and well-intentioned, as it was, Glen Or Glenda throws this description to T.
