It wasn't a very good movie, acting largely stunk and the effects were mostly bad. But there were some funny moments, but most of them weren't funny. The most successful part of the movie for me was that part of a little kid in a wheelchair (that's not a funny part What kind of person do you think I am) anyway, a boy falls out and shouts at his big brother, well Brother comes and the kid is running, he's so funny that it's all stumbling and I really had to rewind several times to play so I could laugh. So if your looking for something to rent, but just don't seem to find anything to check this one and watch the running part.
