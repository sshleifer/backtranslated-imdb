I have not deliberately read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before watching it because I really wanted to see it and create my own mind. In the past, I was a big QT fan, I think we all agree to make some great movies, but lately it seems to have been overcome by mysticism and disappeared in its foundation. This "movie" proves it. It consists of a few scenes of Basterds at work. Rather, it consists of long, boring, boring sections of conversation between people that you will realize after a while that you just won't give it. It is long-haired and lacks any great sparkling dialogue for which QT has been responsible in the past. The whole movie is anticlimactic. There is no tension - what happens in every scene is wired so clearly that when you do, don't worry. Honestly, people, don't believe the hype. It's a very boring movie, and if you don't see it, you won't miss anything.
