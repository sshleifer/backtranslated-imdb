When I first saw this show, it was OK. There were some funny moments and I laughed several times, but the show is getting worse and worse. Carly and Sam's web show IS NOT the least funny. They play silly video from the internet, scream at the camera and make very bad jokes. And then the laughter track disappears?! One problem with the show is that none of the main characters is funny. Carly's not funny. Miranda Cosgrove's play is indispensable at best. Her acting in this show is nothing like her actress from Drake And Josh. Her friend Sam is very rough and rude and the show is written in a way that makes her some kind of villagers. I mean, they're making jokes about her mom who drove a rusty old car, her mom smashing old television with a bat, and then there are jokes about Sam who failed at school, all the time of detention and running from cops. None of this is funny. Then there's Freddy, who's a computer geek. Not very funny if his mom doesn't recognize him as a child. The show is just a somewhat funny full-time character's Carly's brother Spencer. He's doing some funny jokes and doing some pretty funny things like pretending to drive a spaceship while making rocket ship sounds, stumbling on a girl scout table for revenge when they do the same. His material is the only thing he laughs at. Apart from the characters of other things to do bad too. Like the fact that a couple of kids who are doing a local web show from a Seattle apartment are a worldwide hit and got them free to Tokyo? Another thing is, how can a 26-year-old single guy with no real work pay for a two-level apartment in downtown Seattle and raise his 13-year-old sister and pay for a room full of camera and audio equipment including a remote projector and a green screen and HD camera? It sounds like it was written for 10 years. The worst part is that the show contains some content. There are several times when Carly (remember 13 year old girl) appears on her internet web show in a bikini top. WTF? Then I saw an episode where Freddy tells Carly and Sam that "he slept in JUST his socks in the evening." I mean WTF? Then there is an episode where Carly's rival Nevel blackmails her by taking her web rights and agrees to put her website back in exchange for a kiss. Ghostly! And I just saw an episode where Carly meets a boy who just moved to his apartment house and has some wound in his back and takes off his shirt and Carly stands over him. I can't believe Nick let them show that this is something like that, and I can't believe this was the same person responsible for Drake and Josh. This show is not suitable for children under 12 and it is even questionable. iCarly is just another addition to a long list of scary Nick's programs.
