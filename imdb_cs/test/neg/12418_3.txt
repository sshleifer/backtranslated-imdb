If you choose to watch Wild Rebels, don't expect anything deep and meaningful. If you're looking for a movie that explores the relationship and structure of a motorcycle gang, Wild Rebels is a bad movie. If you are looking for an exhibit about the collapse of the US education system and the problem of juvenile delinquency, Wild Rebels is a bad movie. If you are looking for a film that explores how the police in the countryside are exposed to a well-funded, well-organized group, Wild Rebels is a bad movie. But if you are looking for an absurd movie full of scenes of unintentional humor, terrible acting, paper conspiracy, and community theater production values, Wild Rebels is the right movie. Wild Insurgents is the story of a driving car called Rod Tillman (Steve Alaimo). After a fiery fall (which Rod leaves from the unharmed, even though he has only cotton trousers and a London-style jacket for protection), Rod decides to give up. With no plan for his future to wander aimlessly on the back roads of the south, he came across a motorcycle gang of Satan Angels (a gang that is the threesome of the dullest boys ever denying a leather jacket and a woman who seem to be involved). This group of hoodlums spends their time terrorizing a rural Florida city by committing such atrocities to steal a neighborhood mailbox newspaper. These whipping idiots need someone to act as a driver during some of the larger crimes they planned. It seems that these three Einsteins can only drive vehicles with two tires, not four. So they recruit Rod to perform courage performances that only an experienced stunt stunt would be able to as a car keep in the middle of a gravel road during low speed pursuit. Eventually, they hold-up the bank, get into the aforementioned low-speed pursuit, and have the lamest gun battle with the police ever put on the film. I could go forever, but imagine the idea. I hate the term "so bad it's good", but Wild Rebels seems to describe it aptly.
