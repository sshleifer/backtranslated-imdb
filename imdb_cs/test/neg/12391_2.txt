It seems at least vaguely possible that this film provided some inspiration for "The Sopranos", as its main character, Martin Blank (John Cusack) is a hitman who has so many questions about his past and his profession that he is in therapy. tries to deal with it. Everything finally comes to his head at his ten-year high school meeting. The problem was that when Blank came to reunion, I stopped worrying. Frankly, I found this movie by dragging it from start to finish. <br /> <br /> He had the potential. There was a reasonably good cast, headed by Cusack and Dan Aykroyd, to play Grocer, his arch-rival in the hit-man business, along with Minnie Driver as Debi, Blank's High School Sweetheart, who stood up at night, and limited role for Alan Arkin as Dr. Oatman, Blank's psychologist. It seems that quite a talented cast really failed. The drama lacked intensity and the comedy lacked real humor. What I thought had the greatest potential to be a comedy story was Grocer's proposal for the extinction of a man, but besides becoming a bit of a running joke, the idea never developed. As for romance, one wondered why Debi would even think she'd let the guy go back to her life. There was a handful of laughter, but nothing actually caught me and held me. The movie wondered if this thing was ever going to click. At least he didn't - not for me. 2/10
