The original WASC is by no means necessary to see the film in the genre. In fact, if it weren't for the first five minutes, it would be logical if it could be tracked. The remake takes those 25 minutes and turns them into an average 85 minute teen horror flick. Now I have nothing against PG-13 Horror movies, but the tendency around them becomes limp. When you see the PG-13 rating, you expect a movie full of fake horror, teen t.v. or music stars and conspiracies that have been used several times. Do not ask for gore or violence. <br /> <br /> I know it's not right to compare the original WASC and remake, but I think it's necessary because the whole new idea is based on the beginning of the original. The tension that is felt through the first film is not present in the remake by any means. Neither with amazing settings or great flash usage. No tension, no tension, no excitement ... nothing. The movie goes too slowly before it gets a little "interesting" and that is when a stranger appears. Chasing sequence is probably the best part of the movie because at least there is a feeling of "what happens next?". But that's it. The situations that have occurred for the climax are predictable, boring and lack of tension. The original is credited with having tension in the most important scenes, as well as a cool top for the most important scene in the movie. <br /> <br /> Now I understand it's a PG-13 Horror, but if you pay respect for the original. Why change the most important situation? Children should not survive! When I finished, I felt that this film was useless. So the guard played a cat and a mouse with a wacko ... that's it? Then the hospital sequence was stupid. And the worst of all is that the sequel can be on the way. Camila Belle is the best thing about the movie. Brings cute, believable performance. She needs to choose better projects, even if she gets that role for her thousands of teenage fans. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. Some people say that in order to support the Horror genre we should support any movie that comes out. I don't have to agree. If we ignore movies like WASC, then horror movie producers will understand that we won't accept CRAP. We want good horror movies, not lame fills filled with false fears. <br /> <br /> Watch the original "When it's a strange call" instead, because it's the first 25 minutes, it's BETTER than the whole (useless) remake.
