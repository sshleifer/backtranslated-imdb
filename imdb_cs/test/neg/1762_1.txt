This movie really has nothing to do with it. With Reverend, played by Phillip Seymour Hoffman, he complained about his constipation and other toilet humor in a 2.5 hour movie, you know they didn't make any cuts and left the crap literally. It's a loss of good talent and total embarrassment. Terrible! <br /> <br />
