When I saw Alien a few years ago Predator, I have to say, it's as stupid as the sequel, it was somewhat pleasant. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of good movies in the theater lately, so my friend and I decided to go further and find out what the AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is about. We saw it a few days ago and I must say that there was nothing exciting about this horror sequel. From the first AVP movie it took a whole different way, it's not a bad idea that they married Alien and Predator and put them in suburban classes, but from the idea of ​​the first explaining their reasons for existence it was just an average and predictable horror sequel. Not to mention the story that introduces new characters in every scene, where I wasn't sure who meant who's the main character and why, so I couldn't keep up with the story. Of course, from what I picked up, the Predator and the Stranger were in space, they had to deal with the typical neighbors of neighboring countries, just beat the lights and decide why not? Go ahead and take him to some Earthlings. So they fall and Alien takes over the suburbia utopia. But teenagers, including a troubled couple who look like Ken and Barbie, a female sailor and her daughters, make sure they kick some space butt, if the predator doesn't get there first. Since it is checked on Alien, I think for starting a party without him, lol, just kidding, actually for killing some of his friends. AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Requiem is not the worst movie of any standards, it's still pretty cool with a lot of visual effects and the fighting sequences between Alien and Predator are so great to watch. Like Alien's first sequel to Predator is a cast of things that will ruin a movie and seem not to be well developed, I know it's horrible, but the original Alien and Predator movies had characters you care about and wanted. win. But it was a semi-decent sequel that I would say worth a look at some fun, especially for Ken and Barbie sake. <br/> <br/> 4/10
