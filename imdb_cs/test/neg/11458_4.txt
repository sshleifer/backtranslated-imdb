I'm glad it was the last of the Universal Mummy films in the 1940s. The films were all different in quality, and this movie was definitely one of the smaller ones. The problem is that it is a very slow moving movie in which virtually nothing interesting or exciting is happening at all. Perhaps it would be better if my mother entered the film earlier. Instead, the film has once again spent the first 20 minutes explaining what happened in previous mummy films, again using archival footage of this time "The Mummy" since 1932, on which this film is the fourth mummy of the story of the mummy of 1932. The film simply never knows how to find the right tempo, and even though the film is barely over an hour, it still feels like a drag. Of course, it does not help to make the film a rather simplistic and very little interesting story. The film also feels quite disjointed. The first and second half of the movie don't really come together and look like two separate movies. At least Lon Chaney Jr. Once again he shook the role of the Kharis mummy for the third time. Too bad this time has so limited time on the screen. Unfortunately, it is very little interesting to do, which is also a great waste of the mummy itself. The film is even more filled with dozens of stupid actors playing with silly accents. It seemed so utterly unnecessary that most of the characters had to speak with such an accent, and in fact it was quite distracting and unpleasant in points. Mummy movies worth seeing. <br/> <br/> 4/10
