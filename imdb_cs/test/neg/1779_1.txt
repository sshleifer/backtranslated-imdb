I'm a fan of low-budget B movies and horror movies, but that was too much, even for me. If you manage to overcome a weak conspiracy, it's a cheesy effect and an uninspired actress. , then he kills the horrible writing, or you want it. The dialogue was most likely written by high school stoners who thought to say "sir, yes, sir" over and over again, so that these guys knew more of the army. Characters were all typical cardboard stereotypes: Gung-ho sarge, sorta gung-ho other guy with a sensitive side, a bad secret agenda scientist (bald or course), a biting hairy chick that would be hot if she tried too, silly sexy chick with important information, idiot "genius" nerd, random other sorta military dudes who die soon enough, and spoiler character alerts, mad scientist who was in charge of "until something frightened bad" Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there is a secret military (navy?) Submarine, sitting at the bottom of the ocean, 5 minutes from the headquarters (or so it looks), full of radioactive scorpions (ok?) And dead bodies. defined ..... <br /> <br /> If you follow, don't say you weren't warned.
