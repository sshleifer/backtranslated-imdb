Inspired by the true story story, it is full of the feelings of the 1970s, but is told in narration. This is the story of a black swimmer who ends up in Phillie at the final resort in the wrong neighborhood and somehow joins the swimming team. The film's first blind hour stagnates when Terrence Howard, our hero, gets the kids in the pool. There is a good story in this and its clear why Howard and Bernie Mac have attended, but the script is bad and most of the direction seems to be to make it feel like 197something instead of making us feel something for the story. It's not a misfortune to have some reviews make it but, instead, suffer all the recent sports true stories-coach Carter, Invincible, Glory Road, etc. who at least knew you had to at least work with the story to do the film as opposed to just letting the audience suffer because of "its true".
