First, this film was made in 1978. So it tells you that the movie will be just as bad. But I'm not saying that all the old movies are bad. Second, the special effects that we were terrible at the time. Finally, the meeting was so bad, Bozo Clown could do it better. This wonders how people get money to make films of this pathetic. This movie sucks!
