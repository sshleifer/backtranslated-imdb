I do not see it. It's cumbersome. Animated people are scary (looking up at the Wonder Valley). The scenes go on and on and very little turns on. The story is skeletal and has to be stuffed with lots of senseless dramatic, roller coaster rides, as if Disney or Spielberg were planning a movie-based amusement park. Most characters are uncomfortable and uncomfortable. Some of them still appear as if they have something important to add to the top scene. No. They simply disappear without a lasting impact. Someone summed it up as "if you don't believe in Santa Claus, you'll be kidnapped on a train on Christmas Eve." This sums up to a large extent.
