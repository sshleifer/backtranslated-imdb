While I saw and enjoyed similar movies for this movie, which was about silent films about the Russian Revolution, such as POTEMKIN and THIS DAYS WHO RECOGNIZE WORLD, I didn't notice that much. This was mostly due to the unpleasant and "artsy" way the director chose to film. While POTEMKIN excelled in its cutting style, this film used similar techniques with much less subtlety - in some places the adjustments seemed very jerky and amateurish. Plus, and it was really annoying, using zombies all over the movie and late in the movie was really over-the-top. What I mean by "zombies" is that to illustrate how depressed and oppressed the Ukrainian peasants are, people in many scenes stand out as dummies. And it stands like this, motionless, for a very long time, while the "evil" capitalists and exploiters of the mass go around. Give me a break! This film is a great example of style over fabric - and it's just a movie for those who like or overlook the excessive direction. <br /> <br /> By the way, the DVD for this movie is improved, somewhat if you leave the audio commentary. This makes it easier to watch the movie and provides some interesting information.
