Is it an FMV game or a movie? With all my sincerity, I looked at this from "freedom-less-ness". It's a very big waste of time and money. HK movies seem to be heading in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. Try for more effort and money in production and want to follow us, rather than something you want us to watch.

Stop falling and make us an Asian look compared to the big guns in Hollywood. <br /> <br /> Sure! They have big budgets and better actors. But we have some of the oldest history, myths and legends, the best technophiles and perhaps the world's largest computer talent base! So what happened so badly?

Didn't you claim to be Hollywood Orient? Guess no.
