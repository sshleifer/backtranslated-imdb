I am not familiar with the manufacturer of other works, but this film is a piece of crap. I've never seen the MST3K version, but I can tell you, Mike and Bots probably didn't. <br /> <br /> I like a class movie as well as another bad movie fan, but it was almost unnoticeable. There was no credit for who made the voice of "The Dark." It sounds a bit like Patrick Stewart occasionally. The garbage heap could make a better film than that.
