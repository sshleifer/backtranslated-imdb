If you've ever visited Shenandoah Acres as a child and wondered, could the world be a worse place to vacation? Well, you could watch this movie and have an answer. Flavia (a.k.a. Fistula) Macintyre's dude ranch is often attended by business casual Gordon, at least because the resident water witch, Jessica, was 13. But Jessica can find much more than fresh spring water with that rod? buried "tray-shure," lost jewelry, dead bodies, even a talisman who would keep her from dressing like a slut and raising a beverage with a false rhythm and Suzanne Pleshette looking alike while hypnotizing without a head. Evil, Evil Evil.
