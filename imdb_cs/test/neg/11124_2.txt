Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito), a "crypto-zoologist" (a fantasy term for one of those confident losers who like to study extremely rare - read: non-existent - animals) and his hunters crew can catch Chupacabra, a large, scaly, elusive fast-moving animal . To get it to the mainland, they smuggle it to a Greek ship, and some idiots open a crate that contains it, even though they were specifically told. I don't think even the weird snarling sounds coming from inside were good enough or deterrent. The monster then makes a thang monster; Run around biting stunts from different passengers until the ship captain (John Rhys-Davies), a square-faced special agent pretending to be an insurance seller for some reason (Dylan Neal), squeaky-loud blond instructor Tai Bo (Chelan Simmons) bunch boys with machine guns and others trying to stop him. The main victims (who I think are supposed to be comical relief, but it's hard to say) are the old rich female (Paula Shaw) with the yippy terrier and the snobbish spectacular gold digger (David Millbern). It seems that a monster can be knocked out by one damping arrow, but he can live over dozens of hits. The design of Chupacabra is acceptable (though not original), but the rest of the film is without tension, surprise or interest. Boring Sci-Fi channel "original" film; they did dozens of films like this with almost interchangeable characters and charts, but with slight changes to the creature. Enough!
