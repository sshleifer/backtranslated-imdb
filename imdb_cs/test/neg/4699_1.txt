This film had all the elements of a good adventure film, but revealed incompetence at almost every level. Roger Moore's presence in the cast list is usually an indication that the film will not be. nothing more than average because Moore always has a leading role and cannot act. But this movie also had Ian Holm and Lee Marvin and was based on Wilbur Smith, so I thought I'd give her a chance when I saw a DVD for sale in the shop ... . The opening scene seemed to start in the middle of the winch, with the sound suddenly appearing as if the first second of the soundtrack had been shortened. The scene showed dreadnought at sea with a German crew. This bad editing was a sign of what was coming, but the dreadnought scene was so interesting that it was watching me. Special effects were good and the crew wore proper uniforms and spoke German, suggesting that the director paid attention to historical details. I was surprised. So I kept watching, and then Moore appeared and confirmed my thoughts. Poor play, clichés, clichés and cheap humor ... but the worst of all is the disastrous attempt to blend the light feel of the film with serious drama and tragedy. It just doesn't work. The film ends so suddenly and so badly, how did it begin? in the middle of the winch.
