Why did the Italians make the best films in the 1950s and 1960s, and then in the 1970s and 1980s, did nothing but zombies and cannibal movies? Probably because art films made no money. , The Cannibal Movie, unlike the Zombie movie created by the Americans and "exploited" by the Italians, is purely Italian, designed as a show of mondo exploitation, and as much money as possible (no artistic integrity to get here). Eaten Alive arrived during the heyday of Cannibal Movie. The director, Umberto Lenzi, has not yet hit his step; his genre classic, Cannibal Ferox, has been gone for a year. When rendering similar (read: ripped) by Ruggero Deodato is a key cannibal classic, the cannibal Holocaust, a woman (Janet Agren) gets the word from the police that they have received an 8mm film from her sister. Missing in Africa, it is suspected that the tribal ritual on the film may have something to do with it. Mel Ferrer, as Professor Somethingoranother, tells her that a man named Jonas (Ivan Rassimov) began a Jonestown-like cult in New Guinea, and that is where a sister is. The woman hires a guide (Robert Kerman) to guide her through the jungle to find a cult and a sister. And you don't know, the jungle is full of cannibals. One sentence should sum it up: if you saw Cannibal, you saw them all, mainly because these movies steal shamelessly (Lenzi copied the cannibal holocaust to make this film and rework this to do Cannibal Ferox, Deodato copied parts of this for Hit and Run). And because they all share the same material, they all have the same features: scary photography, boring scenes, horrible dubbing, overuse and exploitation, exploitation, exploitation. Fans of genres will have the ball because everyone in it is a veteran of the genre. Rassimov and Kerman have a competition for scenery. Agren exists only to be naked, raped or threatened. Get on all the sick outside. The cannibals, who actually look like they are native cannibals, eat lunch that meets as a human body. And in the great tradition of cannibal movies, live animals on screen are killed shortly thereafter. Overall, it's really not a good experience, but I'm sure there are psychopaths who find this excrement fun. I know I did it.
