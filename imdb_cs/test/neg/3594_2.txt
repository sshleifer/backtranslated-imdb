"Threat" is not funny. He's trying hard - too hard. but rarely brings a smile. There is no gambling, just an ambush. One of the main characters wears a silly grimace on the face of the entire movie. There is no doubt that the less talented Wayans brothers played, wrote and produced a film that was completely blind to their lack of talent. The threat consists of a series of unbelievable, one funny parodies. Punchline can be seen a mile away, but you have to wait until everything is unfolded. No one-liner zippy or elegant dialogue. Just one scene behind the next building to the joke. Jokes themselves are juveniles. Loc Dog (the one with perma-grimation) talks to a beautiful woman - but then ... has a bad breath and then takes his nose and then waits for it (remember you have to always w-a-i-t) she is! How fun is it? Ten-year-old boys may consider it funny because they have never heard jokes before. Alternatively, if you like watching movies completely drunk or stoned then you will be able to follow and may even find fun. The challenge will be drunk enough to lower your mental state to the level of the film without getting lost.
