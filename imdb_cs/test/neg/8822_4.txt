Strange, often effective hippie zombie movie, play an unforgettable husband / married team Alan and Anya Ornsby, this film is not as bad as most in its genre, but is still high on cheese-factor. Includes several bargain-zombie basement, outrageous campy dialogue, scene-chew performance by Alan Ormsby, several gay / kinky graves-raiders, and one straange soundtrack. Anya's wife goes on a show that is so special, one has to wonder if she is acting at all. At the time of the era, the worst photos of this kind are (look for all of Al Adamson's flakes), but it's not the Night of the Living Dead. The director / writer "Benjamin" Clark is indeed Bob Clark, who continued to create pure "Porky" beginnings of the 1980s youth catastrophes. He has now only resurrected after 1 inexplicably good movie ("Christmas Story") to return to his terrible ways with "Baby Geniuses". Weirdo Alan Ormsby later wrote eccentric Nastasia Kinski / Malcolm McDowell's version of "Cat People". Moocow says check this hippie horror for fun, zombie frolics and campy dialog: = 8)
