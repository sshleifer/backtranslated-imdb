When my parents rented this movie, I was expecting a very funny movie because Randy Quaid is very entertaining in comedy movies. However, this movie is not all funny and it is somewhat boring too. You can see the surprise coming a mile away and run long for a movie that is reportedly just eighty-one-minute long. So I can honestly say it's not a movie that's on my favorite list. It can work for some people, but it just didn't work with me to prove it to be quite slow in assembling with virtually nothing that I enjoyed throughout the movie. Randy Quaid is useless and the rest of the cast is a list of very bland actors and actresses. The assumption of the film had the potential, as did Quaid casting, but all that sputters and the inclusion of the horror element seems to be very pointless. It is true that one dream sequence that a boy had when he jumped on the bed and suddenly became a blood whirlwind was very well done and would be very good in a movie that was supposed to be a pure horror movie instead of a comedy. as the first genre.
