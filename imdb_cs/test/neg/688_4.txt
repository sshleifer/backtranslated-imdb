Edward G. Robinson, who has followed his role in the gentle hood of SEVEN THIEVES (1960), which I watched a few years ago, seems to have played older types of criminal masters (with the exception of a special juicy role as in CINCINNATI KID [1965]) . ). I used to watch quite a good "euro-Cult" effort by GRAND SLAM (1967) and I also have two similar titles from Italy that I checked - one of them was directed by future goremeister Lucio Fulci! In any case, it is an international production featuring American and Italian actors and a British director. It's harmless and easy to go alone, but barely memorable and definitely lengthy - especially because to get the finance for the heavy equipment needed for a robbery (such as an army tank and a plane!) the gang must engage in the first minor thefts. Of course, the gang is an incompetent game led by an American (Robert Wagner) and his bimbo girlfriend (Raquel Welch) - others are "pacifist blacks". a persistent hungry Italian and a tiny Englishman. He is trying to get the former gangster (Vittoria De Sicu) to throw his property to them, except that he is helpless ... but under the auspices of "Professor" Robinson, instead suggests paying $ 5 million instead! Needless to say, gang members don't trust each other (Wagner instructs Welch to seduce De Sic to get the name of his fence in Morocco - where to retreat after the escape), or otherwise commit to hold a restaurant, an Italian can't resist sitting at a table and order a multi-course meal for yourself!). Fun, in a similar case, De Sica tries to show them how they did it in the old days - but apparently holding a gas station, it turns out that the owner is his nephew and he just asked to borrow money! The central sequence of heist is typically complicated: while a gang, including Welch, "takes" a train carrying platinum, Wagner kidnaps the pilot Victor Spinetti and his plane. When the job is done, he intends to overcome De Sica twice - but neither his partners nor Welch are willing to go with it, so he is forced to surrender. Since the crime did not pay, the gang had decided to lose all the stash in the air as the aircraft bombers' doors opened accidentally ...
