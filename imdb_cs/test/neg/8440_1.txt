it was the most tragic pile of cinemas I've ever witnessed. Not only was the name a complete misnomer - because the film has nothing to do with piranhas - but acting is so hollow and musty as an attempt to create a conspiracy. when you look at this movie, you can't help but spend every second awakening when you've had enough and it's time to turn it off. Unfortunately I waited to finish in my case. these are two hours of my life that I will never be able to cultivate.
