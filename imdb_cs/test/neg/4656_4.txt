Like his close contemporaries "The Great Race" and "The Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines," I have always linked this film to my childhood, especially the New Year. On New Year's Day we visited my grandmother and after lunch while adults talked, the kids watched TV where one of these three crazy racing films would always be. Just for that reason I really wanted to label "Monte Carlo Or Bust" well, but I'm afraid I can't, the kid is not the man's father on this occasion. I mean, I see too clearly my mistakes and when I was tempted to smile sometimes, I really wanted all competitors to reach the end of the race long before they actually did. Of course, this is dated by his stereotype of nationalities and women as a weaker sex, and I also didn't care too much about one or two stray, undoubtedly mild vulgarities that occasionally appeared. But more than that, the cast, despite the fact that it collapses terribly, simply doesn't sell the movie. Tony Curtis, in a trial run for "Yank Abroad" in the TV series "The Persuaders", seems too old to play a young gallant, Terry Thomas just isn't awful, Eric Sykes is incredible as a dirty minded Lothario, while Gert Frobe as an exaggerated Teuton, he's just weird when he makes a comedy when you remember it was Bond's best villain Goldfinger. If something of the English comes out best - Susan Hampshire is at least engaged as a "bright young thing", appropriately glamorous as a classy flapper, and although she lashes to the lead of Pete and Dud, she offers the most amusement as army top lip types, though "Carry On "The team did it much better in" Carry On Up Khyber Pass ". Director Annakin tries to evoke everything "Golden Silents", with grotesque eyelashes, mistaken identity of capers, accelerated camera shots, dramatic stunts and light romance, but there is no real tension for such famous races. The race at the end looks like another swizz. Actually, I'd give him another mark if they followed the alternative title "The Magnificent Men in Their Jalopies", but in fact the animated series "Wacky Races" did much better.
