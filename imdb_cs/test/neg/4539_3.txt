Anyone who sees this film will notice that the filmmakers have thrown a lot of money on this film. Interestingly, they called her "The Hole"! The production values ​​are good for a short film. The hole is trying to look a big budget and is done in some ways, but is limited by the video format it was taken to. I speculate if it was shot at 35mm it would look incredible and will increase content somewhat. Many Hollywood movies look good and that's enough for the audience regardless of story and content. <br /> <br /> My honest opinion, 3 out of 10 for this effort. Maybe Ishimoto's next movie.
