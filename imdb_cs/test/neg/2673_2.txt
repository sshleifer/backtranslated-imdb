This movie is very bad. In fact, the only reason I gave him 2 rather than 1 is that I laughed. Without giving up, the man's head actually explodes in this movie. It was so pathetic, I laughed. I don't believe the scene was supposed to be fun, but it's nonsense. Nonsense. Original Halloween is such a good movie, it's a shame that they had to go and make such a smelly.
