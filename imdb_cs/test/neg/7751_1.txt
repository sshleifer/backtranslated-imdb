This movie is a bizarre fantasy story that I'm sure it's not desirable for anyone to over 10 but is too special for kids. The storyline is stupid and acting is one of the worst I've ever seen. 25-year-old Kathy Ireland plays a teenage girl who is 9 years old. She seems to have stood up to her voice by listening to Alvin and the Chipmunks. Her tall swing, a nasty child's voice, is annoying when she starts talking. Everything else is wrong, but Kathy Ireland is by far the worst. The storyline is also horrible and it's a mixture between Alice in Wonderland and Mad Max. Wanda Saknussem (Ireland) receives a letter in which her father, who has abandoned her long ago, has fallen into a bottomless pit in Africa, and when he finds it falls into an underground world full of strange Australian accented people. It's one of the most famous movies you'll ever see, with horrible lines around the world. <br /> <br /> It's an unpleasant effect this movie uses for character development. Kathy Ireland is a nerd who doesn't do anything or go anywhere. It flies to Africa ... wow what development! She drops glasses and then doesn't need them. Why is the dropping of glasses to represent that they don't become nerds. He should be her descent into blindness. It's just stupid. The only positive thing I think is that there are semi special effects and working with the camera and the music score sounds good. Overall, this is a ridiculous family fantasy that will appeal only to those who expect nothing from the film. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 of ****. 84 minutes. PG for violence.
