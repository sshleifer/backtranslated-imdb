Before the last call w / Carson Daly, my local NBC affiliate broadcast much more useful programming after Late Night w / Conan, such as the second city television, 3rd Rock From the Sun & Carline in the city of reruns, and some build comedy. These days there is nothing worth watching because everything I see is Carson Daly and his terrible show. He's not a comedian, he's not an actor, he doesn't deserve to be famous because he's not a good spokesman or a comedian. At his show on June 21, he tried to use the internet Meme called "Rickroll" on his show. He failed hard. This event confirms that Carson Daly is terrible.
