Of all the directors behind the camera, Wellman could break his heart faster than anyone else. Even Ford. But this is one of his worst. He, too, seemed to know, apparently from his ugly treatment, not over Bonanza or the Great Valley. Yet one moment, the typical Wellman who comes out of nowhere to smash you, is the death of Gable's wife. She went to give her a baby some water and WHAM is killed by an arrow immediately. No warning. Nada. One of the most shocking, unprepared to death in all theaters. Especially after investing a full hour of love for the lady in what looked like a handy western. Of course, treatment with it is loaded with Wellman's utter indifference, apparently film. Still, it is a reminder of the power he always had at his best.
