This must be the worst movie I've ever seen. The part where they lost their daughter? with poltergeist off? it just moves over the edge with stupidity. I was looking at it in showtime, so there were still soft soft core porn scenes in it. I must say, I laughed. The 3D effects of the 1980s were very ineffective. She included an invisible cat and a rotating vortex. Wow I wonder if the people who did do feel really filled in life. The actress who plays the wife looks familiar but sucks. Her screams could be used as a torture device in hell for more than Nazis retired. Anyway, thank you showtime for super lousy horror. I'll always have fun watching the biggest passport of time and money I've ever seen.
