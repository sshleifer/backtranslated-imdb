I wouldn't recommend this movie. Although G is rated and is clearly for children, there is quite a lot of curses (including the feared words 'F' and 'S'). This language is not particularly offensive to me, but in children's film? Come in. There was also quite a bit of implied sexual content, among one of the first teenage male characters and any willing adult woman who came - including a prostitute! Acting was as good as it gets in this film genre, but the story was very very cheesy, and even my four-year-old remarked that it was "stupid." Despite the fact that Elizabeth Shue, this movie is definitely not worth checking if you haven't seen it.
