Set in 1976 without any obvious reason, besides keeping the cast of the dressers, "The Box" was directed by Richard Kelly ("Donnie Darko"), and stars Cameron Diaz and James Marsden as Norma and Arthur Lewis, a young couple who are allegedly he fights financially, although both have a successful career - as a high school teacher, as an optical specialist at NASA's Langley Research Center, Virginia. They have one child, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). One day Lewises will find a package on his doorstep that includes a black box with a large red button. There is a note from 'Mr. Steward ', which suggests that he will return at 17:00 to explain the box. The mysterious Arlington Steward, played by Frank Langella, appears at the appointed time, gripped in the sleek Savile Row suit. He is polite, but entrepreneurial, but his most distinctive feature is his face, from which it seems that half of them have been blown away and misrepresented her. Langella is the only thing worth watching in the movie, but is unfortunately upstaged by his own makeup, which resembles that of Harvey 'Two Face' Dent (Aaron Eckhart) of Christopher Nolan 'The Dark Knight.' It's like an elephant in a room: one can try to ignore it, but it's more than a little disturbing. Steward explains that he will return within 24 hours to pick up the button. If they decide to unlock and press a button during this time, they will give them $ 1 million in money. The only catch - and it's big - is that a stranger dies somewhere. It could be across the city, it could be on another continent, but Steward assures them that the victim will be unknown to someone. As a good faith show, he leaves them with a $ 100 dollar bill to keep them pressed or not. Arthur and Norma are skeptical because they believe the whole thing is a scam or a complicated scam, but it's not long before they start thinking what would happen if they pressed a button? Would they really get a million dollars? Someone dies? Tired of speculation, Norma pressed the button. Nothing happens. Their initial relief, however, causes an alarm when Steward appears on the next day with a briefcase full of money. They decide to call the whole thing, but Steward tells them it's too late. "You have already pressed a button," he explains. When Steward's limousine breaks off, Arthur notices a license number that she later finds is registered with the National Security Agency (NSA). At this point, the film is beginning to move deep into the untouchable territory as secondary characters begin to spur noses and flashing peace signs. Meanwhile, the city becomes a pudgy attack, clumsy flocks in bad shirts who start to follow Arthur around as a lecture for a zombie race. Ultimately, Arthur becomes jailed by the terrible bookshops in the library (?), Where Steward's Spinster's wife - which we haven't seen before - and tells Arthur that he has to enter one to get out of the library. of three vertical columns of cheese-looking digital water effects. "What happens if I choose the wrong one?" Arthur asks, he seems to be much less confused than he should be under the circumstances, and certainly much less confused than the audience at this time. "Eternal damnation," says the spinster ominously. Arthur enters the middle column of digital liquid effects and suddenly appears, still in his water jacket, hovering over Normin's bed. When he wakes up and sees him, the water bubble bursts and Arthur falls on the bed in the shower of water, which, strangely enough, still drips from the top water pipes that are out of the camera while the rough Marsden and Diaz are hanging around him. It's confusing, I know. Finally, we learned that Steward was once a public relations officer for the NSA until he was struck by lightning that destroyed part of his face. He was pronounced dead, but later returned to life, having been transformed into any superman who now serves 'those who make lightning,' and whose powers have enabled him to assume the CIA, NSA, and NASA all And what is the meaning of all that is this kind of natural waste? It seems that Steward's mission is to subordinate people to a particular kind of biblical character (eg, "Isaac's Binding") to determine if humanity is worth saving. If enough people pass the button test by refusing to push, Steward's divine enthusiast will save the race. Unfortunately, those people who push a button like Norma and Arthur must be punished for their moral carefree they are exposed to a series of sad "mistresses or tiger" suffering that is played as one of those "Saw movies except fun gore or benefit from a coherent plot. 'Box' is a kind of senseless mental masturbation that students of freshman philosophy wanted to cure for a few beers. Richard Kelly's sudden exercise in existential pettifogger finally collapses under the weight of his own incomprehensibility; In the end, the tortured melange of incompetent ideas stiffens, as is the mixing of too many colors, into a meandering gray goo film that is like a fool as one of those on-board narcotics whose conspiracy does not suffer more or less from being interrupted by a leisurely nap. <br /> <br /> In 'The Box' is where Arthur, who is a technically minded guy, becomes curious as to how the button works. Opening the unit is disappointed when he found nothing inside. <br /> <br /> When I saw The Box, I know exactly how it feels.
