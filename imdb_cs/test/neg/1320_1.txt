As bad as they get. This film makes a fatal mistake that the viewer does not care what happens to the characters. Two women in this movie are so stupid that you start to take the bad guys, so this thing is over. This film is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another. channel. This film, written in highbrow, lacks loyalty. People, not even Ohio people, just do not do this. Well, maybe writers do it. <br /> <br /> There's not enough beer in the world to be bearable. <br /> <br /> F903
