I was excited about the fresh (word-specified) synopsis of this film and I look forward to watching it. The first few shots present some of the characters and the main storyline; gardening rations. The film looks fantastic. Colorful but simple. Magic but original. Unfortunately, it only takes a few minutes to find out where the film will go. We quickly discovered that it was a manipulative, unfortunate story that illustrates a lot of tired people who find themselves in a way confronted with "nice victims" of refugees and that they will have a happy ending where tired people realize the fault of their travels and accept them. people. Characters, especially those prejudices, are in nature very "comic-hips". The story focuses mainly on two families of refugees. One of them is led by a single mother, played by Diveen Henry. I am sad to say that any emotions that could be felt for her struggle were devalued by what was remarkably bad. The next story is more interesting and focuses on the father and his two children. They are all scarred by their way to this country through containers where a mother and a mother died, but the husband suffers most. Here Benedict Wong gives stunning performance. Initially, his emotions are very subdued, but as the story unfolds, he subtly reminds us of the internal struggles of his character. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie is extremely boring. There were so many possibilities with this movie. There are several characters that can be followed, many of which may have potential, but none of them is realized. Worse yet, despite the fact that this movie is not very Hollywood, some of the main conspiracy topics are resolved cheaply in Hollywood style. Example: <br /> <br /> Character A like character B Character B rejects his backup No problem! Let's have the character C to declare her love for character And so we can all have a happy ending. Yawn. I really liked the plot of an Asian family. It was good. Unfortunately, the entire assignment trade, its common aspect, the dynamics that involves the great cast, are all under exploitation. What is left is a movie that has very little value.
