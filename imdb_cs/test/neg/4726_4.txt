It is another notorious Mexican horror film: however, while the original version in the Spanish language is fairly tame, all kinds of gore and nudity were inserted for the English-dubbed variant (set up by Jerald Intrator - who did similar duties on CURIOUS DR. HUMPP [1967 / 71] - and, like the American version of this movie, was previously available on DVD through Something Strange / Image! At first I looked at the original and, although there were no major shocks, it was quite engaging - especially with a conspiracy that was as familiar as this one: the doctor is trying to save his life from calling his terminally ill duty son; he even has a massive bump helper (played by Carlos Lopez Moctezuma who, in his role in this game, discovered a remarkably similar role - though in a more sinister vein - in WOMAN'S WOMAN [1961]). I know that several Mexican movies have mixed horror with the "Lucha Libre" genre, but I've never seen him; this element is present - in fact, the heroine is a wrestler - but fortunately two styles are separated (that said the match sequences are competently executed, with some movements being very fun). The doctor's son is turned into a monster (looking like The Incredible Hulk with the mud that pushed his face!) after the monkey's heart was transplanted into it - but then when a female wrestler replaces this place with a comatose heart it stays that way and a couple of fangs grow up to start up (it shouldn't turn realistically into a transsexual ... though I don't think it would be very interesting) !! The GHOST OF FRANKENSTEIN (1942) recalls the climactic roof sequence in which the monster kidnaps the child and meets his demise in the hands of the police. But my favorite unintentionally funny moments in the movie will come when a doctor trying to comfort his son says he will soon heal - just to turn his back on the brink of tears soon - and also an impatient look he gives his crippled assistant (as the latter stagging slowly into the car) when they are chasing a monster that has escaped from the lab. Alternative nude scenes work for the movie (these were actually made by Cardona himself for the racier Mexican version entitled HORROR Y SEXO) but his reputation is largely based on added material showing over-the-top violence, such as eyeball being plundered from his drawer, scalping and even a person is a person. the head is torn off. There are also some graphical operative inserts, but they give rise to stupidity: while it is clear that only two people are involved in the operation, we see a third pair of hands that constantly holds the oxygen mask on the patient's face! The movie is also said to be a free remake of Cardona's own black and white horror movie DOCTOR of DOOM (1962), but since I haven't seen it, I can't say how much it was postponed to NOC OF BLOODY APES ...
