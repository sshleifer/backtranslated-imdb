There has been some good tension throughout. The camera was surprisingly good in view of such a minimal budget. We are witnessing the occasional magic of good acting, but it is quickly deflated by some pretty cheesy lines. Obviously, there wouldn't be many intellectual conversations that could be done if the crocodile watched you. The silence would be golden here. It could have been a bigger tension game than shocking, "I said, I was afraid of my brother in the locker ..." Something tells me that there is a slight difference in how your brother beats than eating him. mighty crocodile. . You decide. In the course of the movie, I don't seem to be able to find a connection or care about it, sympathy with the characters, maybe it's because they don't evolve throughout the film, which is a character. There are some occasional good scares when crocodile sneaks on characters, overshadowed again by some controversial scenes. In one case, we should be frightened by an ear floating in the water, but later we sit next to a headless dead body and just take care of a broken finger. As for logic, a certain roller coaster film.
