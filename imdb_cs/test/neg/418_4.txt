Why don't they follow the book ... I'm really sad and disappointed. I was looking forward to this movie, but if you read the book (maybe recently), it can be very difficult to stay objective. My wife didn't read the book, and she loved the movie. The reasons for disappointment are: 1) Cern's involvement ... away with the wind, such a pity, there is a very small part at the beginning, where antimatter is created, but also that it does not stick to the facts (why no, the fact that Vittoria's father was burned down by the first Illuminati brand, which is how Langdon was involved, would be the perfect start to Movie_ 2) The story between the (deceased) Pope and Camerlegne completely gone ... it completely spoiled the motif of antimatter theft 3) The Story Between Langdon and Vittorio Vetra The Absolutely Non-existent All-in-all, too scaly story, and cannot understand that Dan Brown allowed them to name it against him. Maybe I should return this movie in 10 years, when I can't remember a great book (hope for forgetting a book I'm afraid of) <br /> <br /> I'm sorry about the negative rating that was spoiled by expectations.
