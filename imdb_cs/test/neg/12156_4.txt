The story was clear and concise, but overall, the film never touched my interest scenes that felt flat and uninspired. Ghengis khan, historically spoken, had a very interesting / epic life, but the film could not capture that instead of focusing on small skirmishes like Youth and Love Story I think I saw disguised in killed other movies. I never felt sympathy or empathy for lead that had to overcome slavery, but then it seemed to have an easy ride to plunder the khan, killing and double crossing the road to the top. The only redeemable quality was photography - the landscapes certainly helped the dreary atmosphere of the film, unfortunately in combination with the bleakness of the story - I remained motionless and disappointed.
