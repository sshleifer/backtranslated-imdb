All the movies at the airport are smelly, but this is the biggest of them. The formula was different for this one because it focused on two catastrophic flights and a lot of conspiracy on the ground, while other films focused only on one catastrophic flight and less plot on earth. Stunts with Concorde are worth watching laughter, though the special effects aren't as bad as I'd expect for a film of this quality made in 1979. George Kennedy's sexual notes are disgusting and his meeting with a prostitute in Paris is totally useless (and a bit of me gag). Poor Martha Raye has been relegated to a role where she has done nothing more than again and again in the Concorde bathroom. There are no big stars in this movie compared to previous movies, which gives you one more reason not to look at it.
