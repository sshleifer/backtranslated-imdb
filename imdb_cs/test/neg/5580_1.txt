Once in a while it is good to see a really bad movie like this, just to know how respectable Keanu Reeves is in comparison. The premise of this story is good: teenagers go out on a ship, a meteor of earth in the water, aliens kill teenagers. What is it not to love when you're on screaming thrillers? But I should have known that something was when I read it was only 75 minutes. I thought, "I hate judging movies as long as they are. Who says the movie must be 90 minutes?" But as soon as I took the DVD home from BBuster, I was shocked by the horrible production quality, acting, directing of this totally amateur piece of garbage. The only reason I watched it was that I didn't have cable TV and I paid four money for that. However, there was one ray of light: the actor who played "Chris" is actually decent, and far surpasses this dreck. First, the special effects were cheap and unconvincing. Then the extraterrestrials - the costumes seemed interesting (rubber suits), but since most of the film takes place in the dark, you don't have to see them! And almost none of the actors was convincing enough to suspend infidelity. Finally, I must say that the DVD jacket was made with much higher production standards than the movie itself, which felt like a rip-off, so be careful when you rent another DVD. Save $ 4 and buy a pint of beer.
