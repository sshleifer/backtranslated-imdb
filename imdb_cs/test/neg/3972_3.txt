I'll say it first ... the movie would be a 70s sci-fi classic if it was executed much better. Let's say we're investigating a conspiracy ... starting with Peter Graves (or Clarence Oveur?), who runs for president, then he cuts into a goofy college campus, like an environment full of authoritarians in crazy caps and headsets and retarded athletes who act as if they are always age. showing a guy who seems to be going to America, holding a party, then taking them to a medical lab where he is dazed, wrapped in a plastic bag and then ready, as if doctors were collecting vegetables for steamboat packs ... all right, actually put on except that doctors can extract the organs they need. Then he cuts to another man who thinks the place where he lives is a little strange after the beer (out of all the devices of the facility) finds in the river he looks suspicious (damn those cans from beer!). He and some equally stupid interest in his feeling that he must get to the end of it all, so he will be left behind by escaping what is essentially a large administration building of the college with some evidence that he finds on the way cloning. .. and how it's part of it. <br /> <br /> After hitting one of the controllers, he escapes from his controllers and the old reporter helps him find his father - the man he was cloned from. It is that he is a clone of brother Peter Graves. After discussing what to do with him and his evidence, he returns to a facility where he finds his girlfriend (who has been lobotomized in the meantime to be even more stupid, harmless and ready to host a talk show by SOL crew). He is captured and stored in a cold store, as well as his Nazi retard builder from the beginning of the film. Meanwhile, confrontation at the Graves Brothers' House results in several deaths, including Graves. The reporter and his wife are killed in the middle of an exciting conversation with a bomb. It seems that the conspirators have won to some extent ... <br /> <br /> Then it turned out that Peter Graves was able to survive, thanks to the miracles of the cloned parts he got through metal poker. for me speech, as well as reporters confront him about cloning things. Definitely MST3K feed, but at the bottom end of the spectrum in terms of overall badness.
