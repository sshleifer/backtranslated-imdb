The "storyline" of this movie contains several holes that you could drive a massive truck, but I don't think it's always the highest priority in horror. Two older sisters in rural England have been holding their brother in the cellar for over 30 years. Now he ran away and started killing a spree targeting armies nearby. "We thought it was the best for him" continue repeating and? podivÄ› ?? All Army officers love these women and don't doubt their sincerity, even though five of their men have died. I don't know if to find a revelation near the end of the thrilling ?? or boring! In a way, this film reminded me of "Arsenic and Old Lace." In this black-comedic classic, two half-crazy siblings also have the mother of their goofy younger brother, but they kill there. The old ladies in "The Beast in the Cellar" are by no means less insane. "Horror" in this early 70s movie is very amateurish and inexpensive, but there are a few clean attempts to build up tension. Too many "old ladies" talk about good days, and that rarely is what you're looking for in a horror movie with such an attractive title. Flora Robson, who can be recognized by classical film enthusiasts, plays one of the nurses. She gave the picture to Queen England's legendary Errol Flynn swashbuckler movie, The Sea Hawk.
