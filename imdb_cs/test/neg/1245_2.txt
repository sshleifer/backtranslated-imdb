What could be a great movie about a late poker pro (pre-poker craze) Stu "The Kid" Unger turned into disappointment. <br /> <br /> You can say that filmmakers are working on a short-budget budget. Everything seemed to be cheap. The timelines seemed a little gone. Casting Michael Imperoli of Sopranos was also a bad choice. He looked too old to play on Stu's baby, and he looked too healthy for a coke addict (if you look at the 1997 WSOP Main Event, the real Stu was so thin and practically had no nose from excessive cocaine) . so he was wearing those sunglasses to hide them, and I was expecting Adriana to jump up and shout "Chris-tu-phur !!!" They also skipped the fact that he had a son from a previous Angie relationship who committed suicide in the late 1980s. Every time I saw Vincent Van Patten, he was still thinking that he would announce a show at Stu's head. Like WPT. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a true Stuey track, check out the ESPN Classic as they repeat the 1997 WSOP Main Event so often. Or try YouTube. Avoid this movement as a bad blow.
