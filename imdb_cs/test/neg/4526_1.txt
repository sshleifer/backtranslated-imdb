Don't believe the humbug. If you have great hopes or have expected this movie to any degree, you may be disappointed. Even the cheerful and talented Steve Carrell can't save this badly written, too long silly espionage. For purists (fans of the original TV series), this film bears little resemblance to the original characters and influence. Agent 99 and Maxwell (except their names) just aren't the same characters. There are several isolated references to the original, but not enough to convince this fan that it is anything more than a bad shadow television version. For those who are unfamiliar with the original TV series, you don't have to be disappointed, but you are bored. There are also several cheap Hollywood political shots (truly pathetic and so typical for election year). After the first hour we left and were not alone. Some left after 20 minutes.
