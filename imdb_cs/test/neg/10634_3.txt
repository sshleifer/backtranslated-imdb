A great subject, director and cast somehow contributes to a truly sophisticated film that is in this flat documentary style that was so popular at the time this film was made. (Hi, this is not a film-noir!) Absence, overly complicated, excessively populated story has no arc, no focus point, little excitement and stagnation from one scene to another without any recognizable purpose, other than as a valentine to supposed and highly questionable cooperation between the US and Mexican governments on illegal immigration. The scene that made me hate this movie is when Montalban and Mitchell bravely run away from their prisoners, the race expects to rescue Montalban's injured partner from killing a goon with a gun on the farm. machines, Montalban says something like, "fast - we have to try to save him," but instead of doing so, they lay on their stomach and watched in agony for about 5 minutes! Finally, he goes over (or we assume - the machine simply stops, another goon detects the presence of two "rescuers" and shoots at them when they run again.) Scene over. The whole thing is so terribly filmed and totally anti-climatic. There is nothing worse than the protagonist (allegedly Montalban, even if he is off screen for more than half the film), who will not even try. Jeez, Ricardo, do something! I know it's Anthony Mann, but hell, not all his films are classics, people. How bad must the old movie be here to get less than 6 ratings?
