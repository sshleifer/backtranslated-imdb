These are high-gloss soft porn; a boring soap opera focused on one thing: sex. They actually made sex boring, sad to say, because I defy you to watch it casually and tell me what was going on. What is it, is an excuse for Kim Bassinger to show off his great body and for Mickey Rourke to grin a lot. And it is done. Rourke's complacency is so bad that it's scary and Bassinger, despite his great character, looks cheaper than beautiful. Kudos to the photographer for some nice close-ups and some wonderful colors, but the story is so weak - no character development and no conspiracy - it can't compensate. Let's face it: this film was made for one reason - the titillation of male viewers. At this level, it probably succeeded. As I recall, that's why I did it as a fan of Bassinger's appearance, but in fact I was expecting a story. Those who try to pass it on as "art" and something deeper than soft porn will only be deceived.
