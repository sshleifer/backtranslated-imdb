Do you think you saw the worst movie in the world? Think again. The person who designed the envelope for this box should be charged with false advertising. The cover looks like a good, scary horror thrilling thriller. But not. Instead we have NIGHTSCREAM. A movie that makes "sweeeoooowww !!" every time the credit flashes on the screen. The biggest name in the film is probably Casper Van Dien, who has hardly any part. I voted for one just because I could not vote any further. If I could vote as negative five thousand, believe me, I should. So for now, I'll give NIGHTSCREAM 1/2 * out of 5 just because it's over.
