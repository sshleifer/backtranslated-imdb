In the Muslim country of Khalida (fictional), his kind leader / dictator, Reed Hadley as Amir, dies of cancer. Amir dies and the desperate plot develops. His body is wrapped in aluminum foil and taken in a clandestine operation (the population does not know of his death), consisting of his doctor (Nigserian) and Mohammed, out of the country to carry a risky brain transplant. The operation is disgruntled by Dr. Kent Taylor, who believes there is no chance of failure and has two assistants. One of them is about 3 meters tall (the Master Blaster actually ran Barter Town) and the other is a disfigured and traumatized figure 7 of giants named Gor. What could go wrong? I forgot to mention Amir's deathbed American, the wife of the blonde-Barbie, Tracy, or that Dr. Kent has a dungeon with slaves of female slaves and delusions of grandeur? How about a brain transplant that wasn't? There is a lot of double action in this matter and people are killed, but I won't lie to you anymore: MISSION ACCOMPANYING. The ends justify the means. If you can accept that then you won't have to waste 80 minutes. I hope this is enough warning. Don't say I warned you. If you have to watch, then you don't have to watch yourself and have a lot of medicine standing. <br /> <br /> -Celluloid Rehab
