Just as I love trains, I couldn't stomach this movie. The assumption that one can steal a locomotive and "drive" from Arkansas to Chicago without hitting another train along the way must be right there on Impossible Plot lines hit board. Imagine two dissatisfied NASA employees who steal a crawler that connects shuttles and rides there and rides to New York and get that idea. <br /> <br /> I said it was a nice attempt. Wilford Brimely is at his Quaker Oats Best, and Levon Helm turns good performance as his subdued but well-meaning sidekick. Bob Balaban is suitably wormy as Corporate Guy, and the "little guy on the Goliath" story gets another broadcast.
