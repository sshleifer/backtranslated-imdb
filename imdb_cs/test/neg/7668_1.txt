This film is a total shame! I really enjoyed the original airport and I can't believe how the same people could make this airplane for nine years. First, the action is wrong. The original had actors who made quality (non-disaster) movies before, but this uses actors who made the disaster a movie circuit already (Blakely, Kennedy, Wagner). The character of George Kennedy's patron seems to be very fast. He is now leading in the film, but his character is not strong enough to carry it: he has lost the magic and airport humor (1970), and the character is now only boring. Did I mention the conspiracy? Is it even plausible that someone would send a missile after Concorde? NO!!! There are also too many free ends; scenes that have no meaning for conspiracy. The scene where the hot air balloon lands on the runway, the thief's chase at Charles De Gaulle Airport are two such scenes. They would both be interesting - if they had anything to do with the real story. There are also many unanswered questions: Why do Patrons open the window and fire on the second level? Why was Robert Wagner's character killed? (He must have another stupid and costly way of exploring almost no exploration after the missile investigation. Why are back projections so bad? (Looks like a rocket cartoon follows the Concorde, even though it works well when the plane lands in Paris.) thinks he's in the flight simulator? (when he turns Concorde) Why does the hero in the cabin of the plane after having frightened the passengers? The end so poor, if it is possible to say that it is the end? One-dimensional dimension. "The blessing of a young couple on a plane by a girl's coach is blessed, the man who plays Saxophone and the woman with a bladder problem is simply stupid, the scenes where Susan Blakely is on her conservatory's roof, and when she tells Wagner that he still loves him, they are pretty terrible.This movie was supposed to be the culmination of three previ ous movies at the airport: instead it is devilish, with ub-moronic, complete and complete loss of time, money, energy, celluloid and "talent" !!!!!!! Remember when Patrones ask the French pilot if "landed on his belly?" lands on a pointed nose ...
