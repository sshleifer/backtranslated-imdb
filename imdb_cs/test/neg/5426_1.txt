God, it's so stupid. Absolutely absurd, offensive and repulsive. Why do writers have such a problem with actually getting Zoey and Chase together we all want too! In normal shows, it's actually more than one conspiracy conflict in show, wow, what concept. you also can't even tell Zoey 101 episodes apart because the same thing happens every time. Quinn is exploiting Dustin for some strange thing, Nicole is ugly and stupid, Zoey is just a little bit, Chase is chasing her all the time, but she doesn't notice it and Logan is a jerk. repeat. Quinn is exploiting Dustin for some strange thing, Nicole is ugly and stupid, Zoey is just a little bit, Chase is chasing her all the time, but she doesn't notice it and Logan is a jerk. repeat. it's like a shampoo bottle. and the end of the movie, omg again. so nonsensical NIC HAPPENS. It is as if they specifically designed it so that the film could fit into two episodes of the show and the show would not change completely after the film plot.
