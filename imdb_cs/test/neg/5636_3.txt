I didn't know anything about this DVD when I hired him. He looked quickly at the comments, but decided to keep his mind open. Of course, an independent movie and a low budget, but that didn't bother me. I'll watch Derick Jacobi and play his part as always. Too bad nobody else did. I was looking at 'Atonement' a few weeks ago with Vanessa Redgrave and she was noble. It seemed that she was just turning to read the lines. In my opinion, the main mistake was in casting Vinnie Jones. To be honest, I saw his picture on the DVD cover, but I didn't notice he got the highest billing. A sticker was strategically placed on top of his name! It was traceable and I liked Dickens' story next to the day. Maybe with a more capable actor playing the lead this could work better. It was still weak.
