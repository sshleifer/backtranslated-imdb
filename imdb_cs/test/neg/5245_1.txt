GOOD: Technomusic accompanying a medieval sword. The film also looks more elegant than most b-movies, but let's face it: Quake or Doom has more atmosphere. I usually can see very bad movies; Hell, I like a good B-movie like "Split Second" and like. But this has nothing but boredom and clich√© to offer ... Fully predictable from start to finish. And I forgot the miserable special effects, they look more like an old Playstation game than anything from myth! Using a classic poem to sell this crazy insults me! CONCLUSION: Quite simply boring. If you want to see Lara Croft, buy a game, it's much sexy!
