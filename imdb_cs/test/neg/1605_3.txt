I was hoping this show would be somewhat realistic. After watching him, it bothers me as another mainstream show. I didn't feel characters at all, it is America that has enchanted the idea of ​​how terrorism works? The main character does not act as a fundamentalist at all and is beyond my comprehension as he goes through a terrorist. Neither of the other terrorists appeared as genuine. One of the members, a blond Caucasian white boy, would never have been accepted by Muslim terrorists in real life. Another member, a French ex-skinhead, does not fit into the Islamic horror movement. In addition, terrorists have sexual relations with white American housewives, which I find very special. This is just another stupid American TV show. It's as realistic as Prison Break.
