I have to admit, I love horror movies ... especially 80's slasher movies. Damn, I even like cheese like Sleepaway Camp and Demon Night. But I didn't think much about this movie. The death scenes were not very well done, CGI was terrible and acting was stupid. The worst of all was a story that didn't make any sense. I'd say you'd save your money, but chances are if you want to see this movie ... anyway. I hated it ... it's just not very good. Overall, it's just another bland, lifeless horror movie that lacks life (it's not surprising that this one was on the Dimension shelf more than a year after its completion).
