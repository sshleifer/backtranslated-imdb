It is a very boring film with poorly developed characters, subplots that go nowhere and barely tolerable. It comes as a badly conceived rip-off "2001". <br /> <br /> Sets and costumes and visual effects are all worth it. But even that was not enough to nod. I'd like to get a soundtrack, especially music during a series of space flights, on a night of falling asleep.
