I have never understood the controversy and hype that this film has caused. Especially in France and neighboring countries (eg in Belgium where I am, for example), "Baise-Moi" has been declared the most shocking and stimulating social drama you have ever experienced. Yeah, right! Maybe it's a little shocking, maybe (how often do you see someone who gets fucked?), But the faint and senseless conspiracy certainly didn't make me think. "Baise-Moi" is another of those "guilty of everything that happens in society" - movies and generally not very convincing. About 99% of people work in this society perfectly, so why would you blame this exactly same society for the ugly and hopeless actions of two derailed nymph girls? The two main characters and their unfortunate lives are presented separately and in flashes. Nadine had just killed her roommate; Manu shot his brother and they both met at an abandoned train station late at night. They decide to travel together in France and leave behind a trail of sex and blood, no matter what they stop. Although we are constantly exposed to pornography and violence, this film is very boring to be able to sit. Just like girls all the time suggest that dialogues are lame and people they encounter (and kill ??) are very uninteresting. If people want to make porn movies, it's in my order, but please don't pretend it's an artistic filmmaking. If you omit the swearing and the hip camera, everything is (not) excited about pornography. Great soundtrack!
