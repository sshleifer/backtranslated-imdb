I am the fifth language arts teacher and after reading this book (which the students loved), we watched the movie. They laughed loudly! Unfortunately it's not a comedy! Behavior was so terrible, I felt like watching a lot of kids around where I played the game. My students imitated the lines and made fun and all the way. I have to agree with them, sometimes it was bad enough. However, I would like to show it to students again, just for fun and to compare the film with the book. We did Venn's diagram (teachers know what it is) afterwards to show what was the same in both and what were the differences, so it's educational value in that it shows. I noticed that another adaptation is being shot for 2005, so we can only hope that acting will be better!
