Especially I didn't like Sliding Doors or Twice Upon and Yesterday, so I certainly didn't make this bad apology for the other movies for these movies. The idea that was done to death (what would happen if ...?) And the script is awkward and unsuccessful, not to mention the obvious attempt to add sex / nudity simply in order to get R's and certain scenes that were not necessarily, But they were there to push the boundaries (I don't really have to see a baby urinating or fighting a diaphragm. Especially when they have absolutely no connection or use in the movie). Acting was also very poor, the only actor I found least satisfying was her daughter; the rest was two-dimensional and quite incredible. The people I watched left the room in half; I managed to finish it, but not without a quick passing over part of it. <br /> <br /> Overall: Nothing new, it's a general and boring movie. Few fun moments are far outweighing stupid or stupid. That would be boring even if it wasn't before. If it wasn't such a rehash, I would have rated it five, but it was really missing for Indian film and losing originality as rehash: 3/10.
