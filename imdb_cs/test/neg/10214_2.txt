The new match shows the way for the most feared wrestler he could ever imagine, the giant Zeus. Network President Brell does everything in his power to draw the WWF Ripa champion into a square circle to oppose Zeus for the "Battle for the Hard Boys" championship. But Zeus, unlike Ripa, has ever been struggling with. Normally, I would give Hogan a free hand to get a film role in the game, but this film did not ask Hulkster to do much. on a stretch, he just asked Hogan to play himself, which failed miserably. 'Tiny' Lister made a good effort as a powerful Zeus, but even his work left the film lacking something, specifically playing! Watch this movie if you wish, with a grain of salt and a sense of humor, or you'll probably have to turn it off for just over ten minutes.
