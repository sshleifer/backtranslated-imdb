The premise of this film is that graduating from World War II in America with its stupid apple cakes and hypocritical morality was a terrible tragedy. Those horrible hippies seem to have destroyed everything. <br /> <br /> What holds the film together are excellent performances - especially Lemmon, which is really remarkable. Otherwise, we have a boring drama about life (just over 24 hours of Jack's life) with prejudice. <br /> <br /> I found him as a chore to sit.
