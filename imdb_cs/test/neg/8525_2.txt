I almost laughed loudly as the director said during the commentary that this film was original with strong graphics. There is no one ... repeat ONE original fence line or special effect in this blah movie. The Crows .... Hitchcock did it great back before the CGI and even with CGI this movie lacks a well-executed offensive scene. The fearsome boy ... Grudge did it and did it better. Psycho ... was the last to do at Cold Creek Manor, but it was done to death. No pun. Disconnected / rebellious teenager who no one listens ... about a dozen films used this right down to Beetlejuice. Deep stuff from the basement ... can you tell Amnityville Horror? The door opens uncovered ... What Lies Beneath did with much more taste. A haunted farmhouse ... too much to mention. The background of metaphysics, which was supposed to be a central goal, will disappear once you find out what's going on, which is, by the way, very soon. One thing (in many ways) never tries to explain in the film how they explain to the police that their attacker was sucked into the basement so they don't have a body. <br /> <br /> Overall ... DO NOT FIND
