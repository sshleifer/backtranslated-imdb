Please don't lose six hours of your life and watch as I did. The fact that I did it is not a very good reflection of me. The only redeeming actor in this clunker was Wes Studi. How a 'prequel' with similar roots cannot be in the same universe as Lonesome Dove is behind me !! It was a disjointed, disjointed story. The fence lines were not developed, the action scenes were almost ridiculous, and the big end (disappointment) was a good ending to this mini series. Val Kilmer, who I thought was a serious actor, played one of the strangest roles I've ever seen. I read these flight reviews and this show prompted me to register !!!
