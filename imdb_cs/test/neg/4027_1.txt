That's what I've been asking all my friends about this movie all the time. We couldn't believe how stupid it was! I think somebody filmed it on the camcorder at home and slipped it into the movie store and pressed it on the shelf as a joke to see if anyone could pick it up. Well, I think the joke is up to us. <br /> <br /> I think I should have come to these websites first and read all the reviews they got, each of which says this movie is HORRIBLE, STUPID, and on and on. And the boys are right! Although it was pretty good laughs (me and my friends were pretty drunk) because it is so stupid. We just can't believe someone was so stupid that he made such a lousy movie! I swear it must have been done in the 1970s before they had good technology for movies and things, because every scene looks really bad, but when I looked at it, he said it was in 2001? What? It certainly doesn't look like a movie that was created today, but I think what you get when you use your camcorder and shoot home movies with flash lights and really false looking lasers, and instead use real people from your actor home town or even even new actors. BTW-some of those chicks (or they were dragging queens, we couldn't say!) They were so fugly, even my drunk horny college mates would touch them 50-foot pole. So this movie is not desirable at all, bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, bad, bad, bad. Don't waste your time or money on this, you'll be absolutely disappointed!
