If you've ever shopped at Wal-Mart then you probably know about the $ 5 DVD bin that sits at the electronics department. Well, that's where I found the movie. But I was deceived! You know, the cover of this particular DVD had a big picture of Sandy Bullock and even her name as "headliner." I picked it up and thought, "Wow, I didn't know Sandra Bullock did this movie?!?!" So I was pumped to go home and watch Sandra Bullock's great movie. To my surprise, Mrs. Bullock had a small role ..... a very small role. She plays a CIA son's girlfriend's girlfriend. Talk about the support actress. She can have no more than 2 lines in the movie. Besides being deceived by being a bullock, I looked around and I continued watching the movie with the action. Negative! At one point, for special effects, the gun was taped to the camera. You have to look at it to laugh at what's terrible.
