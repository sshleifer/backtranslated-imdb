I don't know what today's movie visitors are expecting, but after 68 years watching movies .. (Well maybe I didn't watch many movies in the first 9 - 10 years, so 58 years of watching a movie) I expect to be entertained, not bored to tears, invaded by continuous profanity (every other word) and idiotic scenes of violence that are presented in no other purpose in the mind but show blood splashes and body parts to be broken. Surveillance is one of those films created by people who have no imagination, little talent, total inability to combine the scenes together and the inadequate property of letting the scene go on and on, long after the purpose has passed. That someone would think it was a worthwhile movie when it was nothing more than Hollywood waste behind me. As a combat veteran I saw violence, blood and gore, in many forms, and movies like We were soldiers are as violent as the movie can get, but it has a redeemable value. Surveillance must be dreamed of by drug-induced people, without writing skills, no overhead training, no film editing experience, and a complete lack of contact with reality. Just a silly movie of two serial killers acting as FBI agents, they're preparing a script to kill some stupid criminals in the mouth, etc. A highly valued piece of waste that only an idiot could have ...
