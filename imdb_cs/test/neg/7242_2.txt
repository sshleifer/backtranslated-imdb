The Salena incident takes place in Arizona, where six death prisoners are taken from a state prison for reasons they have never explained, and get a flat while driving on a heavily armed prison bus, and the driver is forced to leave the road. Then two fair-haired birds rise and after seduction of incompetent prison guards they manage to get out of them, six inmates are released, but in the break their escape car is damaged and everyone is trapped in the middle of Arizona's desert. They decide to head to the nearest town, Saleny a few miles away and take the cops hostage. When they get to Salena, it's strange that the place is completely abandoned when there's no one other person in sight. He soon discovers that the whole city has been killed by the body of aliens and is firmly placed in the menu ... <br /> <br /> Also known as the Alien Invasion of Arizona in the US on DVD and apparently with the working title Terror Town this rubbishy low budget sci- The fi horror flick was co-written, co-produced and directed by Dustin Rikert & has no real redeeming features at all, to be honest with The Salena Incident is a kind of movie that gives movies a bad name. The film could be roughly divided into two parts, opening forty or fifty odd minutes to focus on prisoners in the thrill of opening, guarding and escaping, even if it's badly written and staged. The dialogue between two blond birds and prison guards is so bad that it is unintentionally funny because two fit birds talk to both not so good prison guards. Actually funny stuff, unfortunately The Salena Incident is supposed to be a science fiction horror, not a comedy. After the refugees and their hostages in the prison guard arrive at Salena, they go into sci-fi horror mode when the aliens rise and start killing our cliché character that is good because they are uncomfortable. Look, the whole movie is upset because it's badly written, thought out, and done. I can't really bother going into it, why believe me Salena Incident is terrible at every level. Besides being a bad, boring and stupid movie, The Salena Incident is also badly made. Scene scene events are terrible, aliens look terrible and never appear on screen at the same time as they are human in nature and how it is sometimes difficult to tell what is happening. Special effects are also poor, extraterrestrials look garbage and CGI computer effects are also utterly awful. The cut is bad, cinematography is bad, the kits are cheap and the whole thing is really just sight. There's a little gore, there's a few gunshot wounds, someone is torn in half and I saw a broken arm. Apparently shot at a low budget Salena Incident has low production values ​​and looks cheap from start to finish. Filmed in Superior, Arizona. Acting is terrible of anyone I've ever heard of, although an actress who plays a female doctor is pretty good looking. Salena The incident is a sci-fi horror that is horrible about every trip, not worth 90 minutes from your, my or someone else.
