I do not recommend watching this movie if you are easily offended. I'm not even offended, and this movie has frustrated me. It's so disgusting. And it doesn't make sense. All the internet thing is so clich√©, and of course the producer has not understood all the "internet rules". You can watch an IP address while chatting with someone. Really? (see sarcasm here). It was stupid. Unimportant. And I didn't even follow the end. I could always say "it doesn't make sense, this ..." This movie is purely crap at its best. Nice comment right?
