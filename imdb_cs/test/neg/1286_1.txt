This film comes as a square pin in a square hole. Poorly made pin. A pin so inexpensive that it couldn't even be made in an assembly factory in Chinatown. In fact, when you try to push a pin into a hole for which it is apparently designed, it breaks into sticky, disgusting pieces that smell like rotting fruit and do not wash off. Quigly is such a pin. This film is so overwhelmingly nasty that it couldn't even be created. A film like this must have been the result of some nature accident; some crazy entity that stiffened somewhere in the corner of the filthy office and got lost until it was too big and scary. Only science would be interested in such a thing; Anyone who does not seek to study would exhume him from this world. What's that, it's: if you can enjoy the first year of violin recitals, racism or Coke Zero, it can be either a birthday.
