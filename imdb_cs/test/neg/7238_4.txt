When I saw the first octopus movie, it was a laugh when he saw both impressive and frightening effects. This film seemed to replace acting, but not special effects. After Jaws and Piranha, certainly, why not make a movie about the killer squid? Octopus attacks New York Waters, where 2 police investigators try to stop the furious beasts before July 4th. Pretty clean plot and descent happenings, but octopus was pretty scary, its nice to see This time they actually did, but it looked like a piece of plastic ... Better in a big budget it was a good movie. There is a constant amount of bugs where I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't look for a way to live octopus ... <br /> <br /> Watch if you like cheap DVD sequels, otherwise your better tracking Jaws.
