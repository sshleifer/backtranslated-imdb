While watching BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM, I encountered scenarios and dialogues so incredibly wrong that I was convinced it was supposed to be a comedy. Several selection dialogues worthy of the belly laugh: "I ate a rabbit." "I told you she was obsessed!" "Are you telling me the devil is in my daughter?" <br /> <br /> There are many, many others, but you have to discover them yourself - if you dare. The story goes into all sorts of directions and things that probably shouldn't, and everyone seems to be a perv or psycho of some kind (even a priest). And I didn't even get into bad behavior. Most notable in this area is a colleague who plays Isabel's father. The director has just told him to behave as if he has his @ $ @ $ because that is the overall impression one gets. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to turn anyone away from BLACKWATER VALLEY EXORCISM because there's a fun value to be ... for all the wrong reasons, but if you're looking for a decent horror that makes sense and is actually scary ... Well, running doesn't go.
