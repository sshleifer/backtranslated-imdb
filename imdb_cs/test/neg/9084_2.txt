Director J. Lee Thompson will again join actor Charles Bronson for a violent and uncompromising action move. In fact, it is probably the most brutal movie of Bronson (quite a good performance for a man who appeared in Death Wish, Ten To Midnight and Chato's Land). But brutality alone does not offer a good film, and the evil that men do is ultimately disappointing. If you were to take away his brutality, the movie would be a little interesting. The story is about a retired officer (Bronson) who lives on a Caribbean island. He is convinced to retire to track down and remove a sadistic torture doctor who has thrown himself at his vile trade around various South American hell holes. Throughout the film, especially at the beginning, we are processed into several graphic torture scenes to show us what a nasty job it is. These topics are really serious. Torture continues to repress Latin American dictatorships, and everyday people are forced to suffer some desperately painful experiences simply because they are unpopular. But the evil that men do - for all its worthy posture - is not really bothered by the misery of these poor people. He is worried purely by giving Charles Bronson an apology to blow a few unpleasant bags. He's just an exploiter who hangs on his coats for real things. The torture sequences of you, the viewer, will feel like a dirty, sick voyeur, rather than someone who will enjoy enjoying viewing "snuff" movies. The scenario is full of horrific dialogue, including some excessive descriptions of torture. The evil that men do is unable to explore their disturbing thoughts ... it serves them as entertainment and asks us to enjoy them. Sorry, but that's wrong.
