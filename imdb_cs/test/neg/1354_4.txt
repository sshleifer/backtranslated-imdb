I believe that the whole book can be written about a odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is freely based. When Hollywood first began talking about such a business, the reaction was always negative, because there were too many aspects that could go wrong, starting with a fixed file that made the original unforgettable. the actresses who otherwise can make remarkable work but which are not suitable for parts, and unfortunately enough, have been directed by the director's heavy hand, who does not understand or appreciate the source material. Looks like there's no focus or direction, or as if the direction that was taken was supposed to destroy anything that was good on the original movie. This is called update, because let's drop the story from humor, elegant dialogue and some interesting assumption. Above all, we prove that women have gone a long way, except that the problem is that we do not actually get (at least by watching this movie) where women actually go. starters, casting Meg Ryan into a central role proves that the film is almost fatal because it seems to have locked itself in some sort of limbo where women actually don't change their appearance even after 20 years of working in movies . Her Marie, who proved to be a difficult role in the 1930s, somehow grew out of her interaction with other stereotypes like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" by learning, observing and realizing she had a choice. Maybe it wasn't a choice women would celebrate today, but it was a fun ride and part of the fun was a feline, silly, sometimes grotesque routine that elevated the film to a noble realm. Here we are on the ground with a bang. Changing the nature of Sylvia, the film has lost a lot of its spark, and that is not the case of Annette Bening at all. I couldn't help but admire how she tried to save this sinking ship and had a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was manipulating. Fortunately, I enjoyed looking at some of her amazing outfits and constantly remembering how talented the lady really was. Her Sylvia is wise but flawed and could be a great creature. Unfortunately, the English did not pay attention to her own work and loses control of one character who could film the film in a new direction. Yet it was not the greatest blasphemy of all. . In the original, we have Joan Crawford doing about one of the best performances of a woman. Her crystal is legendary, with cheerful lines, incendiary movements, duplicate maneuvers and some very sexy poses. It was a connection between a man and a woman, and through it we knew what the disaster was all about. It provided tension between men and women. She was a dangerous, sexy, ultimate femme fatale. The woman of intelligence we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. As beautiful as she is, Eva Mendes is double dimensional in this trip because she has poor writing, and again, some bad cast. There are more atrocities in the film, such as adding a terrible role for Mensing as a devoted mother who lives for having children, and a somewhat unpleasant lesbian turnover for Pinkett. Then comes the biggest loss of talent in the film, because Bette Middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her makeup, shows a spark of what could have been. Its sour supply reminds us of the current angle the film could have made. Her words revive and give the film a great deal of disgust and it is exciting to see that it really flies, then it is gone. He's in the movie all six minutes and disappears in the middle of confusion. Here is a movie that has increased our level of expectation and really disappointed us. Successful "Sex in the City", which made a great transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and uncompromisingly. It gave us more, more and better adaptation. It really updated what made it successful. "Women" in their present reincarnation must return and rework, just like "The Hulk" this year, to find more suitable artists, a really good writer, and most of all someone who truly feels good movies.
