It is often difficult to decide what is the best movie you've ever seen, because it may vary by genre, actor / actress preference, or even the mood you are on a particular day! When I said that this movie is by far the worst movie I've ever seen !! I thought acting was terrible (was there any?), The story was just stupid and the props were totally false. Could lower budget production be created without amateur production? I do not think so. Even the friends I watched the movie agreed to be the worst video we ever rented and we still joke about the night we saw the movie.
