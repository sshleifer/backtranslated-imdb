This review contains spoilers. I had no expectations about this movie. I pulled it out of the video rack called "White Noise". First, credits for this silly movie run for about 5 minutes. Stimulation from start to finish is slooooow. The main characters do not want to wear a bra, and the director seems to be enjoying the jerks when Anna Paquin descends the stairs. If you like movies for boobies, this one has a low buzzing factor. Second, it's nice to have movie rips from the elements of Lovecraft and other horror genre mechanisms, but in better movies, there is at least some rational or consistently irrational behavior. This smelly is trying to create some sense of modernity and reality, but then you have a situation where no one is telling the police, even if they have uncovered a treasury of potentially incriminating forensic evidence, and other world-renowned rituals are nicely refined in a comprehensive book about other worlds. rituals like Buffy. I waited for Miles to show up and give some advice on how to kill a certain type of demon, and so on. The prerequisite is that it is possible to open the age of darkness, where the creature crawling on the ceiling can lower your throat or turn the mill into a meat effect on you. Hm. To do this, you must have a sacrificial circle and then have seven children who must have throat cuts by the people who love them. This opens the world to the age of Darkness. At least that is what he says in detail in the book of ancient occult rituals. Which raises an annoying question, um, as those who wrote the book knew, and if that's what happens, you would leave this information in a book you can take from the library much less. from a library in a world that is no longer covered in darkness, an age brought by madmen who could do it the way they used to, using "Occult Practices to Bring the World to the Darkness for Dummies, 2nd Edition"? It turns out that the father in the story is the 7th child, the one who ran away from the ritual 40 years ago; he was released by his father, who is a doctor / grandfather in the film, who wanted to try out a ritual with probably, other stupid parents, who just wanted to see if a stupid sh * t like this world opening into darkness actually works. Grandpa let his father go because he really didn't love him. Aduh. Stupid silly film written by a moronic director who seems to think he is some Eurofilm Auteur. There is also a scene in the movie where the baby appears with large welds on the face and the mother grabs it and has this complete lack of response. The whole movie is like that. People who see that they are doing really weird and do not respond to it in any way. It must be a bad plot and direction. Anna Paquin tries to play her character realistically without working on a grin, and she looks like breaking into a halter, but at a few critical moments in the story. character does not bother to call for backup. You know, more of the same: "I will enter a probable demonic evil situation without knowing the defense or help from others carrying torches or firepower, even if I feel threatened by destruction." And even stupid, as it may seem, even if you bring the age of darkness, these creatures that make you bloody cannot attack if you have a light source but look like the people you know and tell you to turn off the light source. It reminds me of the video game "Alone In The Dark"; Maybe this movie is rip off that game concept. The best actors in the film are young boys and Anna. They both die at the end. The whole family will die. The creation of darkness leads them to their death, but the stupidity of the characters in the family was the main cause of death. Other adults could be confused with other Red Shoes Diaries in a fine movie theater. So to wrap up, the worst things about this movie are the stupidity of blind-shocked characters in an apparently abnormal situation, a real stupid piece of land (there is an old architect in the story who proposes a house with a sacrificial altar in it) hiding - the architect from the beginning suspects that the house will be occult victims, but does not tell anyone because, no real reason, they could not find the children, but did not bother to say the authorities about HIDDEN ROOMS, which he designed for the house, but he likes hanging around the house for 40 years because he is worried about what is going on inside ... derrrrh ... duuuuh), hackney's use of haunted mechanisms (more children who stood in the dark, or appeared only in photos, and blood on wallpaper) and egoism The director who saw him in DVD elements describing his crap work as a new and original rendition is to understand where the real horror of this film lies. <br /> <br /> Is it fun? At 2x speed on a DVD player with subtitles turned on, it can be fun until you reach the end and realize that the movie is crap, otherwise draaaaaaaags on. Film equivalent of fat shake; Empty calories are terrible. The film gives the impression that the director had to see "The Ring" and wanted to try to create something similar in the mood, which in this respect fails, and so, in this regard, also Jaume Balaguero, it is mine the idea that you suck what you do.
