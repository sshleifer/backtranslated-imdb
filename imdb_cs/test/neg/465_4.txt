I must say that I was not impressed at all, probably because I expected much more from this film. Perhaps an emphasis on religion vs. science or on the meaning of life, not just a few lines. So, if you expect something to think about when you see this movie, no. It's more psychological than philosophical. I am voting 4 because of the end, a little bit clear and because I have great respect for BBC documents. There are some very interesting scenes that really made sense. It was a great idea to add it to a movie related to evolution theory, too bad it wasn't the main subject. Oh, I forgot to say that for more than 1 hour the movie is quite boring and cruel in a way.
