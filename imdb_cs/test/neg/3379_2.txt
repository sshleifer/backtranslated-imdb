This episode had the potential. The basic assumption of a woman living next to an empty apartment (but a phone that keeps ringing) is somewhat interesting. And when he examines the noise, there is real tension and fear. But a silly scenario cancels any promise the episode had. he closed, though not wind; "" This door has serious damage that wasn't here a minute ago; "" The doors opened themselves without touching them; "etc.). Given these supernatural phenomena, plus the fact that the woman in the room committed suicide, wouldn't any measures be taken before entering it? Maybe she could investigate in the daytime. Or she could investigate with someone else. Or she could turn on the lights! Also, while in a haunted apartment, she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets to the argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone, and then they start discussing suicide details. DO NOT USE THE PHONE ONLY! The telephone company may not be involved. Go to your phone and disconnect it. Case closed. Finally, show the scamper phone over the floor as alive was just comic. If the director wanted the woman to be strangled by a phone card, he could do it in a way that didn't look like cartography. Brave Little Toaster Anyone?
