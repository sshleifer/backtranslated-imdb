Ask you not to watch this movie ... It starts with a promise and as it goes, you long for the movie ... Predictable, not funny at all, wasted movie ... Save time and watch better thrillers. ... Synopsis sounds good and that's why I watched the movie ... But it was too predictable with nothing that would allow you to start ... No big tension ... no big direction ... nothing phenomenal with acting ... shy away from this ... low rating ... Nothing to write about the movie, so I filled out the remaining lines of text so you can imagine how much this movie is over time ... really irritated, as a good assumption that was and how bad the script was written out of it ...
