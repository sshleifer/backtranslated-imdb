I loved this movie when I was a teenager. He loved it. However, she did not grow up with me. Maybe it's because it's a melodramatic load of old garbage, full of macho posture, kitschy dialogue, crowded sloo and characters who say 'Goddammit' a lot. Deep narrative spots mindlessly from one character to another, one plot to another, without putting it all together, and it doesn't help that William Baldwin's mono-expression of power is wet enough to make every fire in the movie long traffic. Robert DeNiro and Donald Sutherland are worth watching, but no one is really at the top of their game here, and women folk get a particularly short thrift. The only real impact comes from the impressive fire sequences and majestic score of Hans Zimmer, which remains one of my favorite favorites.
