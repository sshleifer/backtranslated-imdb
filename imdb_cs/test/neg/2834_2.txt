I like Brian Yuzna's other work, even more cruel things like 'Necronomicon', but 'Progeny' was too much for me. My main complaint is that it's unnecessarily exploiting Jillian McWhirter nudity, I'm not prude, but these nude scenes just drag on and on and on ... just to culminate (virtually every time) in tawdry * wink, nudge * insinuation of sexual violence . An example is a scene in which a miscarriage attempts a few minutes of naked screaming. Arnold Vosloo's 'performance' is absolutely turgical, but even Jeffrey Coombs couldn't save this vile pile of film. Foreigners are boring, illuminating your interest evenly, and the plot is completely predictable. The only highlight for me was a too short glimpse of the true appearance of the strangers (a very nice model) and a scene where Vosloo discovers that his wife in the closet was also fine. But you were warned.
