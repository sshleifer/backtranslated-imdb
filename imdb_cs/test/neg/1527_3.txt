The presented topics are very interesting; suburban culture, suburban sprawl, public transport, oil and gas depletion, energy dependency, alternative energy, etc. The problem is that it is pure and shameless propaganda. One view is presented, then shattered again and again to the viewer. You see, the same handful of "experts" repeatedly make their case. The supposed "narrator" starts to sound like a news reporter, but at the end he preaches the dogma of the film. The dark side of the film is not so dark and doomic about oil exhaustion, but the feeling that people in the film are actually pious for the oil company and everything that comes with it. They portray this image of a utopian society where we all return to a separate model of the local village; go to work, shop on the spot, grow your own food and generally live the idyllic lifestyle of the 19th century. A post-oil society would be a great vision of a better world for them. It would surely mean the end of globalization and even better the end of Walmart. I will give them credit for using real mathematics to uncover the weaknesses of several over-offered alternative sources of energy, including ethanol and hydrogen. I gave her 3 stars because I appreciated the old shots and assumptions.
