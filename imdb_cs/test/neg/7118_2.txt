Spoilers ahead JEEEEEEEESUSSSSSSSSSS .... I have a saying: "Insecticides kill insects and Moronicides kill morons ..." "Ghost" in this movie kills morons. In fact, a few people who kill themselves in this film are trying to get killed in abandoned homes, ghosts, and so on. These three story lines have proved to be parallel, and suddenly we learn that they are separated by at least a few days. It's a cheap shot ... <br /> <br /> Also "excitement" is so cheap, it is ridiculous. Even "Nightmare on Elm Street" didn't sink so low to show that someone is attacked by their own sweater ... it's pathetic. <br /> <br /> Save money, stay at home and not resent filmmakers.
