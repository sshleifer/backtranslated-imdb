RoboCop's violent sequel was directed by Irvin Kershner (Never Say Never, The Empire Strikes Back) will never be as good as the original because it is almost humorless and that is extremely important and should be rated NC-17 because of the babies' scenes deal with gunfights, people threatened with brutal murder of very young children with automatic REAL weapons, and even scenes with 12-year-olds who use a lot of explicit profanity, give drugs to a lot of random people, shoot and shoot graphically and kill SWAT officers and officers, open fire to police When many small and small children are present, and a whole group of children who use strong profanity and beat the store owner (who is a very old man) electronics store and steal and destroy a lot of things. This film gives a new meaning to "mean", but the effects and action sequences are extremely incredible. Overall, OK movie.
