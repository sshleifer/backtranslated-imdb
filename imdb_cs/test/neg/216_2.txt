How do you take the cast of experienced, well-known actors and make such a stupid movie? Nimrod Antel has the answer: armored. Six associates on an armored car decide to steal a large cash package. But just as they get on the first basis with their plans, everything falls apart. With such a conspiracy, you think it couldn't be bad, at least for an action movie. But in the first 40 minutes or more of this movie, we see what are 6 normal, everyday kinds of guys. They joke, they laugh, have a few drinks together, etc. Then we suddenly learn that they are about to rob their own business. Hero Ty (Columbus Short) is sucked into the system because of the cold, cruel world, even though he is a decorated veteran, a nice guy and a reliable employee. Oh my, oh my! Then in the last 40 minutes of the film, these former regular boys almost all turn into psychically shocked psychos who are willing to feed each other for money. In the last scene, Mike, (Matt Dillon), is a suicide rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend. The viewer has no indication before this end that these men are ruthless and bloodthirsty. It's absolutely incredible and "B movie" is almost too kind for this kind of kitsch conspiracy. I'd say you're not wasting your time - too bad No one gave Laurence Fishburne, Jean Reno or Fred Ward the same advice before he did this picture.
