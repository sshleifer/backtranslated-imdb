I got out of the way to get this movie, and I was lucky enough to get it on VHS. Being a great fan of Gloria Graham, it was an excellent addition to my collection. Besides, I really can't really recommend this picture. The plot is predictable (and weak) and the only interesting aspect of the film is to watch Sterling Hayden get into deeper problems with his own department. Mrs. Grahame is always fun to watch (if you like, just like me), but dubbing her singing hurts a lot of this picture. He works in a jump so he can use it in his own voice. It can only lend to the atmosphere. I must agree with an earlier reviewer; the end borrows heavily from BIG HEAT. To the point where it is from the end. I saw worse films with Mrs. Grahame (MACAO), but I never get the chance to see her on the screen. If you have a movie night and you're looking for a second feature, it's your movie. Enjoy the picture.
