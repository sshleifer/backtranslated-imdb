I saw it in Toronto Inter. The film festival in September 2005. The description looked interesting - how bad I was! That could easily be the worst movie I've ever seen - in 50 years! I see my director is my age (born in 1948) and lived with Nico Velvet Underground, which leads us to Andy Warhol, which is what I thought when I watched. . This is not art, it's boring. <br /> <br /> Specifically: black and white. Maybe ... but what is the purpose? Certainly they had color in 1968! And there is no contrast with the present. And yes, the headlines were white, naturally. I don't think I missed much, but about 20% of them were unreadable. Furthermore, it is a pure chronological order, but with seemingly random events. old man at the dinner table? This adds nothing to the film. There were many similar scenes - almost like someone took a camcorder and filmed random people and put them together to make a movie. <br /> <br /> Fence? None. "Rebellion" consists of some numbers at a distance occasionally lifting a rocky screen. Mostly it is an unbearable time to watch people (at a distance!) Standing around. Repeated smoking of opium is just as boring. When the main character got to a cute girlfriend, I looked out, but no, she was boring too! This is the only French movie I have seen where no one will wear clothes. They were probably too bored to bother. Romance? None. The girl seems totally indifferent to everything - perhaps her sculpture is of interest, but if it is, it is not shown. We are completely indifferent to the fate of the characters because they are all uncomfortable. Maybe this is the point?
