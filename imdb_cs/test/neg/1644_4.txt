Good grief ... to think I saw it all. It looks really uncomfortable. She can't sing for licking, and when paired with Peggy Lee (PEGGY LEE ???), she can easily control it! Maybe the director saw it and made it a really bad comedy routine that he sometimes does in the movie. Peggy Lee is fine, but the whole thing is shambles. Maybe it's good for laughter.
