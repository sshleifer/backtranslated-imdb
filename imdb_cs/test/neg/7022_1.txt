Lucille Ball was a powerful force on television during the 1950s and 1960s, but she still made an occasional film, most notably LONG, LONG TRAILER and LIFE FACTS. Although her television career remained strong, as the 1970s began her film career seemed to be liquidating under - but Ball was determined to have one last big screen fling, and the project she selected was the 1966 musical MAME. In many ways, the role seemed to be tailor-made: based on the popular novel that gave rise to two different Broadway plays, Mame Dennis is a crazy, wild woman who "inherited" her orphan son Patrick - and leads him to a wild tour of life options, a reflection from one comic spree to another. The music that featured such songs as "Open New Window" and "If He Goed to My Life Today," was among Jerry Herman's best work. The support cast, which included Robert Preston and Bea Arthur, was the best of the best. Expectations were high; the opening night fanfare was great; the film was a disaster. Critics were horrified, and the audience sat hopeless. No matter what Lucy fans claim, MAME is a fiasco, so it's hard to know where to start. It's badly directed, poorly filmed, poorly executed, and there is Lucille Ball in the middle of everything, unable to dance, unable to sing, and grinning like a wax figure while the incredibly poor choreography swirls around her. But the catastrophe is hardly herself; support cast is not better. Bea Arthur and Jane Connell renew their roles on the Very Charles and Agnes Gooch scene; the first is stage, the second is neutral. Robert Preston manages to sing with a smile, but he's pretty much about himself, and he's not too happy. <br /> <br /> DVD brings a movie from a VHS pan-and-scan to a widescreen screen, but it just means you can see more horror. Everyone loves Lucy, but only the least critical fan could love Lucy MAME; While I wouldn't say it's bad enough to wipe out your eyes, you might want to. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> GFT, Amazon Reviewer
