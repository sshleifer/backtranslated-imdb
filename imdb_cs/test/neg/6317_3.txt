I wasn't a strange fan of Westerns, especially because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than the role of "I Love Lucy" or "Lucy Show". Here she plays Christine Larson, owner of the Arizona Territory Salon in 1868, who is about to marry a ruthless local Indian agent (Dean Jagger). she didn't blow me. I succeeded in the fact that the role was very different from what I was used to when I saw it - there was very little out of the outrageous physical comedy that she later made famous, even though the film tried to keep it gently amusing feeling. (A typical witty line - "There are two ways to deal with women - and none of them knows one of them!") I didn't find the story that was convincing, even though I appreciated that the Indians were the victims of Indian agent. There's a typical shootout and lots of horses - your typical western word. As far as Christine is concerned, we can pretty much estimate from the outset how her planned marriage will end; it's just a question of how he gets there. If you like western, it would be quite typical, with a bit of humor. If you are not big on the genre, it will be missing. I'm not big on the genre. 3/10
