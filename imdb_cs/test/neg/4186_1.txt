My friends and I have often joked about movies in real time. But this movie is really ... They will literally show a 4 minute strait nothing but a guy digging in the dirt with their hands. He has a non-conspiracy and an incredible amount of gratuitous cries. I honestly don't think he would get a prize for alleged tension. If you're like me and I've seen the first movie and loved it, it's a terrible deal, randomly cheerful one steamer, and all around low budget "ness" won't matter; it is so bad that bad memories could even break away and spoil all the good memories you have from the original. You'd be more fun if you looked at the blank screen.
