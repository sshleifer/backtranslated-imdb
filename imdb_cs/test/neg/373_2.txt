I just watched Dog Watch. I thought parts of the movie were hockey with more than a few options. The meeting was not too bad and the plot was not bad. But, as said, the devil was in the details. Some examples: <br /> <br /> 1) Charlie Falon's bloodstream bandages (Sam Elliott) come from the back of his hand while his knuckles were bleeding. 2) Would the detective kill his murder victim from a very well-lit area? It seemed very stupid to me. I'm not unusually picky about the movie, but in my humble opinion, this is definitely NOT recommended.
