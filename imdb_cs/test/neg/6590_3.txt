Yes, it may not be historically accurate (in fact, only 6 9th Company soldiers were killed there), and yes, it has some mistakes and exaggerations (a bent machine gun? Conquered by anyone - an educated Russian officer would know history much better than was the case British campaign in Afghanistan). And yes, it doesn't have multi-million dollar hollywood-style special effects, but it's the strongest point in showing a soldier's life there, their relationships and their feelings when best friends are killed before their eyes. In my opinion, 9ya company really does a good job that shows all those things. Again, the film has weaknesses, but in my opinion it seems to be one of Russia's strongest films over the past few years. years. <br /> <br /> 8/10
