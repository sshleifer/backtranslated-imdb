If you're ever in the mood for a really horrible movie, it would be hard to find something that could even compare. I've spent a lot of time watching a lot of horrible movies just for the sheer joy I got from it, and man, that's one of the worst. This movie was so bad, I had to buy a third Beastermaster online. It wasn't that bad, which is amazing because it was right on the video. This is one of those movies that is hard to understand as it was in the first place. I think someone had to actually read the script (or many scripts, I'm sure they made some suggestions) and said, "Yeah, that's it." They probably wanted to make Beastmaster 2 before they had the script, then they went with what they had. Ack, terrible. So if you're a fan of really bad movies, look at this. It's a real classic and the movie isn't much worse than this. And if so, please let me know.
