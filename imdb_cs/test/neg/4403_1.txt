Brazilian cable TV presents this month "Yadon Ilaheyya" in the channel "Cult". I saw the trailer and listened to the ad and decided to see this movie. It is actually absurd boring, reckless, unreasonably disconnected bullshit about the Middle East conflict, and together with "Soultangler" are definitely the worst movies I've ever tried to see. I really wasted forty-three minutes of my life watching the first half of this crap, highly indicated for torturing enemies. How can this film be awarded and nominated for awards in Cannes? My voice is one (terrible). <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Intervenção Divina" ("Divine Intervention")
