This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, don't look at it, even if your life depends on it. This film by Laurel and Hardy is when he inherits an island, wrecks and is hanged. Incredibly boring movie that is not near funny. That was Laurel and Hardy's latest movie and what is a very low note to ending such a great career. The 40th movies were not great, this film was made in 1950. If you want to remember Laurel and Hardy, remember them in their premiere, in the 1930s. Short films are better than feature films, my favorite is "Me and My Pal". Another reason why this film is horrible is that it is dubbed. The actor opens his mouth there and the words come out three days later. Absoulutley crap, but let's end up in high consciousness, Laurel and Hardy were in my opinion the best double act ever.
