Other than police rock and the show where the child dies of eating a spoiled hamburger under the bed was the worst and dullest show that survived the main time. If not for the unjustifiable success of Jason Lee in the film, this show would never make it out of conception if pitched with relatively unknown as leadership. <br /> <br /> The concept is TERRIBLE. Moron Redneck hick spends his lottery winnings to redeem his past waste. It's funny? periodically, but not consistently. Is it stupid? Every single episode. I've seen a lot of great gigs going before their time, but this bug survived longer than I could imagine. Dialogue is incredibly rude as well as episode themes. Every episode for someone with IQ over 100 is an absolute fight. And icing on the cake? Jason Lee is an annoying voice that tells every episode. If it were not for the southern culture of the state and the flower beds in the south, this exhibition would not have viewers. If you are a fool and need a show totally devoid of humor that still overflows with bad taste, bad dialogue and dimwit characters failing in life ... well then you're probably an actor on this show.
