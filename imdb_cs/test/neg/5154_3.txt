My mother took me to this drive-in movie when I was about seven years old, thirty years ago. She had no idea that the family movie was so violent. My most obvious memory was on the boy's father's face as they stabbed him and killed him. This picture haunted me for weeks. I learned that I lived in a world where one could wipe my father at any time. How could I stop them? How could my father protect himself? You have to realize that this sting is not a fantasy for a seven-year-old. It is as real as a testimony of a real event and has no place in the innocent mind of a child. Sadly, we still do not understand the impact that violence brings into our children's lives on our children and society. If only the parents protect their children from images of violence with the same strength, they protect them from the images of nudity and sex.
