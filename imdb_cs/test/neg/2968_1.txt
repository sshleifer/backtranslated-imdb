All I have to say is that it was the third worst movie I've ever seen right after attack 3 and star soldiers of deadly tomatoes. no holes in the walls. It was a terrible deal. No wonder I've never seen these actors before everyone probably slept with the director. I think I'm on this movie now nice, but that's just because I'm tired of screaming for a movie (I just saw it). My advice is to buy as many DVDs of this movie as you can and burn it, so no one will ever see this horrible loss of time, money and movie again.
