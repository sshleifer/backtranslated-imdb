I don't really know if it was supposed to be science fiction or horror. It was at least confusing. However, what really upset me was the lack of storytelling between characters. don't spend 30 seconds together on the screen together. The hot secretary (Kristen Honey) is dead and has more acting skills than the other two. <br /> <br /> Bad Developer vs. An exaggerated story, but I personally as evil developers get theirs as I live in Florida. The only reason I stayed with it was a creature. It was original. I've never seen anything like this before and I'm a newbie.
