The morale of this show is that bad eating habits give people bad hair, bad taste in clothes, poor posture, poor jobs and more. They are clearly miserable and hate themselves. However, if they learn to eat broccoli, they will be rich, successful and attractive. TLC should be ashamed of this obvious abuse of parental fear and guilt. If nutrition is really so important, it should be able to develop a show with honest and true methods. If they really believed in their computer simulations, I'd like to see them perform a double-blind test by finding about 40-year-old children, find out what their eating and exercise habits are like children and children who have developed age. fotky. Then compare with real things. Hey, that sounds like a project for Mythbusters! Discovery Channel - Are You Listening? TLC must stand for Tabloid Lies and Cons.
