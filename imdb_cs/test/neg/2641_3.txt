This "horror" movie lacks horror or even slight tension. Not even gore is good. The story would have a promise if someone who cared for what he wrote / filmed did, but apparently not the people who made the film. Basically, the film continues a series of seizures and begins with: <br /> <br /> The main character insists he is not crazy. "Milo" lurks in his yellow raincoat or rides a car on his bike in front. The main character insists he is not crazy and stepping on her passion as a teacher. Someone kills in an unsatisfactory way. The main character insists he is not crazy and picks up a few false sobs. <br /> <br /> Do we see the pattern here? If not, you can enjoy this movie. Otherwise, look at something else. The budget is low, low, low and HIS EXHIBITIONS (as opposed to what he says is a bad story that made you forget your budget) and is bad, bad, bad (with the possible exception of a janitor). The film is generally boring, boring, boring. I can't think of a single scene that's actually done. In fact, I didn't like the movie so much that I turned it off ten minutes before the end, something I rarely do ... hell, I watched MOSMUS, CLONES and WILD WILD WEST look all the way. <br /> <br /> 3/10. Save and watch PHANTASM again.
