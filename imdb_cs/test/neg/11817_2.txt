This is one hell of a slimy movie. Like so many "women in strings", this one is full of lesbianism. However, unlike most previous films that strongly suggested this, BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA shows a terrible amount of skin as a horny female prisoner guard on women, as well as having sex with one of the prisoners. In the early 1970s, it's definitely a soft-core pornographic film - something like GIRLS GONE WILD GOIS TO PRISON! It's also a bad rip-off from DEFIANT ONES, although in this case it's two hot women who hate each other, who are strapped to each other when they run. While the original film is considered classic, it can only be considered a classic example of bad taste. That's because there is no subtlety and the movie is just cheap - cheap excitement, cheap writing and very cheap gaming. Pam Grier is a "black prisoner with attitude" - a lady who has been set up and sent to jail on this hellish island. Margaret Markov is a revolutionary. When they escape, both cannot stand and have opposite ends. Since it is a clich√©, it is no surprise how the film ends - both become friends.
