I thought I could laugh out of this long stretched movie, but unfortunately I was disappointed. This film is about losers who spend most of their time trying to get a handover without attempting to open a book or achieve something. The film also portrayed teachers and directors, Mary Tyler Moore (Mrs. Stark), "Work Pain", 2000 as complete idiots. I know it was a comedy, but I was never allowed to, and I thought the whole movie was COMPLETE TIME WASTE! However, all the actors have given excellent performances and had a difficult task to make this movie a pleasant and fun movie! Just a simple study and getting a good grade for college is the only way to go!
