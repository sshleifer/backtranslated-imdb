My Take: Steven Seagal is obviously too boring to become a leader in an action thriller, even boring. Don't forget Steven Seagal? Not you? Don't worry, there's not much to catch up with. After playing in incredibly enjoyable crowd-pleasing films like UNDER SIEGE and EXECUTIVE DECISION, Seagal hits the low reasons for the poor movie gap. He now plays in the low-budget Type B action vehicles, some of which are made for the "Film of the Week" television, which have lost their way to the big screen. HALF PAST DEAD is among them, say, dead action movies. Loud and lousy action movie, carelessly driven and lazily written (and worse, wrong). This is one of the bad movies I don't need to watch until I realize it's bad. I didn't have the courage to let all my brains die while I was wasting my time. It is this kind of bad movie in which you realize that the other movies you hate are not bad. The storyline (and the locale) is completely pulled out of a similar picture, Michael Bay's The ROCK, though the word that describes it may not be similar. Both movies are summer movies and they are not to be taken so seriously. But compared to that, The ROCK (which is not much in writing, as well as lights and sounds) has better characters, more convincing action, better action sequences, and a more fun atmosphere. Although there are action scenes in HALF PAST DEAD, none of them are exciting. All of them are sometimes boring and predictable. Although predictability in summer action movies has been a welcome benefit, predictability has never tasted more sour in those that aren't fun, and HALF PAST DEAD is never really fun, it's just a headache many times (hear that In this film, repeated music from rap is constantly repeated, which makes me crave aspirin every second I hear. Acting is extremely average, the plot is derived, without any convincing or appealing characters. Seagal's character, a secret agent sent to Alcatraz to stop a criminal (Morris Chestnut), a very boring thief, is nothing to get excited about. Seagal's character is also provided by a sidekick (played by rap star Ja Rule) and a bunch of amigo prisoners, and there is no chemistry going on here. If he plays in a series of other forgotten action cars (what were those films again?) killed Seagal's career for good, HALF PAST DEAD is overkill. And viewers should be warned: you are invited to feel pain. Advice: Avoid at all costs. <br /> <br /> Rating: 0 out of 5.
