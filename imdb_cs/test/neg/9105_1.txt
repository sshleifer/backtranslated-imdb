It sounded so promising in the rental store, instead it sounded great, and I couldn't wait to get home and watch it. It was Apalling the Diologue's horrible, The Action is Extremely Scripted and Plot takes away nosedive from the start. Gutenberg puts into poor performance, Sean Bean tries his best, but with the bad scenario there wasn't much he could do. It is not even worth watching, although you can get it for free (borrow it eg from a friend) Dont how you regret and waste 90 Minuity of your life. <br/> <br /> 0/10
