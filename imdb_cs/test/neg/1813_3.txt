Despite the excellent cast and potential of the story, this film fails on many levels. I was convinced the director was a beginner. The film is very poorly edited, shows a lot of unpleasant and unpleasant flashes, has very visible shakes and has no exciting atmosphere. The question that repeatedly appeared in my mind followed this: "So what?" I couldn't take care of the protagonist and what would happen to him. It's not that the story isn't convincing, it's just the way it was said. The film tells a story. TIME. It is like an actor who mutters his lines without knowing what he is saying. The film simply tells what happens without any soul. And the director is to blame. He doesn't know how to do something interesting or exciting or fun. (And believe me, I'm not someone who wants to die hard 8 or 2 fast 2 miserable. On the contrary, mainly as slow-moving movies.) So I was convinced the director was a beginner. But to my amazement, this man has years of experience and worked as a cameraman or cameraman on many amazing productions. Guess he had a bad year.
