... if only Disney would stay away from it. I think this film has some potential. The main character's situation is at least that. Take the whole thing out of Jordan Cahill and get the start of a decent movie! Of course you are also losing more than half of the film, but well. Not such a big loss. So here it goes: you take a typical, preppy, suburban teenage girl (Danielle Panabaker, who is actually a decent actress), whose best friends do a lot, mostly through "pop feeling" it is a direct quote from the film, a film like this almost always including that particular phrase named Jordan Cahill. In addition, TPSTG wants more out of life. Enter the character Brendy Song, a sophisticated individual who needs TPSTG (frankly, I don't care what the character's real name is, I like the abbreviation better). Two new friends go to Jordan Cahill (one who is drooling, one is joking about handkerchiefs) and comes out with a cell phone. Hijinks follow and everything ends up fine. If Disney, or any larger film studio, had not had such a low opinion of 8 to 14 years old. Or maybe if they expect 8-14 years more of the films that are targeted at them. It's a sugar-coated crap like that that makes me more than a little unsure of who is more disgusted (a small movie called "High School Musical" comes to mind ...)
