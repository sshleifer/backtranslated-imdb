What is this film ??? A horrible film with an old, boring concept of infidelity, which has already been achieved by "Bhatt". The film is in the film EMRAAN HASHMI, UDITA GOSWAMI AND DINO MOREA. The movie has "No Base". It's just like this ... Dino and Udita are married and live in a rich mansion. However, Dino doesn't like Udita in the heart because she only wants her wealth. She loves someone else (Tara Sharma). So he bribes Emraan to have an affair with Uditou so that he could catch them and eventually break up with Udita .. How BORING !! But Emraan falls in love with Udita and vice versa. Finally, when Udita imprisoned her for killing Emran, Dino pretends to save her to show her her false love. On the other hand, a dog does not understand it and feels that he really loved her. So he lends Dina his entire wealth. Finally, Dino comes out of the police station and goes with Tara with all the wealth. What a scam! The song is good and there is a good thing in the movie. Now there are individual ratings: (outside 5) Emraan: * * Udita: * 1/2 Dino: * 1/2 Overall: * 1/2 Direction: * * Story: * Music: * * * 1/2 Final rating: * 1/2 Bad performances and bad casting ....... Music: Good ... I rate the movie: 1.5 / 10 (Don't waste your time !!!!)
