Of the thousands of movies I've seen so far, it's the first to make me think about the expression "useless talents". I've never seen so many great actors doing such a terrible performance (Frédéric Pierrot, Elsa Zylberstein and so on). "Aging" makeup is pretty terrible, and to make it worse, it shines widely. The use of music (eg Love at first glance for a young camp assistant) is sometimes so caricature that I felt that most viewers around me smiled awkwardly. Meanwhile, Antoine de Caunes was quite a good actor, but see this one and "les morsures de l'aube" I think he should start considering finish. Antoine, give up the master balantree project; I doubt you deserve it.
