I noticed that the IMDB didn't offer any conspiracy information ... because it's not possible without it being ugly and disgusting ... because it's this movie ... VILLA AND DISGUSTING !! I watched it because I am a humorous fan of Chris Noth, whom I met personally and is a great guy ... but when I meet him again, I will have no doubt about asking him anything it made him play something so horrible. Playing a former child miracle that is now a great doctor who spends his free time running through little kids with a car, with the intent of mutilation and mutilation is ... it's not a "spoiler" because all this is done very clear from the beginning ... pretty nasty? Oh, that's better ... he's being manipulated to do his incest sister who threatens to get him a sexual favor if their last victim doesn't die ... even Clive Barker couldn't write anything so nasty. If you want to see Chris Noth worthy of his talent, rent "Teddy Roosevelt and The Roughriders"
