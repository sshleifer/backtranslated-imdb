I'll never go to another Tarantino movie again. The whole movie was worthless. My wife and I regret that we did not get up and at the first sign of what the movie really will be (which is still difficult to determine because it was so ridiculous ... blood, guts and violence seemed to be the only one real topic), but we still hoped to buy something around the corner. Unfortunately there was nothing to make sense! We, along with lots of other people in the audience, came out of the mumble theater "it was disgusting", "what a waste of time", "I had to go out", "where was comedy", "it was pathetic", etc. the audience, the voice of our disgust and the feeling that we were just thoroughly ripped off. The only thing he deserved in the film was the costumes and acting ability of almost everyone in the movie... there's no 0. I can't quite understand how anyone could rate it higher than 0!
