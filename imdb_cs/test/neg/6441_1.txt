Eastenders left the entire circle of unjustifiable in 1985 to be absolutely abysmal. It's such a bad reflection of the nation that this crap tops rating. The ideas for land can consist of nothing more trivial than putting sometimes the name of a name in a hat. The first two out (regardless of their gender) will sleep with each other, the third and fourth will fight in Vic, the 5th will be arrested, 6. develop addiction, 7. get pregnant, etc. Etc. However, manufacturers are smart. The 30-minute show is actually actually made up of 3 lines. 1) Someone will walk in Vic and say "What's going on?" 2) Someone else stands up and says, "let it aht" (out) 3) Then the woman tells "Doan choo come to ere 'n' insult mah fam'ly" <br /> <br /> That's it. That's every show. Except for the occasional "Get it sort-id / Is sort-id?" The show was once a realistic depiction of the East End folk and its way of life.

Ross Kemp, Martin Kemp, list is endless. How long does the marriage of the longest couple last, are they faithful to each other? Yes, people will leave, but until the writers realize that the characters, the couple may be interesting and sympathetic without sleeping in the show, it will continue to deteriorate. The episode last week had a 3 separate plot exactly that. And Zoe and the Doctor even Lofts & 'Shell' like 'The Most Unconvincing Couple Ever appeared on TV.' Yes, Eastenders is the most watched show, it's undisputed. However, many external factors contribute to this. 19.30 / 20.00 is a perfect time of day to get as many viewers as possible, has two hours, and more than millions of viewers watch it, beyond nothing but habit, but if they were totally honest with themselves, they would admit (in 2002, more than at other times it can be totally pitiful.
