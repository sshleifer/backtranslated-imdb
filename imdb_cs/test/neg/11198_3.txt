I went to Crooked Earth to see a piece of New Zealand. What I found was poorly written and poorly echoed by the people I know. <br /> <br /> Great moments between characters? including many of Temuera Morrison and Lawrences Makoares scenes together? they were often destroyed by long and ugly monologues that the actors were forced to stumble. Beautiful and badly falling phrases emerged from Lawrence, as if it were the new Maori Messiah on their pulpit of beer crates. When watching a movie with Maori actors, I found out that I can always take half a dozen characters to remind me of someone in my life. With Crooked Earth, I was trying to find one key character that spoke for two hours. Most ?? including Wire and Peek? blow up or do things I didn't understand and couldn't connect with them. By the end of the film the writer succeeded in alienating the audience where the Maori were not able to relate to it, and Pakeha was therefore given permission to release it. My feeling is that movies report ??? or at least a major of the few who were lobbying the audience? it is important enough to avoid the use of character limbs. Unfortunately, no one who had read the script before it was filmed thought he should give this advice. The soundtrack was invasive and as irritating as the horrible bing-bong noise they'd made through `Eyes Wide Shut '. Viewers weren't so gently auto-cued laughing, crying, or getting angry when the music changed. It reminded me of the input music of Darth Vader in Star Wars: obvious and slightly amusing. I think there are some people who could enjoy this movie. It's funny in parts, has a fair amount of events and has really powerful scenes. Calvin Tuteao and Quentin Hita also worked. As a whole, however, I did not enjoy this experience as I had. Barb Wire, Speed ​​2, Dr Moreau Island and Crooked Earth seem to be the Top Quartet of Crap.
