This final "airport" franchise payment was so unbelievably terrible that it took me a while to realize it wasn't a slapstick like "Airplane". George Kennedy fired a light gun from the open window to divert the heat-seeking rockets. What would happen to your hand if you held it at two speeds? You'd lose your grip on your gun and your broken arm. Passengers were unintentionally cheerful, as was the interior of the aircraft. Sophisticated French woman coming to George Kennedy's freedom was like Jackie Kennedy, who comes to Ernest Borgnin. It will not happen. Susan Blakely, a talented and unappreciated actress, received no points for her CV. Not even Robert Wagner. This movie was so bad that it looked unreal.
