If you are one of those people who don't like Sci-Fi because of their sometimes appealing ideas and unbelievable world perspectives, stay away from Stuart Gordon's Space Truckers! It is a truly absurd space adventure, filled with eccentric figures, colorful kitsch and ridiculous conspiracy. I would never be honest about this film at all if it wasn't for credits on Gordon's name. This guy is coming to be a genius in a horror genre, with undeniable milestones like? From Beyond 'and ?? It seems Stuart Gordon likes his humor as much as possible! He once completely overcame a comedy-top (with Re-Animator), but with a slight difference that bizarre humor was effective there. Something that is not really for Space Truckers - most gags go nowhere and the totally exaggerated atmosphere works only in small doses. Finally, all that is left is sometimes a fun but utterly useless mess. Dennis Hopper and Charles Dance (or at least the semi-finals of Charles Dance) are always happy to look and still stunning Barbara Crampton has a small role near the end of the movie. Crampton was a regular hero of Stuart Gordon in previous horror movies. The story of Space Truckers is as stupid as they are. Dennis Hopper plays a self-service loner who is busy. Who wouldn't be carrying pigs across the galaxy for a company called Interpork? He sees his change running away and bringing his muse to the ground. They float into space pirates and find their cargo to destroy half of the universe! Stuart Gordon wisely returned to the horror of this little escapade. Since Space Truckers, he has already done a noble `King of Ants 'and absolutely brilliant` Dagon'
