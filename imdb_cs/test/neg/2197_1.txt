We can say that there are 10 types of people in this world. Those who understand binary and those who do not. Those who understand binary have brought this film to the grave along with the hackers, while those who enjoy the movie do not. Sometimes. For the film, try to be a modern film with fiction on it. That failed. Terribly. Only 11 years old and below can enjoy and only 30 years or more could worry that their identity would be accepted. Losing the main market for selling value (watching it now is more boring than when it was first released).
