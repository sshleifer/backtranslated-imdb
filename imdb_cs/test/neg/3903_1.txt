The only reason I rented the movie was to see Jeri Ryan in it! OMG was the most boring movie I've ever seen !!! HOW LAME !!! Really, give me a break! After Voyager I would have hoped to be offered better roles !! That's just a bad movie !! The thing about the Indian tribe, and how it compared every 10 seconds, really got old. Poor Jeri, next luck!
