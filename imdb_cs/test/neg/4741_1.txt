Ed Wood rolled over in his grave. For the price of this waste, he could have done a hundred cult classics. The worst memory scenario (doing "X-Men 3" spark like "Citizen Kane"); most amateur directing; pre-K cinematography; the most skillful "special effects" (I'm talking about the "fifth 13" continuation of the territory); and throw in a nonsensical, rebellious, deeply disturbed maternal sequence. The lack of any talent or sensitivity that wastes on the screen is astounding. The fact that "industry" could reward anyone involved in this cluster should be the cause of a serious alarm.
