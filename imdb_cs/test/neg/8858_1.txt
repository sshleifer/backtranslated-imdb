If you watched Pulp Fiction, you don't see this movie. This movie is not funny. This is the worst parody ever. This is a bad attempt to parody movies. The cast is bad. The movie is bad. This is one of the worst pictures ever created. <br /> <br /> I don't recommend Plump Fiction. I prefer the original Pulp Fiction from the great Quentin Tarantino. This is one of the worst parody movies ever made. Plump Fiction is not a good movie. It's not funny. It's so stupid and vulgar.
