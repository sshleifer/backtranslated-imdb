This film is a collage of gangster clich√©s. Writing is a degree of z and the storyline and story are constructed without care or logic. It's a messy pastiche of stereotypical gangsters (I think of Bugs Bunny cartoons) and silly support characters (doctor and writer). There are much better Bogart movies out there. In fact, Bogart seems to have slept through this performance. He puts very little effort into this character. I think the directorial board he received was something like "He's a bad guy. This guy is the equivalent of Darth Vader's era, obvious, evil and anti-hero.
