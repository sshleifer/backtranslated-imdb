I have long been a fan of carpenters, I have read a resume, watched specials and saw the story of Karen Carpenter Story. This movie really didn't show the real Karen Carpenter. She seems shy and very lonely in the film (except for one girlfriend). The real Karen Carpenter was very different. She was outgoing and friendly. She had a lot of friends, especially Olive Newton-John. The film does not even show Karen's attempts at a solo album and her meeting with Phil Ramone and his wife Itchy "Karen". Itchy knew the real Karen Carpenter in New York. When Karen was in New York, she saw a psychologist, but she was voluntary and once a day and then went to the hotel room. Karen also uses thyroid-boosting pills to lose weight but stop taking them because the psychologist did not recommend her. Also, Karen's husband in the film is named Bob Knight, but in real life was named Tom Burris. Karen also did not divorce with Tom, but only separately. Karen was to sign the divorce on the day she died. Also, Agnes found Karen naked in the closet, unlike the movie where she was dressed in white. The music was very good. That was the only thing I would recommend to see.
