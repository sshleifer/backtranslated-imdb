Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen) brings a group of people to the mountain to help find her missing daughter (Erica Durance). What they don't know is that she was killed by the sasquatch (Taras Kostyuk) and still there ... waiting for them. <br /> <br /> It was late at night when I discovered it on my DVD player. I really wish I came back in time and stopped me. Most people will tell you that movies like "House of the Dead" or "S.I.C.K: Serial Insain Clown Killers" will be movies you never saw. Poorly. It will. I've seen a lot of bullshit, but this is the only bullshit that haunts me. How I wish I never saw it! Negotiations are not so bad. It's just writing and directing and pacing and everything! I'm actually a fan of Sasquatch movies. But not this one. Please listen to my warnings. Don't look at it!
