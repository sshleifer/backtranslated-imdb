Talk about drilling-snoring. This three-speed cycle movie put me to sleep as soon as the initial credits appeared on the screen. It is a pity that the cast included many fine actors, among them George Kennedy, Karen Black, Leo Gordon, Richard Lynch, Lance Henriksen and William Forsythe. Western Classics' takeoff, High Noon, is basically the story of a former US Army Green Beret (Henriksen) trying to get someone to help him get rid of one horse town of a ghostly cycling gang. <br /> <br /> Everyone is trying, but the script is at elementary school level. Sad to see the Academy Award winner Kennedy in such a comedy from his out-stood performance in Cool Hand Luke. <br /> <br /> If you have problems sleeping at night, it would be a perfect video video to rent .......... you will sleep in no time!
