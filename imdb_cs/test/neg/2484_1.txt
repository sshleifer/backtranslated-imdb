Please gwen stick to your pretty pop videos with your jap posse and not offend the british with your efforts as an actress. I went back to work in the working class anyway, and I was thinking about God, I could do it. but yeah i remember working till i am 65 years old if i live so long and you put your feet up to a girl with royalty every three months, pah you marry money okay xxx
