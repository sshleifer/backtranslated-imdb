The "Danish Bladerunner" is boldly presented on the box. Are you kidding me?! This movie is a full drag. When I am thirsty and go to the soda in the kitchen, I usually stop vcr, so I don't miss anything. Not this time. Actually, I found myself long and hard in the fridge, so I didn't have to go back. Why the hell isn't ONE sciencefiction-screenwriter who has unclear guidance on how computers work? It's overwhelming. One of the movie space is that our hero (who is a hacker) has a little computerassistant to help him (Microsoft Office paperclip finally captured in the future). When he loses an assistant in the film, he is helpless and cannot get into any computer. It's HACKER! It's like saying you can't drive your car if you're not lucky. I will not even go into a lightning-fast effect when she gets electroshock ...
