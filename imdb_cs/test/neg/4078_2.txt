This movie is definitely there with the worst movies I've ever seen, probably in my top 5 movies. I laughed once and that was when: <br /> <br /> EVAN: "im building something" Evan's secretary: "Hope his barber shop" <br /> <br /> That was literally the only time I was laughing in this 'comedy', terrible compared to the almighty Bruce, who as a great fan of Jim Carrey ... wasn't so great! This film lacked humor to have God's power and was more about family bonding. Id sort only as a family movie, definitely not a family comedy. The sight of a poo bird on one's shirt is not merry, nor the beard that grows back instantly! I didn't even think the special effects were great, the animals looked really stuck, it was like watching a movie that wasn't "glued" together correctly <br /> <br /> 2/10 movie - avoid!
