not really, im not kidding people here, and i can't believe how many people here gave really really positive reviews! oh wait, his IMDB comments section, stupid me. It is interesting to note that there were not enough votes on this date to get a rating of ten, but there are dozens of comments on the film. what does it mean? the scenario is still terrible. the character changes their personality and motivation and actions each scene, so that the film runs on something that vaguely resembled the pace. it wasn't even stupid behavior that was there, but the pure idiot of the script exceeded any stupidity of the depicted characters. for example: karl does not obey the order because there are two dead bodies in the desert and "the killer is out there somewhere," so he forces everyone to travel 40kms to find the killer, disobey orders and search everyone. when a hero sees something ugly in the dark and warns Karl, Karl tells our hero to stop being an idiot and there is nothing there so everyone is home. another scene, he refuses to let it go and has to chase whatever it is. It's just a joke. Yes, the monster is very impressive, but the bullshit people say is just trying to cancel his interesting aspects, and predators and extraterrestrial rip off moments were very tiring. and the end ... end!?!?! Jesus .... the worst movie I saw in, and I saw a bug buster!
