OK, I could only find three reasons to consider this movie, which is worth considering with an extremely low budget. First there was Linnea Quigley and Rachel Carter. In fact, two of them gave me four good reasons to look and see how I did it. The only other reason to watch is that many of them were shot right on the road. Now I didn't know it in advance, but I saw the Orange County brand and said: Wow! it was shot in Florida. I was impressed by the memory of the past and the young guy's ancestors, but that was really. Killing a pumpkin man was rather lame, except for a cyclist. <br /> <br /> If you want to see Quigley and Carter, OK, but the return of the living dead will give more excitement.
