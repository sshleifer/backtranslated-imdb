Yeah, I did it to the end. It was pretty hard. Sometimes I wondered if there was even a director. Negotiations ... well, I don't know what to say. I thought the girl who played Emily was trying the best with a boring, sometimes shocked and sometimes predictable dialogue. I know it was a low budget, but hollow sound and lighting unfortunately made them look and look like a 100-minute audio cassette. I'm not even talking about the end ... <br /> <br /> Music was the best on film. he said, I don't recommend this movie to anyone. Even for lesbians who do not have many movies to watch overall, it is nothing to waste time on. If you're looking for a sad lesbian themed movie, check out Children's Hour, Lost and Delicate or High Art. They all leave depression and grimness, but in this process you will not have to suffer film hell.
