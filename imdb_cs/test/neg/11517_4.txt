When I saw this movie three years ago, I thought it was illustrated by the many features that appeared in Singapore in movie houses: slow moving, with little conspiracy and dialogue, depending on the composition of the film, to make it work. During that time, among local cinemas, the inability to appreciate "Be With Me" is equal to panning "Citizen Kane" or one of the late Ozu films. I have no idea how "Be With Me" has achieved such sacred heights in Singapore's cinematographic consciousness, but I always felt that the Khoo "12 Storeys" was a better movie, though the second movie was not a good cameraman like Adrian Tan, Khoo DP for "Be With Me". The "12-storey" has a story that is better connected with most Singapore players and has a bite, something that "is with me" is the inability of wistfulness does not. "Being with Me" is basically a barely interwoven trio of stories linked to Khoo and his screenwriter Wong Kim Hoh. He deals with security that falls in love with a girl he sees only at a distance; two girls in a horoerotic relationship; and the story of the deaf and blind Teresa Chan. "Be With Me" is very well shot by Tan, using Varicam camera. Film compositions are masterpieces. The film, almost completely silent, has no dialogue besides it. The characters move, not in a realistic way, but almost as if they were under the direction of the director, they almost always look at the screen and emulate: either loneliness or sadness. Unfortunately, the characters do not act against each other. This kind of film has been seen many times before: in Tsai Ming-liang movies, in Khoo Royston Tan's temple, "4:30" and elsewhere. Sadly, his ultra-slowness (basically a plot less) and the use of the lento piano soundtrack just don't tell me. To criticize "Be With Me" seems to be almost a negation of the inspiring story behind it, Teresa Chan, who is blind and deaf and yet lives in spite of all that fulfilling life, but I'm afraid this film for Nothing will do me much. I am willing to appeal to Chan's relentless and courageous march in life and to Tan's remarkable cinematography, but to better take the same subject with more meat (without two more boring and disturbing undercuts) try Werner Herzog's "Earth of Silence" and Darkness (1971).
