I recently watched this movie on The Sundance Channel and I was interested in it from the beginning. It seems, however, that he will forever go where he wants to go, and finally I felt a little cheated. In a nutshell, Noble Willingham (Walker, Texas Ranger fame) plays a boat salesman who starts getting bothered by a phone from a man claiming to be his son. According to the mysterious caller, Willingham has a dark, dirty little secret that affects his son, and he (son) reminds him. I won't spoil anything for anyone, but for me, three things kept me from enjoying this movie. One, the film has a more outrageous language than Goodfellas, Scarface, the Casino, and Glengarry Glen Ross combined. 99% of it is flown from Willingham itself. It didn't take long for them to carry me with four-letter words. Two, I just couldn't believe that someone would answer a phone that many times, especially when a person knows that the calling caller is on the other end of the line. No matter where Willingham is in the movie, be it at work, at home, in the restaurant, etc., the phone will ring and always answer that he "spews poison" on his son, and then hangs up ONLY HOW TO ANSWER WHEN KALLER BACK TO THIS SECONDS! How many of us do it? Now I realized that we probably do not have a movie if it does not respond, but I could not suspend distrust on this particular issue. Three, and that is the smallest of the criticisms, why is the director opposed to show us "Corndog Man" (a.k.a. / caller / son)? Most of the time it's just a redneck sounding voice on the other end of the phone. I could have lived with it if other things had fallen in place, but because it wasn't just one thing that could be turned on. I give the film credit for being a somewhat original idea and keeping my attention with tension from the start, but that's about it. You see it if it's only once. However, if you're like me, you'll say "Triple K Marine!" while sleeping for the night or two after watching.
