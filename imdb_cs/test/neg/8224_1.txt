OK, so I have to start this review by saying that I was really expecting to see this movie for months, I used to watch its trailer and I think it looked really cool .... little I knew the only great thing This turd-driven cliche was just his trailer. In the cinema I watched the first 3 shots of this movie, and although for myself "by no means this film is so bad, don't be an idiot, give it a shot! You've only seen 3 minutes while I turned in shame All those pictures showed .... get it .... guy with a poker face (because he doesn't feel anything .... it's deep) looking directly at the camera in the middle of the frame. his perfectly made bed (because he sleeps like a dead guy ... because he feels nothing), and his father is calling, saying, "John Garden State, I'm me, your father" .... but come on! more than a few movies to hate clichés like "me, your (insert parents)", how the hell am I reacting ?: "Oh, he's got a tough relationship with him" .... uh ... yeah, that's exactly what should I respond ... <br /> <br /> Man, this is a crappy movie ... <br /> <br /> Anyone continuing the film is learning about his friends, from whom EVERYTHING IS ALTERNATIVE EMO WALKING INDIA MOVIE CLICHÉ One of his acquaintances is a man working in a medieval Klingon themed restaurant (Bizarre Characters + Pop Culture = Your Standard American Indie Flick). Then we know it's Natalie Portman, who is a copy of Alissa Jones (from the movie that digs GS, Chasing Amy), Amelia and the young Eternal Suns ... you know, clever, original (not really), cultured, beautiful and ... in contact with her sexuality (!). He listens to the 70's band called The Shins and gives ... what? are they from this damn decade? So why does it sound like that? Oh, they have no personality, OK ..... so he puts a CD player in John Garden State and looks at her with a silly face (you know, love). As the song played, I heard his words saying, "You'll love this soundtrack, it's so alternative and cool, you'll love this movie, it will define you and your generation, even if it's an ideological photocopy of Breakfast Club, Ghost World and every other clever teen movie from the past 20 years, you'll drink coffee and read books you don't understand "... <br /> <br /> Until now, a really unoriginal sh! T starts to run out ... ... don't care if he dies in a plane crash (because he's already dead ... and he doesn't feel anything) and he gives us a knowing scene that was taken directly from an unknown movie called FIGHT CLUB! !!, it's a great scene, but, I mentioned that he appeared in the trailer? ....... then at some party, and only if you think this guy is really deep and asexual, he does it with bimbo .... so oh, he's not such an emotional zombie after all ... clever character development or just movie! everyone else is moving really fast speed ...... the idea of ​​a scene taken directly from an unknown movie called REQUIEM FROM DREAM! ...... just sh! tty, sh! tty film ... <br /> <br /> Then they encounter more eccentric (clichés, actually) characters and finally a character who lives next to a big hole in the ground. John Garden State says some crap like "good luck exploring your endless abyss" and he says ... and now I really wanted to choke, "you too" ............. and then we gently said that Neo is Jesus .... oh no, wait, it's from another stupid, obvious, repetitive, overrated and cliché piece of crap. Finally (finally!!), there will be some more stupidity and he will enter the big showdown warehouse to destroy the bombs: he must talk to his father, whom he has not seen in the last billions of years, because he (FINALLY COOL SPOILERS) killed his own mom. (you see, he killed his mom so he's also dead ....... and he doesn't feel anything ..... that is deep). Now I was really expecting only a smart and moving dialogue between my father and Magnolia's son ... but this is Garden State, so it's almost: -John Garden State: Father, I forgive you, you didn't do I don't know what you did when you were He has drugged me for millions of years, but I know you love me - Dumb director's dad: No! No!!!! I will say some simple things, because I am not so deep from a character like this whole movie so no !!!! -John Garden State: No dad, we have to get the reason we're the same individuals ..... I mean different individuals -Good director's father: No !!! No !!!! ............ OK, you convinced me. And he gets a girl (because he's not dead anymore, you know) and the movie ends and I go and eat a piece of chicken that does my day .... <br /> <br /> This movie made for trailers
