Synopsis: A child is not admitted to any university. He creates a "college" where he and his friends can party by using their maternity tuition money. Wow. Paean to ignorance. <br /> <br /> If you think we're fine, man, then this movie is for you. Next, you must understand that: <br /> <br /> 1. Children have everything inside - they just have to leave it. 2. Teaching really suppresses the innate creativity that everyone has been born with. 3. Someone else should pay to follow your passion. 4. 300 teenagers can live together in harmony if you remove these restrictive rules. 5. Extraordinary speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation. 6. If the Education Council allows you to open a "charter school" with "unconventional teaching techniques," it's because they have your best interests in your heart. (Not that they are willing to let low-school students end up with fast food.) This film is one of the comedy genres, Animal House. This follows the pattern quite close. But a novelty is a complete attack on higher education, not parody of bad elements. He lacks a sympathetic guru, a professor who embodies a useful part of university life. This lack of balance will weaken this film to the back of the stunt. It's so one-sided that I was wondering if it was an ironic self-assured takeover of the genre - about a minute. The film has no profound meaning, no layers, no introspection. It's as if they let some children who never went to class do what's natural. Naturally, the name of the school is: S ***. <br /> <br /> (I never thought I'd say it: Go see something with Will Farrell. His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated.)
