Yesterday I hired a DVD and above all it started wrong, it's a 4: 3 aspect ratio movie and it's getting worse, acting is so bad and the movie itself is predictable, I was happy to watch the movie and say to myself : This happens next and guess what happened? right ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good action boxing movie, don't watch this one end up disappointed with this low budget movie like I did. go and see Ali his way better!
