Ever since Paul Kersey missed real relatives to take revenge, the third installment of "Death Wish" returns to his return to New York to visit an old war friend. He comes only to find out that Brooklyn has completely turned into a crippled gangland and that juvenile criminals have killed their friend and constantly terrorized all the other tenants of a shabby apartment building. Kersey will make a deal with the local police commissioner, take over the heart of his blond lawyer, blow many villains with the impressive Wildey Magnum, and train and inspire fossilized New Yorkers to stand up for themselves. Okay, we can't defend "Death Wish" after seeing Part Three. The 1974 original was a masterpiece of social drama as well as retribution, and although it was pure exploitation, the second part still had relatively few redemptive qualities, and at least these events were logically linked to those that occurred. First. Number three often feels like a completely separate permit. Kersey doesn't seem to be an architect anymore, he's ten times more social and talkative than he once was, and suddenly nobody, not even the police, is against vigilance actions? All these changes and a few other aspects make it more than obvious that Michael Winner and Charles Bronson have reduced their "Death of Wish" success to a purely thoughtless and exploitative action series with the victim who has become with every episode, the armory that is becoming more and more Explosive and criminals who resist, slimmer, worse and much harder to kill. However, gentlemen did not realize that the continuous spitfire violence actually creates the opposite effect, extremely monotonous and much more boring than the previous two. I once read a brilliant review that referred to "Death Wish 3" as a pure definition of film masturbation. This description could not be more in place because the script is moving tiredly from one outrageous execution sequence to the next. Especially the last twenty minutes is a complete "orgy" of shooting, blasting, and executions made with improvised home measures. Yi-Haaa! This record in the series has quite an interesting support cast, including Martin Balsam ("Psycho", "12 Angry Men") as a neighborhood neighbor who holds machine guns in his closet, Ed Lauter ("Family Surface", "Longest Court") ") As a slightly unorthodox copper and even Alex Winter (from" Bill and Ted's Super Adventure! ") In his debut role as one of the Raiders.
