"Volcano" is at best B-movie and in the worst case it is more than a disaster it should display. To be fair, you have to be ready to suspend infidelity for one major concept in every movie. 'Volcano' asks you to suspend distrust of science, human interaction and common sense. Tommy Lee Jones becomes the proud hero of the Emergency Management Office in the 1990s. it is fine if it does not touch the stupid dialogue that the script provides. However, Anne Heche gives howling a poor performance as a clever ass geologist who becomes Roark's love interest (while the city burns, natch). Gaby Hoffman goes from Field of Dreams and US President to turn as a whining, needed, and victim-for-life daughter Jones. Don Cheadle sits in an office where he is really coooool and takes Jones's phone calls, doing his job, which Roark would actually do and should do. In any case, the film really begins to roll down when Heche's geological partner gets sucked into the lava vents as they break into metro lines. To pick up the speed when Jones begins to suggest that they use buses to flow lava flowing down the street, Heche geologist (who loves reciting everyone about geology science) are apparently forgotten the fact that lava is hot and it melts metal, and rock , and a dead bus is unlikely to have much effect. It really starts to suck when the film introduces Rodney King-like racial tension between two bad actors dressed as cops and an angry black man who can't understand why firefighters are busy with this big river of flowing lava. But hey, in the end, three of them will work together to build a K-rail dam that would stop the lava before eating in their neighborhood, even if the dam is in the wrong direction and the material used would not stop the lava anyway. Besides, K-rails are barely waterproof, but I think lava wouldn't think she could pierce her head with gaps, not when Tommy Lee Jones looks at it. Don't even get me in an early-evening car where the hot lava tunnel descends, but strangely, it's not too hot to try and rescue. all poisonous gases so everyone can breathe. It must be LA Lava, or Lava Lite. You know, it eats cars, but it's environmentally friendly. There are moments of a sheer camp that almost cares if it's supposed to be a comedy. For example, two security personnel wrapping Hieronymus Bosch images have a totally insignificant and fake conversation about weight, and in the end, not before the little boy Roark / Jones saved the note that everyone looks the same while covering the ashes before the storm breaks out and clears all - and then the sun comes out and Heche says something in the spirit of "aw, shucks, roark". 'Volcano' almost reaches the status of Battlefield Earth, but with the exception of Heche, no one approaches Travolt as badness and technical aspects are quite well done. If you're from the LA area as I am, it's a little funny to think of a lava flow that wipes out Wilshire Boulevard. I gave her three for the effects and a small amount of tension you'll get from it.
