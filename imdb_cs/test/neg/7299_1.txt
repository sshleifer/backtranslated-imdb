My home friend and I foolishly bought the "The Roller Blade Seven" video from our local second hand video store in the hope of finding a bad movie. This film is not even ridiculous, it is pathetically poor, worse than Jack Frost 2 - and it says something. Script, acting, production, stunts, sound, sets, everything is terrible. In some parts, the actors have not learned their lines and are recklessly ad-libbing, or in one case they actually have lines that are read from the set and simply repeat them. The film is set in an apocalyptic "bike zone" and the film seems to consist of about 45 minutes of film, many of which are edited poorly or repeatedly from different angles to make the film longer. This is very fast. The plot has no meaning at all (It is probably the amalgam of two books written by Scott Shaw), there are not even seven of them, most of them are not on the blade, they are wearing roller shoes and it seems to me that mainly the film was completely sold to reality there is about 3 minutes of female nudity. The writer and star Scott Shaw apparently likes some of the samurai and performs some very bad stunts throughout the movie. Despite everything, his website says that film should never be compared to traditional film, because it really pushes the boundaries of modern filmmaking. My home friend and I have been without a word all the time suffering, and despite my frequent attempts to burn a videotape, she decided it might be some kind of curse to be passed on. If you see video in stores, take it from me! Stay well!
