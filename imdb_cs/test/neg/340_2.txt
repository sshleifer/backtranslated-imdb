While this is a low budget, this movie might be worth watching if there was a story. It started pretty well, and quite engaging and believable. Actors and characters were interesting, though there were not many character developments. My favorite scene was when everyone ate their rations. Some hated it, and some thought it was not bad. The story starts very airtight. And then ... <br /> <br /> And then plunged into a little horror, which is usually a sentence of death for most sci fi. Suddenly no scientific basis for any of the happenings on. No real loyal game for criminals? No real explanation of what's going on. In general, if a movie has to use the word F for each additional word, it usually usually spirals out. I still like it or don't believe it. I often wonder what inspires people to do bad sci fi? Isn't there a universe of fantastically good stories? People do not feel that they are wasting their time and everyone else throwing it away. Why do we have this average sci fi? No female actors or characters? None at all? This resulted in another "predator", but unfortunately fell far away. <br /> <br /> My last comment - poor editing and ultimately too low a budget to build a real campfire? What does he give? <br /> <br /> My advice for all companies that produce sci fi movies. Make sure you have a good story before you start and adjust bad special effects - it's better we see nothing but something that looks fake or ridiculously fuzzy.
