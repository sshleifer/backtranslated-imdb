Television plans (in England, at the very least) are now crowded with home improvements, horse-hunting, home hunting and cooking shows in the afternoon. The chances of any of the terrestrial broadcasters killing a full unknown like this will take a few people. hours of screen time on a slow afternoon are slim, to say the least. But in the 1980s, the BBC did it and guess what I saw. And this is a testament to the astonishing strangeness of this Hungarian-American co-production, which I still remember big pieces twenty years later. At first, the title hero appears briefly during the opening titles, just to disappear for at least half an hour. (Imagine American TAIL re-edited, so Feivel is nowhere to be seen, and you will appreciate how confusing it is.) There's a totally bizarre piece of animation where one of the characters gets his elaborate waxed mustache modified and stretched, complete with boing the sound effect that causes the boss-eyed to go. Probably cheerful if you're stoned, but for the baby, quite disturbing. And when we talk about it, the infamous "hippo" scene is represented in an abstract way - clouds in vague hippopotamus shapes are struck by lightning - but it's still unpleasant. In fact, this film is quite cold and not evolving around the world, the sad state has barely helped the strange look of production, all the muddy colors, the fluctuating lines, the bloated forms, and this uniquely European bleakness reminiscent of Jan Svankmajer, just not so convincing. Then, to close it all, we get Osmond's songs! This is not so bad a movie as a deeply misleading, not as fantastic as a somewhat bad trip.
