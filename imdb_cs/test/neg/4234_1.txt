European movies can be slower and less conspiracy driven than American movies, but it takes too far. It also shows a lot of incompletely drawn characters who do inexplicable things. It's not a fantasy, it's not even surreal, it's just awkward and bad. <br /> <br /> What's this message? That people in France are thoughtful and staring? That they want to watch other people who have sex? Are they spontaneously screaming or touching the stranger's neck? When you see this movie, don't wear a watch because you will be amazed at how little it is explained or learned during the vast timescales. This is the story of a "police superintendent" who is deeply concerned about the brutal murder of a little girl, although in fact it seems to have been troubled before. He is not just angry with his own personal tragedy, but apparently mentally rather slow, he behaves very much like a six-year-old without teaching. He looks a lot, walks his arms like a small child, speaks in a humble, tense tone, behaves strangely in all his interactions (though no one seems to notice or care, even if it's a police business)). He is not a problem cop, rather an outpatient. Andy Kaufman's Latka character on Taxi, but without humor. He is not only believable as a policeman, but is not believable as an adult. That he won the prize for his character's interpretation is truly amazing - if he doesn't play a role exactly as it is written and the error lies on the strange things that wrote the thing. The land is clearly secondary. Do not expect to see at a distance what the police would do if a murdered girl were found. This is not so important, although the unlikely behavior is offensive. The problem is that even the rest of the film makes no sense. This leaves long-lasting shots of fields, vegetable gardens, people's faces, etc. The end has struck me as particularly ridiculous - totally unsupported by the events that led to it - unless you think, "What's the worst way the movie could end?" There's a lot of sex and nudity, which means something. Do you want vaginas? You'll see the vagina. Don't worry, it's art. It has a profound meaning that I'm not sure. And the protagonist, despite his innocent strangeness, seems to have some homoerotic neck or jowl fetish. Finally, the headlines are white and often appear on a white background - very difficult to read many of them. On the other hand, there is not much dialogue, so it's not a big deal. There is also very little sound in the film - not even the ambient sounds you would expect - in the film, which contributes to the emptiness of the experience. Old Woody Allen should parody this day. That is an award-winning movie, it's sad. I'd hate to see lost movies. <br /> <br /> Enjoy.
