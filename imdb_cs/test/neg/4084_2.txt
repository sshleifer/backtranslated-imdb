The only way I feel good when I hand over these precious minutes of my life is to tell someone every day how much it was. And even if I say it once a day, every day for the rest of my life, I will not fully realize my opinion. Just stupid. There is a difference in movies like this, and movies like elephant or fat boy go Nutzoid, two of my other least favorite movies. The last two were terrible, yes, but that was it. Evan Almighty has a strong cast and tries to kill them all. Wanda Sykes, Jonah Hill, John Goodman and Steve Carrell ... WHY GOD WHY! All these people have a much better talent, every time I see one of them, I'll think about this horrible movie. The only reason I gave this 2 instead of 1 was when I saw the movie there was an older mentally disabled woman who thought that the firing of bird shit and jokes caused by wounded tools in making jokes were so funny that she kept laughing all the time, almost wiped out several times.
