The film uses motifs that could be plagued by "Wait Until Dark" (1967), a much better film by Terence Young, starring Audrey Hepburn. "Dead Silent" is a pale paraphrase. There is nothing new - a hidden object in a doll, bad men who want it, a bad person who acts as a good person. However, the inability has shifted: Audrey Hepburn has not seen the child in the DS can not speak. But both stories relate to disability. Where "Wait Until Dark" has created an unbearable tension, "Dead Silent" allows you to estimate the outcome, the story is such a stereotype.
