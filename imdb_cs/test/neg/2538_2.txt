Anyone who pays to see Troma's movies knows and appreciates what they get. When I said it, I didn't think it was possible to make a film so badly and still be convincing. I found myself looking at just how much worse it could be before the end. First, it is an Indonesian action film with an American main character who looks and performs as a bastard son of "Taxi" Christopher Lloyd and Rambo. He always puts himself dressed as Sly's "Cobra" and even has his own shooting palette (with the cutouts of his biggest enemies) in Jakarta, even though he is in the CIA and just arrived a few days ago. There's a lot of action on weapons-play (no flashes on those M-16s, only sound effects), motorcycles (which run through the walls), karate (where no one makes physical contact) and even some sex (where all the actors are ugly). The main plot of this epic should be at least reasonably plausible, but not here. It is the most dangerous cartel in the world trying to find a drug detection facility. Why would they need it? It will never be revealed, why not kill dogs? It makes no sense, but it takes it seriously. Actors are to be praised because this film seemed to make them all famous and try to "act". Best line? "Now dance to your grave, you dirty bitch!" The best scene? Rambo jumps on a flying helicopter, pulls out a baddie machine gun, let's go, falls, shoots a helicopter when it falls, throws the chopper into the air, cuts into a dummy thrown into the water. F ** royal genius! If you can't appreciate the rubbish, don't look at it. If you can, it's amazing. One more thing I mentioned was the directing of three Punjabi brothers?
