Director Fabio Barreto received a strange Academy of Nomin for his latest film About Quatrilho. Quatrilho is a bad movie, but in Bella Donna Barreto has made one of the worst movies ever. His adaptation of the novel Riacho Doce is ridiculous. Think with me how poor Brazilian fishermen speak perfect English? They do in the movie. It's not a script, it's just a very long video with beautiful places and many sexual scenes with Moscovis and Henstridge.
