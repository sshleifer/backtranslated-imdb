Everyone has a choice for "the worst movie they've ever seen." Some like to choose Gigli or Battlefield Earth. Some selection on classics like Plan 9 from outside space. Since I was 14 years old, I was very loud when I said it was Problem Child 2, and nine years later I feel exactly the same. It's not "one of the worst", it's not just an expression. It's the CURRENT worst movie I've ever seen. <br /> <br /> How much can you wash, poop, urinate and puking in a single movie? I don't need to see a dog that gets to my waist! Why is it so hard? I have nothing against the bathroom or gross humor. Damn, I like American Pie movies. Having such a surplus within 90 minutes is a bad idea, but the real tipping point is to do with kids! Have small children call each other sexual names (IMDb won't let me write this message, but here it comes from the mouth of 8-year-olds. Think about the irony!) And urinate and puke on everyone else just makes the whole thing feel dirty. Worst line in the movie: "I think I should break more people in the office." What other film is it: peeing in a lemonade, dynamite stick exploding toilet, a little boy filming a babysitter who has sex and projecting him to the side of the house, and a little girl joking about scratching the testicles? However, my favorite moment must be when the same girl is on a carnival ride, saying, "I will vomit," opens her mouth, and a fake-looking curious shoots straight from an open mouth at a perfect 90 degree angle! The Scary Movie 2 murder scene looked more real. I suppose the only element in the film is Gilbert Gottfried. You get the impression that he doesn't have a script, but he's just his usual self. Too bad he must act stupid while the pizza gets thrown at him. <br /> <br /> You know what? Thinking about this movie making me go to the bathroom. Hi!
