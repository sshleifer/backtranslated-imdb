I recently went to the movies to see the new (2007) version of Bridge to Teribithia. Then I went to the library to rent an older version to see it again without paying. I must say, I was very disappointed! I found an older version that has terrible gameplay, as well as slanting lines including Jessie, who says, "I know, Dad, but I hurt so much inside" after Leslie dies. It was pretty pretty done and in my opinion it wasn't much better. I noticed in amazement when I said that they didn't think they would rework it. The story is great, but believe me, I'm spending money and seeing a new version, if you just see the old one, you'll never experience the true magic of Teribithia.
