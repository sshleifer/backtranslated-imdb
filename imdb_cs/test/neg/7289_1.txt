This film was horrible and it doesn't even deserve to be called a film. As I look at it, it's more like three average episodes of the Disney cartoon that are loosely linked together to create a single video that pretends to be the continuation of Atlantis' first movie, which was much better and more fun. And where do I start with the problems of this DVD? Story? Characters? Pictures / animations? For me, everyone is bad and unobservable. First, the story of this direct video DVD is ridiculous and meaningless. The only good thing about it is that it is consistent - that is, consistently bad, from start to finish. After the film, I still don't know why Milo came back and how these incidents occur in three small stories about each other or Atlantis itself. And all I remembered about this movie was how I felt after seeing it. The characters feel wooden and lack personality and the drawings look different than the first. You may say that they probably aren't from the same animators of the first. As the DVD played, I found myself less and less concerned about what could happen to the characters and that I hope the movie will end soon. In addition to the story and the above-mentioned characters, the image quality is too low in this, probably one of the worst in the products Disney has ever released. As a fan of the original Atlantis: the lost empire, I couldn't be more disappointed with Milo's return, which is a complete waste of time and money. Thank God I rented it first instead of buying it. Still, I wish I had never seen this crap or even its existence.
