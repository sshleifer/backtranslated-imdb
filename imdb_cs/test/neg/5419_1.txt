This film is BORING, BORING, BORING, BORING and BORING !!! It's not a worse movie I've ever seen, but on the contrary ... ... how do I put it ....... It's boring! There is some very nice scenery and some clever dry joke, but that's about it. If he was advertised as a travelogue, I would consider him 7, but it should be a film with a story, a drama, and a god for a thing or a satisfactory conclusion. I've read some of these comments on this album about this movie and I was wondering if they saw the same movie as me. <br /> <br /> Look at this movie (yawn) at your own risk ........ one thing for sure is properly rated = G RATING! (Most of which is worth BOHEMNY BORING!)
