I'm still trying to figure out what the aim of this movie is: 1) Whether to show how stupid, disordered, unprofessional and arrogant the police (I would certainly be able to add various adjectives here, but I think my opinion is clear). 2) Whether to show how a twisted-minded cheater who doesn't know what he wants from himself can create chaos. 3) Whether to show whether a persistent detective will solve the case only by asking the criminal for the same stupid question again and again until the criminal answers are answered? 4) Or was it just to show that 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called FILM? That was one of those movies that didn't disappoint me in a way. From the first 10 minutes I figured out that this film will not be nominated for Best Film Award and surprisingly enough? It was consistent all the time. Was it stupid enough to wait to see how stupid he would go on and finish? and I wasn't even disappointed there. Was it a complete pass of time? YES. What raises your question? Why did I watch it? Well, I was trying to fall asleep, and I thought it was a great candidate for it, but unfortunately I had too much coffee before?
