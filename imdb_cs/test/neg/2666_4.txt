Michael Myers, scared, not-so-young-psycho anymore, who seems to get a beefier with every appearance, is resurrected by his druid brothers to destroy more of the threat to his family members, and someone else who gets in the way. Gaps in logic seem to be ignored in favor of a healthy body count. Michael, who originally favored strangulation and kitchen knives, learns to swing an ax and use whatever means are necessary to get rid of his victims, resulting in a horrible, mosaic work, a movie of dollar deals that is virtually untouched by several truly spooky sequences. Donald Pleasance, who died shortly after production, seems to be simply inserted into the story, so * someone * could be charged as a star. You will not want to hide your eyes during this, but you will shake your head on the downward image of John Carpenter's classic creation.
