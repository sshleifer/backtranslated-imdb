Did Beavis and Butthead make this movie? It's just so bad. Really unequal and unfair display of "bad" vs. "good" in the wine world. You have noticed that the filmmaker is trying to try some of the wines from the protection of individual wines and terroires. Working with the camera is, at best, dizzy, while content can sleep until recently. It's not smart journalism. What I got from this film was that the filmmaker tried to point out the globalization of wine by showing, for example, that the Mondavi family owned wineries in all parts of the world. Well, that's a good start. So how do they compare these wines? They taste the Mondavi Napa cab as their Italian wines. We never found out because nobody in the movie said that. Instead, there are plenty of allusions to Nazi and fascism. Well, those things don't grow grapes. Hmmmm.
