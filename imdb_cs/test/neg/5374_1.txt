Initially I tuned in to Paranormal State because I (more or less) find a paranormal search genre to be an interesting TV if nothing else. I really like the Ghost Hunters because over half of their investigations lead to total debuning and find the Haunted Bridge to be hilarious with its use of media and tasteless British women with Paris Hilton's day-glo eyes fainting out of fear / demonic Presences All Shot In Beautiful Night Vision Green. Paranormal None of this appeal has any state. It feels like he's been tiled together by "leaders" that the Ghost Hunters have refused. The episodes ranged from trailer families and lonely mothers to adolescent emo adolescents who were sitting around and scared to "talk" to a 5 year old man about a monster who lives in his room (the monster goes to RAWRRR, we say). All these people call on the college to solve their problems. The whole show is about Ryan and his partner, his huge ego. He leads his group of doo-eyed coeds, except when the case is considered "too extreme" and instructs them to stay at the HAHAHA Hotel. Better leave it to professionals, ie. The unexcused comedy of this show is how trusting the participants are. Ryan spins his story of being hunted, followed, etc. by the Demon he first met when the Catholic Church accepted him to help him with the case. We regret, but the Catholic Church has people who can do it, they do not need a day shift manager on Quiznos to chip in at 2 cents. This show is terrible, shame on A&E for bankrolling This stupidity, trying to follow in the footsteps of some much better paranormal themes. It's almost unintentionally funny, except that Ryan is so arrogant and lacks charisma that watching the show long enough to ridicule is not worth the trouble.
