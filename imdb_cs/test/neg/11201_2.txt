Has it ever happened to you? I go to my local video store and see some news in the "film noir" section. I'll pick up a copy of the new arrival of a movie I never saw called NAKED ALIBI. It's one of those companies that offer mail-order video (mostly) "dupey" looking for copies hard to find titles. The description on the box sounds good. The film has players I like (Sterling Hayden, Gloria Grahame and Gene Barry). So I'll take him home and watch. About ten minutes into this movie I started to have second thoughts. About halfway through this movie, I didn't like it. At the time the movie was over, I hated him, despised him. The film opens with cops who have asked Al Willis on suspicion of robbery. Besides being a drunk, the police have nothing on it. When he pushes the cop and asks him to be allowed to go home, the cops beat him up. Detective Conroy arrives, lets the cops finish beating and then announces that Willis is fine. Willis swears to take revenge. Later, one of the police officers is shot dead. With no other evidence that Willis is "sore" about beating, Conroy make Willis his only suspect, despite the fact that his boss appoints a couple of gangsters as suspects. Conroy arrests him, but Willis is released for lack of evidence. The next day, two more cops kill a bomb. This time Conroy goes to the bakery that Willis owns and tries to beat him out. Conroy doesn't know, but a local journalist whose book has accused Conroys of police brutality will look at a picture of Conroy trying to strangle Willis and Conroy. But Conroy continues his efforts, and Willis flees to Mexico where Willis has a mistress. Conroy manages to persuade his lover (who Willis is dealing with brute behavior) to help him prove that Willis is a murderer. What this film lacks is a compelling scenario. The script looks like only a rough draft was written and the shooting started before the finished script was completed. Things happen, figures of celebrities change, plot plot does not appear for any other real reason than that script that requires it. In addition to the fact that Willis likes to drop the glass now and then, there is nothing in the early stages of the film that would make us think it was a crazy killer who cheats on his wife. He treats his wife well, his child and his employees. Soon in the movie, one gets the impression that his Conroy is the one whose free cannon is. It seems no doubt he approves of police brutality. Conroy, for no reason convinced from the very beginning Willis has a criminal history. It seems to be working on the motto of the old communist Bulgarian secret police; "Everyone is guilty of something we haven't learned yet." Later, Conroy shows kindness to Al's lover and young son, now we like him. Excuse me! The early impression I had with Conroy had stayed with me for too long. And he's a stupid cop. Only after being fired and leaving for Mexico, Willis runs a background check in the background and finds out that he is issuing an arrest warrant issued in Maryland. Why didn't he think about it before? Because this movie didn't use enough time. The cast is good. Gene Barry will think well about how badly his role as Al Willis is understood. I am a big fan of 40 and 50 years of criminal thrillers, but not only did I not think this movie was good, I didn't miss the bad taste in my mouth (something that many modern movies do, but rarely older movies).
