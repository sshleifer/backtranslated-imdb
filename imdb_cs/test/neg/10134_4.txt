Imagine being trapped inside a dark medieval museum and a resurrected vampire, and its manic sidekick chasing you. Where is the absolute last place you want to hide? I would say inside the mysterious virgin Nuremberg torture device because there is a great risk of being brutally cut to death. And yet, the older lady in this movie silently runs into her pointed coffin. "The Vampire's Coffin" is a somewhat unsatisfactory continuation, as director Fernando Méndez does not recreate the 1957 gothic atmosphere of the original, but emphasizes comic situations and dialogue. No more ominous castles with mysterious cobwebs and dark vaults, but confused doctors and clumsy assistants that provoke laughter instead of ghosts. The story opens inside the final resting place of Count de Lavud, where a dignified physician and a hired assistant steal a coffin to explore the corpse at a private clinic. Naturally, the wooden nail is removed from his heart and the number of vampires lives again and immediately enslaves the petty thief to his dirty work. The vampire has an eye on a beautiful patient at the clinic and is on Dr. Enrique Saldívar to save his soul and destroy the blood. "The Vampire's Coffin" uses a limited number of places and there are very few events. The whole movie would be really boring if it wasn't for some unforgettable sequences and decent acting performances. However, shooting is amazing with the amazing use of shadows and darkness. This is most notably during the scene in which Count de Lavud watches a young woman through the deserted streets of a small town at night. It's the only really valuable scene in the movie, the rest is quite average and déjà-vu.
