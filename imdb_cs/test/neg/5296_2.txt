I really wanted to like this movie. The previews looked marginally funny, but I thought they put most of the funny things in thumbnails. In this case, not only they did, but the clips were twisted to make them look more fun than in the real movie. I like John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Vince Vaughn, The Rock, Cedric The Entertainer, etc., So I wanted this movie, but it never seemed to do anything. <br /> <br /> I saw Get Shorty and did not care about it separately. Too slow and rude to me. This movie is definitely no better, and if anything, it's worse. There were plenty of opportunities for some good comedy moments, but none of them took it. Acting was fine, but John Travolta also seemed to have eased. Cedric was fine, but he was too ruled to be really funny. Vince Vaughn and Rock were pretty good and ready to be funny, but they let them all go. I wish they were given a chance to go through the funny things they set up, but instead they just went back to the same old thing and went back to making Vaughn and Rock funny (though they never let them really deliver) a punchline or comedy). Overall, it was a very unsatisfactory movie, and I'm glad I only saw it on video. At least it was cheaper than theater.
