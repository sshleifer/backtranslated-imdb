The Propaganda Pro-American War Effort movie that came out in 1942 has East Side Kids getting tough against any Japanese that spot in their own neighborhood when they learn they are too young to enroll. Finally, they learn that they were mistaken in their distrust of some individuals, but they also stumbled across the spy ring, which they then went to the bust. The film is harmless in its fashion, although some may be offensive because innocent Asians really got out during World War II. Overall, however, it is quite a general effort, and both Leo Gorcey and Huntz Hall would have better times, the best of which tend to come here when ad-lib.
