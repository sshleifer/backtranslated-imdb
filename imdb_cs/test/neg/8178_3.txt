What You Need In Running Up On 'What You Need', Every Episode, Because 'Lonely' Was A Winner To Some extent. This episode is the first major failure from 'Escape Clause'. Again, the Serling script is based on someone else's material, Lewis Padgett's story. As with "And When the Sky Was Opened", Serling's content changed dramatically, removing scientists and his machine and putting an older salesman. <br /> <br /> "What you need" works best when it's sweet. Opening half, in which the peddler provides customers at the bar with items they will need in the near future, has a subtle charm that can have worn thin throughout the episode but works well within the timeframe it is allotted. Unfortunately, the main plot he is preparing is full of holes. Steve Cochran's past performance as a double-bored thief becomes the main focus of the episode. Cochran's part is a subscribed stereotype and its flat performance highlights this deficiency. His exploitation of the old peddler is boring and predictable, and the revelation of murdering the old man is totally unconvincing, so the whole scene of slippery shoes seems to be completely false. Ernest Truex is good as a salesman, bringing a character to a magical, mysterious but warm edge, but not good enough to help humble writing. Worse, the weak script is also full of discrepancies. For example, we learn that the salesman's ability to provide people with what they need stems from the ability to see the future. So how exactly is it possible to produce a pen that magically selects the winning horses. It seems to be a little out of his sphere of power. Also, for a man who sees the future, the salesman is definitely surprised when a robber awaits him in his apartment. There are many other holes that can be selected in 'What You Need', but it's hardly worth it when the episode is so thin that you can see through it as well.
