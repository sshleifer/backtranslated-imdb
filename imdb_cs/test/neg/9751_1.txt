I really don't have a reason why all people are like "Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever !!!" It's a lot of junk! Negotiations are primarily ridiculous and we can't even start talking about dialogue because it was awful ... Films are supposed to be fun and let me be the first to say no * fun. I actually laughed because I was so embarrassed. Music and dance also did nothing for me. And what is Channing Tatum's zeal about all the girls talking about? It does not matter. The film was pathetic. Don't waste your time - or your money. If you're not a movie movie lunatic, but movies are not movies like that, they're jokes.
