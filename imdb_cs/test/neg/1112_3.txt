Bad little things have excellent synopsis: an empty house next to an abandoned mine in a forest with a tragic past; the family moves to the house and strange things happen; little spooky kids are starting to emerge here and there are scary little kids doing. But this is where cleverness and potential fun ends. This group of kids has been sealed in the mine for decades before, and now it seems to be moving in the woods (bad makeup) with weapons seeking meat to eat. Oh, I understand, this is a ghost-zombie movie. Hmmm ... while I can appreciate someone who is trying something new with this genre, it just didn't work. What was the children's motivation to look for? Why did they need weapons? Anyone else could imagine the filmmakers gathering around everyday giggling footage because they felt it would be a great movie? I found out that after thirty minutes I felt a familiar resignation that I had just wasted my time on another modern mess. While acting was good, as well as setting good quality cinematography, the script itself suffered from what seems to be a lack of knowledge of the supernatural horror genre together. A bunch of kids walking around the mall is more frightening than this pack of poorly masked rodents. This film is not scary, and although I respect the story, I may have enjoyed it, if I read it instead of watching it, I still have to say that Wicked Little Things is more precisely called Wicked Little Turd.
