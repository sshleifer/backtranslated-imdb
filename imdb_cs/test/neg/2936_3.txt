The basic premise of this film is that everyone in the world can know that a person is gay, except that person. And that a person who likes to show a tune has a good taste and is elegant in appearance MUST be homosexual. Yes, the movie is funny, but the basic assumption is homophobic and offensive that the whole movie is falling apart into something that is quite painful to sit. The performances, especially Joan Cusak and Kevin Kline, are very good.
