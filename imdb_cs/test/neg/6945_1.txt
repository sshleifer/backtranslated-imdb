This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. They said it was the man's answer to Waiting for Exhale ... All I can tell you is that we didn't really answer at all. I couldn't believe it was actually done. The director should choose a different profession because he can't make a film. The script wasn't good. It didn't make sense and was very chaotic. Betting movies are much better than they were, and I was terribly disappointed when I saw the talented actor Terrence in this bad movie excuse. If I could put my hands back on time, I wouldn't go back to Media Play to buy a movie, just leave it wrapped on a shelf instead of wasting time.
