Oh dear. this was probably the worst movie I've ever seen in years. I mean, what more can I do with the old story of "woman inside the body"? It was full of clich√©s, eg nerd coming into his own succession, "kid" getting what comes to him etc im not calling these spoilers because someone could guess what happens !! All it was about was Laura Fraser, who gave average performance. and as for the "dream" of the boy, it was the wettest piece of acting ever. Even the bad guys were forgotten immediately. horrible movie.
