I went into this movie full of hope. With so many capable and witty actors led by Sir Ben, I thought it would be a little honor. Oh, how I felt like my eyes looked like the credits were rolling. That I missed 93 minutes of my life this movie, which was clearly DOA. There are some real problems with this movie and it will probably be easier to list them; 1. No jokes, I'm not particularly fond of comedic - high or low eyebrows - but there's no really one laugh in this movie. 2. Sir Ben mumbles every line to be drunk or not?!? 3. There is no attempt to begin let alone develop a relationship between the interests of love in this. 2 people who accidentally encounter each other would have more information immediately. 4. All the acting talent that is compiled is totally useless. Don't be fooled when you watch it for names. 5. For a cold ass-man who hit more people in Gandhi than this fading waste of time (depending on how the colored beard looks really scary) I was hoping it was a slow burner, but eventually the only thing that could inject. Any life - and justice - is Frank, who pulled 9 and threw away the entire cast, starting with tea and ending with himself - I'm sorry it was so bad.
