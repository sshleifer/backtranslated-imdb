I should have realized that every two video files sold for just $ 6 was bad. I even read the reviews before I looked at this movie and it hasn't happened to me yet. I loved the book, and I knew it couldn't be as bad as people said. Yeah, that's it. The mosaic of film, video and what appears to be stock footage combine to make a three-hour tour of one chapter by James A. Michener's epic novel. The good time it covered was one chapter, but I don't remember the many situations that actually occur in the book. Packing on my copy of the film gives Maria Conchita Alonso the highest billing - even though she is only in one spoken scene. On the second tape. Actors are to be commended for playing their roles well, despite the grim and revised scenario. However, they are to be insulted to take on roles first.
