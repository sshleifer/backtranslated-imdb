I remember the bomb that came out in the early 1980s. At first it sounded like a great idea. American classics ads with the help of modern day film techniques. There was a bit of back lash over the treatment of the original "Lone ranger", Clayton Moore. The film studio threatened legal action if Moore continued to display it as a real lone ranger. (Moore appeared in children's hospitals as Lone Ranger for Sick Children.) For many Americans, Clayton Moore was just that; the only one guard. I always felt that a studio could do justice to fans and a lone guard's legacy if Moore were treated better. Maybe a portrait in a new movie. As was not the case, and many of the watched public remained in horror. The story and the acting were also weak. All this was complemented by a big bomb at the box office, right. Personally, I am glad that the studio lost big money after the real Lone Ranger was treated. This is not how you treat an American icon.
