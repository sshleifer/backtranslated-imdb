If there's one thing I want to distinguish from all the other big reviewers, it's that I'm queen looking for strange movies in savings and dollar deals. That means you can't imagine how happy I was when I found this one. I even remember that on Saturday morning, when every station listens to it, you were trapped when you wanted to watch something else (then again, I think it was an idea). As a child, I didn't know if I liked how all the different characters were stuck together (there are some crossovers they just won't do). But I think that strange has its intended effect. Don't do drugs because you'll have nightmares about the Muppets. Now, as you watch it as an adult, you'll be treated with a strange drug movie. this side "Reefer Madness". I think I'll leave it before I get in trouble.
