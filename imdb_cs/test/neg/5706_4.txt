Before I start, let me get something from my chest: I'm a huge fan of John Eyres' first movie PROJECT: SHADOWCHASER. The film, the B-degree cross as TERMINATOR & DIE HARD, may not be the work of a film genius, but is an extremely entertaining action film that has become a cult hit. Referee and jury starts with Joseph Meeker, a convicted murderer who was sent to Death Row after his capture of the so-called "bloody gunfight" (which appears to be a bad name for a killer spree kills three people while There is a fun scene where Meeker talks to a priest about life for sex but to meet his one true love (who was killed during a firefight), expressing his revenge for the person who killed her? a faded football star who spends his days watching his son Alexa practicing football with his high school team (and ends up harassing his son's coach), but as soon as Meeker is executed, he returns as revenge (or as Kelly Perine calls "hamburger without fries") whose sole purpose is to get his revenge, which basically means that Silvana's life is misery. <br /> <br /> Let me stress that the referee and the jury is not a real horror movie, it is a supernatural action movie where Meeker pursues Silvano and uses his ability to change form (which means David Keith dresses like everything from Elvis impersonator, a French chef (with a bad as bad as his mustache), queen, clown & stand-up comedian), shotgun that fires explosive rounds and invulnerability to death (though it doesn't stop Martin Kove from shooting Keith with Desert Eagle), paying Silvano back for killing Meeker's wife. Br /> <br /> Director John Eyres is not interested in characteristics but instead focuses on action scenes that have a lot of film. But this is a major film error because the action scenes are not linked. Acting is surprisingly good because Keith brings the best performance, supported by Kove, as well as Paul Koslo, who plays pretty well. Kelly Perine is uncomfortable with the cab trying to help, but the situation is worse.
