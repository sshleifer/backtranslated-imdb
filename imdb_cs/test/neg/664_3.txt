Another movie with a star of the match. So far I've noticed .... wrestlers can't act on the movie screen. This film is no exception. The action is terrible. He does that by laughing at what they say, and they can't be serious, trying to act fear, but they fail and look stupid. Acting is terrible, maybe from a bad director. The storyline was stupid .... Only some people get to the hotel because they are criminals, and they accidentally kill themselves. The movie is stupid all the way, making it one of the worst I've ever seen. The only thought and that's why I give it 3 and not 1 is because of the journey Jacob Good Night Dies. The pole through his head and the stories about him, how it drowned, was amazing. Overall, it's a really horrible movie and you shouldn't waste your time with it.
