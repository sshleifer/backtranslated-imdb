I was a little old for this show I was 6 when it came out for the first time. First, when I was a small child, there were a few children's shows that were on the sesame street that I was watching and where I was learning from them, but other than that. My cousins ​​were born a few years after I was 7 years old was the first to come second. Barney was a big part of what they were watching. When I first saw this show, I told my grandmother how she would do nothing, she just used magic to fix everything. At that time I had 9, how many 9 years have an idea of ​​what is actually going on with the TV show. More and more I have seen or heard what Barney's teachings are getting more and more what I told people how bad the show was. The funny thing is that my parents had a small child in the mid-1980s, which I was by the way. They agreed and said the same as me. The sad thing is that my cousins ​​are 13 years old and still agree with what they saw. It's not cheating his creative, it's not the right to think differently than what someone tells you. Its o.k to steal if a person wont find out or mind that she's gone. Let's be honest with you, Barney's out to teach nothing. The more charming the program, the more children will be observing the observation. Children are stupid not because they are not educated, but they just don't know anything better, the other Barney took the show and the parents bought it. I never believed that television could affect people as Barney does. If you have a small child to read to them to watch a show that teaches them numbers, don't get involved in this show. Barney's like smoking once is a lot, smoking a couple and your addict letting your baby watch this show are addicted and one day their kids will watch the same crap and buy the same crap you bought
