The nest is really just another "nature run amock" horror flick that fails because of the low budget. Acting is fine and the setting is great, but the whole movie seemed a little boring to me. Gore effects are not the best I have seen, but they are fun in a shabby way. The cockroaches themselves are just common cockroaches that bite people. The nest reminded me of a much better film called Slugs. If you liked The Nest, then Slugs is a must-see to see how it's ten times better. It is also worth noting that Lisa Langlois, who plays Elizabeth, was in another "run run amock" movie called Deadly Eyes ("The Rats"), which is about killer rats as you might have guessed. <br /> <br /> If you like these types of horror movies, then you'll want to give it a watch, but you should be far better off seeing Slugs, which is much more interesting and bloody.
