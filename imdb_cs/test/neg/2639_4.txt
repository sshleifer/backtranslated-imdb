A typical story of a bad guy who goes after people. I believe that Antonio Fargas (Huggy Bear on "Starsky and Hutch") and Vincent Schiavelli did not want to emphasize this waste on their resumes (actually Schiavelli left this life with a mostly good biography). Sometimes I wish murderers in these movies to go after idiots who decide that every second month we need a new movie (note: this note is not to be taken seriously;). Anyway, it's one movie you can best avoid. It is ninety minutes to two hours that I will never return.
