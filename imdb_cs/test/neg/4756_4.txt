I love movies B, but I was happy to realize from the beginning that I was watching one. I can't believe anyone could spoil a film about aliens and predators so bad. Foreigners and predators are amazing. This movie made them a big joke. The filmmakers did not take this film seriously at all. I am really disappointed with how Strauss jerked this movie. They made a mockery of amazing characters. It's as if they were trying to be serious at first, then their writers got high and surrendered. Almost nothing was continuous, the main characters were terrible and were not aliens or predators. I'm so ridiculously sad that nobody accepts Alien and Predators anymore. These characters are icons of American pop culture, and the creators of this film have shown no respect for original films. They should not be allowed money for the names of previous films and should be ashamed of themselves
