I haven't been too old for a long time - or I've seen a movie that's so idle! Talk about it so badly that I laughed! First, I estimate that about 40% of the length of the movie I couldn't tell what was going on, or even what I saw. I can only describe camera work as a frenetic LSD compliant. There are whole segments, minutes, where all you can see are blinking flashes and fragments of a cave wall, people and various other unidentifiable things. I spent half of the film asking my teenage daughters what was going on, but they couldn't follow him better than I did. Then there are the "black" moments when everyone is trying to frighten us (woooooooo) and the screen turns black - and I don't mean just a few seconds. I think it took almost two minutes for the longest. I think an empty movie is one way to cut costs ... <br /> <br /> I believe the "director" recently read a book about all the "must-do" making scary movie, and decided to throw it out all in - about 20 times each. There are three good things on this movie: 1 / It is short for 90 minutes (even if it is an hour and a half too long!) 2 / All characters are dying (after all, you can't take care of them) . 3 / There was one really good scene - when the group looked at the shaft they came down, after finding that their rope had fallen to the bottom (seeing it coming), a large boulder was pushed through the hole to seal them. I expect it and it was really cool. And what about the early scenes of a campfire with a shot, after a shot, after a shot from behind the camp lights. I swear the director used almost the same shot about 20 times in 5 minutes. And I'm sure that after the first kill, the same trace of blood is used on the floor of the cave. 90 seconds. <br /> <br /> All in all, CRAP is a piece of film. I'll watch almost anything, but that's near where I draw a line.
