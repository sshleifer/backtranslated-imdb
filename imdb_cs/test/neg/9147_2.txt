This version of "The Magic Flute" is not just the worst production of Mozart's great opera I have ever seen, but it's also the worst video production I've ever seen on an opera. a great opera fan and I have more operas on DVD than movies. The sets are cheap and cheese. Papageno doesn't even have a bird costume. He's just dressed like a guy. The sound is in mono. The color is really bad. It is saturated with orange. Most DVDs from this period have a digitally restored color but have not bothered with this. The language was changed to Swedish instead of the original German. <br /> <br /> It's not a movie version of "The Magic Flute". It's a movie show and it's not a good performance and it wasn't shot very well. You can choose another available DVD of this opera and guarantee it will be better than this. My preference is for the version run by James Levine with the scenes of David Hockney.
