Can Liberals like Alec Baldwin not get over the head of their elections in 2000 and 2004? Ridiculous. lame swipes at WalMart, non-trade union workers, George W Bush and the stock market not to mention the deliberate GWB accent that Balwin's character use in the movie just makes him look silly and bitter on the screen. As credits roll sour grapes continue as "Special Thanksgiving" are given to Ken Lay, and other CEOs from Enron, Tyco, WorldCom, and IMClone. Let me put you in something - if you put all your money in one company, you are IDIOT. We don't need this apology for a movie that tells us. What is the loss of Jim Carrey's talent - I was expecting a completely different film from the trailer - what I got was 90 minutes of commercial advertising on DNC on how to scare people not to invest in their own future, keep them silly and keep them dependent to the government. No wonder Hollywood is in trouble and can no longer make a decent movie - maybe you could get an original idea and put it on the screen once ... though I shouldn't be surprised because Jane Fonda was cast in the original.
