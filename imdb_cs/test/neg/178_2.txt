I don't understand why this film has received such good marks from critics - - I have seen dozens of documentaries (on TV) about the world of wine, which was much better when (when) watching it, think of two very annoying aspects of mondovino: first, filming he's just awful and horrible and upset: it seemed to me that the guy behind the camera just received the material and played with it: a lot of zooming (without any other purpose than pressing a button) in / out) - for example - I almost stopped watching Because it! secondly, the interviewer (the director thinks) is not really relevant: he looks like and asks questions like a scout, not a journalist, even though the general idea and topics would be interesting, too bad a conclusion: an overrated document, maybe just for boys who wine knows nothing => not recommended at all (2/10)
