While I'm a Heather Thomas fan and I have a few of her old bikini posters somewhere here, I can honestly say that if he was the only movie I ever saw her, "Cyclone", I would never be able to guess why she did it as far as she had in exhibition business. Fred Olen Ray's director (perhaps as good a sign as when the circles above his head in the desert are recognizable in the desert), this story of a woman (Thomas) who must protect a high-tech motorcycle from unscrupulous types is probably as a "B" movie as it gets (or in the case of Fred Olen, "B minus"). He should tell you something himself. It's not every movie that combines Thomas with Beswick, Hall, Combs, Donahue, Tamblyn and Landau (!!). If you're lucky, it does very few movies. And while it seems to be fun, shouldn't any such fun be passed on to the audience? I am voting yes, it seems that they have not voted. Of course, if you ever wanted to see Heather bring another woman, use the word "F" to connect to the battery cables. apparently I was looking for this. I myself will be happy with the old "Fall Guy" reruns. One star, given in the hope that the next "Cyclone" strikes the city, Heather runs to hide. I know I'll do it.
