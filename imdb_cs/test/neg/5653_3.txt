Miranda Cosgrove is known for her "School of Rock" debut with Jack Black and her role as Megan in "Drake and Josh" and has become a fan of Nickelodeon fans, so it's not surprising that Dan Schneider would make a show for her. Unfortunately, it ends up being as bad as, if not worse than, "Amanda Show". "iCarly" is about three friends, Carly, Sam, and Freddie, who became the idols in junior high community through a webcam show called "iCarly". Carly and Sam are the hosts and Freddie shoots and puts it on the internet. Carly also has an older brother named Spencer, who has been acting with the wondrous Jerry Trainor, who is known for his work in "Drake and Josh" as Crazy Steve. Well, let me tell you. Don't believe 8.3 out of 10 this show because it's pathetic in almost every aspect. Dan Schneider probably went through about 5 minutes of studying teenage interests because all I see is that he says, "iPod? IPhone? IHome? Ah! Teenagers love something starting with 'i'!" and most of the gigs that were used in "Drake and Josh", if not, are just really dry and forced jokes that don't even count on generous laughter like "Do you want me to turn to AC at 60 degrees?" "We want you to change it to 60 cucumbers!" Not only that, but if you look closely, almost all the sets in the shows were used in "Drake and Josh" and "Ned's Declassified", which were simply spit-and-polished with random things to try and make it look different. The shots on which the show shows the broadcast of the iCarly network are as terrible as the whole series. The dialogue in them is cruelly bad, which can be accepted by some because it's just two friends playing in front of the camera, but what is it with the strange, humorous antiquity they do like "Random Dancing!" And from there it only gets worse. As far as acting is concerned, Miranda and Jennette are not by far the best. Nathan Kress, who played Freddie, is sometimes unbelievable, but he does a good job. The person who really steals the show is Jerry Trainor's witty bravery, who fits well into the role of "protective older brother" and his widescreen loud play can do some pretty funny segments. Too bad they aren't frequent because it might, in my opinion, show another star. Dan Schneider had to do this show just to get Miranda Cosgrove her own handbag. a playground that can jump and churn out incredible jokes and pathetic cue lines in every way because everyone else has exceptional talent buried under poorly executed scenarios and weightless gaming. Dan Schneider did a great job with Drake and Josh, so it's a real disappointment that "iCarly" is such a failure. Jerry Trainor's acting rescued this show from 1 out of 10 ratings, but he himself can't save "iCarly" from being as terrible as it is.
