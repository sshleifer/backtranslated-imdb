I expected "Born to Kill" to be an exciting, highly exciting film noir. Instead, he has two good action sets (one at the beginning and one at the end) and some amazing atmospheric cinematography by Robert de Grasse (usually a glamor cameraman and surprising credit for noira), but the rest of the movie is pretty boring. Lawrence Tierney goes through her psychic kick, but it is a strict performance that mechanically spews what viewers expect from him after "Dillinger" (an overrated movie, but at least better than that). Claire Trevor's character is too stupid and unmotivated to have an audience appeal, and the action (as it is) remains so resolutely inside that damn house in San Francisco where the film becomes claustrophobic instead of really exciting. It's one of those films that support players - especially Elisha Cook, Jr. (whose homoerotic itching for Tierney is one of the few subtleties in the otherwise quite obvious scenario) and Isabel Jewell - lead the way. It also doesn't help that nearly half a century after Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins revolutionized the display of psycho murderers on the screen in "Psycho", Tierney is so rude and obvious that he could also have "PSYCHO" tattoos on his forehead. There is no indication in the film of why the source novel was called "Deadlier than Man" - but James Gunn made the female characters stronger and more interesting than in the film. "Born to Kill" is a real disappointment from Robert Wise, who has already had some good movies under his belt and will continue his stellar career.
