There are a lot of comments that have already been written, just as I felt about this movie, so I kept it short. "The Grinch" I thought it was amazing - Jim Carrey is a really talented, physical comedian, as well as being a versatile clever actor (in my opinion). Mike Myers, on the other hand, gets his laughter by being uncomfortable. I liked him very much in his "Waynes World" and "So I married Ax Murderer" days - but I never like Austin Powers and "Cat In The Hat" just finished me. This film was terrible - the gags were terrible! not suitable for children not only in adult content, but in the fact that some of them have been so dated that they have not been having anyone for 50 years! The storyline was messy, messy, messy! It's a shame really because the kids were very likeable like "Mom". They could probably choose a better villain than Alec Baldwin - but he could pull it out if it wasn't ugly, ugly, overly depicted for Cats. I mean - did Myers even look at the script? Was it written? Other actors seemed to have one - but Cat seemed to be winging! On the other hand, I would like to mention that sets and props were amazing !!! But unfortunately they can't save this movie. Poor Dr Seuss - the man was a genius! Dont destroy his reputation by adapting his work in such a lazy, messy way !!! <br /> <br /> 1/10
