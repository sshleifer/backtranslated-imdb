After watching Stop-Loss, I find myself in disappointment in Hollywood for making such a stinking one. Gone are the days of glory of the 1940s movies that made one proud to be an American, fighting evil, eager to conquer abroad and death at home. What we have left is dribbling the foam at the mouth of the angry anti-Bush radicals. The story tells of three young men returning home from the war. One descends into extraterrestrial madness, culminating in his death. The main protagonist leaves his country during the war and at the same time destroys his best relationship with his fianc√©s. The third is really the hero of the story, choosing to continue the fight that was brought to our shores almost eight years ago. What makes this film wrong is not acting, but its premise. We are convinced that decorating soldiers are actually our country's hatred. Desertion is similar to betrayal during the war, and the main protagonist flirts with him throughout the film. This paradox is designed to weaken the viewer's reaction to the central act of film. We shouldn't find a king because he wears medals, but his actions don't deserve it, but shout for it. He's not an anti-hero. To accept the film, viewers must accept the correctness of desertion because the story paints the king as nothing but a hero. I can't accept it because it's like asking me to call the bright blue day on the yellow sky. In addition, the ridicule for the real hero, the man who re-enlists and continues to serve his country, is reinforced. I would only recommend the smelly person who needs a convincing decay of Hollywood because it is a clear example. No wonder the box office wasn't doing well.
