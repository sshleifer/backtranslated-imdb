Independent movie viewers know that once or twice a year they will see stories of dysfunctional families and they expect them to be more and more challenging to keep them fresh, but despite the good cast it seems to be the same. The story is about Travis' family trying to get out of Matt's suicide (Kip Pardue), who was a very promising swimmer in high school. Ben (Jeff Daniels) is a father who will step away from everyone and never treat his other son Tim (Emile Hirsch), as well as Matt, but communicate (somehow) with his mother Sandy (Sigourney Weaver), who finds his hiding pot and starts smoking. ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** Sandy also starts flirting with much younger men like check-out cashiers at the grocery store, but when she tries to buy more marijuana she gets arrested and taken to prison. He won't tell anyone what happened, but he discovers bruises on Tim's body and also that Ben took a vacation from work. After all this happens, Sandy gets sick and lands in a hospital where her life is in jeopardy, forcing Ben to realize that she has to deal with the loss of another part of her family. This film is written and directed by Dan Harris, who collaborated with Bryan Singer on "X2" and also on the upcoming movie Superman, and while his script allows these characters to have real moments of expressing their pain and confusion, The Story (To Me) Has Too Many Things The scenario touches on so many different areas you need to watch, including drugs, sex, love, infidelity, abuse, neglect, experimenting with homosexuality, and life-threatening illnesses. If all of these scenarios were not enough for you, then Harris would turn on the plot at the end, which should summarize and explain most of all feelings to Tim. While I was aiming at least two or three times as the script unfolded one by one, I have to admit that I hated the movie and I have to attribute it to the actor. Everybody has at least one good scene in the film, but I wish the story would focus more on Weaver and her character than on Hirsch. Weaver is exceptional and with a sharper scenario she might have had a role that might lead to an Oscar nomination, but instead we get endless scenes of Hirsch at parties or his shenanigans with a neighbor next door. Harris shows that he can be a good writer / director, but with this effort he just throws so many different things to the audience that the material just becomes laborious and invented.
