A depressed creepy teenager does a lot of bad things for a socially active older lady who doesn't want to use shades or curtains in her windows. Steels separated things from her, looked at her, made calls, and played various unpleasant tricks. Oddly enough, none of this cares. At first, she doesn't seem to care for it in one way or another, that she bothers her. Later, he seems to start to respect him for his cruel feverish activities. <br /> <br /> There are some illogical items to note. One of them is that the guy looks into the night through a glass plate from a brightly lit side. In real life, such a thing won't happen. The brighter-lit side of the glass sheet acts like a mirror. He'll be able to see exactly anything. Also, everyone at night could look at him sitting in a well-lit room. Another illogical item is that a creepy young man takes a job as a milkman and his one seems to be the only lady she collects every morning. Easy to work if you can get it. I saw a short film about love in public. There was not one open eye in the house until the end. SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE is a movie for foreign languages ​​for those who don't like headlines. There are few words in the film, but most of the film is silent. Some rest at rest.
