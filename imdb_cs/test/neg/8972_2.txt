Star star Grace Hayes plays in this dark movie. After years on the stage, he is going to visit a small college town to see his son being raised by his grandfather. The boy doesn't know who his mother is and when he sees him in the local malt house, he's a cruel blockbuster. Part of the problem is that it is a clown college, the other part is that it is really spoiled. Interestingly, it turns out that mommy is really rich and not only finances her son's life, but he's her. a powerful college contributor. So he has an idea to make a young man mature. He talks to the man who educates Peter, and his contribution is completely cut off - hoping to get to that opportunity. It also turns out that he puts screws into the school because he thinks all these kids have to stop playing and be more responsible. <br /> <br /> Now that's where it's pretty stupid. To show that they know the value of hard work, hires a lot of them to sing and dance in the malt shop they just bought. Talk about invented !! What happens next is like a long and not particularly good talent show or maybe a poor version of Judy Garland / Mickey Rooney! I would suggest that children try to do something different to make money ... or maybe sing and dance until people pay them! I know I'd pay them. Given that talent is far from gifted, Peter is a bad actor and his change from lout to responsible adult is almost instantaneous, the whole thing being a bit heavy. . It's not a good movie by any reasonable standard, it's a dark movie that should remain dark! By the way, it is interesting that Mrs. Hayes' son in the movie, Peter, is actually the son of her real life. The only problem with this is that Peter Lind Hayes is a really terrible actor. He is not handsome enough to be the leading man and leave as boring and uninteresting or utterly uncomfortable. Especially all the silly impressions he does are really bad and he has a charisma of gelatin that you step on Spam. Despite this terrible performance, he continued his successful acting career. Who would believe it if you saw it in the BOIS BAH - because it is as welcome as Bubonic Plague !!
