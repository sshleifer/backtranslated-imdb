This is what used to be called "female image" and later "cat is film" when more juveniles got times and movies. The storyline is just a soap opera for women and will only appeal to these types. The only challenge for most guys is if they want to see too much college Mary Tyler Moore in the leotard. (If you're at a certain age, just like me, it may be enough to look at it.) Otherwise, MTM gives another of her typical performances she has given since the early 1970s when she took it. the heart of being an American Heart. Christine Lathi gives another of those abrasive and unpleasant performances that seem to be a real part of her personality and are probably referring only to those of that kind. (Excuse me, but it seems to be true.) Ted Danson is too young as a MTM husband and usually issues a slightly horrifying appeal if he doesn't have a gaming partner to soften it. And it won't happen here. Allan Burns wrote and directed and probably passed it all because he worked with Mary before, wrote it as a project for her, and at this point she had the juice to make it. He seems to have no other purpose.
