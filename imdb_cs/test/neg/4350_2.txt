Decent action scenes, but the film is saddled with a slow, intricate story, a nearly non-existent dialogue that leads to minimal character development and a seriously frightening story ... \ t But in their defenses, the action scenes were impressive, though they let you scratch your head for why it just happened. There's not much to say about film. It's a neat, mindless action adventure that makes no sense. It's like watching a worse version of the Matrix and skipping the whole story and dialogue.
