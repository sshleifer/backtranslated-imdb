This filmmaker wanted to make a film without telling a story - and so did. Really awful tangle of unlikely / unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable conspiracies, all without character or clear motivation. <br /> <br /> We get clich√©s instead of characters. One of them is a tiny and beautiful criminal boss who designs an exaggerated person of "hard guy" person and casts cartoonish shadows of intimidation over the real hard guys who came to work. Nothing much surprising when we look at the movie, except for one shot when the boys set off and one of them carried a small suitcase (like the smallest of the complete American Tourister) in a bright celestial light, without explanation or excuse. Otherwise, it is visual by default - another exception is the convincing shot of a beautiful CT bridge.
