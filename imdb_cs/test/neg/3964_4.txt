Beloved story of the hero "Benji" ("Higgins" dog), which is a lot of different things for many different people. In his busy day "Benji" grabs breakfast in the house of two young children, has a chat with an official lawyer, chases the old lady's cat and reminds the aging owner of the cafe to start the day special. It helps some, the amusement of others, is a companion for all. Problems arise when his young friends are kidnapped and taken to an abandoned mansion he calls home. From here we know that only "Benji" can save the day. The fence is a routine from writer / producer / director Joe Camp, and he tends to do slow effects. But the audience will find it hard for him to resist a small love affair, and children of all ages will certainly love him. Cast has never been anything but "Benji" background. <br /> <br /> It's not what you call inspired but fun family fares. Oscar nomination for "Benji", "I Feel Love". Saturday, July 13, 1996 - Video
