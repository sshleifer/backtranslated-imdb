This is a very bad action movie for various reasons. Above all, Seagal is terribly fanciful. He looks old and fat, plays as if he had annoying duties, and his battle scenes require creative editing or simple replacement. Second, his opponent is a very weak villain. This is a smart and medium masterbrain and Chestnut doesn't give. What about the action? Well, both sides shoot at each other in different places in Alcatraz prison. He shoots wildly and badly because, compared to the amount of ammunition required, body condition is somewhat low. There is nothing to store this movie. There is no single good line and no one good joke. The little psychological downturn with 49er One and Judge McPherson is ridiculous. So what does it have? Well, the usual Bell helicopters, silhouettes moving in blue light and slow motion, the door smeared with bullets and 1000 Watt lights through the holes, figures leaping through the air, lots of weapons coming from nothing, a long black coat containing a bold black man and a thin wooden box containing 25 tons of gold. The pain continues until the last step, a hopeless approach to relieving the final credits. California Beachboy Don Michael Paul wrote and directed. At least this mountain of boredom comes from a single simple mind.
