This movie, which is a.k.a. "Life in the fast lane" is easily one of the least entertaining movies I've ever seen. I think it was in the mind of the sick, twisted and tired of L.A. women representing about .00000001 population in states. All characters are one-dimensional, even lead. After stabbing her friend with someone's scissors, he tried a cheap laugh (and failed) by sticking the cork into the friend's skull to stop the bleeding. Smart! Patrick Dempsey (whose films are almost always an act of the class - Sarcasm) plays this "devil" who changes his life - but from what we saw her life was this series of medallions. No emotions, no laughs, no story. The only reason I gave it is that Jeffrey Jones is fine as a priest and is a bit of a style in the cameraman (albiet zero substance). Otherwise, one of the 5 worst movies I've ever seen. Grade 2 of 10 AN F! I think even the bravest drug addict who would laugh at a falling toilet seat wouldn't like this movie. I can't emphasize enough how much you should stay away. <br /> <br />
