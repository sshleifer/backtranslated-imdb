I just saw Caribe a few days ago at the annual Vistas Film Festival in Dallas and I have to express my dissatisfaction. The introductory introduction tries to tell us that the film is a picture of the current invasion of South American countries (Costa Rica, in this particular case) by North American oil companies and the negative effects of this economic invasion on the economy and the environment. The main characters are husbands who live a simple, pleasant life-keeping banana farm. A woman comes in immediately and announces that she is a wife's half-sister. I will not go into the specifics of this (and to be honest, I do not feel that I have spoiled anything with this revision), but another key point is that the company that distributes its bananas will drop it. budget in a poor economy. The main conflict to be solved in the film is that the husband between the rock and the hard place tries to maintain his livelihood. On the one hand, the oil company Reynolds offered him, in principle, employment and financial compensation (basically a bribe) to use his public influence to encourage the city to allow the company to start drilling in its city (compromising its position with the community and community). alone). On the other hand, he is confronted with being dead, but on the side of his community, protesting against drilling. Given the length of this movie, there would be enough time to investigate the problems just described, but that just won't happen and I'll tell you why. You will notice that this film has won several awards so far, one for the direction and price of the audience. I won't choose Esteban's direction, it wasn't bad or good enough to be so passionate about writing anything. Audience awards were presented at the Spanish Film Festival and I have to imagine that Spanish people are just digging out soap operas for winning the audience award. In fact, Central and South America dig soap operas anyway, I know that much. I suppose Esteban either tried to take advantage of this or that he himself would kick out soap operas because that's what unfolds during this film, so much so that he kicks the whole oil company plot to the side, almost as if you're halfway through making this movie seemed tiring because at least three of the supporting characters seem to have their back story and character development seriously threatened to create room for further sex and tears. The only true villain in the movie is one of these three characters, and by no means do you actually get to know who the hell is that. It's almost as if they've shortened the screen time to take it out of the movie. Occasionally with oil against community conspiracy, but they are at best turning. What we see much more is the scenes of passion, jealousy, betrayal, adultery, etc. These topics saturate the story to the point where the oil company 'sub'plot becomes useless. It is almost as if it were a stunt that would legitimize a romantic drama (soap opera) by playing a little political importance. However, the film gets so caught up in the romance that it eventually does not know what to do with itself, resulting in an end so pinned to the fact that you stayed wondering what it is that you are waiting for, or if it were something that would could start. Here are two things I think could save this movie: either cut out a half-sister or cut out an oil company. It is obvious that one of them is more interested. Or if Caribe was an hour longer, they could do it all. Regardless, I would be fine with direct soap opera, and I think the topic of oil companies using foreign nations is in dire need to reach out to the film community. Caribe is both and neither. These two angles could work together if they were adequately balanced, but with a romantic conspiracy in circles that would take almost twice as much time at the expense of an oil land that was barely built, both sides suffer. Best of all, a romantic conspiracy is never resolved. I would like to say that I watched this movie again to see what I missed, but I have a strong feeling that I already know what it is. As for me, it didn't matter if I saw Caribe ten times. I missed it because it just isn't.
