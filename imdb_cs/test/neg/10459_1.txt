As other posters commented on this was a very very bad movie (keeping it child friendly) FX was a low class, they would have spent $ 1 on coke. As is typical of these D movies, most victims die and leave a mystery except for one happy soul and, of course, leadership. I hope it was worth Boxleitner, a really big step down from Babylon 5. I like to see what happened to Buck Rogers, but the hell was low for him. "It was so bad and you could even say on older actors that they thought it was wrong. Don't look. <br /> <br /> ***** Spoiler Warnings **** **** <br /> <br /> This thing chased everyone who was then and Boxlietner got away ... that she was pure BS. And the end? How come kids ended up with him? That was just too stupid.
