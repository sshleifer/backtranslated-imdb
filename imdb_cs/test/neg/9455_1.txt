Vampire is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Wooden acting, lame effects and a frightening story, all this is a film that has no reason to see it. PV is one of those films that do not have such a good grace to be bad in a fun way, instead, this bile tries to try to be as boring, stupid and stupid as it is humanly possible. The vampire created a serum he sells to the elderly as a life enhancer, and those who take it fall under his control. A former lab intern will contact the nurse to try to stop him. Someone should stop the creator of this waste. Nobody has any reason to see this movie, and I'm actually horrified by the human race on the grounds that at the time of writing 2 people gave it a cruelty of 10 out of 10.
