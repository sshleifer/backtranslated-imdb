When I looked at the review for this movie after watching it, I was surprised that there were people who gave him a good rating. This is a movie of bad camera work. Everything "scary" takes place off-screen, usually accompanied by the detail of someone who shouted: "Did you see that? Well, no, we didn't see it! We can't! And when there were no close-ups, the camera did something strange, like when she turned upside down, or trembling back and forth really, really fast, to express an action or to physically become ill. > The characters were unlikely because they started screaming again and again every two minutes. I don't care if that's what it 'really' would be like, I rent a scary movie to see sensible things! I expect disproportionate things like extraterrestrials, demons or good behavior! They were stupid too - let's have intimate relationships in the cave! With all our clothes on! Speaking of it, the end is somewhat contradictory to what Domingo said immediately before he died. That bothered me a bit, though not nearly as much as the fact that the end ended ... a serious invasion of one girl's privacy. -work. What is left? Ajo. The end can have a 'twist', but generally with horror films, a twist at the end actually has an understandable meaning to what happened during the movie. The sixth sense explains a lot. Hide and search too. But Cavern had a lame twist that served as an 'explanation' if you could call it that way. Explain. Anything. <br /> <br /> You can't see it. Please.
