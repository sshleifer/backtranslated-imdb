After a pleasant surprise with the performance of Sandra Bullock at Miss Congeniality, I decided to give Murder By Numbers a chance. While decent in the hopeless roles, Mrs. Bullock's performance in "serious" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days), leave what you need. Her character is both omniscient, confused and sexually maladjusted (sub-plot Sandra's past comes as a useless filler that does little to develop her already shallow character). Two teenage boys gave decent performances, although their forensic knowledge and the attitude of catching, if possible, are neglected by stupid mistakes screaming, "We did it!" Chris Penn as an all-seeing suspect is wasted here, just as Benkenlin's symbolic partner / love of interest is. *** Spoilers In front of us *** Mediocre heride aside, the biggest drawbacks can be traced by a TV-on-week plot that has never completely bought you into the murder motives, and, as mentioned, stupid mistakes (vomiting rare food on the murder scene, too comfortable and framing) from the school janitor, two boys who meet in public, a comfortable love interest to cause friction, etc., make the view of the murderers coming back is boring and disappointed. The end was strictly "numbers" and was probably the most disappointing aspect of the film. Using now the cliché of tactics that almost showed the top scene at the beginning of the film, and then filled the audience with the way we arrived at the moment, the ultimate scene is no surprise and lacks any so-called intelligence that the film has thought. come to its conclusion. A somewhat promising concept, but poorly executed and weak in almost every direction. * outside ****.
