This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Not only is this a comedy that isn't funny, but it's also very poorly done with the exact direction full of unnecessary partitioning screens and other effects. Two "heroes" with their fantasy language is just annoying and it makes me pretty confused that they have touched each other's genitals all the time. But the worst of all the nonsense is the inexpensive attempt to give this film some attraction, to refer to German history and to show the sensitive aspects of the "heroes" that will peak in how Erkan and Stefan heal a mentally ill woman with their "joyful" lifestyle ( !). However, I did not expect anything better director Michael "Bully" Herbig, who also made two not funny TV shows, not a funny western movie and almost no funny SF-comedy movie. But Erkan and Stefan were just a little better in some of their stand-up programs. For me, the only good thing about the movie is Alexander Neldel, which is very beautiful for me.
