Well, I have to agree with the reviews of everyone else. Characters. They are. Stupid. They are all stereotypical and yet they have nice clothes and are always thin. I didn't even start playing Jamie Lynn as ZOEY. Zoey is a pretty, popular, tanned, blond young teenager who just loves! He has a "rebellious", great, personality with whom everyone agrees, no matter how stupid or extreme. Most annoying of all: her voice is so bold and nervous. "OMG!" Consider the first episode, for example. As they enter the huge PCA campus, they all seem to love her. The boys want to ask her, the girls want to be her girlfriend, etc. She thinks it's all, the episode happens to be the center of attention with Zoey; is the so-called best player of the unofficial girls' basketball team, confident, and everyone regrets it when she feels weak in her face. Oh boo-hoo. My favorite character is by far this whole series is a girl who appears much later in the show, Lauren or something who is the only person ever introduced in a show to hate Zoey. And Zoey sometimes doesn't seem too loyal to friends. In one episode, he even calls his friend without apologizing to EVER and does not show a bit of regret. Zoey is always the best: <br /> <br /> -Desiging professional T-shirts and backpacks (which become a big hit) <br /> <br /> coming with VERY sophisticated HERSELF schemes teaching one person. <br /> <br /> - Flawless Marks <br /> <br /> - Guilt for things that haven't been related to her, so everyone else can be happy. - Come with an ad that was so good that it was put on TV. The list goes on and continues ... Ugh. He has no acting talent. He's always the perfect person. It acts dirty and rebellious and preppy and ... UGH! She can't stand her. <br /> <br /> Not only that, but everyone at the show always has great clothes. ARE NERD! Her wardrobe is better than mine, and mine is pretty decent. Nobody cares about everyone loving you on the PCA, Zoey, and doing anything for you, even if it means giving your right hand. <br /> <br /> BUT regardless of these cardboard characters, graphs are creative. Not everyday things. They are interesting and fun. Humor is usually good-natured and entertaining, but characters are so papery that it's hard to enjoy. This show would be really good if Dan Schnieder gave a little more time to think about the type of characters he wanted, because they are so typical, so boring that it is lame and silly. Point: No one is the least overweight, everyone has a stylish outfit, Zoey is the definition of Mary-Sue, story lines are well thought out and humor is ridiculous. But again, I want to emphasize that the characters will charm the show. Look at the show if you have to, but don't say I warned you when your eyes start bleeding.
