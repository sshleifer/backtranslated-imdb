This movie is bad. It's not so bad that it's good. Just wrong. But it's badly bad. I watched it from some morbid curiosity and I never intend to follow it with any other Chuck Norris movie. If you have a choice between this film and death, you should be happy to choose this film, but it is a master class in scary filmmaking (including merriment). It's a constant depression. Me as I almost on the table that some people get involved in making a movie and decided to produce things like this. 1 out of 10. Even better than "Starship Troopers" however.
