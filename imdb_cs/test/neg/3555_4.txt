The action in this film was old school: sloping and stiff. Irene Dunne is luminous and comes out of the best, though she has several very unnatural lines. But her ability to express emotions is going through. Older film enthusiasts will find in this film at least some balancing quality through watching the 1930s film technology. Otherwise, it is not really useful.
