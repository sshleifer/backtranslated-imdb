Definitely not a bad little low budget movie, this "Bride of Gorilla" but nothing special, nor, and unforgettable enough to be ranked among the meaningful Sci-Fi efforts of her time. Director Curt Siodmak was a major screenwriter in the 1930s and 1940s and published stories for some classical genre classics ("I went with Zombie", "The Wolf Man"), but apparently lacked the required competencies as a director. "The Bride of Gorilla" is similar to the above-mentioned "The Wolf Man" in story and atmosphere, but the film looks much more amateurish and pitiful. They both deal with the cursed men who become big animals at night, but the titular gorilla doesn't look half as impending a werewolf, though the film came out a decade later. During the cheesy opening speech, actor Lon Chaney tries to convince us that the jungle is a sinister place and hides many mysteries, but there is actually no real secret in the plot. It's just a plantation manager who is jealous of his older colleague for having such a beautiful young woman and killing him. The native woman witnesses her crime and puts Barney on the spell that makes her turn into an abominable gorilla at night ... Or maybe she wants him to believe he's turned into a nasty big gorilla? Commissioner in charge of murder investigation, while Raymond Burr (who played in about a thousand Perry Mason TV movies) portrays a greedy plantation manager / night gorilla. Siodmak tries to make the film look like a supernatural thriller? is it or isn't it all that happens in Barney's head? ?? failure miserably and causes too much talk and too little jungle-action. Several jungle settings are pretty in the picture, but the rest of the "special" effects are cheap and poorly executed. Still good, Barbara Payton looks beautiful and? though very predictable? the story is strangely captivating to the very end. Weird movie, does this voodoo-cursed me?
