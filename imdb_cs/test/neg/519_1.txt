This film has to be included with Ed Wood. Terrible script and bad, bad playing. <br /> <br /> Machine-gun battle in front of glass panes; minutes before anyone is hit and no one has a cover - no window will ever break. Thinking about a fire fight, as if a big U-Haul truck could be riddled - not scratched. Performed by CIA agents and government contractors = shouting = Top Secret information on a stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people around. <br /> <br /> There is no one actor you care about; everyone is shallow and basically unlikable. Hawaii established 747 aircraft from Los Angeles and fell twenty minutes later in the Pacific "... in 100 feet of water ...". A short time when the flight attendant tells five other passengers that only two hours of air remains; at 747? The next day the paramedics will introduce themselves and the incredibly six passengers are still alive. A film that starts on average and goes from bad to worse. <br /> <br />
