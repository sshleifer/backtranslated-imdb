When I saw this movie, I think I was a freshman in high school and still feel as if he was charging Master P in an hour and 20 minutes or so that he would take me out of my life that I would never return. <br /> <br /> The one who has sent is perfectly fine. Master P is a wannabe gangster. He, like all the other rappers in this country, made his millions of rap cds sales to young children in this country. It is common knowledge that the crowd was not a black thing and the blacks were not allowed to be a part of it. Unjust that it could be rappers can't deal. This film painted Master P as a gangster named Nino? The script is terrible when it comes to a match. Absolutely incredible. In my search I came up with a link or something that said that it was going to do another movie called "The Black Sopranos" !!!! Please save us and stay with Nickalodeon. You are not a white gangster, your or a good actor Master P, please stick to your music for whoever listens to them these days ...
