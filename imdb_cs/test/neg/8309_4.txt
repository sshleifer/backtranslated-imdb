I'm from Texas so I thought I knew the big hair but the female villain in this movie had humongous hair. Whenever she was on the screen, I couldn't concentrate on anything but her hair. Make your presence on stage! There seemed to be many people with hearing problems in this film. There was a traffic director who wrote a parking ticket that didn't actually notice the owner plunging toward the car and shouting at the top of his lungs until he hit the car. Then there was a man in a telephone booth who couldn't hear the huge bulldozer coming to him until he was 5 feet away. All the men in this film looked a little deaf, no one had to sneak at them. The only "hero" of this movie was so lush and ineffective that it was funny. Bar-fight was pretty funny. There is an invaluable scene where the hero and his girlfriend just had sex and judged by their expressions, for one of them it wasn't good. That made me laugh aloud. This movie is on 50 movie martial arts if you want to see a lot of bad movies (with a few decent).
