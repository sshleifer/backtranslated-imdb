When the body of the young man she met on the train appears on her autopsy table, she begins to explore the mysterious circumstances surrounding his death and reveals a terrible conspiracy committed by the secret Antihippocratic society operating in school. Disturbing and rude, lots of scary parts. He even has a good script and an end. But he has one bad part. What else did you see from this movie? It's a good secret and a horror movie. But of course, if you like it, go buy it. If not, there is still no reason to waste money on it. Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Sexual Situation and Blasphemy.
