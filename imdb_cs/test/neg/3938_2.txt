Good idea .... shame about the real movie. He would like it to be a little scarier and explain more about the characters and who exactly was the evil woman? If she tortured the children, why did they help her kill and not help others kill her? It's kind of coming from Malcolm on Wednesday! <br /> <br /> I think it would be of benefit from being a little longer and going into more detail with the characters, though about an hour later I was wondering when it would be over !! It would also be better if the real characters who killed them were not really computer, that made them crap. And what happened to Frankie Munitz? He fell into the bed of wild roses, so he should be safe, but the computer game showed him that the game was over, so dead. Another thing that seems to be with the irritating blonde girl to rescue the guy afraid of the fire I noticed had no remorse about flipping the lighter when the lady lady was after him !! Too many discrepancies in this movie If you really want to enjoy it, you may think twice about playing this new computer game !!
