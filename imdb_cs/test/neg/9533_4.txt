This film was so restless, rambling and uneven that it was an effort to watch the whole thing. (Actually, I thought some interesting elements of the conspiracy might have developed.) That was nothing more than the film "coming of age" for the thirty-something generation. Absolutely stupid and I have no idea what Julianne Moore was doing, because that was the only reason I took him off the shelf in the rental shop.
