When you read the commentary on this film, it's a smart and witty political comedy based on real events - the only true word is it's a comedy. If you said it was an insider movie about Russian politics - it's not so. There is only about 2% of what actually happened in Russia during this election campaign. In fact, 1996 was a thousand times more interesting to watch the situation and it was a real funky election campaign. Well, there were PR consultants from the US who worked in Yeltsin's staff, but their role was minimal. The whole campaign was totally different from what was mentioned in the movie, it would be much more fun to show all the presidents who travel around the country with paper money boxes and celebrities who support Yeltsin throughout the show. that would be true. I only give it three because it's respect with Jeff Goldblum, Antony LaPagglia and Liev Schreiber. And about machine guns in the streets of Moscow. I lived in a place that had the highest offense in Russia in the mid-1990s and never saw a man with a gun on the street.
