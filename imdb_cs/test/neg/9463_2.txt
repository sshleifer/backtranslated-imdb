I know this movie is a low-budget horror movie designed for those who support shocks and "cheap" gore, but even if we consider that, this movie is just too boring, full of incoherent plot, along with horrifying music and obvious signs that this the movie was never finished. Without giving spoilers, I can only say that, according to the last disc, things are packed without any explanation, either by film or by narration. Anitra is really attractive, but it is not good enough to enjoy this movie. If you are a fan of those films from the sixties and seventies, you should watch it, but warn that it will not even reach the usual plateau of these kinds of films.
