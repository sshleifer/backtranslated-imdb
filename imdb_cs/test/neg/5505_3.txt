In general, I am an admirer of Jess Franco's filmmaking, but for some of these films, I really have trouble understanding the motivation behind them or even their reason for existence. For example, this sick puppy. "Sadomania" has absolutely no cinematic value, it is poorly made without any conspiracy and contains some of the most vulnerable sleaze shots ever captured by the film. This is another filthy movie in jail, where there are daily routines, lesbian events and violent torture. The Rangers are crazier than prisoners, and the institution is protected by an impotent governor who is only sexually excited to see a girl having sex with a dog (!). Girls are very beautiful and naked throughout the movie, but you can't really enjoy this view with everything that is happening. Doubtful events include a barbaric hunting game (you can guess what is her prey), a duel between death and guardian, and a picture of a poor girl with a hypodermic needle across her nipple. Auch! Avoid this sick mess and save yourself trouble with TWO baths to wash off dirt off.
