Okay, so not every Australian movie is so good. Yes, maybe there were very few with many merits. But Take Away is an absolute bomb that qualifies as one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wanted it. I thought I'd do it. I even met one of the screenwriters Dave O'neil, so I feel kind of a traitor giving this movie a bad review, but ... The story is quite thin (I won't bother to refer to it ... read synopsis) that I can forgive : There are lots of movies that can cover it with a few decent jokes. Unfortunately, Take Away's jokes cover his plot as a $ 2 prostitute skirt. Probably the only laughs that came from 6 other people in the cinema were bad behavior and dialogue. Take Away goes down like a week old Dim sim ... You can understand that joke if you see a movie but a joke isn't worth it.
