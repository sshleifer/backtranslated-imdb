From the very beginning, this film is dragging and pulling. Clumsy overdubs explain history, monochrome acting, boring sets, complete lack of any humanity, verve or style. The actors look like they're intoxicating. Potentially interesting story completely useless. Certainly someone realized how wrong it was at some point in his production?
