I think it says something that Bollywood "Bride and PRejudice" has remained more faithful to source material than this Hollywood version of 2005. I also laughed in the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Invaluable!) If you read the book or saw the BBC version of 1995 (and liked it), then you will have an unpleasant surprise in this movie. My friend, who didn't see him, was slightly amused by the film. But if you are a purist of JAne Austen, or even a movie viewer who does not like historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit in this. <br /> <br /> Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors wouldn't be so sinister if they had a decent script, maybe written by someone who loved Austen's work. <br /> <br /> What journey has been committed? Well, you'll be forced to endure such incredible lines as "Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!" and "Let me live once in your life!" Not only are these lines far from anything that might have come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone sincerely believe words like the one that poured out of the mouth of fine young ladies from the Regency era? The use of modern colloquial expressions is one of the many exciting ways that the screenwriter cuts the book. The writer also decided to give the characters lines that were spoken by quite different characters in the book and all without obvious purpose. Worse of all, if he tries to hold a little closer to writing a book, the screenwriter has an ugly and useless habit of rearranging Austen's phrases and replacing the unpleasant synonyms of her perfect word. It was as if the screenwriter sat down with a book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other while writing the script. Stay Austen's words; she did it better than you did! I assume that all this was done in a "revisionist" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 version of the BBC. However, it also made me happy about the true spirit of Austen's favorite work. Casting had potential, though it was quickly interrupted as soon as the scenario kicked in. But Keira, giggling excessively and exposing the harsh teeth doesn't equal magic and liveliness! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him pretty pretty enough, has read his script and was under the impression of playing Heathcliff and not an impressive Mr. Darcy. I really enjoyed Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really rather refreshing. But Donald Sutherland! Someone has described his performance as seemingly hobo, who accidentally went to the film and I must say that this is a descriptive description. And can anyone tell me why they made Wickham after Legolas? Although he was in the film for less than two minutes, I daresay, and without his formidable archery skills pick up the film. On the cabinet note, I'd kill for Miss Bingley's dress because they were luxurious and fit more into the modern century. (Evening sleeveless dress? Please! More Versace than Austen, that's for sure) And poor Keira, the whole budget went to her salary and not to her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they finally caught the bastard who stole the hairbrush from the movie. Unfortunately, they haven't caught him early enough to play the actress's hair before filming. In short, with this new Hollywood version, offer adieu to Austen's eloquence, subtlety and joke. I get the complete opposite.
