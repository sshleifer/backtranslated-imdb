Stripes, the army training camp comedy starring Bill Murray and directed by Ivan Reitman, is my favorite. Meatballs, summer camp 'romp' starring Bill Murray and director Ivan Reitman, are a waste of time. It requires considerable effort for the four screenwriters to produce the film (the word 'comedy' deduces work with mirth aforethought) as helpless, anemic and boring as this. Murray obviously reached the same conclusion during filming, but his usually reliable powers of improvisation escape him, and his attempts at injecting life into the game just contribute to embarrassment - "Really doesn't matter" singing the scene is unbearable. It doesn't help to support talent - the hair is the funniest thing, but Meatballs was made in 1979. ("Chris Makepeace as Rudy announces introductory credits. Makepeace?!). Merciful Reitman remedied his mistake two years later for Stripes. Murray's shtick is so much fun to roam with John Candy, Warren Oates, and John Larroquette. Ditch it and watch it.
