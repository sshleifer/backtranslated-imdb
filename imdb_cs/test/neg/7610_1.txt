I rarely give one or ten stars to a movie, but it was so terrible, I had to make an exception. I'm a SciFi fan and I've seen a few comedies that really like SciFi. There was nothing you liked. I realize that it started with a very small film student budget. But even with that, the files and the effect are bad. Cinematography is average, but it can be the best part of the film. Acting is wrong. A sad state where a female voice is the best actor for a computer. Dialogue is wrong. The script is very weak and the plot is incoherent and almost nonexistent. Humor is not only gentle and noble; it is nowhere to be found. As an example, a full 20 minutes of the 80 minute movie is spent on a lame 2 punch combo joke with a strange mascot and a lift. It was supposed to be a parody of everything from the bad 50's SciFi to 2001. But what we're going to do is just a slightly updated version of the old 50-year-old SciFi C-movie. These films were at least funny because they were taken seriously.
