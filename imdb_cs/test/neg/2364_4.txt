Young woman nicknamed "T.N.T." For being a virtual dynamite in battle and eliminating appearance on the shoe, it goes to the most inauspicious part of Hong Kong in search of its missing brother, Steve Jackson. When he learns that he was murdered, he decides to bring the murderer to justice in a way that only she can do. <br /> <br /> Sounds good, no. Well, it's really nothing wrong with the basic premise as the starting base of the martial arts / blaxploitation action thriller, which is what it is supposed to be the goal. The leadership also proved to be very good when Jeanne Bell was perfectly suited to the role of "T.N.T." and Stan Shaw acts like an ambitious, powerful Charlie. Where it fails, it is in terms of the combat activity it offers. Combat scenes are utterly and utterly unconvincing and / or sometimes over the top that it reaches a point of ridicule that does not help when the action hero of Kung Fu is the core of your film. Also, poor lighting, actors, sports accents that make it difficult for them to understand, confusing camera work and sometimes even bad sound do not help this obvious low budget effort or any of them. It comes in one area that can please some fans, it offers a lot of T in "T&A", in fact virtually every battle scene in the movie is going on some type of nude scene and Jeanne Bell actually has one expanded battle scene in which is completely topless. Finally, it's not something you want to visit again because the battle scenes are so pathetic, ridiculously bad.
