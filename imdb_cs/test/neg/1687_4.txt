My wife and kids were billed as 00s own Cosby show - but unlike the other one, it was rude and unobservable. In fact, it is so badly written, and some of the jokes revolve around Michael Mickey taking Michael Jr's stupidity and the fact that he is such a loser who has become more and more tedious and annoying when the show continues. What was to be a promising hit, eventually turned into a stupid, stupid show later, where ideas became such OTTs and ridiculous. As for the other Claire, I didn't really understand this figure: she became a corrupt, childish and sighing teenage brat, in most later episodes. rather it was just a poor black sitcom according to general standards.
