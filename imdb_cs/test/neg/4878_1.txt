After I saw this movie, I didn't want my money back. I wanted my time back. I wanted an hour and a half back in my life - it was the most amazing, outrageous torture I knew I had missed the precious minutes of my life on this trick. I'm obviously busy, and since this "movie" came into my life, I had trouble sleeping. I'm trying to suppress memories, I really am. . . but they cause me to burn things. <br /> <br />
