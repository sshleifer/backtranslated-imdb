I gave "Airport" 79 just two stars because it's a really crappy movie. Nobody who has anything to do with it deserves any praise (except for Charo's Chihuahua, who has a pretty good job in his role.) That doesn't mean the film isn't worth watching. It helps if you have a buzz but it's not essential. <br /> <br /> A'79 really looks like an early "Airplane!" Each scene has set-up and payout, and scenes in a row, as if they were completely disconnected. One of my favorite recurring points is that passengers, crew and aircraft will get on, no matter what. Are you a reporter and in your house a strange guy is murdered in your house? Then the pursuer chases you to the roof? No problem. You can still catch that morning flight to Paris ... there's no need for cops to get involved. Your plane avoids one unmanned rocket, four rockets looking for heat and cannon fire from an unknown Phantom fighter, makes roller cylinders, immobile dives, and landing without impact without reversing in this process? No problem, we'll have the mechanics check the oil and get you on the road in a couple of hours. It's really funny. And I admit that there is a bit of an anarchist in me, when the passengers don't pay attention to the cabinet. The highlight is when the operator tells Jimmie Walker that he will have to put down his saxophone (God will save me from the flight sitting in front of a jazz saxophonist!) Before the start. Basically, Jimmie says, "No." Later, during the flight, the sax is damaged in a cylindrical cylinder, and Jimmie actually appears on the next leg of the flight with another sax that does not set aside. This aspect of the movie is just fun. (The ONE actually listens to the subscriber. When Charo says he can't take his dog for a flight, he leaves the plane. Naturally, it's because you can't get a good look at her ass and tits while sitting.) <br /> <br In short, a horrible movie, but pretty horrible to be a little funny. Unfortunately, filmmakers and cast don't deserve any credit at all, because it was probably completely unintentional.
