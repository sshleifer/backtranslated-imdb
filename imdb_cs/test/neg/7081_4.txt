As a documentary, it is a laugh in the camp, such as the Schlock Collection of newly created Bible tables, which mix with the so-called "Experts". Think about it as an infomarketing that pushes Jesus instead of Jesus' masters. However, the detailed scene of crucifixion is superior to similar scenes in widescreen Hollywood extravagans such as "Ben-Hur", "King of Kings" and "The Greatest Story Ever" in terms of historical precision. over his shoulders to his outstretched arms. Nails are not routed through his palms, but instead through his wrists. His legs are not nailed apart, but one is placed over the other, so just use one nail. By the way, Rubinstein's flogging before his crucifixion ranks 35th in the book, "Lash! One hundred big scenes of men who are whipped in movies." Of course, Rubinstein and two thieves wear modest loincloths, which are probably not true to the shameful reality of the Roman crucifixion, but contributions must be made. Curiously, a "good" thief is placed on the left side of Jesus, who goes against a long tradition. It is precisely because this thief plays a poetic, overweight man, but it is a mystery, especially given that the "bad" thief is something like a "piece".
