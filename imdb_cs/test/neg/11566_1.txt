In fact, it was terrible. Of course, the main chick in it, which was topless, slept with the director. She was shot in a warehouse that was probably owned by family or friends. They also decided not to bother to come up with the story. Sure, these are ways to cut costs, but are they smart ways to keep costs down? Are not. At the very least, they could find a high school student at the "Creative Writing" course. At least the children could have a lesson on the structure of stories. At the very least, they could read the 3 act structure, but obviously not a priority one. Watching these jerks running around in funny clothes that were stupid by the 1980s standards were embarrassing. The fact that none of these actors committed suicide in humiliation is probably a testimony to the limited distribution this film has received. If the actors had actually seen the end result of their hard work, a lot of people would be waiting to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge. I'd give this movie to 10/10 stars, but it just deserves 1 for being released. This film should be shown to film students everywhere. It's better than 90% of student movies I've seen and wow is this movie piece shiiiit.
