I bought this movie from a gas station in a 3.99 basket for one reason: Billy Drago, who is one of my favorite actors. He's terribly scary and good, but he stops there. The film itself is a stupid, horrible scary attempt at the fearsome western and cannot even succeed in merging the two genres. Behavior alongside Draga is so bad that I wanted to put a couch pillow over my ears, production values ​​do not exist and the script does not even know where to start. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost if you are a fan of Drago like me. Terrible, shameful, unforgivable.
