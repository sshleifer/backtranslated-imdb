Lonesome Jim is something like a romantic dark comedy about a dysfunctional family whose two boys are totally defeated. Both boys around 30, living at home with nothing. I live in the Midwest and I can't name such a family. I picked it up because I'm glad it's humor. Now I realize that I need to counter this humor to make it work. Working with camera and camera editing was fine. The first 15 minutes you have set, and the last 15 minutes have helped prevent the film from being a totally depressed Jerry Springer trash type story trailer. My family members begged me to turn it off, but I won under the assumption that there must be a turning point at the end and we watched the movie. As expected, male family members simply left after the first 30 minutes.
