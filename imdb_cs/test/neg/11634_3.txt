Two years after leaving the small town of Grover's bend to meet Krity, Brad Brown returns for a time with his grandmother for Easter. Meanwhile, Krite eggs begin to hatch. As the city's troubles, Brown & Burgess, as well as extraterrestrial hunter hunters who have returned to their destination, have to fight bloodthirsty furballs before they wipe out the city. The original critics were a lesser attempt to tear the family horror of "Gremlins". She became a cult favorite on video shelves and was so successful that she requested a sequel. This sequel reduces horror and makes his entire focus comedy place. Unfortunately, the comic part is extremely clumsy as well as childish. Acting is on the same level as the rest of the film. It is this film that suffers from a weak scenario. Visual effects are quite well done. Degree: D + Review by M. K. Geist.
