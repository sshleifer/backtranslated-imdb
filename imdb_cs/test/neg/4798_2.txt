He just saw Coronado ... Around is the only line they came up with, it's "from the FX team for Independence Day". I think it says a lot. Not to talk about writers, directors, actors ... <br /> <br /> It's a cute little adventure story set in a banana republic in Central America, but the storyline is thin. <br /> <br /> All through the movie I kept thinking about how much this movie looks like cut-scenes from some action computer war game. Even though they are nice, they are too often visible. Like CG-style cut scenes like Command'n'Conquer. Almost immediately you know that a particular vehicle, background, bridge, castle or fighter never existed. The view is smooth and nice, but not up to the standard we expected today from Action Adventures. The film lacks much apparent filming on the spot. Acting, the storyline is below average and FXs are nice but not up to the feature film standard. I'm not surprised that it went directly to video / DVD. <br /> <br />
