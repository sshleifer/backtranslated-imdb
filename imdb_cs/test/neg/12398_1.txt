Imagine the most beautiful b-movie horror plot you can. Add more holes to fences than a fence. Have it written for 10 years. Make a play done by drama students who pretend really bad accents in the US (on the Isle of Man!) Add special monster effects that will be appreciated by B&W Dr Who. The result: duff film. Throw Samantha Janus off her dress (make it on the cover) and you'll probably sell enough copies to make a profit anyway!
