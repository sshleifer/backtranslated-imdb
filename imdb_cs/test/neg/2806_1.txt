If you were in the east of Europe (or even in their armed forces), you may consider this film interesting. I don't know why it says comedy (there are a few fun moments here), but it's not a good movie if one of the regular officers talks about socialism successes for Christmas for 15 minutes. Officers in general behave like funny oafi, soldiers run at base to meet their girls at night, and surprise, surprise, one of the girls is the daughter of the commander. The East German Army was known for its defamatory and humiliating service to its consumers, and the comedy did not basically flourish on equipment or equipment to create a good East German film and their time was over. Yet some actors and actresses have tried to act well, but they have only come out in roles they know from East German television and a few small movies. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, it was basically boring and very cheap.
