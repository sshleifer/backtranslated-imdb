A slow, weird movie that pulls and plods (I mean really PLODS) along with its disappointing climax. At the end you can expect some punchline, but none is. Both Milland and Snodgress perform unpleasantly; in fact, the strangeness of the film can actually be the only thing it has done for it. Generally the atmospheric score has some absurd parts (like the music that plays during the first appearance of the monkey), and there is a really awful fantasy scene involving .... gorilla. (**)
