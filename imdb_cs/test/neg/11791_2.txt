I suppose this movie was supposed to be "cool" for 1961, but looking back (45 years old) it's as silly as its fun value! True, special effects well on T.V. with a series that started in 1964 but for the big screen ??? I once had a fish tank that was just as exciting! I have to agree that the Octopus scene is coming to an end where it joined Seaview. Obviously, he is not well staged ... or trained! Overall, it's pretty bad playing with awkward special effects and I still recommend it - laughs for fun. That was probably one of Irwin Allen's greatest films, and I think he was thinking a lot. Barabara Eden continued to play "Genie" on T.V. Micheal Ansara was her husband. Now it's a great part about this movie! In the same film, I have always seen the real life of husbands and wives. Clean!
