I didn't care much about it, it seemed too proficient for the documentary. Even the film directors seemed to direct me towards certain characters, and yet I was completely unsympathetic to the protagonist because they showed me what they chose. This film disappointed me because the story and the people were interesting, but the film fell flat for clever editing that didn't allow the viewer enough time to understand each scene. The evolution of the story was overlooked instead of being discovered by boxing men or other things that were random in the story they told. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that you skip this and read this story.
