In this film, Gary Oldman plays an advocate who was previously a prosecutor. He's a little bit annoyed, but he's more or less playing an ordinary guy than some pictorial or literal monster. The funny thing is, he won't pull him out. I think you can't get out of there. Kevin Bacon was scary enough. The park scene was too long with too many false fears. And the strange sex scene with Oldman and Karen Young seemed to come from another film, though Miss Young was fine for the rest of her time. This film suffers from a strangeness that tries to conceal predictability. And failure. Don't bother.
