Bela Lugosi as God? Transvestites discussed in the movie in the fifties? Glyly, that must be Ed Wood's movie. Watching this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure and nausea all at the same time. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter-ego Glenda. If this movie was created, I'd see Kevin Kline Glen / Glenda playing. Note how all alter egos are cross-dressers' versions of their male name (Glen / Glenda, Robert / Roberta, etc.). He attempts to sympathetically portray it as a mental disorder that is, rather than a graphic perversion. Wood manages to break into slavery and the S&M sequence into his initial Glen / Glenda story. Along with these ritual scenes, Satan himself appears to have a bad day. There is no dialogue and pace, but the film is pleasant in its context - the strange world of Ed Wood.
