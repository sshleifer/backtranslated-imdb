I can't actually think of one good point in this movie. The story is terrible. He acts as dull as a carrot and the script is so bad you want to kill yourself. OK alright, if you love (and you have to love it to understand) snowboarding you can enjoy microscopically better because it has big mountains and some cool movements, but besides, it's awful. He has some absolutely stupid ideas and it is a racist way that both black and white people offend each other's races. The only time you laugh is when you laugh at stupidity or feel embarrassed. I've seen a lot of movies and I have to say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen. If you have this movie I would recommend that you get it back to where you bought it and get the money back.
