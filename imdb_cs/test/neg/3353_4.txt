The thread horror trip has an innocent teen (Meg Tilly, appealing as always) attempting to get into good with the popular click at school (despite the fact that they seem to hate her total) and let themselves be exposed to their sorority-like initiation: spending night in a haunted mausoleum. Despite the lack of originality, this low-budget thriller can handle some decent special effects and has some good performances (especially Robin Evans, crazy greed as a leader of the girls). The scenario is not razor sharp, but it has enough jokes to make the procedure somewhat bearable. ** of ****
