I need to comment on it !!! <br /> <br /> First, it is necessary to ironically add a "companion alert" to match the IMDb parameters, but there is nothing that should be "spoiled". br /> <br /> There are six characters: a pretty gallery, whose A-list mountain guide in the "climb" and apparently among all the guides (including Mt. Everest Sherpas) on the planet; her lost love that has disappeared from the front cover two years before what the party is supposed to find, but never finds; her store owner friend, also a guide who can be better than a sheriff, but no match for her; a strange chief actor dedicated to his service and saying that in the treaty they will find their long missing love; his one companion, a computer hacker with allegedly unlimited experience, at a level that Gates could give him; and his other colleague, a bodyguard who seems to have an IQ near three digits. There are, of course, criminal going-ons, and the secret search for a leading actor is to get a healing satellite that has fallen into a "pass" and has world-changing and unique data that bring them countless wealth. Exactly what has never been revealed. Exceeding excessive amounts, the scenario looks like something C-in freshman writing in the first year (but F if presented at a higher level) and thespians devour each set as a horde of beavers. The most interesting aspects of this movie for me were juxtaposing portions with three other moves or roles I saw. First, the mysterious, unpublished secret data makes one remember the "Spanish prisoner," part of the A-leaf / Mamet film surrounding a valuable business process that has never been specifically clarified but better . Definitely not here. Secondly, the lead biscuit may have been even more inventive than "Rambo" in a quick solution when it appeared later in the presentation. Third, I remember Steven Seagal flickering (not remembering the title) where he was semi-conscious and abed about 1/3 of the time, and fully comatose to the next 1/3. Although I didn't try to observe a lot of his work, I saw enough to notice that while comatose, he provided the best job he had ever had, and most in-line with his laconic persona. In this opus, while awake, a young hacker may have been the most interesting personality on the screen, but while indisposed and unable during the latter part, and unable to emotion, he provided the best playing during this seemingly endless two hours. Here's a thin, stupid foundation. Imagine being compressed into, say, SNL, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Martin Short in four roles. They could get a recording of laughter with some changes in the dialogue here. The most interesting aspect of the latest analysis is thinking about what information could be in a spy satellite that is worth "even billions" on any one of them. many nations, and yet made worthless (by the guru hacker) if it is simply placed on the internet, without obvious consequences afterwards? Even Turkey, like this one, should have some trace of logic somewhere. This one is completely plain.
