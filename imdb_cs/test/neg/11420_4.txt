There are rumors that it will become the fourth underworld. If so, the third part, which is also a prequel, would be in the middle of the series. With prequels that follow the original movies, you always ask yourself in what order you should watch movies, so it makes sense ... <br /> <br /> In this case, I think it doesn't matter. The third underworld movie is not on the same level as the other two. They also had their obvious shortcomings, but this lacks a few things and looks like cash. It looks like it's not full throttle, which is a shame because the actors could work better with the material. The story is fine, but it's nothing special. Nice movie, but Rhona Mitra couldn't fill Beckinsale shoes (yes, she plays a different character, I mean the void that Kate B. has gone)
