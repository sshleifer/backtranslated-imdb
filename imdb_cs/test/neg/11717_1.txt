After completing this hellish piece of basket, a friend and I promised a promise that we would never talk about how we just beat up the last 90 minutes of our lives. This film is a totally pointless, two-dimensional hero and heroin that we can't hoof to survive, and some of the most beautiful villains sometimes darken the horror screen (or any other genre). To prove how unnecessary this film is, I'd like to add a plot, but I can't write fiction. The only reason I can think that someone would like to see this movie is if they just murdered the entire community and were looking for some of their own suffering punishment, which would haunt you for the next few years!
