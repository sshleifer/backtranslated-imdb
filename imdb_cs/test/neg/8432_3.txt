The art teacher encounters an antique wooden bed made of ginkgo trees and puts it in her apartment, but has a terrible history and becomes a hunted ancient spirit that keeps its human form torn by people's hearts. > <br /> This beautifully crafted horror movie? Well, in fact, it's more fantasy / romance than anything else that provokes some chills and provides some stunning visuals, but the plot was hardly interesting enough and the scripting scenario lacked any life. The problem was that most of the time I tried to keep my finger from the button forward. Certainly it would speed up the slow pace of the movie, but then I wouldn't know again what was going on, which was quite difficult to find or keep in the first place. The performances ranged from too melodramatic or just plain boring, and that's probably because these characters are unconvincing, outdated, and inducing coma. The real back story of an old bed and ghost is incredibly boring and chaotically compiled, with too much focus on poor romance, laughter when it shouldn't be, and overall it is constructed in a normal way that lacks oomph or condemnation to carry the film. The shortcomings of the story are compensated by really artistic paintings that looked spectacular, but the use of some paintings somewhat impressed me with what it really meant for the film. What catches you is a faded color scheme, but sometimes the real screen will look really grainy or snowy. Although it shows the raw intensity of the production valves, it also adds some nice polished effects that fit well with the soothing but sometimes nervous score. Working with the camera was very diverse (though it didn't add too much), but there were too many nearby windows or dark lighting during some more positive scenes, making it difficult to understand what you see. Also at the show are some nice moments of blood and gore, but not obviously large or distinguishable from most other movies. Letargically special film, with light images that look like something from painting, but still not very tempting. Beware, it could make you in a deep trance!
