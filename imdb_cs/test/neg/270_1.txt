I didn't expect a lot when I went to see it, but my god did disappointment. The original was fun in his genre, but that's so bad, I felt abused when I left the theater. There is no spike, it's not funny, it's not nice to watch, it's embarrassed. After an hour, I was hoping my patience would be rewarded, but now I regret not leaving the theater. Do yourself a favor and ignore this, look when it comes to a small screen. Or you can see it on the DVD budget, no matter what you don't waste money on it. Don't say I warned you.
