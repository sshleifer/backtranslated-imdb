In the opening scene, you feel you are watching high school play. But I saw high school games with better acting! Every line was delivered so clearly that I felt like I was watching the actors work instead of seeing the characters. I found that the development of the characters is poor and the actions are very forced! I found out that 25 minutes into the movie I didn't really care about what happened because the story was too obvious and I was bored. I still hung there and waited for the film to buy, but it never happened. Nurse Theresa was too sweet, even for a nun, yet she seemed impulsive and slightly manipulative. Overall, I was powerful disappointed.
