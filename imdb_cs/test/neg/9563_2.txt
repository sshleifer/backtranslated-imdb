It goes without saying that a mode of allowance must be made when a real story is adapted to a large screen. But if you're making a fairy tale that has nothing to do with what actually happened - why call it Bugsy and persuade viewers that it was a lovely story? The Godfather trilogy handles many real characters and events, once in America, but does not claim to tell true stories. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br In the movie, Benny has this great gambler's vision of Eldorado; in real life Lansky had to argue him to go to Nevada. Benny considered the counterpart to be an idiot of Monte Carlo and he would rather continue his life as a playboy in L.A. But of course it's the hero of the film, so naturally his idea had to be. In the film, Benny wants to use Count diFrasso to approach Mussolini to murder him because he was Hitler's partner and Hitler eventually killed the Jews in the gas chambers. Apparently we should like Benny so the screenwriters have invented this nonsense. In real life, at that time no one knew about the gas chambers, at least Benny, who was not interested in politics at all. In fact he used the Countess's connection and he visited Mussolini, but not to kill him, but to sell explosives to him. During his stay in Italy he even met Goebbels and Goering. The whole Greenberg subplot was nonsense. Greenberg did not change his stool pigeon, sought refuge at Benny, Benny didn't kill him (except for Albert Tannenbaum) ... at least they got a name. I think it was supposed to be very romantic for Virginia to return to Benny and offer him the money she stole. The film even goes so far as to tell us through text panels that after the assassination of Benny, she has woefully returned the money to Lanski. Let me say that revisionism is simply no more rude than this. This list is by no means exhaustive - is there a problem with Benny's family that doesn't live in LA, how Benny deals with Dragna and Adonis, Costello's view (unpleasant company type), Lansky (kind Teddy Bear), Benny himself (an aging windbag who wouldn't reach the age of 12 if he regularly went "bugs" in situations like the movie) And what's more, who doesn't look good either Benny Siegl's charisma) and many more. Apart from a few hard facts, there is nothing in this movie. <br /> <br /> * SPOILERS END HERE * <br /> <br /> All in all, it's one mafia movie that can be even more ridiculously bad than Harlem, NY. But honor where honor is: This is a performance in itself.
