This movie is terrible. If you are thinking of this movie ... DO NOT use two words. It's tasteless, the story is really lame and the jokes are even worse. Acting is really pathetic. I can't believe this movie was made. You better watch American Pie, Going Greek or Road Trip if you're in the mood for a teenage comedy. It's about two girls heading to Malibu for their Spring Break. As usual, they didn't do much planning and called (I think her name Michelle) is an uncle falling to his estate in Malibu. Uncle Bennie strictly forbids them to have any kind of party, and as you guess, they continue and do it. Please, I'm asking you not to see this movie.
