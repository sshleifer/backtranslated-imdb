Don't get me wrong, I love most of Paul Schrader's movies, so it was with excitement that I could take part in the "Rolling Thunder" screening at the Paris French Film Festival with a surprise on December 17, 2004. I was too). The film was then finished, but the score, so P Schrader used excerpts from the Return of the King and some other film I forgot (Was it Conan?). By the way, the film was finalized. A few happy people (about 200 people) have been told not to write about the film on the Internet or magazines because it might have jeopardized his chance to get to the Cannes Film Festival. Then came the film, then came to the realization that the film does not have to be chosen for the festival because of its quality: I have never experienced such a sense of embarrassment in the audience because people have gone from skeptics to laugh out loud. the spectacle of full regret. I couldn't believe how low the Light Sleeper, Mishima, Blue Collar, and Affliction had sunk. Forcedly acting, stupid ending, black and white moral, horrible FX, the worst on Christianity from Schrader ever, not thrilling, just boring as hell (no pun intended) and not surprising at all! Some good locations, but unfortunately missing or at least not fulfilling the initial hope! Finally, I was 100 times more satisfied with Schrader, who had Rolling Thunder, and wished I could get back 2 hours back. Don't believe the humbug, even John Boorman's movie is more exciting and original. Oh, and Billy Crawford casting, poor man doing his best, but what about where you expect? Now he is part of a small club of the worst casting mistakes! I give film 1/5 just because I didn't leave the room, but I should have.
