Bad news for anyone who wants to shoot a feature-length parody of the Lifetime Network movie - the creators of the Deadly Meeting have done it, though unintentionally. All life trophies are there - a divorced mother in danger from a frightened stalker, an unreliable ex-husband (who, of course, cheated her as they were married), and a police department that patronizingly rejects her complaints, forcing her to stand up . A particularly deteriorating jaw is a scene in which the heroine, after being raped and attempting to murder her mother with her seemingly ubiquitous stalker, has decided to relieve stress by going shopping! When I first saw the co-worker harassing some of the sneaking she met in church, I know that chasing is not a joke, but it's definitely in this movie.
