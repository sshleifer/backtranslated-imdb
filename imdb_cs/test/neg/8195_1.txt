I remember watching this movie on television a few years ago. It was so bad, I just remember the scenes that made me laugh. The only summary of the plot I can give you (without spoilers) is a picture of a home movie created by high school kids. (Spoiler's record starts here ...) Run, chased by "Demon Cop" when in fact, a man was really chased by a Halloween costume messed up. The car jumps out of the blue, hitting the guy who ran. He sends him flying over him and what does the driver do? He watches the man falling, returning to the car and leaving. What would that hairy delt do? I'd like to at least ask if the guy was okay. Then some black man stares at Demon Copa in the face, then, later, tells reporters, "I didn't get a good look at him." My sisters and I were almost choked with laughter until then. Then there is a scene in the aisle where this afro girl pulls a machine gun out of the machine gun. little small handbag. It couldn't have been FIT !! I barely remember some scenes. Maybe it's because they were just so bad. The cops in the movie can't even jump the fence and the acting is so wooden that it makes wood planks better. All in all, this film brings shame to Hollywood, more than any other flop could. You have to see it to believe your handy kitsch conspiracy that doesn't have as I can say.
