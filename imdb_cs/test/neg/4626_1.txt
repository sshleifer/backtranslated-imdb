I saw it on the Sci-Fi Channel, so I knew it would be wrong to start, but I was surprised how worse it was than expected. CG effects on the dragon were terrible, even for the Sci-Fi channel, and the writing was pathetic. I couldn't tell if it was as stupid as a joke or if it worked out like that. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it's so horrible that it's almost funny, especially the part where Patrick Swayze's knight goes home to his father Knight, who retired after losing his legs and now on the bed your armor for the sole purpose of letting the audience know it is a knight. Most of the film focuses on the huge dragon eggs that hatch into a not-so-great baby dragon with some of the worst CGI I've ever seen. That was just awful.
