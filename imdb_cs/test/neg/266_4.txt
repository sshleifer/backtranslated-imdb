I enjoyed Oceans 11, I thought it was quite nice, show and direction help. But I was disappointed with this film. Don't get me wrong, it's not a complete bagpipe, thanks to the stellar performances of Brad Pitt, Catherine Zeta-Jones, George Clooney and Matt Damon, and especially the effective direction from Steven Soderbergh. However, the film really suffers from a really lethargic stimulation, some movies were so slow that I almost fell asleep between one key twist. Second, the plot is very intricate and there are many twists and turns that make it difficult to keep up. The camera was not as innovative as it was in the first movie. While in the first film it was smooth and professional, it was jerky and embarrassing, and the music was not particularly unforgettable. The screenplay was also not so funny or funny, and the film felt antisimatic. At the end of the day, it was all a little lazy, despite professional play and direction. So much potential, but a missed opportunity. Bethany Cox
