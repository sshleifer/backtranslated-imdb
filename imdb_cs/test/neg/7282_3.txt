So, it came to this. In the commentary on this film, which was best rated, someone says, "Nishi is an honest man". Really? This is the person who mainly kills and sorry people in the movie. It takes a short break to rob the bank. Honest? How would you like your children to go to school with someone who honors? Wait, there's more! The person also says, "We can say he is constantly thinking." How can we do that? You know the joke "How can you say when he's lying? CEO / politician / lawyer?" "His lips are moving." Well, Nishi's lips never move, so I think that means he thinks. Existentialism is said to emphasize that the individual assumes responsibility for the consequences of his actions. Not Nishi. Borrow money from yakuza. What, they want it back? Kill them. The police will find out. Kill yourself and your wife. <br /> <br /> Really honest.
