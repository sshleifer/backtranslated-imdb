Everyone can make a film these days. Budget, production value, or an experienced crew may not stop the described "director" from "realizing their dream". Respect for the craft of filmmaking, or even respect for no cinematic aesthetic is no longer a prerequisite for truly performing the film. Director Bill Cowell had to think that when Lion's Gate decided to sell his original movie as a sequel to a movie that had nothing to do with. far more by mistake than Cowell's Dark Harvest 2, which is open to the public. The deceptive marketing of this film should be investigated by the Attorney General's state office and the officers of the Lion Gate should be treated in sulfuric acid and kerosene for their total disregard for film, film and good sense. <br /> <br /> It's not worth commenting on the film itself.
