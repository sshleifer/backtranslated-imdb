I had some expectations from this movie, because 1. It was Yash raj 2's production. Well, I have to say that I just couldn't sit in this movie. Uday, (with red lips-what were makeup artists thinking ???!) Trying to look cool but unhappy. I won't even start playing (if he can say it). 'Cleavage queen' Tanisha, with all her screaming and boastful rantings, makes you pull your hair out of frustration. I think Uday was a little more tolerant than her! She really needs to take lessons from her sister. The story is pathetic ... the same old proven formula. Absolutely no originality. There is nothing interesting to watch in this movie. I wonder why it came first!
