It is unthinkable for me how anyone could enjoy or laugh in this film. I'd say it's the worst movie I've seen in years, and I see many of them. Maybe I forgot about junior high? It is also very difficult to believe that this is the same thing that Jeff Daniels did to George Washington in The Crossing. Looks like he's gone to the tank since he was doing Dumber. Can you believe he even wrote and ordered this waste?
