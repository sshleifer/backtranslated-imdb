This item does not contain a spoiler. It doesn't have to. The film is as predictable as the sunrise. The first element in the first Alien films was the tension that might have happened. This was so in the first two films of the Predator, though less prevalent. The requisition completely removed the element of tension and replaced it with blood and gore. You know people will die (well rainbow, that's AvsP movie), but you know that WHO will die and die, and where they die before it happens. Directors should take the lesson from Hitchcock, who said, "Tension is not a time bomb that spreads under the table. What is the point of going to the movie when you know exactly what will happen and when? If you really want to really watch this movie, wait for it to come out on the video and then RENT IT, but I would never buy it.
