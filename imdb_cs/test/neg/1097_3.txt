Director J.S. Cardone is something a little scary and a little scary, but nothing more. The widowed mother Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) inherits a home in the mountains of Pennsylvania; so he takes two daughters and moves into the vast estate of what appears to be in the middle of nowhere. But it's somewhere, somewhere some 90 years ago, a tragic mining accident has claimed the lives of many children who were forced to work in the dark and dunes. It seems that the area and especially the Tunny estate are being persecuted by the spirits of the small evil souls. The legend is that screaming children appear in the moonlight to seek revenge; and believe it. Also in cast: Ben Cross, Scout Taylor-Compton, Chloe Moretz, Julie Rogers and Geoffrey Lewis.
