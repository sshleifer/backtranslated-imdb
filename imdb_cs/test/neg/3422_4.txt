Play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between 1604 and 1606. Many other versions of the game have been produced since, including remakes completed in 1948, 1971 and 2006. Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957 entitled "Kumonosu j√¥." The game begins with King Duncan on the success of his two generals, Macbeth and Banquo, in a recent battle with the Irish and Norwegians. After a quick promotion from Duncan, Macbeth instantly gains an unusual feeling of lust, greed and power, and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown: though it involves murder. Geoffrey Wright tried to create his own version of the famous game in 2006 by setting it up in the modern Melbourne underworld. Just imagine the humble Macbeth killing hundreds of AK-47 soldiers and raping his own renditions, "Low" at the same time. You're just kidding about this, but one thing he's doing is to say traditional Shakespeare. And he's holding the whole movie. That is right! Shakespeare meets the ghetto. It's all you could hope for! No?? The latest Macbeth is pretty rough and violent to deal with any other modern action movie, but lacks decent gameplay, genuine jargon, and good camera work. A modernized film starts with Macbeth (Sam Worthington), who works as a drug and drug dealer for Duncan (Gary Sweet), a drug lord from Melbourne, Australia. After Duncan has been promoted to Thane of Glamis (as predicted by the three witches), Macbeth begins his aspiration when looking at the throne. After the promotion of Macbeth, Duncan invites himself to Macbeth's house for the night of drugs and alcohol. Before the festivities begin, Lady Macbeth (Victoria Hall) speaks to Macbeth to kill Duncan to take over the throne. When the bodyguards are drunk and everyone is asleep, Macbeth sneaks into Duncan's room and stabs him to death. After his murder, Macbeth takes all Duncan's possessions including to hide the title and crown. As soon as he thinks he has what he wants, he finds it will take more than bribery and run to solve his problems. One of the main mistakes of the movie was acting. Once seemingly beautiful and empowered, Macbeth suddenly turns into sissy. The whole movie looks like a sad puppy. I don't really know if it was Worthington's or Wright's fault, but in any case one of the two should realize that Macbeth was a king, not a knot on the log that all his wife had to say literally. As I said earlier, Macbeth should be rude, arrogant and malicious. But when his character turns into a drug lord, he changes the personality. On the other hand, Lady Macbeth really knew how to invade her when she came to know and personify her character. It seemed not as sinister as it was in the game or in the 1971 version, but reminds Macbeth that, compared to murder, anything else he could do would disagree. Another thing I found out was nasty nudity. This argument was supposed to be Wright's fault. The witches didn't do a bit of acting unless you say you go after your birthday suit. At one point in the movie, I wondered if I was watching Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol. 2. Don't be mistaken when I say that Shakespeare's dialogue is out of place. They speak flawlessly, but when the Australian gangster talks, it's really weird. When Macbeth starts killing people, he first tells them to speak with them in English Ye Olde. Macbeth contains a lot of actions, blood, gore, and nudity to endure anyone for life. You forget all the positive facts when you start thinking about yourself: "Well, what the hell did he say in the last sentence?" In some places in the movie, I don't even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying. The new movie age could be easily removed, not for "Thou's" and "Thee". Working with the camera was just fair to me. One thing I couldn't stand was constant stimulation among the characters. The camera technology used to release the vibrator Blair Witch and made me get up a bit. Matt Reeves has tried the same concept of working with a Clover camera, but it just doesn't work. This is for me to want to get out of my chair and look around for small barf bags that have comfortably planted on every seat in airplanes. Looking back at everything, gangsta 'Macbeth holds one positive: lots of action. Other than that, the film contains nothing more than uninspired acting, proper English use, and stomach-flip camera work. The audio track contains one or two identical songs, but each song is edited or remixed differently for each scene. Variations of interesting or captivating media never appear. From now on, directors should leave the dangerous drugs of the underworld Al Pacino and Robert Deniro. The future rendition of Macbeth should be created just as Shakespeare intended the game to be 400 years ago. I would recommend using medieval clothing Ye Olde English, swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enyou. But in any case, modern Macbeth is forcing you to long for some good folk music, camp fire, and buster.
