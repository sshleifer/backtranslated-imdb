If you really want to experience the magic (?) Of Don Dohler, then check out "Alien Factor" or maybe "Fiend", but not this. The Alien Factor is actually rather imaginative because of its low budget and it's quite scary, but "Nightbeast", which I think it's some kind of update to the Alien Factor, is just stupid. Actors walk through their roles, especially Mr. Monotone Sheriff, and the monster is some stupid Halloween-mask something that instead of wildly imaginative (but kind of stupid) looking animals from the Alien Factor. The spacecraft crashes on Earth, and there is, of course, an animal in it that runs around the evaporation of humans. And tearing weapons, etc. And it has a cool weapon that it uses to vaporize people when it gets out of hand. And that's really about it. "Alien Factor" beats this mess hands down, if you really want to see a good movie of Don Dohler, check it instead. A RIP by Don Dohler, 12/2/06.
