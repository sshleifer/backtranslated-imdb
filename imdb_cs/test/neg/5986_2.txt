I lived next to the author in 1980 when he first moved to Portland from Downer's Grove, Illinois, with two of his high school friends. He seemed to be a normal man, though he had a lot of artistic assumptions. In a few years, he jumped into the Portland post-punk music scene with his friend Phil and several others, and a band that was definitely not going anywhere, even though it gave him a lot of action, including playing with Courtney Love in her Portland groupie days. He seemed to think that his musical prospects were good enough to move to San Francisco, then to N.Y.C. I was surprised to hear that in '95 he got a publishing house after the band crashed and burned. Courtney Love's name seemed to be a clinic. I have no idea how the film was made, especially with this cast, but I doubt Gus Van Sant was involved. Anyway, it seems that the reviewers are not sure whether the lack of a narrative focus is intentional or not, so I would just say that this is the work of a pretty intelligent person who wants to be a writer or an artist or something, but not. I have nothing to say. Like Kerouac without benzedrine.
