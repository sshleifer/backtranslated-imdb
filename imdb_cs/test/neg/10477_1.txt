I saw this DVD on sale and bought it without a second thought, even though I didn't know it was out because it's one of my favorite books of all time. As soon as I returned home, I raced to look at him just to be completely disappointed. While it is true that this film is somewhat based on the book, the similarities end there. The characters change (ie Finny appears to be a more pompous blockbuster than anything else, while Gene seems somewhat stupid); thoughts. The film tries to portray some feeling that the previous one lacked, but it is done in a more subtle way that makes a flat boring movie. It is the depth of the character and the feeling that makes the book such a classic and this film will take these things and destroy them completely when rewriting.
