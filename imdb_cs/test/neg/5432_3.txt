It was a very publicized movie before it was released, but it turned out to be a bagpipe. I've never spoken to one person who likes this movie. I agree: I didn't like it either. Perhaps one big reason why it wasn't a box office success was that it had nothing but enemy characters in the story. For a while there - I don't know if it's still true - I didn't. t any movie in which Laura Linney or Dylan Walsh played something but annoying characters. This and a stupid story to make this movie a great disappointment, especially in view of this great buildup. Did the filmmakers really think this would be a hit?
