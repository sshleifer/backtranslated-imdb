As? I wondered why I didn't see it in theaters, or even for one ad, and then when I saw the movie, I realized I was cheated on HARDCORE. I am a big Transporter fan and a big Blade fan, so when I saw it, I imagined a killer scene in a fight between two badges, lots of weapons, a lot of things. Instead, I got the movie Ryan Phillippe with a short portrait from Statham and Snips. Whoever has audio and video in the lab got more time on screen than Wesley. It was like renting Jackie Chan, who was expecting a lot of kung fu and getting Erin Brockavich. I expect bad movies from Hollywood, but actors like Snipes and Statham should do better with the fan.
