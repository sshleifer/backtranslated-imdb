All you need is to read the cast list and credits that promise in anticipation of this DAVID COPPERFIELD, but unfortunately, unfortunately! How much of a major acting and directorial talent could become one of the richest stories of literature in such a monumental BORE, is completely out of me. It's nice to see a beautiful photo, especially Yarmouth, but JUST PLAIN DULL !!! No need to move on! Skip it and check out Selznick or the amazing 80's mini-BBC series.
