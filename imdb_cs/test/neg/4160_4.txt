*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> I saw the movie last night at the screening. I started to love Tim Robbins and loving sci-fi. The first third of the movie was very cool. The score was good, the cinematography was interesting, the vision of the filmmaker of the future was realistic, but still interesting. I remember thinking, "This is the most intelligent sci-fi movie I've ever seen". Then they just couldn't keep it together. Although, from the outset, there were many more "rough edges" with this film (specifically, editions and later writing). / development of land), these questions were forgiven. They became unforgivable once the film lost all momentum around half the way, and then the movie got bored when you realized it wasn't going anywhere. Robbins couldn't breathe life into his character, but he did what he could. His female counterpart (her name misses me now) was good in her role. The main reason for the film's meandering was that filmmakers couldn't decide whether to make a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story. They ended up with none of them. Good: <br /> <br /> Some of the cinematography: grainy, sometimes it looked like "21 days later". Very suitable for a futuristic movie like this. <br /> <br /> I dug several shots out of position. <br /> <br /> Music was great. <br /> <br /> The vision of the filmmakers of the future was realistic, but still cool and interesting. <br /> <br /> I liked the interaction with other minor characters in the movie. Some of them were interesting (soon). The girl who played Maria Gonzales (name can't remember) was good. <br /> <br /> *** SPOILERS POST *** <br /> <br /> Several questions / comments: <br /> <br /> I felt that many futuristic things in this movie were good for patchwork story repair. Specifically, VIRUSES. Obviously, the virus they gave her at the end of the movie, which physically feared him, was just there to be able to stick to another sexual scene and then report it uncontrollably to Code 46. erasing memory and ending the movie. Classical 'dream sequences' ending when you ask me. connects all the loose ends very neatly if you just do all this dream dream? Was Robbin a character naturally good as intuition, or was it a virus? Why don't you explore a myriad of questions about a girl who is his mother's clone? That could make an interesting story. <br /> <br /> At first I like greetings from all over the world in everyone's speech. But this has become disruptive, especially since their accents were not convincing. I understand that the future will undoubtedly be more racially and culturally androgynous, but at the end it began to feel like a commercial commercial by AT&T Global Networking. <br /> <br /> If they were “out”, how could they get busted for Code 46? <br /> <br /> 'Cover' has never been precisely defined. Sometimes it seemed trivial as a visa and at other times it was just as important as life or death. Again, free definitions allow them to use them to bond various parts of a graph together. Well, I'm getting into the negative for it, so I'll stop. There were some cool scenes, and interesting things about this movie, but it just gives 4/10
