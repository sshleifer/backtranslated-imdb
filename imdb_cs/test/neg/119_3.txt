Technically I'm Van Damme Fan, or I was. This movie is so bad that I hated myself for losing those 90 minutes. Don't let the name Isaac Florentine (Undisputed II) deceive you, I had great hopes for this, depending on what I saw (undisputed II), man .. I was wrong ?? all the action fans wanted a great comeback for the classic action hero, but I think we won't be able to see it soon because our hero still comes with those (go-to-the-border-the-city-and-kill) -films-bad-guys- non-comeback-home) I think for God, we are in 2008, and insist that at all levels they will make those disappointed movies. Why ?? Do yourself a favor, skip it .. seriously.
