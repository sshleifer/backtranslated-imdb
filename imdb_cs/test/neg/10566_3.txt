The massive alien beastie crashes on Earth and soon destroys mankind by first using its laser gun to dissolve in the dust of almost every person it captures (that is, when its target is not terribly gone) and later its bare claws with which it teases and eats spleen! All in all, it's pretty stupid. I have to give him some points for being fun at times. Actually, at the beginning I enjoyed a mindless battle weapon and some of the later best effects. However, this does not help when a monster gives the movie only really fun moments and he is not on the screen for much of the movie running. Negotiations in this direction are just horrible and amateurish, and our hero Sheriff Cinder is too unattractive to be the bag of the hottest movie. I also have to take points to copy the AGE FROM ANOTHER WORLD (1951) several times. When a monster is not on a rampage, NIGHTBEAST is too boring and eventually his attacks become so repetitive and predictable even they become less fun. Look at this backstage in 1951 THING and look at the characterization of the differences, attention to the plot and detail and creating tension makes the monster free.
