The creators probably had enough money to afford decent makeup effects, but not enough for a creature to move around and convincingly attack. We never get a chance to see a "monster" move from one place to another - whenever it happens (supposedly), the camera focuses on "frightened" reactions of people who are nearby. And when a man is attacked, he simply seems to be holding an inanimate object against himself to not fall to the ground. It still is not the worst "Alien" rip-off around (two "Xtro" movies are even worse, for example); it's actually fun if you have 68 minutes! (* 1/2)
