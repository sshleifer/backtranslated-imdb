As LIVING THE DREAM managed to get to Laemmle 5 in West Hollywood, it's over because it's the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I should have known when the first scene opened a breath, Eugene, Oregon, that the movie with the characters you want to love and apologize for being expelled from high school but can't, They're such losers, it's so wooden and cruel with dialogue who is behind the bad. Then, a clich√©, three losers of high school will end up in LA, and here's a movie where it could be realistic if it were. they showed them trying to find a career in acting. But no, one works as a used car salesman, the other is a real loser in a garage call center selling magazines. Even the bastard who leads this place has a greater audience appeal than the horrible actor with a terrible foreign accent. And fraudulently getting money from insurance fraud to start a recruitment manager who has no experience, just showed "supposed good life" in LA night spots with cast actors who are so woody and bad they don't have better SAG cards ... I could go on and on about the bad movie, but in the end I went out of the theater that had six people in the beginning and when I left four men, it was the only one in the audience. I wanted to like this movie, but I couldn't find any merit in story, characters, writing, dialogue or actors. The filmmaker should retire. Amen ... enough ...
