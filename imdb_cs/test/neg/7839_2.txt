That's not a good movie. If I have to, I can usually sit in the Van Damme movie because they're usually a little laughing and don't need many thoughts. This has no balancing functions. <br /> <br /> He has a significant lack of conspiracy, humor, acting, direction, etc. Real smelly at all levels. I've never left the cinema during the movie, even though I came here pretty damn close. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost.
