**** SOME SPOILERS **** <br /> <br /> There is nothing in this movie that you haven't seen before browsing the net. There's nothing shocking about this movie. In the film, a man tosses a goat, there's a bulldozer that breaks down, and a lesbian face burns. All these "extreme violence" scenes are so fake that you are wondering why someone would like to sketch this piece of rubbish again. I just can't believe I've spent hard earned money on what must definitely be the worst movie ever made. Don't let the reviews deceive you, this movie would be a shame for anyone who owns ... except jails that want to torture prisoners. For the classic REAL classification, check out Bloodsucking Freaks or even the newer Doom Generation. The island of death is sinking to the bottom of the movie toilet and must be washed out of existence.
