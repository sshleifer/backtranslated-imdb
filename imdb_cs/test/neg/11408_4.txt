I really love horror movies and try to give everyone I see as much credit (or sometimes more) as possible, but this is the fact that this ticket is really very similar, but most of them couldn't act at all - but then Think again about writing / dialogue of this mess ... some good makeup but totally ridiculous special fx. All in all, I give it 3 out of 10 - and I have a second thought about it !!
