I think "Category 6: Day of Destruction" was very unrealistic. Digital effects like child's drawing. The actors did not perform realistically, for example, when a girl was shot, she acted as if she had a tomato sauce. The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on. The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy, he was funny! <br /> <br /> Please keep real effects. <br /> <br /> I like the comment: "What did we do to piss-off mother nature?" <br /> <br /> I don't know what else to write to fill 10 lines. What else can I say that the film is so boring, I think my commentary will be just as boring.
