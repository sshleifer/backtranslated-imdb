Isabelle Huppert is a great actress. Director "La Pianiste" understands this and gives the viewer long shots of Huppert's face and it is a pleasure to see. Huppert is not an animated actor - he registers emotions with the slightest stroke of an eyebrow or a flick of a smile. <br /> <br /> In addition to the experience of watching an experienced actor he excels in his profession, nothing is this film that makes me recommend. (Well, if you like self-mutilation, sadomasochism and bizarre behavior, "La Pianiste" can work for you. In addition to these attributes, I found no redemption value in it.) People who compete at the highest level - musically, athletically, anything - start as strange people and are in a competitive environment formed into strangers. <br /> <br /> It's not worth a trip to the cinema to teach this life lesson again. <br /> <br />
