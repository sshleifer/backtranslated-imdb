Bean, Kevin and Perry, UK TV creations that made successful transitions to the big screen. Now it's Ali G's turn, and I'm afraid to say it's not one of them! Ali was always obscene, but funny. This film was extreme ill and not at all funny. Scenes involving bestiality, homosexual sex and pedophilia should not be displayed for fun. Ali G In Da House is a waste and deserves to earn very little money. <br /> <br /> 1 of 10
