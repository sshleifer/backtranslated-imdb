This film is not worth seeing, at least not in the cinema. The story is difficult to follow and understand (it starts 10 minutes of something that happens 3 years earlier). It's hard to know if this film is trying to be a comedy or it's just so bad / weird it sometimes seems. American sirens and lights on Swedish police cars are just one example. The behavior of Persbrandt and Bergqvist is as good as usual, but I think Jenny Lampa acts as Jasmin. Zara Zetterqvist behaves quite well, not long seen as an actress in Swedish films. If you want to see it, wait for it to release on the DVD or appear on the TV.
