Not to be confused with 1943 by George Zucco's film "Mad Werewolf", "The Mad Monster" is a movie that Zucco appeared in the year before. Zucco, in this rather painterly affair, is perfecting the way to turn his dull cutter Petro into a wolf / male hybrid by wolf blood injections, and then losing little time in sending a transformed doof to kill former colleagues who ridiculed his experiments. It's a very simple chart, really extremely low budget production. Glenn Strange, who plays a man / wolf here, would soon achieve greater fame in playing Franky monsters in movies such as "Frankenstein House" (1944) and "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein" (1948). Make-up work on it is pretty lame, and just succeeds in making it look like a hippie with bad teeth (like the one in 1957's "Teenage Monster"). Sets in this movie, besides, are quite non-existent, and denouement is sudden and unconvincing. I gave the movie a very generous 4 stars, partly because I was dedicated to the love of horror movies in the 1940s, but the truth is that most objective viewers would consider it ridiculous crap and I suppose it is. It's certainly not a well-formed universal affair or Val Lewton's masterpiece, that's for sure! Still, Zucco is always fun to watch, even in an easy piffle like this. If you can save 72 minutes of your life, I assume you could do worse than "The Mad Monster" (of course not much worse, of course!). Oh ... one more thing. This DVD is from Alpha Video, and you know what it means: fuzzy pictures, lousy sound (really the worst sound of any Alpha Video DVD I've ever encountered) and no add-ons. You were warned!
