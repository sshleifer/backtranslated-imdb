I really liked the movie 'The Emporer's New Groove', but watching it was like going home and seeing my wife having "relationships" with Lama. Seriously, this movie was bad. It's like Club Dread after Super Troopers. I should write 10 lines, but I don't even know what to say. I laughed a few times, but just because I was drinking. The movie should be at least funny when it's drunk. It was not. Maybe llamas are just funny and ordinary people aren't. Either way, just stick with The Emporer New Groove if you want a funny, cartoon, llama-themed movie. Line 10 is this line right here.
