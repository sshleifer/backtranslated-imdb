This terrible action? sci-fi movie is crap. I just spent 90 minutes of my life watching one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story makes no sense, there are a lot of shortcomings in the script, the characters are poorly developed, the unknown cast is terrible, the leading actor in the ham seems too old to play. I was brought to buy this VHS, which has a beautiful cover, and see this bullshit because of the illogical rating of IMDb and some "ten stars" reviews. I just checked the authors and each has only one short review ("L.I.N.X.") released in IMDb and nothing else. Why do they promote such waste? My voice is one. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "L.I.N.X. Conex√£o Letal" ("L.I.N.X. Lethal Connection")
