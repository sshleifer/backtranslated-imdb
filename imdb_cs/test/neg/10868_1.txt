That's what I kept asking when I watched this movie. I think the amount of nudity and sex was one thing, but another part of the film that gave the genre to adult industry was the lack of a story. I really wanted to get up and leave throughout the movie, but I insisted. I persevered in the hope that it might be better to end up being a good turn. But I couldn't be more bad. I finally endured because I thought I could write a bad review if it was something after watching. I mean, I'm not doing badly, there is nothing wrong with beautiful, sexy and vibrant women, but when the director just shows that along with the lush story he thinks is, what the viewer wants to see insults us all. Thinking that we are all so superficial that we just want to see the burlesque from the rep ratable, the big movie industry player is pointless. My advice: hire another movie.
