I think I can safely say (without giving up) that this film doesn't have robots in it. The "robot" costumes did not or did not speak as such, and the bad entity behind the whole "conspiracy" is not even a robot. The whole thing seems to have been shot somewhere in the city park, where the photographs have fallen in the background when the director needed his own set. I can't even use words to describe acting ... It couldn't even offer the hilarious ending of "Star Crystal." In short, it is clearly one of the worst sci-fi films of the 1980s and I would be so brave to say "all the time".
