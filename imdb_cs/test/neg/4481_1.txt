I was very excited about this movie! My expectations were under control because I read the book first sooo and the expected differences. what I didn't expect was big differences. The characters start a physical performance ... like Channing Tantums lack of tattoos n Amanda Seyfried is not a brunette lol, but I let it go ... character development wasn't there at all ... you don't have time I love amanda seyfried character and you couldn't feel for her or for John when they first broke up ... I thought those two weeks were rushed and I hated them leaving first, then ... it took emotional separation ... and why they changed Tim from the book ... why did they make him Father instead of brother and why they forced him to look at the old look and the film lacked the intense moment to find out what was going to go wrong at the end of the story lol, but for those who watched it I know what I mean ) and whhhyyyy ooooo wwhyyyy they changed the end ... in the book it was heartbreaking and emotional and it stressed the Channing Tatums character decision whyyy this twist it ... it just looked like a rushed end ... it was horrible ... tha what me n most disappointed ... the end of the book should be exactly the same: (
