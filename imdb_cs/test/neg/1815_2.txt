After seeing the movie version of Heart Of Darkness, I feel like I'm wasting 100 minutes of my life. Although the book wasn't my favorite, I was very disappointed when I saw how badly Roeg had portrayed the story. Despite having missed many pieces of important information, the cast didn't seem appropriate for their roles, and the whole film seemed immensely emotionless. The book captures live scenery and details that are completely ignored in the film. Do you think the director could throw 76 pages of a book in the film for at least an hour and a half. The differences have completely changed me. For example, when the character of Kurtz's fiance is nonchalant to the fact that Kurtz died, it completely modifies the ending of the book she gave. Not to mention the files and scenery used in the film were not as beautiful as they were described. He sincerely feels as if Roeg was filming another story with the Heart Of Darkness included in it. <br /> <br /> If you're watching a movie without knowing the name or expecting it to be something like Joseph Conrad's story, you might consider it good. Even though I thought working with the camera was bad and casting was inappropriate, it is a charming story the same. But if you're looking for a good movie version of the famous classic story, don't look for it in Roeg's movie.
