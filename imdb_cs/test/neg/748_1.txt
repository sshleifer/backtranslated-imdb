This movie started well, keeping the book mood quite well, though the acting wasn't top notch. The soundtrack was badly tortured. Saxaphone and Electric Guitars? It was annoyingly disparate. The singer was positively crushed! In the second half of the film, the story is definitely darker. Too dark for Austen. Northanger Abbey is a dark and scary place, while in the book it was disappointing to tame and modernize Catherine's eyes. Who the hell is this marionette with horrible makeup and wig? Totally alien and unnecessary character. One of the key elements in the book is a general who is not a gothic monster as the character of Catherine's books. His monstrosity is much more complicated in his oppression of his childhood spirits and his treatment of Catherine on the basis of money concerns himself. She doesn't block her wife or kill her, but she sends Miss Morland 70 miles alone in a hired carriage that doesn't have enough money to pay her home. Only her thoughtful girlfriend Miss Tilney handed her some money on her way out of the door to save her from getting stuck. This whole point is really confused in the movie. They make the general too dark from the start. Peter Firth shouldn't sing! This work was painful to watch. His view of Tilney wasn't too bad, but there was a dark wall in the place. Henry Tilney made Miss Morland's sporting imagination on the way to Northanger, but it was never dark. Firth would benefit from a better direction. The young lady who played Isabella needed a better coach. John Thorpe was duly repugnant. The striped vest and coats he wore were terrible! Certainly his character suits him. I think the movie would be much better with a completely different soundtrack. He threw an oppressive palette over the entire film. If I watch it again, it will be with the sound and subtitles off. Maybe I would give movie 4 then. The sound quality on the DVD was pretty bad. Image quality was not much better. This is remarkably noticeable on digital television. When I think about what this movie might be, I think of Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.
