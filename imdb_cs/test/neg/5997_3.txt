We draw attention to potential viewers, the current IMDb audience rating for "Tomorrow in Seven" is an anomaly of low voter participation. He has an interesting premise, and the murderer leaves the ace Spades calling card in place of his crimes, while the victim warns in advance. The execution falls flat however, and stating that the film has its share of conspiracy holes would mean that it is actually a plot. Chester Morris portrays writer Neil Broderick, weaving elements of the real murder of Ace of Spades to his latest novel. Broderick intends to talk to a wealthy businessman about his book, but first he has to get through the eccentric man secretary - "If you connect his relatives, you'll have enough nuts to keep Ford together". This line admires him infallibly to her mother's daughter, Marta (Vivienne Osborne), who offers the performance. puzzle delivered by courier that morning. The only remaining pieces, as we learned in the next scene, are the bold black Ace of Spades, which includes the words "At Seven Tomorrow Night". Now, what a person putting together puzzle does not use pieces with contrasting colors FIRST! At first, I was impressed by the performance of Frank McHugh and Allen Jenkins in their roles of police detectives who were summoned to the Drake Residence. In general, their characters are colored enough to offer real comic relief, but here they are simply uncomfortable. In particular, McHugh's Clancy gives up screaming objections to his partner's shameful comments, Dugan, and both usually point in the opposite direction when real problems may arise. Now there is the question - in the light of the identity of Ace's killer, why would he invite a novelist and a few cops he had just met to fly to his Louisiana plantation? Especially when at seven o'clock, all parties will be a captured audience aboard an aircraft when the first murder is committed. It's not Drake who's dead but his secretary Austin Winters (Grant Mitchell). Early suspicion falls on the Henderson pilot (Cornelius Keefe) after the light scene, but Henderson has not yet reported the murder to his superior until they arrive at Drake's plantation with everyone else. Can you imagine anyone trying to get away today if your name is Ted Kennedy? With the cause of death that has not yet been determined, the local coroner is called, but the first one that points up (Broderick's accomplice) is false. But when a real coroner appears, it just disappears immediately after! In the second dark scene he is going to read a letter from the victim of the murder of Austin Winters. When the light returns, it ends, and because it can point to the killer, it becomes a guide that must be loaded. So where was the letter? Winters' daughter Martha grabbed her and put her in the cloak of the living room! How many thoughts were put into this idea? Apparently the matter is so adamant that Morris's character is rather easy to solve. Although the film comes in about an hour, it becomes almost a chore to watch all the nonsense happen. It's really just one funny moment worth repeating; while on board the detectives have this exchange: Dugan - "Hey Clancy, how often do these things fall?" Clancy - "Once!" Except for McHugh and Jenkins, I can't say I've seen any of the other players in the movies of that time, even though I am a fan of most Type B mystery films for 30 years through the 1950s. Fortunately, the pair are doing much better to back up Humphrey Bogart in the 1938 "Swing Your Lady", where they are deliberately deliberate. The best I can offer about "Tomorrow in Seven" is a quote from Martha Winters about the origins of this turkey - "This is just a stupid waste of time".
