The Lifetime Channel aired it in October, but I got to watch it now. Again, is it the old eternal triangle? little city Connecticut boy Dave Ford (Matt Long) quickly plunged on his best friend's girlfriend, Emily Darrow (Emmanuelle Chriqui), on the eve of his departure to New York School of Law, thinking about it for the next five years while pursuing other activities . She does not make contracts and briefs, returns to her again when she returns home after the death of her father on the eve of the great trial five years later, and re-joins her again. But director and co-founder Matthew Cole Weiss goes over the top, framing the whole thing in flashback, as Dave confesses to killing Emily, her husband, and another of her lovers in front of a lesbian cop who is also Emily's flame. Weiss exaggerated the "flanging" effect by which Dave gets to see the pieces of his previous life flash before his eyes before he is actually dead, cutting those, even though Dave and Emily have sex, thereby destroying soft-core porn shots that They give even some otherwise quite lame Lifetime movies at least a little viewer appeal. I couldn't help but remember James M. Cain and how much better he wrote to women like this in his classic thrillers (all adapted to hit movies) "The Postman Always Rings Twice," "Double Indemnity" and "Mildred Pierce. "It also doesn't help that the movie ends up with bad guys (bad girls, in fact) triumphant and decent, if naive and stupid, the hero seemingly on the way to a deadly injection table ??? or that the actors playing Dave and Emily are cheating, they're both better than them. By the way, although this movie went directly to the US, there were some blank spots on the soundtrack that suggested where the words were sworn, so I suppose this has a theatrical release somewhere in the world.
