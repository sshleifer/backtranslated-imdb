This is the worst movie I've ever seen and believe me I've lost a lot of bad movies. I like cheeese horror, but it was just awful. There was no scene in this movie where I was scared. All the actors had to be people they found at the bus stop 20 minutes before the shooting. I wish Blockbutser gave me my 99 cents back. Acting was terrible. Writing was incredibly bad. Someone had to project this movie before it was released, and he had to know it was awful. I would be embarrassed to have this name associated with this monstrosity. Don't let this movie be rented. If you do, do not return it, so no other poor souls will ever make a mistake to rent it.
