That was bad enough. I really hope he won't continue. Maybe it's part of a conspiracy to know that there is an open option, but no, it really isn't. There's really nothing special about this movie. Well, the special effect was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. PG-13, definitely not R. It also says that slasher aspects were less than spectacular. The shovel to the head was the only thing that was unusual. <br /> <br /> Tame scare scared.
