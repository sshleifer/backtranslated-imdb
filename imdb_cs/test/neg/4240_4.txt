This show can be most accurately described as TV Bubble-Gum: It's chewing, it has good taste and it takes a long time. But, like Bubble-Gum, it can leave a bad taste in the mouth after a few too much chewing. This show contains very simple questions that take the form of simple games like Hangman, guessing simple phrases or guessing items on a short list. Callers are competitors and everyone can play. But the questions are very easy. There was some techno music in the background that turned into a continuous loop. It never seems to get old, but it never adds much to the show. The hostess, however, no matter which one is, is extremely personality-friendly enough to watch and can do some very fun facial expressions. I rather enjoy the British woman. But there is nothing at this show. It's simplistic and uncomplicated, though it can be fun if there's nothing else.
