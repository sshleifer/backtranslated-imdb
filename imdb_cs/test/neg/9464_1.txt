I can't believe I tried to watch the dirt. As a passionate fan of B-Horror, I was more than riveted on the prospect of this movie by the popular budget horror director Herschell Gordon Lewis. Unfortunately, right from the opening of the movie, I couldn't think of a worse movie than this for my life. Well, maybe Gigli, but I firmly believe Dr. Gore (The Body Shop) is worse when I think about it. A terrible plot that moves incredibly slowly, the film stretches without real horror. However, I admit to the pure joy of a few scenes when Dr. Gore mesmorizing her early-to-be sacrifice. The camera comes close to its too large, bulbous eyes, while at all times it is a purely disgusting soundtrack for entertainment. I laughed for a better part of 10 minutes. After stretching out his "miraculous woman", the film wastes nearly 20 minutes and shows him and his "girlfriend" learning how to talk, then talking, frolicking between weddings, picnics, etc. without speech at all. This part of the movie lets you wish you cut your wrists with a matte edge of the buttery knife. I almost wanted to vomit on the idea of ​​this movie.
