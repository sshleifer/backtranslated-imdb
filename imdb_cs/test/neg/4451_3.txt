A man who claims to be a Asmodeus demon (Kane Hodder), a torturer of the 13th level of hell, comes to the office of Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance), and wants to say strange things. He says he and Lucifer agreed to become human again. On the day their mother died, she should defeat her virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) and she should kill six people and free Christ, and then escape from the pit and reborn. When Mary Elizabeth becomes pregnant, her stressed and offensive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe she is a virgin, but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines her daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile, the Church will reveal the truth about Mary Elizabeth's pregnancy and send the priest and ex-father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to reveal Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by her fetus and is forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and girlfriend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself and eat their heart and drink blood, but believes she has nightmares. But during ultrasound, he realizes he has a monster and asks his father to stop pregnancy. But it's too late. The terrible "Born" is a B-movie (actually Z), which believes it's a great movie. The result is a demanding and unsatisfactory production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible action and direction. The story is a complete mess: he is a priest who is a hitman and a former soldier; a demon in an existential crisis going to a psychiatrist; a father who examines his daughter's virginity; two women-demons (succubus?) who stand naked as a statue with both hands covering their sex; A character who is a whore and just exists to reveal her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is acting: unknown chief actress Alison Brie is historic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Mrs. Alison Brie, but I hated your unpleasant performance. I didn't recognize Joan Severance, who has a good performance, because I still had an idea of ​​youth. Denise Crosby performs a hateful character and, like everyone else, has grown old but is still a good actress. I believe that if a writer and director included some dark humor and assumed that this film is a B-movie, the story could work better and better. My voice is three. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "O Anti-Cristo" ("Antichrist")
