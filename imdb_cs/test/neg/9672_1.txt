Just as I thought nothing could be as insulting and / or irritating as Billy Mays infomercial, I had an intellectually appalling experience of renting this piece of garbage. Peter Barnes and John Irvin should be brought up on charges of smuggling this scenario into public space. Actors must be accused of being accomplices who are less than a lifetime away from the public eye. This production offers a disclaimer: "For a dramatic effect, we took a poetic license with certain facts," or some such inadequate statement that would fully support you for the absolute ugly transcript of a biblical story that it didn't need no drama. What they did was enough to make your I.Q. send three full points for every five minutes of observation time. "Poetic License", invented by characters so bizarre, you know nothing but the names of a few, and of course, the Ark. Noah and Lot live in Sodom for some reason, so Abram was on a ski vacation in Switzerland. Lot's wife, played by Carol Kane, is a harpy, and when she turns to a pillar of salt, Lot tears her off and carries it in what appears to be an empty baby food container. If it's "poetic", I'm kumquat. When Noah - who has now begun drinking wine in an amount that could help to swim on the ship - is driving the hard work of the construction project, he wakes up One morning he discovered that God had released enough pre-sawn timber to lighten his burden. At least I think it was God. It looked like a van of 84 Lumber, neatly stacked and tied. Maybe Lumber is really an agent for God ????? Instead of carrying you with the load that is loaded, I will summon you with a description of the pirate attack on the ark. It's not okay, you think? This film is filled with such insulting nonsense. After an incredible time on the waters, Noah spies on a pirate ship heading straight for them. And who could be a salty captain? Well, rainbow, it's Lot! The only surprise was that his uncle Abram wasn't on board. If you want to defeat the plot line, you'll kill everything. The attempt at piracy is unsuccessful, and the jump rope was pathetic, not poetic. I think it was around this brand that my nausea prevented me from punishing myself. An ugly, nonsensical, moronic distortion of anything remotely reminiscent of a biblical account. On a scale of 1 - 10, this film is premeditated by mind abuse. Stupid and offensive, you will be more entertained by reading the Yellow Pages.
