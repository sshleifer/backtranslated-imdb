Have you seen all the great adventures of the past few decades? If you haven't bothered with this because you have seen most of the scenes - and I can guarantee that these scenes were originally in much better movies. Story (I'm sure I'm never going to forgive real storytellers) is childish and stupid (stupid in a way that would make it play in the morgue, which would cause a lot of angry dead) . Every character is based on clichés and ... well, they are nothing but clichés. And yes, again, all you need to be a hero is to be an American. <br /> <br /> At least in Finland, they promoted it as a movie for which the DVD was made. Maybe I should sell my player ... <br /> <br /> 1/10
