... And the guy is soft <br /> <br /> I saw it on the Bravo cable channel one Saturday night and here in Britain we often have these terrible "Erotic" soft core movies that appear late at night on Bravo. This is followed by a WEIRD SCIENCE conspiracy of several college students who are building a virtual reality kit that gives you sexual fantasies. <br /> <br /> When you saw one of these movies, you saw them all with lots of bimbos that seem to be silicone advertising implants. Come on, I've actually seen real-life breasts (I'm sure some of us have too) and vibrate unlike here, where they surrender to laws, if not physics than at least gravity. Sexual scenes are these boring issues where a well-crazed geezer protests against his star without any dialogue or sound, except for some musician, and when it culminates, both seem to have a bad constipation attack. Girls themselves are very nice, especially Brandy Davis and Nikki Fritz, but they are unnecessary in these kinds of soft core movies. And if it's a fantasy, after I recommend the Lord of the Rings trilogy
