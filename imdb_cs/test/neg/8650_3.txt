This film is very modern and forward. That's about 75% in English. It focuses on the English speaking multiplex young audience. The base graph is similar to DDLJ. Acting is below average. Unfortunately, they display a bad image and set a bad example for the youth. Tanisha is shown drinking from a bottle, or taking tequila shots about 5-6 times in a movie. The director does not even recognize that he is an alcoholic and has a drinking problem. During the whole film, he only wears a bikini, be it at work, at the beach or at the wedding. The film's heroine makes this make young people feel this behavior is acceptable. The less it is said about Uday Chopra's failure doing Shahrukh Khan's DDLJ role as an arrogant girl's pursuer, the better. The film is about gender equality. But equality should not be about making the same mistakes than doing the right to do the right thing. If men have shown themselves to be chronic Casanovas in movies, it does not mean that women should also display the same behavior. the name that it is ahead that the "fun" part of the film has no effect. Even in Canada, women don't dress like that, or boys behave as they did in the movie. Certainly it is not a reflection of Indian society or even Canadian society. Perhaps they should have a disclaimer at the beginning: "All characters and events in the film are imaginary and do not reflect the true culture of the cities and countries mentioned in the film". The only good thing about this movie is the length, 1.5 hours, thank God.
