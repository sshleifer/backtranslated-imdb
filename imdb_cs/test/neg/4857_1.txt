I must say that this movie was really terrible. Acting was average, the film's pace was horrible, as well as the soundtrack and cinematography. the two boys who played the lead roles sometimes looked terrible and didn't take the emotions needed in the movie. the girl was sometimes scary and looked like a doll that was scary. The end did not satisfy even though the film, which should be over, did not attack me for the characters. This movie was boring and did nothing for me, I recommend this movie to anyone.
