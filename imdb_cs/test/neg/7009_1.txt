I'm just throwing in this review to show I'm not crazy - I like a lot of Wynorsky's work - Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law are fast and very enjoyable - just to prove I'm not blind, I have to mention this, together With some Shannon Tweed "Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something" they are miserable - I have nothing against drawn-out sex sequences, but Julie Strain's breasts are so unnatural looking that you can't help but stare at them - which can be the desired effect , but I didn't like the fact that I was staring at them - and a few members of the cast seem depressed or uninteresting - "erotic thriller" was the worst thing happened with low budget moves and thank God that their day is more or less.
