It seems to me that I am in this minority, but I have found that one real thing is schmaltzy, fanciful and generally unpleasant. Not that it was so bad, but the characters seemed to be a little more than archetypes (evil father, oh, but wait, maybe not incredibly bad, maybe at the end of a resolutionâ€¦). It is true that the woman I liked the movie with would like it. But I don't.
