This is the slowest movie I've ever seen. A very weak scenario gives Jack Palanca and Rod Steiger the exceptionally good lines they have created for the audition. Palance and Steiger both claim to be really serious actors who can portray their roles with power, emotions and drama. The story itself moves at an incredibly slow pace, mostly in the living room. The director apparently moved the actors in rhythmic circles because they brought extraordinarily long lines to keep the pace from visibility to the audience. The action does not go up to the last ten minutes of the movie. If you're the one looking for more depth in a crime drama, this is not for you!
