I wish I had read more reviews and more views on this movie than I rented it. Wasting Money. Waste of time. Very little dialogue. Dialogue was hard to understand in every way. The storyline and storyline were weak. The only thing that was pleasant was cinematography. The characters were interesting. At the same time, you will spend so much time trying to figure it out because of the lack of dialogue that you will rewind the film a lot. <br /> <br /> Don't watch this movie. It was a mess and you let yourself feel like a mess. <br /> <br /> Will you say what the hell was when the movie ends?
