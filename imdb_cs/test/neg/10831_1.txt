When I first saw this movie I was literally rolling on the floor laughing (especially when they got stalked by water, and when that guy rode through peoples gardens, I think it would hurt to drive around the car wash?) special effects! this movie didn't have a big budget. Either that or that guy left his toddler in charge of control. the water that came from the hell seemed to close the can of beer that had disappeared. what did the actors think? believed it was a good movie? or did they really need money? not that they earned a lot. when I first saw it, I was like 'god, how old is this?' When I looked at the information and saw that it was done in 2003, I thought my TV was broken. This is really a disaster movie, in more ways than one.
