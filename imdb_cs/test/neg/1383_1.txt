The folder for this show is: "He speaks his mind. We're looking for more lawyers." When you look back in time, no classic comic has ever been in controversy. Richard Pryor's line was not: "I am brutal, racist and courageous." This is basically how Comedy Central launches this show - in your face, non-PC and "honestly" - but how can a TV station be proud to be this way? Where is humility and humility? And what did Carlos Mencia suddenly make this huge figure for Comedy Central? Let's start at the beginning - Dave Chappelle cancels his show (which has become PERSONALLY popular and controversial) and Comedy Central looks for something new to push him. They hire this guy named Ned, who says he's Mexican, even if he isn't. They spray his face on several TV commercials and make it appear to be "brave" by unleashing him in public. I've seen many hateful topics in forums for this show, and I disagree with "Mencia" criticism. It's not a terrible show. I was crying in laughter several times. When it's funny, it's very, very fun. Yes, he's a juvenile - but so is Chappelle. The problem with Carlos is that he still uses a lot of the same material. And it's too obvious. Clear marketing put aside, "Carlos" now said the beaner so many times I lost count. He's trying to make it another famous line (like "I'm Rick James, b ****!"), But it's too obvious. <br /> <br /> When it comes to repeating yourself, Carlos uses many of them. still the same jokes. For example, on one episode he said he would love it if all the Mexicans disappeared from America overnight. He woke up and the American would say, "Room ser'voc!" in Southern accent. He used this joke - literally - when he appeared as a guest on Adam Carolla's talk show. It was much less fun the second time because it looked desperate. Is "Carlos" funny? I think yes. There are some outrageous moments in his show. However, it focuses too much on being more controversial than going with the stream and letting its comedy progress naturally. Repetitive silly little phrases that reunite with goofy faces and loud vocal screams will really get old quite fast ... I just hope Carlos - or his writers - can give this show a new advantage because it is starting now shrink in repeated hell.
