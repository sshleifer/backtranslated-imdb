For the first time when I saw the movie, it was with this cute girl I was attracted to. we had a lot of fun and laughter. So my impression was that it was horrible, but attentive to the value of the cheese. Then, as part of our anniversary, we watched the video on the video again. As it turns out, the film is just terrible and unnoticeable. It's amazing how cute girls can change the way the world looks.
