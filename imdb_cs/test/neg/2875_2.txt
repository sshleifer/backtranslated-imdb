I really like Salman Kahn so I was really disappointed when I saw this movie. She didn't have much conspiracy and what they did wasn't so appealing. But Salman looked good in the movie looking young and fresh, but worth the price of this DVD. The music wasn't bad, it was pretty nice. Usually Indian films are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short film for Indian film. The American actress who starred in the film is from the television series Heroes, Ali Larter. Her acting had to be very desirable. But she looked good in the Indian dress she wore. Everything that didn't like the movie, and I hope Salman would do a lot better on his next movie. Thank you.
