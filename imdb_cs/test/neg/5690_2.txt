Let me split this movie for you ... <br /> <br /> The first fifteen minutes is a showcase of terrible special effects. I'm not one to choke about the special effects, but what you have to understand is that if you can't afford good special effects, you shouldn't anchor your movie around special effects. Starships paint bullets of color at each other, flaring into stock blasts, and careening past months with the number of polygons low enough to allow for your fingers. You won't know what's going on. It makes no sense. The second act involves a woman walking in the desert. Here you will be treated with a drab landscape and illogical, boring battle scenes. Nobody speaks. Nothing interesting will happen. The goals of the protagonist are unclear and not very convincing. It takes about 45 minutes. Then, in a five-minute cut, he sneaks into the enemy base, lashes to the rocket, tries to destroy the weapon on the doomsday, fails, and dies. Br /> <br /> None of this has any effect on the film's direction. In the last twenty minutes, basically, the memories of the chickens have been transferred to her daughter, who is in the stasis. For many years, learning the secrets of mankind. Then we see the first and last five-minute segment of human interaction in the film, then the new heroine is forced to choose to become part of the material that causes the big bang or not. You know. Because when the universe collapses, you decide whether you want to be part of it. <br /> <br /> Choose yes. But MEMORY MANKIND SURVIVE IN POCKETS. Maybe we won't make the same mistakes again, huh? If you like movies with characters, then this is not a good movie for you. Leading roles could be nicely accomplished by any old toy that could stay in the right position while walking across the sand. The whole story is told by a painfully boring narrative. The film tries to look deep by throwing together a lot of undeveloped science fiction ideas. There are enough concepts to drive a number of movies, but as it stands, it is inflated with absolutely irrelevant details. Two-thirds of this film could be reduced to 45-second mounting. Instead, the narrator fills the novels behind the scenes without giving us reason to worry about what happens to the characters. People watched movies to be fun. This movie is not funny.
