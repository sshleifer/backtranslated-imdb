Steven Seagal's intent is to be commended, and his work in this film is the same as in many of his other, if you ignore the fact that he is supposed to display a brilliant scientist. The problem I had was with two conspiracy items that stretched my suspension of mistrust beyond the breaking point. as it is carefully examined and constructed in a large laboratory, is it cured by drinking tea from the flower that grows high in the mountains? and that the Grandpa family seems to be the only people who know anything about it? Second, and this really takes the cake: After gathering enough medicine to repair the whole city, would you expect the army to land with a helicopter and start throwing sacks of flowers into all the houses in this small town? No, instead, they decide to sprinkle flowers around the city and force sick people to go out and reassemble them. Just stupid, unless under the Native Faith Power in Drugs somehow depends on someone going out and picking up the flowers themselves. maybe you think my voice on this movie is really high.
