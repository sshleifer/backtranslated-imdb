OK I for one thought that the trailer was pretty good, so he was hopeful for this movie, plus with the cast line up I was sure he couldn't get less than 6 in my books. However, for half an hour, I was angry with the story ... just where normal movies thrive, this film hit the bottom. SPOILER * Whoever is trying to help is caring for other people who are wounded amidst the noise they are turning to their colleagues to save the hiker and then lock in one of the armored cars. Not only is he constantly trying to get the attention of other people who end up threatening more people and a long story short, he is responsible not only for the death of the tramps, but also for the police officer who is shot. his younger brother ... oh and all five of his colleagues are dying of disgruntled deaths. But in the end, HAPPY is because he got into his senses in the middle of his effort, so what if all his colleagues are now dead, rather than sticking to the plan and being a millionaire. This film tried to be so politically correct that it made me sick! He destroyed a good story. Damn really.
