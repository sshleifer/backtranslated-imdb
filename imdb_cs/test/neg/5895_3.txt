Am I the only one who thought the purpose of this film was graphic violence? When I rented it, I didn't know anything about Leigh Scott and I wouldn't do it if I knew most of his previous movies were a horror movie. I am not at all at all, just expecting an informative document on the September 11th report. Instead, I got an almost incomprehensible, violent movie. The only good thing for me was that she made me read the message to find out what the hell was about. I wrote it because I am shocked that we have become so immune to violence in movies and television that it wasn't even worth commenting on bloggers whose reviews I read.
