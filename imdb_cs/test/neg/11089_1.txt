Very strange, it feels like a very average movie, if not a little less. It's brilliantly shot, but with the performance of R. Lee Ermey, this is probably the only redemptive aspect I found in a movie that consists of two separate parts. The first part deals with the basic nautical training that comes in tracking in 2007 as something I saw a few million in dozens of other movies and series, and that's not particularly interesting. After 30 minutes, I got an idea and wished they could just do it. The drill sergeant is the only credible nature, while everyone else seems to be just cardboard cutouts. The general meeting is tremendously haggard and the script lacks anything interesting and consists of a little more than a sergeant screaming. Boys can do it and end up in Vietnam. And that fat weirdo shoots a sergeant (which is a surprise ...), probably in the mistaken belief that he was actually a screenwriter. That was an hour and nothing happened. Nothing ... <br /> <br /> Then we have the Vietnamese part. It opens at the bunk bed where star and strip reporters get bored and do a little conversation. time. At first I thought that re-enacting some movie scenes from old movies, it sounded pretty bad. But no, they actually murmured their scenarios. Then the camp is besieged. About 20 Vietcongs enter the camp through the main gate. Too bad they're dropped as flies because they just go to a few unmanned jobs without covers. Is it normal behavior? Were the Vietnamese all suicidal? If so, how did the US not win this war during the first two months of engagement? The rest of the film continues with totally illogical war scenes. Moreover, the whole property is completely useless. None of the characters sing much sympathy, and the story is frankly hostile. This shows a little more than some war reporters who meet with a platoon with some of the guys who are shot because they are disobedient to the morons and who also believe that some hole in the wall will protect you from bullets. <br /> <What was the message of this movie that people died in Vietnam? That people are animals in war situations? If you want to destroy really stupid people, will you send them to the war zone? Or that somehow, in Vietnam, can concrete really burn? Sorry, but if this movie deserves 8.3, Apocalypse now deserves 38,3 <br /> <br /> 5/10
