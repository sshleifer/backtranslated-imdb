The film starts great in 1872 with a violent, bloody battle between Dracula (Christopher Lee) and van Helsing (Peter Cushing). Dracula is impaled and dissolving into dust - van Helsing is also dying. Someone is collecting Dracula's ashes and burying them in the church. Cut to 1972 - here the film is falling apart. We are immediately hit over the head by loud, bad 70s music, HORRIBLE fashion and stupid dialogue. When it happened, Hammer lost money and decided to try something. The introduction of Dracula in the 1970s is NOT a good idea. Fashion, music and dialogue date the film terribly. We present to you a lot of annoying children in their 20s who decide to have a black mass - "for giggling". Of course they have it at the church (now abandoned) and naturally revive Dracula. It's a good thing that he is a descendant of van Helsing around ... but Dracula goes after his niece (Stephanie Beacham) in revenge. Lee and Cushing are great as always in their roles on the screen the film gets the much-needed shot of energy. The opening and ending battles are the culmination of the film (although the end is spoiled much by playing lousy 70s music). Also the chief children's leader is Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame) - a really stupid name dating back to the 1940s. The film also has a great scream of Queen Caroline Munro. The film is well-directed and very well behaved, but the storyline is stupid, the fading of fashion in the 1970s, dialogue and music are very annoying and I was basically bored. - It was one of the worst films of Dracula - Satantic Rites of Dracula was the worst - and the last film, Hammer Dracula. It gets 2 - just for Cushing and Lee.
