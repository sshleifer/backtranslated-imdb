Solo is an Android action movie that is designed and trained for the military. When an error is discovered, it is issued to be deprogrammed. Instead of death, she faces an escape to the jungles of Central America, where she turns to the village. The army is chasing him and leading to a great feast. Mario Van Peebles makes a decent performance for android. His movements and gestures look mechanically enough to do it. Real scientific realism is abandoned to be a good action hero. And it works; action scenes aren't as spectacular, but they're not too bad either. Behavior from other characters is bad enough, but I didn't expect anything very good. Special effects were also decent. The solo is decent as an action move, but very forgettable. She lacks the substance most films have. But if you just want to walk a few hours without much thought, it will work.
