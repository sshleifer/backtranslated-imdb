Brilliant Australian comic genius Barry Humphries had a rare failure with this uneven and sometimes disgusting comedy that was released again after a few days. Drunk, lush Australian diplomat Sir Les Patterson randomly sets the Arab potent to fire at the UN and is sent to his small country as a punishment arriving just as the palace coup introduces the new leader (Thaao Penghlis) to the throne. Sir Les, with the reluctant help of Dame Edna Everage (both playing Humphries), almost accidentally kills the new leader's plan to release a deadly, nasty AIDS-like virus in the western world. Joan Rivers has a portrait as a female president of the United States, her desk board reading "President Rivers"! The extremely bad taste mixes with the slap and Humphries' usual haunted satire in a movie that is more fun in many funny parts than together as a whole. Dame Edna's TV fans may be confused by the presence of another Madge Allsop, unfortunately, the one who lacks the wonderful magic magic comedy of Emily Perry's role in the role. The film was written by Humphries and his third wife Diane Millstead and directed by Mad Max himself, George Miller. It is necessary for hard Humphries like me. All the others, be careful.
