This is undoubtedly the WORST sequel I have ever seen, and I have seen many of them to make this conclusion. The story is just ridiculous. I can catch the ball and run around the field. Why can't I play in the Superbowl? Yes, I know that this film was intended for children, but there are only some plots that children can realize are completely silly and unrealistic. The first Air Bud movie was pretty good, but this was a total fall. Disney's losing it. If I controlled who won the Razzie Awards, I'd give this pair. Have a nice day! =)
