it is really "okay" series .. everyone in it is pretty good. but I can't take Reba. She is trying to be funny, but she just isn't and then got a stupid accent! If they took her from the show, I'd love to see her every day .. <br /> <br /> I watched the show in 10 minutes and as I said earlier, Reba is destroying the show. however, a 20-year-old man (he doesn't know his name), but it's soooo fun, and it's really a lot of everything .. <br /> <br /> so here's a great show recipe. kick Reba out of it and then put a 20 year old guy in the lead role. I really hope someone agrees with me and thinks (like me) that they should kick Reba on the show and give someone else the lead role
