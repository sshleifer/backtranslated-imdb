Jeff Morrow's Leslie Gaskell, Barbara Laurence's Vera Hunter and John Emory's Hubbel Eliot. Along with some auxiliary air force personnel and a comic geek, they are in charge of super-secret west coast underground laboratories. Morrow is thrilled to find that the meteor is passing through the atmosphere, but is not excessive when a meteor decides to dive into the Pacific Ocean and appear as a fantastic machine on the Mexican coast. Nobody knows what this colossal, block structure is. Obviously, this is some kind of carpentry artifact because it is all made up of right angles to the kind of bald half-visible sphere. It turns out that the machine, dubbed Kronos, is a planet from some distant place and has been sent here to rob Earth of energy. You see, here on earth we learned how to convert matter to energy, but on planet Kronos they came to the other half of the equation - how to convert energy into matter. And now they are running out of energy on the other planet. Do you take notes on that? Good. You may be able to fulfill some of the scientific questions raised by the Kronos mission. For example, if Kronos builders can convert energy into matter and vice versa, why not just convert a small part of their own spare material into energy instead of sending elaborate machines to the ground to quench the LA lights? But it is doubtful that the authors could explain it. The polarity reversal of the two antennas is described as "anthropic conversion", meaning "change to man" that makes no sense. But science doesn't seem to make sense. The scheme Morrow draws on the board has the current direction in the wrong direction, from positive to negative. The problem is also with Kronos' locomotion. Marching along the coast, threatening "populated areas" (reads Southern California) but has no joints in its two or three feet. These stubs are just banging up and down slowly, breaking some people. The film doesn't make much of these confused people. They are shown as Mexican peasants, so they may not count too much. The USAF also drops the hydrogen bomb on Kronos while it's in Mexico. Nobody raises an eyebrow. There is not much acting and there is not much. Jeff Morrow has a distinct and resonant voice, great for radio or for television voice overs. His face is less pronounced. He has only one expression, no matter what the situation - a smile, as if he had his picture taken at Universal Studios Tour. Barbara Laurence had a soft, golden quality when she made "Street With No Name" a few years ago. She was a slim 17-year-old woman like Richard Widmark's wife. Here, her care and demeanor cut her to a B-movie actress, though she is still beautiful. It's always good to see Morris Ankrum in one of these movies. He did so much to mix them. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie seems flat, I'm afraid. (There are some nice B-47 shots in flight.) The files reveal a low-budget business. This in itself is not necessarily bad, but there is nothing to replace the barren settings. Small tension in the screenplay, no directorial display and little effort to perform. <br /> <br /> You can get a kick out of it - a relaxed height - because it's unquestionable. It's just that there are so many better movies from this genre.
