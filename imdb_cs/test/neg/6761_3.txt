I first saw this movie on Saturday when I was very young. I thought it was cool and often thought about it. I finally read it on DVD. It was still very fun, but otherwise. It has a position as one of the goofiest, campiest, 1950 sci-fi movies. He seemed to be filled with military footage. Dialogue is immense and the effects are gross. There is one line of dialogue that puts me in stitches. Line Jeff Morrow says on the beach with a babe. Rent it if you need a movie to watch with a bunch of drunken friends. It's a classic.
