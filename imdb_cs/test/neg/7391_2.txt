This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen. Can someone please explain the plot of this movie to me? Yes, I know that gas has run out in the middle of the desert when the driver never noticed that his compass was not working, but what then? And how did it end? Maybe I'm stupid to understand this movie, but for me it was an absolute waste of time. <br /> <br /> My recommendations? Don't bother, there are much better movies. This film ranks among my other low-low (Adam Sandler and Fire on the Amazon - Sandra Bullock)
