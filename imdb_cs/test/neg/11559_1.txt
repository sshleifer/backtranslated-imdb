After watching this movie, I couldn't help but notice the parallels between him and another movie called America 3000. They were both very bad in the mid-1980s after apocalypse culling disasters. False sets, wooden gaming and silly monsters are obviously in both movies. The only difference between them is that the main villager (played by Angelika Jager) has a very strong accent. Avoid this if you are not following the MST3K version. Joel and the bots barely saved this turkey.
