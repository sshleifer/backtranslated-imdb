I saw this movie when it was first released in 1986. At that time I was young and enjoyed all the common comedies available, ie; Monty Python, Jim Belushi & SNL, Steve Martin, Cheech & Chong, so I believe my opinion is the majority of "reasonable" individuals. movie for the new "My Little Pony" movie that came out. This film was so appalling that it was actually taken out of most theaters before the end of the initial week. I was surprised that anyone would lose corporate money to duplicate this smoking pile of human waste. Don't waste your time or money on renting or watch this movie.
