Spoilers are abundant. You were warned. <br /> <br /> I was totally disappointed, this is my first movie, STREET FIGHTER, which I saw (I dare not go near the 1994 joke). Very little grabs your attention in STREET FIGHTER ZERO (ALPHA) as opposed to most japanimation. The fighting is happily carried overboard (Shun versus Zangief was a lauger) and dramatization is too moody, especially towards the end when Ryu has to control everything in his fight against his brother. The main street fighter, Ryu, weakened to a much darker version inside himself. Frustration in controlling this darkness is further complicated by the sudden arrival of a younger brother! The Shadow Street Fighting Tournament takes place with more than just a fight in the mind of the promoter. <br /> <br /> What about Artist's Foot Drawing? Any anime over the stomach is impressive. The soft nature of the story makes the STREET FIGHTER too intelligent and puts much more emphasis on the character (Shun), who is not even a fighter in the video game! Studying the character on more than the basic stars of the original STREET FIGHTER is completely ignored. How many times have you caught Rolento? Adon? Guy? STREET FIGHTER ZERO lacks the idea of ​​a video game.
