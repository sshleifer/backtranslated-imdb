I also waited a long time to see this movie. If I know he has never been released in Australia, I finally found a copy on the Internet and ordered it there. Weeks after my order confirmation finally arrived and I was very excited to finally sit in front of my television set ready to watch a movie that sounded so interesting and controversial and was filmed in a world where there are so many good movies. What a disappointment. During the first few minutes, I realized that I had ordered a B Grader, but I was still full of expectations. I persuaded my son (18) to watch me like sharing with me when I find a movie of value with good basic statements and / or storylines. Around the middle of the way he got up and said he could no longer follow him, it was so predictable and amateurish. I agreed, but I supervised the end. Stereotyping is also predictable, and I feel good with the people of Lake Arthur, Louisianna, who, after seeing the film, had to display it in such a way. Undoubtedly, some racial prejudices still exist in many parts of the world, not only in states, but in fact, on this day and age, I doubt that they would get rid of all the ridiculous alibi presented. I had to check the date the movie was made, because their attempts at subtle film from those horrifying scenes were something I'd expected from the first attempt of a high school student to create a film "indy." I would like to see this film in the hands of experienced screenwriters and filmmakers, his old story, which could still pack a punch if handled professionally. So disappointed after such a long wait and with such high expectations. The soundtrack was probably the only thing I liked.
