First, Blythe Danner doesn't look so far away that he can play Capshaw's daughter (and in fact he isn't - only ten years apart). I understand that this is supposed to be one of those magical, moonstruck-type novels, but it's pale. Very, very weak in terms of acting, script and direction. The only one who really shines here is Ellen DeGeneres, who makes this film observable - unless he's really true to herself when he's busy as a little heterosexual sex. But still. In fact, DeGeneres and skin shots of a young boy, Capshaw, along with him make this watchful. But no one can tell if Capshaw is really in love with a young guy or not; neither the script nor her acting do not burden him and we are left to wonder how he feels.
