Will it be a pleasure to end the hyping movies that relate to social conflicts or other human disasters? Okay "Care" is about childabuse, "Care" is about perverts boys abuse at school and how disgusting it can be if it's a movie with a bad script and with bad actors, then it remains a bad movie. "Care" is a movie that could have been, but it's because it was a tvmovie I don't know, but everything seemed so limited that it comes as some cheap movie that some housewives and fathers will choose to go to sleep . There are so many unanswered things in this movie ... for example, a relationship with a mother or the death of an abused boy from whom we know nothing more. "Care" should be much better.
