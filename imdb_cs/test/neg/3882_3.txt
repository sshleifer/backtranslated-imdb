I was in awe of the movie when I was looking at the promo and I was going to watch it FDFS The movie was terrible to say the least <br /> <br /> The first scene is good and until London there are fun things, but slowly the pace of slackens and This is nothing funny about it <br /> <br /> Manoj Joshi's subplot is funny in places, but is undesirable and adds to the boredom <br /> <br /> Drugs Part is especially funny about Govinda's monologue <br /> < br /> The film continues and continues aimlessly as the little boy wrote it <br /> <br /> The interval brings twists in the story, but then I lost hope <br /> <br /> The second half starts fine, but the way how things are processed is ridiculous. All Arbaaz's Jackie is half-burned Also, how do people identify them? The top is pretty funny, but stupid <br /> <br /> Priyadarshan is not at all in its elements, from this movie he started making craps and his movies were bad and bad Music is good, SIGNAL, TERE BIN stand out and AFREEN also camera-work is good <br /> <br /> Akshay Kumar is white in the stubble and looks old but behaves well, though this role he has done many times with his natural comedy acts looks bearable, Govinda looks out of shape, badness, and his act in addition to the monologue is too surprising from Govinda and it seems to be too much pressure on the comeback and Priyan doesn't use it Paresh is fine, but overall just repeat the act Manoj Joshi is fun places Sharat Saxena is fine Shakti Kapoor is great Jackie Shroff looks overweight and acts in her sleep Arbaaz Khan is bad Lara Dutta screams for fame but does not act
