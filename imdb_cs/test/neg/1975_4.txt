This show lasted for most of the 1980s, and had its moments, but the plot was usually sparse water thin and often painfully ununny. Terry Scott and June Whitfield were wasted in this sitcom, both deserving better, but it provides some nice memories and I found myself smiling at some repetitive scenes. June Whitfield's comedy talent is allowed to occasionally shine (when it's not Terry's foil) and it's really smart. The 1980s are the last decade where you will find this kind of middle class, middle age comedy, and many people kindly kindly do it, but I prefer to remember decades of alternative comedy and biting satire Spitting Image.
