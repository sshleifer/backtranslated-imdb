I know we shouldn't expect much of the low-budget independent movie. But the idea behind it is an attempt to open American eyes to a cozy relationship between government and journalists who should be against it. But some documentary aspect is reflected in his drama. The protests during the Republican Convention in New York in 2004 were not so convincing to make a documentary about it. Those kinds of convincing protests belong to the era of the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It would be better to stick to the dramatic format. Perhaps slow building, where the eyes of a young journalist gradually open to conspiracy.
