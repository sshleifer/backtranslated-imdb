I have read all of Dave Robicheaux's novels and consider James Lee Burke as my favorite contemporary writer. I also visited New Iberia and many of Acadian to better visualize the environment in most of these books. Needless to say, I was very expecting to see "In Electric Mist", especially since I thought Tommy Lee Jones would be amazing as Robicheaux. <br /> <br /> I was very disappointed. The story was very jerky; the interplay with the "spirits of Confederate Dead" was shallow and lost impact, and the nobility that added to the book; and Tommy Lee Jones was frightening, lackluster and hard to understand as DR. The best way to describe this forgotten movie is to add my "ditto" to previous users' comments that this movie was one of those old movies made for television. I expected Jill St. John or Cameron Mitchell. The location setting was accurate, and the photo sometimes captured the essence of steamy vibrant, smoky juke joints and the terrifying southern Louisiana cemeteries. It is a pity that the discontinuous presentation of the story and the performance of Tommy Lee's parody disrupted the region's unique mood and spicy taste. Next to the final comment: In the novels, the nickname is Dave Robicheaux "Streak". because of the distinctive strip of silvery gray hair on one side of his head. (Similar to Sopranos Paulie Walnuts would appear if he was seen only in profile.) Tommy Lee had no such streak in this movie, probably because the editors are James Lee Burke fans and they airbrush streak out after being witness to Mr. Jones. bad imitation Dave Robicheaux. Final Comment: Although I generally regard Alec Baldwin as pompous and uncomfortable in most roles, Robicheaux was by far better off in "Prisoners of Heaven" than Tommy Lee. "Electric Mist. Heaven's prisoners are also more exciting and exciting, with unbelievable performance and more evocative atmosphere than this new movie. <br /> <br />" In Electric Mist "is fine to watch when you feel like "veging" and there is nothing better on TV but then they are also infomercials.
