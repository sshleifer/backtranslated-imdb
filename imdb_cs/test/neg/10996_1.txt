Wrong adjustments, bad production values, poor continuity, unlikely, bad dialogue ... these movies are bad, bad, bad. However, if you want the movie to poke fun at (la MST3000), it's your movie. I wouldn't recommend spending a lot of money on it, but if you see this movie, make sure it's a lot of funny, like-minded friends.
