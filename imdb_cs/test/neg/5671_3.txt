I'm not going to say that the show is all bad, because there are some funny parts like Spencer, and some random incidents. But besides, let's just say, it's just another dry sitcom that kids buy. Miranda Cosgrove was cute and funny like Megan on Drake and Josh. Honestly, ICarly is average and not as fun to be. The actress who plays Sam seems to be sleeping most of the time, and her rumors are so clich√© that I would think of them. They're not funny, just annoying. And Freddie is fine, but not so interesting. Of course, the situations are unrealistic, but it's not all bad. But some are annoying. Here are a few: <br /> <br /> 1. The girls are 14 years old and have a web show that gives away too much personal information, with a weekly 27,000 audience (WTF), with little to no advertising and can still continue their life that is not attacked by crazy people. Br /> <br /> 2. Their web show gets too much praise ($ 100,000 a year to advertise sneakers, free trip to Japan, Plain White Ts performance, and so on). Frankly, anyone over the age of 6 will not find their "comedy" fun. 3. How is it that they are so "mediocre", yet possessing a three-storey attic, Spencer hardly anything and can still afford many basic luxury items and have all the equipment for a web show? 4. All adults are idiots. All of them. 5. No 5 feet tall girl, no matter how annoying and tenacious, can take off trained cops if he's not muscular. Sam is skinny and petite. 6. Nobody can fall into nine stories in the elevator and live. 7. Children can handle crime findings better than cops. The show is stupid. Indeed, it seems harmless, but making kids think they can be annoying to their elders, living alone in Seattle when they are just 14 with irresponsible moron, and giving away personal information is just wrong. I'm disappointed to say that my cousin, who is 3 years old, is looking forward to this show. What happened to the cartoons when I was her age?
