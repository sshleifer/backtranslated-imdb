Why would a filmmaker with a record like Wes Craven want to borrow his name from a boring collection of clich√©s like this one to guess. And if he paid some money for it - all 50 pounds judging by appearance - he should bang the director's door to give him back the money the movie was released. There are many "Alien" rip-offs and this is one of the worst. Even a reliable Lance Henriksen, saddled with a character who is so stupid that she allows her children to wander through a dangerous government lab, can't save it. As a cure for insomnia, it rates 10+. As a piece of quality film - forget it.
