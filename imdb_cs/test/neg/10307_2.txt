I like this show. I watched every episode last year. I bought a DVD. And I tune in to watch tonight and see for some reason that you have redesigned this great show. And you took what caused and destroyed it. You took one of the best aspects of the show, which was 4 friends. Sam, Sully, Lizzy and Piper. I love other characters, but they are good in small albums like Derek, Darcy and even Sully. It's like the show has lost part of its family and everyone else is trying to fill it hard. It's an overdose. While things are funny in small boards when you're exposed to it all the time it goes from funny to annoying. I was looking forward to the return of this show. So please bring the spell. Even if you couldn't get Piper to the show at least bring Lizzy back. But I loved those girls. They brought fun. The show was about Sam trying to live his business life and master his personal life and friends as well. That was magic. And also a great dog. I hope the network (FOX) has made writers do it, and writers are not willing to do it at the show. I will introduce the show a few more episodes before I give up, but today's episodes were bad. I made a great evening when I came back and I had people and I felt like crazy because nobody was allowed to go 2-3 times. I apologized to them and said I didn't know what had happened. And about 10 minutes into the episode, I realized that they wouldn't show Piper or Lizzy and it was no longer necessary to see a television comedy.
