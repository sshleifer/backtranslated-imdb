That's as stupid as it is. A classic case of two-dimensional characters who always act in contradiction with what a sensible person would do in the same situation. It reminds me of a scene in "Scary Movie" where Carmen Electra runs away from the killer. There are two characters, one marked "to safety", the other to "certain death" (reciting from memory). <br /> <br /> As in Scary Movie, characters always run in the direction marked "Sure Death". Why, why did the girl fire in the box office and keep the door buried? Did she rather die in the fire instead of killing him? Why why, after cutting and thrusting the driver, they put him in the seat and let him watch the wounded guy instead of shooting him from simple shooting, or at least set him out? He ran through his friend and killed him a while ago, but they have scruples ??? Why Why One Hundred More ... <br /> <br /> If this movie was on the road, you couldn't act in the yard because of the openings. Everything is so appealing, sometimes it starts to hurt physically. <br /> <br /> Add a ruthlessly throwing "actor" and a small budget for it and here's what you get. Looking at reviews and comments, I feel that these people are watching a completely different film. One thing that is missing is the infamous red toolkit "While She Was Out" - a film that is similar in unrealistic conspiracy and stupid behavior to characters.
