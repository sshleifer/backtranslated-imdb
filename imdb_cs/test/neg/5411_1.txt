To be honest, the movie was so terrible that I loved it. I've never seen such a TERRIBLE movie in my life. I was shocked. I don't even know what to say. The characters couldn't even hold their own weapons, one minute the M16 and his friend had an MP5, then in the next scene they switched weapons. (Don't Ask, Believe Me I Know My Weapons) And I never understand how they got out of a place that looked like Vietnam, on the Arizona Highway, on my backyard, and then into a California chemical factory, that's what I took it. Why would you worry about a guy in a Halloween mask wearing a garbage bag for a cape and shooting plastic darts at you? How scary is that? I wanted to swallow arsenic in the movie. I love how the "skeleton man" accidentally decided to go on killing a spree on a given day. But hey, the one who did this movie should be shot on his knees and fed on a pile of ants. <br /> <br /> Hello.
