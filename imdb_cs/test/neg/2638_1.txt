This film was so weak that he couldn't even come up with good clich√©s to rip. I love horror movies and I'll see virtually anything, but if I had to do it again, I'd totally skip this. You may think I was exaggerating, but I urge someone to find anything that would satisfy or be interesting about this piece of garbage. It's not scary, not funny, it's not curious, it's not worth it.
