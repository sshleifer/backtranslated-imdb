This movie wasn't as bad as the story went, but working with the camera is what makes it hard to watch. I just don't like the so-called "realistic" camera that is being done today; You know the type of jumping out of the center, panning around, etc. What made me particularly concerned about the film was a new thing they'd thrown into the mix by shooting several shots in black and white in each scene. I believe the film would be much better if the camera work was shot in a much more common way, because I couldn't concentrate on it and instead dealt with analyzing the camera work myself. Perhaps if more people were dissatisfied with a camera like this, the filmmakers would finally get help.
