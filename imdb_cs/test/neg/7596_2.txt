That was in many ways delayed. The filming location in Ireland, though sometimes quite beautiful, can't save this uninspired film. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, as a married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherits a haunted castle, just aren't interesting characters. Paul at the end of the film becomes incredibly annoying and wishes to shut her mouth and close as it seems to be screaming as if she just became an Olympic event! Other problems with this movie are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the movie, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and a woman in bed with a cut off hand crawling over a writhing naked body. Even though the woman is quite adequate, she does it without stories. One is left to mind that the production team needed to turn off a short run time and just tossed in some fill and a little T and A. CGI effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery final rivals co-executive producer Roger Corman is much earlier and far superior to the Fall House Usher in all his inefficient cheapness. Any attempt at real tension and tension, and consequently chills, are thrown out of the window at this low budget bust. If you like pictures of Ireland, you can find something here, but you can rent or buy a travelogue. Skip it if you are not undiskcriminating and thinking the plot is secondary. Rent another low budget ghost story (if you can find it) called Woman in Black and see how good and scary the movie can be. That was a missed opportunity.
