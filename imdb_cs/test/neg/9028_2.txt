This film is a big disappointment. Director Vicente Aranda has provided many interesting films during his long career, some of which have been highlighted by the powerful and powerful performance of the Spanish actress Victoria Abril. The JUANA LA LOCA also relies on the talented actress, novice Pilar Lopez de Ayala, but it is hardly the only positive element in the otherwise horrible film disorder. While Lopez de Ayala is trying to portray Juan as a romantic and passionate young woman, absolutely obsessed with the love of her handsome husband, she seems unable to develop her character over this one-dimensional feature; Juana was an important figure in Spanish history, and the policy of that time was necessary in her story ... but here she is introduced as a romantic leading lady out of soap opera; this is a real pity and the film lacks the opportunity to show how personal life can affect history and vice versa. The worst of all is that the Italian actors Daniele Liotti and Manuel Arcuri are performing poorly, which is a real problem with Liotti when he portrays Felipe el Hermoso, a key role in this story. It seems to be a clear choice to attract a young audience because they both look like top models of this era. On the other hand, talented actors such as Giuliano Gemma and Rosana Pastor are completely lost in supportive roles of underdeveloped. Even if it was a big-budget movie, little attention was paid to making a good script or creating "period pieces" on the screen. Costumes are particularly grotesque in some group scenes, as if they were taken from stock material, without real coherence. The main problem with JUAN LA LOCA (and that's what makes a difference with much better historical films like LA REINE MARGOT or ELIZABETH) is the lack of a director. This is a strange turn in Aranda's career when he was able to develop it in other works (LIBERTARIAS and AMANTES), creating very personal and interesting films, while this JUANA is really just a routine academic piece. and it's not very good at it!
