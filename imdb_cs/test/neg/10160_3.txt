I saw this movie when I was a boy (before World War II) and I was surprised that the local library had a copy. He saw it again after some sixty years and forgot how bad it was. This is an example of a movie that was not a movie "A". No cut, bad script, poor gaming and not much overhead. It shouldn't be as high as "B" I was laughing as I became tired over the years. It seems to me that I thought it was good when I saw it.
