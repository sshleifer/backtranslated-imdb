This show is pretty okay and fun to watch, its a great Disney show and sometimes fun. I really enjoyed the first season, but I hated the second and third seasons. This exhibition has changed completely. In the first season it was more about science and animals, everything that is now gone in the season and the third season. It's more about her life and dating. Since the gay boy (Ben) came, this show was sucked. The writers took a perfectly good children's show and turned it into a lousy teenage comedy. Disney turned to worse. I can't stand to watch the latest episodes, it's all garbage.
