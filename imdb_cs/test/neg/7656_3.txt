This movie is not a bit bad. It's not so bad. It's scary. You know you're in trouble when Charo appears in the movie. She had to have a week off from "Love Boat". George Kennedy, at least he's a player - he's out there trying. Actually, he's fine. It's good to see Martha Ray. Jimmie Walker is fine. It's a little better than '75, but what movie doesn't perform better than '75? One thing I liked about this movie is that it was more than a lot of other catastrophic movies. At least they tried subplots. What really hurts this movie is special effects - ugh! It's not too strange to ask me. That's the kind of movie that's really, really funny at 2:00 if you talked to your friends and you're looking for something to laugh at.
