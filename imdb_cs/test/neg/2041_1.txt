WOW! What is a horrible, disgusting waste of time that has turned out to be a celluloid cruelty. I remember seeing it years ago and I thought it was fun, but now ... it's just stupid. Not to mention the fact that it is a glaring rip-off "The Exorcist" to the point where it was re-released in one place under the name "Sex-orcist". The only real difference is that manufacturers have been discredited by swearing that the events in the film are real! Who would truly believe such a brave lie in his true mind? To make matters worse, a video in circulation was released with an envelope that was ruthlessly trying to earn "Rocky Horror Picture Show" by throwing a few lips on the cover! How low could it fall? Don't be fooled by false claims, glaring lies or titles, because you'll be disappointed with SORELY if you do it!
