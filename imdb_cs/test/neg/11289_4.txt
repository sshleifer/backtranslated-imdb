Ty Cobb is by far the most interesting and aggressively madman who ever lives. His baseball career was incomparable in absurd statistics, brilliant strategy, and pure violence. Every game he played was a spectacle of human abilities and cruelty. Obviously, the film does not deal with it, but instead focuses on writing his biography by Al Stump. In theory, this is not such a terrible idea as Cobb himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as the years grew, and the stories of his crazy explosions as well as the senior are shocking even today's desensitized standards. But instead of focusing on these events, which was probably too interesting, there is a pseudo-fictional road movie with clichés and clichés that will make every knowledgeable Cobb fan cry about vinegar tears. Tommy Lee Jones is pretty cobbled with Cobb, but somehow he can play his caricature. Most of Cobb's stories are hardly believable, but to be even more crazy, it seems impossible and useless. Robert Wuhl, depicting writer Al Stump, is a dark belief of nonexistent talent. He sucks life from every scene and tries to make this film his own Nagasaki. There's a reason why we never see him as a leader again (Arliss doesn't count. It's barely a show). Even the fictional, inevitable "reversal of the role" of Cobb and Stump at the end is even worse by his pure inability to pronounce words that don't sound like a poor book about a pulpit voice. For all those scary writing and bland filmmaking on display there is one sequence that stands out so far better than the rest of this failure that taking this movie from the same movie is almost impossible. Hyper-stylized flashback sequences depicting Cobb's powerful psychology and brutal athletics, while in fact playing a baseball game, are purely brilliant. The camera moves in a bizarre fashion and the whole event seems like a dream thanks to the unique Cobb monster style. Each shot, strike and remedy is even stronger with a better sound and Tommy Lee Jones OWNS intensity player player. This makes the viewer drool over the possibilities of Cobb's true biopsy in his prime with the same actor. It's worth watching a movie for this incredible few minutes alone just to see what might be. I can be slightly unfair to this movie because of my own Ty Cobb knowledge and want it to be something that's not, but to make such a boring, castrated movie about this maniac is pointless. I'm glad Ron Shelton's career has slipped since then.
