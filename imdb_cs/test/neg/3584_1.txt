Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Drab, unimaginable, predictable - and with all the usual suspects. Exactly the type of film the Irish film industry shouldn't do. Plus, with a back-end bonus. A frightening example of how talent and originality go in favor of almost aggressive mediocrity. Yes - the children are sweet. Yes - it almost looks professional. But this is a film by number, direct smash and grabbing what the director thinks is a "success" - a film that disdains and despises the audience. It's amazing that a job title would spill Â£ 3 million on this waste. But then they paid for Love Actually. Don't waste your money.
