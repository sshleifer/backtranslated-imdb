It should be remembered that the Gammer films, as well as many of Gozilla's first films, WERE actually aimed at children. Little Kenny and his cohorts live in the dream of children in the audience: running around and playing with secret things while the adults stand and allow it; they get into a cavity with monsters, and even when bad guys enter, they are never in any real danger. Perhaps the first Gammera movie is aberration because the baby is getting punished and put into danger, but the rest of the series is a pure fulfillment of the wishes. As one critic has said, these are not unsuccessful adult films, but successful children's films.
