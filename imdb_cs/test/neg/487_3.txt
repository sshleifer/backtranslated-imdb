I didn't expect a classic but at least a funny movie. There were only a few scenes that made you laugh, but nothing more. Don't worry about being full of American teen-slasher clich√©s and you can guess what happens easily. But it tells a lot about a senior student in Turkish High-School. Student Pressure Selection Exam (OSS) that a 3-hour exam determines which university you go to and thinks about the exam when the ghost is after you is not exaggerated. The movie is bad. Don't waste your time watching.
