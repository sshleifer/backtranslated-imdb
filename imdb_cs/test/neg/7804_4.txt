Anupam Kher is an outstanding actor, debuted on 28 games 50 years old in SARAANSH <br /> <br /> Now the director turns with OJJ <br /> <br /> The movie has a good graph, but it's regressive <br /> The theme was done for death, and the character Urmily looks too much, while the tracks of Anil-Mahim and Abhara Tara are too sudden and then forgotten <br /> <br /> scenes such as the entire conflict between Anil-Fardeen and Abhishek, where Fardeen says he sells the house <br /> <br /> Abhishek seized for the crime and Anil yelled at him but <br /> <br /> Anupam's headquarters shows potential but has some way to go Music is fine <br /> <br /> Anil Kapoor excels in her part as Fardeen always tries hard and is fine, but needs to improve Abhishek's excellent, it was a turn pt, people realized that he can act urmila's in after The line Mahima and Tara are useless Waheeda is good
