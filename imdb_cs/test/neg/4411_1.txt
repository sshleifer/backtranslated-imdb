I know it's not original, but what the hell? What can we say about this? I feel stupidly stupid, I just pay attention to "From Hell it Came". The film makes the important political and social issue of the impact of atmospheric atomic tests on matters for joke and release, not the fears and alarms raised by scientists around the world at the time.
