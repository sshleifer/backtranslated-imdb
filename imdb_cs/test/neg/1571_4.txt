The film was disappointing. I saw it on Broadway with Bernadette Peters and was excellent. Perhaps she herself will fall apart at the end of her musical career, her desperation condition will bring her into the role of ranting, re-invents and triumps as her own. Bette singing is always girded, always flat and lacking to show her ability as an actress. To make it fun, this show dies for stronger leaders and a stronger cast, so others would be unforgettable in the absence of Bette. Another criticism: she smiles right into the camera every time she starts singing! I know it's a musical theater, but please leave some love company - Middler can't play like Liza or Streisand in a retrospective tour - out of character and out of context.
