When I wrote Savage Intruder to IMDb, one of the options he came up with was Savage Garden: International Video Collection: The Story So Far (1999), the only reason I mentioned it is because I'm a huge Savage Garden fan & you should do a favor and check some of their music like Affirmation or On the Moon and Back before bothering with this average pot boiler, sorry to say that. Anyway, Savage Intruder begins with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM music and premiere shots and a few spinning portraits that have no meaning at all in the long run. It's the late sixties Hollywood & amid glitz & glamor serial killer is at work choosing aging actresses, killing and disassembling their bodies. A young man named Vic Valance (David Garfield as John David Garfield) jumps out of a bus looking for a job when he stops in the house of the now retired actress Katharine Parker (Miriam Hopkins), who was one of the greatest stars of the film but now lives in a big house with an old housekeeper named Mildred (Florence Lake), personal secretary Leslie Blair (Gale Sondergaard) and a young maid named Geta (Virginia Wing). Katharine recently broke her leg and needs a personal assistant and gives Vic a job. Slowly Vic casts his way into Katharina's affections, and more importantly, is her big wallet. Vic starts turning Katarina against other employees, but Vic is not what it seems. Vic is a drug-dependent loon who gets Greta pregnant while having sex with Katharine. Greta threatens to tell Katharine and spoil Vic's insidious plans, but she has a close encounter with the ax, nobody in the house is safe because Vic brings drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll party & gardening to Parker Castle while his sinister plan It starts to become more and more apparent ... <br /> <br /> Written, Produced and directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess, but also slightly fun. The script is everywhere and can't decide what it wants to be, Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis! The film begins with the discovery of a separate head and limbs, right after another woman (Dorothy Kingston) is killed by a mysterious unknown character, but then completely omits the elements of the slasher films she has just built and never returned to. The Savage Intruder then becomes a good movie, as Vic makes Katharine and shows her how to enjoy life and have an implied sexual relationship with her, it's actually disgusting to think about how old she is to be his grandmother. Katharine stops living the life of a reclause and gives up alcohol as Vic seems to make her happy when they go to a party and hold banquets for her friend Katharine as she does. This part of Savage Intruder wouldn't look like in Disney! So often, the feeling of good things that Vic interrupts and has silly hallucinations about his mother (Sybelle Guardino) and the hatching of an ax hatching, has sex with the Big one in one place. After Greta was murdered, Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror movie, as Vic is revealed for loons that she is. In my opinion, Savage Intruder just doesn't work properly as a movie because it blends different genres with little success. Likewise, the mysterious elements of the murder do not work and they are frankly a little riddle, why go to great lengths to hide the murderous identity during the murderous scenes, but then is it absolutely clear who will actually commit them in the whole movie? Vic as a character didn't help me, at one point he's a cool, calm, clever and sinister man, and then he's a horrible fool! Why kill all your other victims, but try to bring her to Katharine? What makes her so different? If that's because he has money, why not go for her to start? So many questions and so few answers ... Some of the sixtieth dialogue is quite funny when we listen to these days like Vic offers Greta a painkiller, in fact, hard drugs, and Greta says, "What do I need? Vic willingly replies "because your pain" wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies! Or when Katharine suggests that Vic do some gardening and asks "do you have green fingers?" he replies "no, but I'm good in the grass!" There's not much gore in the Savage Intruder, some separate limbs and a pair of disheveled heads. There is also a rather impressive shot when someone has a cut off hand with an ax, which is probably why it is repeated three or four times. Silly-looking drug-delusional scenes must be seen. Technically Savage Intruder is fine, instead of filming in grandiose mansion and Hollywood hills it seems to give a better view than it deserves, acting is average as well as the rest of production. Overall, Savage Intruder feels like he's trying to be a murder mystery, which unfortunately kills the killer and, as a result, just doesn't work. It's a mildly fun disposable watch at best and the sheer clutter of the film worse, you decide which one!
