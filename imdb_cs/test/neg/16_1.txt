For years I have been a big fan of Park's work and "Old Boy" is one of my favorite favorites. <br /> <br /> With great expectations, I rented this movie just to find the worst movie I watched for a while. It's not a horror movie; There is no tension in it and even the "light" part is so lame that I didn't know if to laugh or cry. I introduced a younger brother to Chan-Wook Park and what a disappointment. it got out of it. For me, the idol fell. If you loved movies like "Old Boy", Mr. & Lady "Vengeance" or even his short films on "Three Extremes", don't waste your time, the film isn't worth it.
