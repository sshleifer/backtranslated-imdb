Have you noticed how many really bad movies attract so many 10/10 votes? Not much of Riddle as it happens, but that's not much of a movie. There are two ways to look at how it is dealt in Mail on Sunday. <br /> <br /> 1. It's free, so you can't complain about it. 2. It's free so it can't be very good. <br /> <br /> My voice is number 2. A free DVD in Sunday's newspaper stuff is a recent trend and some big old movies have been dealt. These are the ones that have been forever and have done most of the money they will ever make, so it's a case of anything else that is a bonus. It's the last stop for old movies, not the first for new movies, so you can guess how bad it has to be to skip TV and DVD rental. Plus points are that Vinnie Jones will try hard and Derek Jacobi is good as Dickens. Minus points are longer. Testing is not the same as a poor Vinnie and Jacobi's next tramp character, it's a talking ham that's gone. The story is very weak. Dickens' story has nothing to do with the murders of the film and feels like another film that turned out on the script to make people think it's British Dan Brown without religion. Supporting casts are either for money (Vanessa Redgrave must be really tough) or because they are friends or friends of the filmmakers. It is also very, very long for what it is. Vinnie with his precious Dickens story with him in his jacket pocket everywhere is good for a couple of laughs, but that's it. It's not funny and it's not very good or free.
