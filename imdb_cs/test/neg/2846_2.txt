Bridget Fonda is a sexually satisfied woman of handsome Hart Bochner. One afternoon, he returns home, calls him "honey" and drinks it softly, just to find it annoying. Minutes go, while she's with his cloud silence. He suddenly gets angry and accuses her of infidelity in the absolute absence of any reason, calls her word C, slams her head against the locker, breaks it and breaks it from the second floor. balcony, breaking hand and a few ribs. She wakes up in a hospital where she is revealed to be deaf, though we notice that she is perfectly reading her lips. This avoids any inconvenience associated with an ASL interpreter or having squawk words in the language simulacrum. <br /> <br /> All right. Let me lay down the basic elements of the conspiracy. This beautiful and devoted handicapped woman is defeated by her husband, misunderstood by her old mother, betrayed by her sister, has a bank account emptied by strange hands, almost raped by a fat man who harasses her at the bar, is supposed to have murdered her now, and is watched by two cops (Kiefer Sutherland and Steven Weber), one of whom is only interested in justice, while the other seems to dislike all women and is embarrassed by their presence. The end finds herself standing at an abandoned bus stop with her hand full of money - alone, crying, but brave. <br /> <br /> Now, a pop quiz. There is only one question with choice. "This story was written by: (a) a man or (b) a woman." It doesn't sound sexistically. You could easily imagine a scenario about a decorated military hero and trained warrior captured by his enemies, betrayed by his organization, beaten and tortured, fleeing to exact vengeance, and ending with a woman he loves, whom he thought had lost long ago . <br /> <br /> The direction is functional and conventional. When Fonda regains consciousness in the hospital bed, we see the faces of the anxious doctors and nurses looking at her - that is at the camera - the echo of every scene in countless second-class movies The camera hurls around the hall and the people on sloping white coats and decorated with stethoscopes, hover over the camera. Hart Bochner played a number of evil people in an interesting way - some of them characters are stupid ("die hard") and some are somewhat more than common rude ("and sea states"). His masculine elegance has a kind of evil touch. It would be too easy to cast him as a hero. Nice, deliberately lackluster performance by Steven Weber as a stupid cop - maybe the best in the movie. Bridget Fonda is also interesting. Her acting range is limited, but she is on the full screen. What makes her interested is her almost stereotypical beauty. He's like a high school queen. Very feminine. Of course, she can't help her slipping around or moving so elegantly. He can't do anything with his nose either. For most of its length it is perfectly normal and attractive, but at its tip there are bumps that follow the natural flash of the nostrils. The nose tip is full of intrigue. <br /> <br /> As for the film - Pfui.
