Please - if you have not tried to sit in this garbage and are considering viewing this movie / mini-series - do yourself a favor and find something else. Floss your teeth, start learning to play the cello, beat your dog - what you choose will be time spent better than watching this waste. This is not a bad movie that you can get a couple of laughter from - it just sucks in every possible possible. Just boring from start to finish. And for those animal lovers who feel that my comment is insensitive - if your dog could talk, he or she would be asking for beating rather than watching this mess.
