Okay, I think it would be terrible. But when I saw it, I showed myself wrong. Emily Bergl did a great job like Jason London. Sue Snell was under-used and under-written. The ratios were fine, Dylan Bruno and Rachel Blanchard are definitely stand-outs. When it comes to things that teens and how people claim it's all wrong. It does not matter. My friends and I use the term "swank" and I drove the car and I had someone I changed. It's almost all there. I've never been to an after-game party in a house that has a big light show. Best includes glasses, spear gun and pool .. all in that order. I have to say there will be people who hate it, but I'm not one of them.
