John Knowles Modern Masterpiece, Separate Peace, is one of many subtle and subtly watched words, themes of love, hatred, jealousy, denial and regret. The 1972 version attempts to address this style and what the book is - a love story with a war imminent in the background. <br /> <br /> Version 2004 does not use gently at all, but the appearance in the story view. What awaits you when reading a novel - is a love story, and yes, maybe it's a questionable, homosexual love story. In the novel and the 1972 film version there are sexual undertones everywhere in the writings and dialogue. In the 2004 movie Showtime versions these tensions were dropped and the actors were there late 1920s playing teenagers which caused for mature acting to take away some tenderness or hesitation of innocence in youth. <br /> <br /> I don't like this remake for more reasons. The hair that broke the camels back was that Phineas got the surname on the letters he received from the design boards! Finny is a character who doesn't even need a surname. John Knowles did it deliberately. Although I accept the 1972 version, acting was sometimes a bit amateurish, so what, it was trying to be honest with the novel by shooting at a location at the Phillips Exeter Academy that The Devon Acedemy was based on; which also writer John Knowles took part as a student. Directors and producers have taken all the teenage Exeter students, with the exception of Parker Stevenson whom he attended Brooks School, playing in Paramount Movie! Class by preppies compared to this Canadian College shot, played with adult actors, politically correct, platonic version. No - Try this veto again. The 1972 film version with John Heyl and Parker Stevenson was a real deal for a separate peace on screen. Showtime 2004 movie made for cable version was not.
