Actually, this movie doesn't really happen. There are several key moments, and everything else speaks of the key moment that takes place before the film begins. The primary mechanism used in the story is flashback. Flashbacks can be used very well, but they aren't here. There is no indication when the back or forward flickers, and the events are divided for just a few weeks, so the context in which the scene unfolds is the only way to find out when something will happen. Maybe it was intended to add a sense of mystery in places, but it was very annoying. <br /> <br /> If you are interested in watching 100 minutes of on-screen discussions about why things and lame questioning are good against evil, enjoy. If you're watching close-ups of a mostly blank look at Ryan Gosling's face for most of the movie, he appeals to you, you're lucky. Unfortunately, I can't find any reason to recommend this movie. Oh, and as another review showed, Spacey is really just in the role of a role here, and playing with an uninteresting separation that you've probably already seen. *** The rest contains spoilers though a few big points are held *** <br /> <br /> First, killing a so-called retarded boy happens before the movie opens, and we never know exactly what happened. As a result, he was killed to stop the deep sadness that came over the boy's eyes. There are not many other unanswered questions because the characters outside the boy and the leadership are very one-dimensional. As for what's with the lead character ... More reviews suggest he is crazy. I agree it's not 'okay', but I don't know I call it crazy. The film seems to have been trying to say that it is either autistic or slowed down in some way because it was sure it was slow and could not understand the obvious. Either that or they went to a neglected youth with some separation disorder and / or who were heavily medicated. As always, Ryan Gosling is good at giving something to the viewer, but what seems to have been intentionally left in the air seems to be. This film does not provide any answers, just questions, but it was a bad movie that I didn't really care about.
