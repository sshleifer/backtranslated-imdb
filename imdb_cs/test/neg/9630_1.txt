In this terrible, boring, boring snooze-fest there are no saving graces that bring to mind the "Red Boss Ransom"! Although there are some big stars in this movie, acting is almost even horrible. Glenn Ford, normally a carefree guy, sews with forced emotions. Donna Reed is so over-the-top that she may prove ridiculous. Leslie Nielson is woefully sick and terrible. The son is such a repulsive little brat, I was kidnapped for the kidnapper. The only decent performance in this mish-mash is the relatively small butler role. I may be too rough on the actor, after all, all they did was read the lines they gave them in the script. Oh, that scenario, the turgical piece of an inventive beam that would pull a heart, but just turn your stomach.
