This movie was rented for free, I had no misconception that it was a very bad movie. I rented it for Thanksgiving because we ate turkey and then the family watches a horrible movie. So you ask what makes this movie so bad that you just gave it 2 stars? Dialogue. Lack of dialogue makes this film ideal for the deaf audience. In fact, if you rent it, just turn the volume to zero and jump into any heavy metal CD from your favorite artist. I know you will enjoy it better. The storyline of this vacation Turkey has been so loaded with tech and geek talk you need translators for narration. Now for all those with good sci-fi effects ... eh, they're not much better than video game trailers or cut scenes in worse cases. Even the actors, both of them, are not very interested. They won't say anything over the movie. Many of the technical aspects will make you laugh like a scene where a hero is strapped to a rocket and fires at a city 70 km away (never showing how landed). Scene before we see a robotic watch fire with a gun 12 feet away and miss more shots. We have also been told that the political division between the protagonist and the protagonist is biotechnology (genetically enhanced people) versus cybernetics (machine-refined people), but both seem to be cyborgs or better people. What I was told was that it was a bad movie in the rental shop, it was a cover that looked like a video game cover and there was only one copy, good new versions have many copies available.
