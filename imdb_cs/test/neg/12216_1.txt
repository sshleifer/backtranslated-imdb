I ordered this movie on the internet because it is very difficult to get Turkish movies where we live. I have heard so much about the TV series from my friends and virtually everyone in Turkey, I was expecting a breakthrough in Turkish cinema. What a disappointment. Me and my husband (who is an admirer of any film with a bit of Turkish landscapes and Turkish dialogues in it) followed him to the end because we paid $ 20 for a DVD. Well, that was a boring way to waste it. It was confusing, sometimes exaggerated, while sometimes under the influence. The story was not only confusing, but adding a gay man walking with his dog to the beach and using some toilet humor in the script to make it 'Hollywood' also didn't work for me. American characters were almost too stereotyped that it was neither funny nor realistic, and like the other user, Turkish customs and lifestyle were irrelevant. The camera movement had no meaning. The addition of several Dervishes (never seen in Kapadokya by the way) and broken plates -Greek's style made it difficult to film. I'm ashamed of this film and all the noise the press has made about it. There are certainly good films from Turkish directors that deserve more attention and respect. I give this movie 1 out of 10.
