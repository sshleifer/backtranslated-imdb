Now this movie is the worst I've ever seen! It's just a disaster. I think it's a really sick movie, I just wasted my time watching this cheap crap. I can't believe anyone would cause such a disaster. Such a loss of money and time. Nothing that can be learned from this film is an empty disease. I don't think they can make it even worse, this film deserves a title as king of the lowest crap. Negotiation is a catastrophe, meaning ... oh, there is no sense just the sick pain and grief suffered by the suffering child at the end of the film, and the killing of the wife, which was another stupid blow to this film. . Do yourself a favor if you really have some self-respect, stay away from this horror !!!
