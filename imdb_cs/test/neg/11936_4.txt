The director was probably still in his early stages of learning when he tried to marry the westerns. Look at the clothes. Everyone looks well scrubbed, well brushed, well dressed and well ironed, as if ready for the church. Even horses look well groomed and shiny. This is WEST, for a loud call! It should have looked dusty, ugly and sweaty. And then there is the amateur activity of women in this bird. The whole lot, a dozen or so nicely and well-endowed, was just freshly raped and widowed, but a tear barely spilled. Instead, they all look with great interest (if not lusty) in the newly arriving spectacular seven, who then feed, bandage and comfort with love during the battle with the bandits. The same director's criticism goes for Lee van Cleef, who does reasonably good acting. Our law Lee has lost his dear wife. But Lee, hard as an organic rock, does not evoke any emotions and finds himself in the arms of a succulent widow, with whom he and his young baby go to the future, within a few days of the death of her husband. Cadre. And then there's another thing that always worries me about this type of movies: no matter how many dynamite-induced blasts take place in the middle of a pack of about 50 horses, it doesn't matter how many shots are fired at Rabies, only crooks kill and nails always enjoy one piece. (I know ... stupid moi ... it's just a movie ...). It's not the worst Western ever done, but get ready for serious yawning.
