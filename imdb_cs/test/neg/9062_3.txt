I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn't terribly motivating, nor did they get an idea of ​​what a training plan would look like, so non-marathoners could have an idea of ​​what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact, there was almost no technical information at all. I didn't expect it to be a technically demanding instructional video, but when this information approaches zero, the film was not balanced and was not particularly useful for non-marathons who thought about their first run. <br /> <br /> There were other problems. Some of the first paintings were people who collapsed near death and tried to run the race. Yeah, really inspiring. The timing was also hard to watch because it was semi-chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues about how long you were watching. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor is hurt, and you just assume it's all of her workouts, but then a few scenes later finally teach you that it's because she tripped over the cone in the yard. Some parts were very good, although it was something about a woman who defied race officials who wanted the run to be just a man, and coverage of the Chicago race, where two were the first to compete from previous runners. At the top of my head, I think of other chronological documents like Supersize Me and Grass, where you always know where you are and feel like they've told you everything you wanted to know. In short, it would not be difficult to make a better marathon film, and as it stands, I cannot recommend it to marathoners to educate and motivate them to try, because I do not. I think it will have such an effect.
