OK, I don't normally add comments to movies, but in the end I watched a movie that was so full of bullsh * t and riddled with incompetence that I had to warn people. The Blackwater Valley Exorcist is loosely about wife-beats / pederast / priest and this family of horse-lunatic horses, and make a long story of the shortest youngest daughter who has been harassed by a priest, but in love with a hillbilly ranch's hand gets possessed. Along with a heroic god who avoided a Mexican gardener who had once been involved in exorcism, his wife-beat / pederast / priest could save the day, but not before the possessed demon was able to jump on the hooker the city sheriff had thrown him into the air. . All in all, this movie is the biggest pile of useless (I could get very descriptive with this part, but why waste my energy on this movie) sh * t I've ever seen. All and all those involved in making this film should be sterilized so that they cannot pollute the Earth with their unnecessary scum.
