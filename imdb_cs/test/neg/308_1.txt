This would have to be rated as one of the worst films of all time. The film was screened at the Italian film festival in Melbourne, Australia. After the screening, I wanted my money to be returned. I have a very broad tolerance for the leniency of some European films, but it is one of those films that are selected for festivals based on the filmmaker's reputation. This film is proof that even if such choices can satisfy the ego of the filmmaker and the selection panel, there is no joy to the audience. There is no character development at all, the plot is a garbled mess, the style is pointless, the choice of shots is scary and the cut is worse. At the end of the first reel you will wonder if you have entered the wrong cinema and beg at the end of the third reel to be excluded from your suffering. This film is an abomination.
