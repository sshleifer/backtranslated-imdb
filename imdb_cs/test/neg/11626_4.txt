Mickey Rourke (who was once a famous movie star) plays Martin Fallon, an IRA terrorist who accidentally throws out a school bus full of children who are so disgusted with his actions that he decides to leave the IRA and go to London <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! The opening of the film is somewhat disturbing because the lives of young children end up in a fireball. Things like this happened in the 1970s and 1980s and in Northern Ireland in the 1990s, which gives PRAYER DYING realism. But when Fallon decides to give up the violence (What? He's a terrorist and he never blows out innocent bystanders?) Realism disappears and clichés and ridiculous conspiracies take place. Martin is busy in the London Underworld (don't have his own hits?) To hit while he wears a "uniform" (never knowing that he was wearing uniforms) in a cemetery in the daylight. The IRA man uses a bomb under his car? Where the priest who sees him when he was in SAS will see him. Hands up, who thinks I'm lying? I am not and we are in the middle of the run and there are still a few clichés to come <br /> <br /> That sounds very stupid and it is, but what do you expect from Jack Higgins' novel? Everything is cliché, inventive and stereotypical and pieces that are not just plain bizarre. Critics killed this film when it came out, most notably they said it might have some potential if the film had Bob Hoskins starring the gangster Jack Meehan and Alan Bates playing SAS soldier turned the priest and for one critics would be right. They should also note that the film could be less desperate if Fallon were played by anyone who could make an Irish accent. Rourke might be hunky and macho (Oh Gawd another movie with IRA uberhunk), but the accents aren't his strength any more than acting. To give you an idea of ​​how unsatisfactory a prayer for dying is a director who rejected her, which is always a bad sign <br /> <br /> As a footnote, the original edition of PRAYER FOR THE DYING in Britain has been delayed for several months. because of the "Enniskillen bombing". In November 1987 a provisional IRA exploded a bomb in the center of Enniskillen where a memorial day parade that commemorates the British War dead was held. Eleven (11) people were killed and injured. It wasn't an accident and no one left the IRA for that
