May contain Spoilers. The Innocent Trailer Park or maybe 'Compton' LA White Child witnesses a terrible childhood tragedy about drugs and violence. Unprofessional, but dedicated police partners are trying to take down the "sophisticated" high-club drug club to be expelled and chewed by pharmacist ambassadors. The story gets stronger when more people return to revenge and justice with a predictable end. The only unforgettable part was going through Ron Jeremy. <br /> <br /> If I was at the movies, I'd ask for a refund. I'm sorry about the poor actors in this movie. Watching it was just horrible and painful. The worst thing was cinematography, when the director was still flickering in the same scene, so that the sound didn't match. And NO was not a codec or DVD problem, but a deliberate technique. Ughh. Two stars.
