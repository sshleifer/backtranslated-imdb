I'll tell you a story. One day, in the streets of Athens, a film director came across a male prostitute and decided that the world just had to know his story because ... you know ... She's gone ... and takes off her shirt a lot. .. so on. This film is the result of his revelation. A repulsive, corrupt, homophobic, misogynist ... but of course full of pretty boys with their bosom. If this is your idea of ​​a good movie, then enjoy it if you avoid it, such as plague. It's going to Greece for me.
