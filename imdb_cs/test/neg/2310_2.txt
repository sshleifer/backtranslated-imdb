I really have to evaluate "Sex is Comedy" as one of the worst pieces I've ever seen. The film indirectly demonstrates those that are the worst aspects of French, or at least how stereotypical, narcissistic, snobbish and pseudo-intellectualism are. I am French-Canadian myself and I feel a bit ashamed that the creators of this film come from the same culture as me, which should give you an idea of ​​how bad this movie really is! This film is not so much seen as being subjected to torture, there was a total lack of humor, and it seemed to me that the whole film was a documentary interview with people who were neither famous nor talented, as if they were celebrating something that never happened . Instead of not watching Auberge Espagnole, Happenstance, or Je t'aime ... la folie, three fantastic modern French movies.
