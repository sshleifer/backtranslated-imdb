As I wrote this user comment, Tim Burton's interpretation of the story of Sweeney Todd makes big cash at the box office, and the film even earned a few Oscar nominations if I'm right. I haven't seen it yet, but I sincerely hope Burton wasn't looking for inspiration and / or style marks in the good old Andy Milligan's "Bloodthirsty Butchers". Yes, although the name makes a lot of reference to butchers, the main characters in the plot are the barber (the infamous Sweeney Todd) and the female baker. Together, they form a nasty alliance where they kill customers in their store and process their bodies into their famous London meat pies. In other words, Andy Milligan assumes his most typical, more derived, delirious and amateur character. I think the IMDb rating for this movie speaks for itself. Although the real story is definitely not the worst I've ever seen, Milligan somehow inexplicably attracts total mistrust. Production is one huge mess, with an incoherent narrative structure, a truly vile photograph, poor lighting, miserable acting and directing, ridiculous gore and zilch's tension or atmosphere. More than half of the shots are purely padded and the words can't describe how the BORING movie is, even at just 80 minutes. Ed Wood, Ted V. Mikels and Bruno Mattei; you don't have to worry like no one else but Andy Milligan is? hands down ??? the worst director ever, but I don't think he cared. Perhaps if you have a really high level of tolerance, "Bloodthirsty Butchers" is worth one look.
