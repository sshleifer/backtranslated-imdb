Wow, this movie is really sucked under the normal scale of boring, boring and unimaginable movies I've seen recently. Behavior was bad and robotic. The story was so bland that you could sum it up with a simple 5-minute shortcut. The sound was so poor and dirty it was hard to even listen; Maybe it was back from the camera he was shot down from? I'm not sure which movie 3 shining reviewers commented on, but it wasn't this one. Perhaps the director had a hand when he saw that his film had a good overview, at least before real reviews began to appear. this movie. Absolute suction!
