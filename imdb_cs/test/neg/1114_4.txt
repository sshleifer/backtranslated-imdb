In 1913, at Carlton Mine, Addytown, Pennsylvania, a cruel mine owner used poor children in exploration and after the blast, a group of children is buried alive. Karen Tunny (Lori Heuring) has now lost her husband after a long period of terminal illness when family savings were spent on treatment. Without money, she moves with her daughters Sarah (Scout Taylor-Compton) and Emma (Chloe Moretz) to an old mountain house that belonged to her husband. Karen is recommended by her neighbors to stay home at night, and Sarah hears that there are zombies in the area. When Emma becomes Mary's friend, her mother thinks he's an imaginary friend. But when Sarah's friends are attacked and eaten by live zombie children and Emma disappears, Karen and Sarah chase her near the mine. ; makeup is scary; and cinematography and musical score are excellent. However, the story and the script are very weak, a really bad collection of clichés. The beginning is reasonable, the widow moves to a house in a secluded place because the family has spent all its resources with the patriarch's disease. But when it comes, even small zombies attack people without consequences, for example, families do not seek missing persons. Then the evil Mr. Carlton comes to the place with the most disgusting attitudes, typical clichés that will eventually die. There is no explanation as to why children attacked innocent people and why they should stop after killing Carlton. When Sarah runs away with her mother and says she's tired and can't run anymore, it's one of the dumbest lines I've ever seen in a horror movie. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Zombies"
