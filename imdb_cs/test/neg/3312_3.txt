OK. Well, I think it was worth sitting once *, but I won't watch it again. There are a few things about this movie that irritated me. First, man ... I really hated characters. I had the same problem with Sid and Nancy. I have no time to rationalize the righteous time that follows the characters I don't really care about, and I can't relate to them. It's not that actors or writing are technically wrong; it was that the characters were written in such a way that I had only contempt for them, and almost as I saw the sky falling upon them as the film continued. And that leads me to the second problem and the question I think is at the heart of this film: Was it the intention to simply document this generation and these types of bohemians who were (I think) wandering in Europe in the 1960s? Was the intention to criticize them and lambaste? Or was this film a warning? My final film rating (that is, in determining whether there is anything that could be saved) depends on this issue. Regardless, these characters are really unlikely, and as a result, it's hard to bullshit or conspire. If it were a statement about this generation, then the film would become a little more tolerable. It is clear that Schroeder is not a geriatric business square, so the way it proceeds carries more weight than, say, countless silly AIP movies that take place in or against the 1950s. This movie has two things for it - the first, the soundtrack (of course). I like the way Cymbaline is used here, and others have mentioned it as well, because it occupies a prominent place in the film. I believe that if you are a Pink Floyd fan and want to see it for this reason, nothing you read here will probably stop you from following it anyway (it won't stop me). The curiosity of hearing Pink Floyd in the movie may be enough to make it hard for you. Second, there is a nice scenery. Ibiza looks like a nice place to visit. Maybe I'm just sick of looking at Los Angeles, New York and Chicago in movies, but European movies that give us time to really show Europe (beautiful or ugly - mostly beautiful) are always welcome. But I really don't see any special genius. No revolutionary camera, no moral, tone, message, sensitivity, or storyline to say. Perhaps what was a revolutionary was merely that he came from a guy like Schroeder - a film critical of the way of thinking that at least partly caused his films to be negotiable. This is an honorable film; there is no celebration of surplus surpluses in the 1960s, something that you might expect. In fact, the depiction of characters in this film closely reflects (somewhat distorted, in my opinion) the modern cultural memory of this generation. Oh yeah, a bunch of nudity and sex here; nothing new if you watch these kinds of movies from this time period. I think it was considered new or provocative, or something at that time. I do not consider it offensive or titilizing (I doubt you will either be); rather it extends the running time of a boring movie. In this way, this particular use of sexuality in films of that time (especially European) has become a little clich√©. But I think you can't blame them in retrospect; in that decade, which is able to "get rid of it" and I think (I guess here) the very presence of this kind of graphic sexuality was a political or social statement in itself (that sexuality was part of the life that this generation would not be their parents). <br /> <br /> Should you track it? If you're a Pink Floyd fan, be sure ... I think it's worth a watch. The valley is in any case a better film. I went to this movie and expected what I got. If you don't normally watch these kinds of art, avant-garde movies, and don't know what to expect, it's annoying for me. This is a normal, healthy response :) <br /> <br /> If you're not a Pink Floyd fan, I'm not sure why you're spending your time here. I noticed one colleague who left a comment, enjoyed this movie so maybe I miss something. I don't need guys running in slow motion from fireballs, special effects, blasts, or something to enjoy a movie. But I need some sort of handle - I have to find something that I like about the film, and generally I have to sympathize with some aspect of the character's situation (preventing any new film work from going on). There's nothing to hold on except for the grandeur of Pink Floyd. Which is * enough * to be tolerable. If you are at a low level, if you are a Pink Floyd fan, you will enjoy Cymbaline, I promise.
