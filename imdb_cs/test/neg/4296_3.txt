She took the chance to find out if my good message slipped into a really good WWI movie - that's not it. John Phillip Law and Don Stroud are both in their performance and in bad behavior for their roles. Dialogue is stupid or does not exist; The flying sequences are fine, but quite repeated. Compared to the amazing "Blue Max", this film should never be made. Watch George Peppard, James Mason and Usula Andress at BM and you'll get the reason this movie is one of the best war movies ever made, and that's not. Recently released on DVD Richtofen and Brown is presented as some great 'lost classic' from the 1970s. Don't waste your time or $.
