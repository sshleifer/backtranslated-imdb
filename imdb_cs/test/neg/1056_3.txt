I'm sorry to disagree with you, but I found the DKC series quite engaging. So much that I invested in SNES and my own copies of games. That is, I think, almost a decade after DKC 1's initial release. Music and characters are all unforgettable and games have brought dozens of hours of fun to yourself and your girlfriend. It is true that the second game was better than the first and the third may have missed the "edge" of the second installment. But all three have offered a different game and I still enjoy them today. By the way, I'm old enough to remember when there were no video games at all (and the TVs were black and white!).
