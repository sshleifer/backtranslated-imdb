There's no better way to describe the HORRENDOUS experience that looks at Mamma Mia: Hitler has to look up and tell the pseudo-director Phyll Lloyd 'You monster what you did?' <br /> <br /> Everything about film is bad. Just?? Poorly! Even his success, which is inexplicable. I can understand when those crappy parody movies like Epic Movie make their minimum share of money and turn profit just because they are cheap (of course they are!). But when something like Mamma Mia makes $ 450 million worldwide, you think "what the hell is wrong with the world?" And think that we have Meryl Streep, one of the world's greatest live actresses , in it? What did she think? "I need money," she said. Well, then sell one of your grandchildren, even if it's less embarrassing. It's not that Meryl is good at a disastrous piece, film, film. It's also disastrous! When he sings, even if he has vocals, it's ridiculous. Worse than her only Pierce Brosnan. It was James Bond. Now she sings Abba in purple spandex during the worst movie credits ever. Really? And when I mention Abba, not that I have something against the band and their music. Although they don't help when the actors started singing (wrong), dancing (worse) and the extras then joined together (They emerge out of nowhere! Often!), To introduce one terrible musical sequence after the other. You want to cry when music starts. And I love musicals! But this is the first in the genre where PRAY is for real silence. <br /> <br /> I could go on. The list goes on forever. You can write a Stephen King novel with a complete list of bugs in this movie. Summary: Go look! Really! You must witness understanding! And because it's a huge success, who cares if it makes you a few dollars? And they don't like selling your soul to the devil. Meryl did it before. For all mankind. And now the world must end because we have done the ultimate evil and we must be destroyed.
