I like this movie and I've been watching my copy twice since I got it a few weeks ago. But you have to look at it in the right context. <br /> <br /> I didn't check on the dates, but I bet this movie came out afterwards, and at about the same time as Collier and Walt Disney's popularity. The spaceflight vision is supported by W.Von Braun. This is reflected in the effort to seem factually correct and scientific. However, while some thoughts are given across (eg Step Boosters) roughly, other things are generally wrong. For example, it is said that a rocket rises high and then turns ninety degrees. enter the space ... as you reach the top of the staircase and turn to landing! Then we were told that by turning in the direction of Earth's rotation, the overall speed of the ship would increase accordingly. This is a merry misunderstanding of what's really going on. Most space centers are placed as close to the equator where the Earth and anything on its surface rotate about a thousand miles per hour, including any rocket that goes into space, eastward (as well as planet rotation). ). Of course, if the ship turns west once in space, its speed relative to the Earth's surface would be greater, but nothing would add to the actual vehicle speed. In this film it is referred to as "air speed"! Similarly, we were told that passengers only feel free falling or "weightlessness" when they reach thousands of miles from the Earth, outside the planet's gravitational field. Again, comically wrong. Most manned spacecraft travel no more than a few hundred miles, but if (and their contents, including the crew) travel at a reasonable rate, their outward momentum balances the gravity thrust, the free-fall orbits. Of course, traveling far from Earth and even a slow object will lie well outside of Earth's gravity, but to leave Earth's orbit, it must reach outward (for example, the Moon) "escape speed," about twenty thousand. miles per hour. Thus, by definition, the vehicle has achieved "orbital speed" (and "weightlessness"). But the movie has a lot more good things than this. Someone decided it would be more fun if they lost a month due to a technical problem, fell asleep for a few days, and then woke up to find out that they had reached Mars! The captain then overruns that it must have been a divine intervention! At what point any pretense of being scientific is torn into small pieces, such as confetti and thrown into the wind in the middle of a cheerful dance of still Burmese conspiracy. The power of a movie like this is in fact illustrating "how far we have come." Last but not least in attitudes towards women. The drivel, who is deployed to a crew member, is both cheerful and shocking. Do you think such attitudes have been "normal" lately. As I said at the beginning, I consider this movie to be very entertaining, like late night, the lights jumping over the romance of space travel, from the days before it actually happened. An antidote to the cold space flight routine, as it has now become in the twenty-first century. <br /> <br /> I will not reveal the end. It's a brave and shocking movie of this year and character.
