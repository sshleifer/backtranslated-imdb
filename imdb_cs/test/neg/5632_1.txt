This film was pure waste. It's not a worse movie at all. If it were to be broken, the deal was good enough to do the job, but the script was out there and so stupid that one was thinking, "Where did my life go?" Even Vanessa Redgrave ~ I love (and that's why I watched it) was useless. Wasted. She didn't leave any impression. The director was so distant that I didn't have much left of the character, but they didn't leave anything to see Redgrave. Part of it was nothing. She was good as the average boss, but that was it. In depth and she is given depth to small roles ~ see Venus and Reconciliation. I wouldn't waste time and I was upset that I spent $ 5 on this movie ... I wanted it back. No revenue. Skip the movie. It will only bring you sadness ... and boredom.
