I saw this movie yesterday, and like most allrdy wrote "I was also expecting Steven's movie", God I love this guy just because his fighting style is unique and very humerous. In had a bit of doubt causing me to read that "I rule" was playing in it, but I thought hopefully they would give him a smal role so I don't get irritated by watching him. And offcourse opposite happens, goooooooooooooooooooood steven what the hell did you think you'd want to join the sry *** crew like that. Steven was broken and needed money? bah = (what a disappointment. If you like Steven's movie, please skip this clean drama, you'll get just a few special effects that made me vote 3/10. > <br /> My beer went from fresh to water tasting we do dishes in. The story didn't have any "good" about it. I felt like 3 years old. in future movie.
