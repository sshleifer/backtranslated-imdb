I was just following this "latest" version of Macbeth and I was pleasantly surprised by the solid gaming and obvious effort that had to turn a historic piece with a low budget into a full-fledged movie. One note, however, music was very lame and didn't add anything to the film's intensity and sounded like someone with a keyboard and lots of samplers as opposed to a full orchestral score. I think Paul Farrer must get his act together!
