This is another Bollywood remake of Hollywood movie. Hitch ... If I'm right. The film has a few great moments that will make you laugh out loud, which sincerely come from Govinda, who has become a legend in the Indian cinema and will always bring his Comedy play. Another bonus is Rajpal Yadav; who is cheerful as a gangster who imitates 'Don', an Indian cinema icon. Lara Dutta is a plus ... I know it sounds shallow, but mainly because I have a soft place for her, she's trying to be funny, but she seems to be forced. Her actions are weak ... but shining. Salman Khan is cruel, trying to bring cool, enchanting depths, but fails miserably, overcomes actions, and still shouts for no apparent reason. 'It's not a playmate, it's called mentally challenged' Katrina Kaif is just bad ... she's not very good at anything. No charisma, no talent ... and I don't understand why people consider her nice ... The plot was very appealing and I had a hard time believing that Katrina's character was remotely attracted to Govinda. The only good thing is music ... "You're my love" was the best in the soundtrack.
