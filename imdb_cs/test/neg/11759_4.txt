This movie really starts strong. We know Roberts is Atlanta's introductory message to Australia to fix Coke's marketing problems. We also know he's an eccentric genius. Roberts' gentle action will convince us quite quickly. Unfortunately, the plot is so fragile that whatever development of a subtle character has been achieved is negated by emptiness, inconsistency, and totally boring film sequences. Usually I'm crazy for courageous and distant lands. Examples I like include "Dark Star", "O.C. & Stiggs" and "Popeye". In connection with the fact that I have to admit that this film was fine, I am also surprised that I cannot recommend this film. The complete collapse of this film takes place in the middle of the film. All comedy is instantly lost and the film darkens. Then the film is stretched. The movie to get a comedy will fail again. Other surprises await the viewer and are getting darker. <br /> <br /> For sure, mixing a drama with a comedy can be a model of success. However, with this film, the result is about as successful as "new coke."
