The theatrics and drama involved in the film is fantastic, but the facts and research is far from solid. When quoting Dr. Bovona, where the documentary tries to make contact with Mary Magdalene of Mariamena, Dr. Bovon later clarifies that it should be used for literary purposes (ie, the fables of that time) not for the historical character. In fact he says, he does not believe the Mariamene ossuary in Talpiot's Mary Magdalene. He further comments on his public letter that he was not informed that his words would be used for this document, but rather for information on the Acts of Philip (literary work in the 4th century). So, what we have here is a director who made one clip for the history of Philip's 4th century fantasy and used it specifically to support the 1st century ossuary inscription. Very sad section and Dr. Bovon calls the connection of Jesus and Mary Magdalene as "science fiction" - this document should be properly labeled.
