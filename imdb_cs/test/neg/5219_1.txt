OK, Chuck Norris has shown up in many fun movies over the years. This is not one of them. I will not even bother trying to get into a conspiracy that the Bible shipment has become bad. "Acting" the main characters is as wood as, Pinocchio would do a better job! The synthesizer-based soundtrack is even worse than the Deathstalker. While traditionally low budget spooky movies often try to catch their audience by adding a lot of graphic violence, this one tries to catch the audience by throwing a religious mambo jumbo at the viewer. The story boils down to different versions of the Bible.
