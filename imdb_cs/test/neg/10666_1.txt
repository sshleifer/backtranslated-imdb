I watched the films of the last 10 years and I must say that I never felt so bad, which I felt when I watched this extra large movie, it was bad, very bad. There were songs and songs. No one should watch this movie. The director showed the Germans speaking English, which is waste. The Germans don't speak English. There was a white girl on one scene asking Himesha for an autograph. (Obvious that he had to give her some money) In the promo they showed up to prepare for Laughing riot. But I could say there was only one scene where Himesh laughs for no reason that he thinks he's funny. Hansika is very good. is like an angel. But too young for only 16 years. If you have enough time and do not know what to do, you should watch this movie or otherwise waste money
