I was one "selected" to see this movie in a sneaky preview. First of all you should know that this film is based on the video game "far cry", for its time really good game (2004). the second you should know that the regisseur of this movie is a great uwe boll. This is a man who takes video games (dungeon siege, bloodrayne, postage, etc.) and makes them movies (very awful ....). I still remember when I saw boll's "royal swords: dungeon besiege tail". there were such horrible mistakes in this movie (like 3 scenes playing at the same time, 2 in the daytime and one at night .....) so you can get into "distant crying" ". you are expecting a great event, forget it, really cheap tricks and a plastic helicopter are far from real action, if you expect a great story, forget it, this movie, which is not so bad in the game, is laughing. Moments funny, but not in a good way. <br /> <br /> I had the opportunity to see this movie for free, so don't make a mistake and pay for this waste.
