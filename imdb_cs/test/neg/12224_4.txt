RKO tried to reinforce his star JOAN FONTAINE when she was cast as a flying nurse who was strong enough for the doctor (JOHN BEAL) to come to terms with escaping responsibility in this small programmer. TCM aired it as a stepping stone in Joan Fontaine's career. Fontaine is reputable and does an acceptable job, nothing more, and John Beal is fine as her love interest. However, it is clear that PHILIP HUSTON (who has the appearance and courtesy of young James Garner) is an actor who should share top billing with Fontaine. What happened to this handsome actor? Why did RKO not promote him with Fontaine? He showed skill as a light comedian. These are the thoughts that went through my mind as I watched the somewhat lukewarm drama never endure up to the strict promise of its title. The story itself is somewhat tiring, only occasionally coming to life thanks to the lively heroine Fontaine. Photographs pretend as a nurse and wears his serious expressions skilfully, suggesting that they should be used more in the future. date. Beal has never come to an excellent career and his performance shows why. Strictly bland. But what happened to Philip Huston? The proof is that he should have a good film career. Trivia Note: Watch Dwight Frye ("Dracula") as out of control of a patient on board an aircraft.
