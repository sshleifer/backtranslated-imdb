The worst movie I've ever seen and I've seen assigned. Acting is terrible, the plot is terrible, the idea is terrible and no research has been done as possible! Ok, I admit, "Air Bud" was a pretty good movie, but not "Soccer Dog". This "dog" is smaller than my cat! How can he play football? Even for 10-year-olds, it will not be a problem to kick the ball so hard that a silly dog ​​halts! It's horrible, don't watch this movie.
