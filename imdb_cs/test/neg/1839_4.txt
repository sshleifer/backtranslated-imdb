This relatively obscure Hong Kong "tiny piece" is the perfect desert island film for the film age peeping toms (at least its first half is). Every lineup, every scene, every sequence is an excuse to look up the girl's skirt, staring at her breasts, glancing at her bottom and angrily at her narrow crotch. What it bases on is the perverse tendency of the leading character, of course (!) <br /> <br /> The genre of pious Anthony Wong is a marginally perverted married man, plagued by erotic dreams and outrageous fantasies. All include terribly clad, sexy Chinese ladies with nothing but sexual slavery in their minds. The land is amplified by a murderous subplot, voodoo doll skewering and a little rape and looting. Some sex scenes are quite hot and gore is liberal, but the supernatural elements introduced into the other half feel half-baked and the plot's development is ridiculous. It is clear that the producer of brave garbage Wong Jing was in a terrible hurry to get it to and from the theaters. The rich name of the sequence wasn't crazy about this tired punter.
