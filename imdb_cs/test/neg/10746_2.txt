I was looking forward to Dante's contribution to this excellent series of horror anthologies from Showtime, but that was the worst of the game. It's really bad. Part of this may be due to poor, odd choice of source materials. Why Joe didn't just write the original, I have no idea. Instead, we get this episode of soapboxes, where "news" overcomes the script, the characters, the staging, everything, and finally I just wondered if it could be worse, and I won't mess it up ... but it got worse. What a stink of such a talented creative team. Skip this and buy Carpenter instead. It can balance all elements: horror, humor, character, vision and fun. Returning home is about as fun as a bear will sleep on you.
