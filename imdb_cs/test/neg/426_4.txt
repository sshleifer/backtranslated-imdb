Jeff Speakman never did it at the lowest levels of martial artist-turned actors (lower than Don "The Dragon", such as Wilson) and with vehicles like "Expert" you can see why. There are three main issues with this movie: 1) Plot - or I should say plots - are all over the place, there are some characters that take a lot of time on the screen but serve a small purpose, 2) there are only 4 combat scenes in total , some of them are completely unrelated to the main plot, and some are in the dark, 3) The musical score is exaggerated and prevalent. Strange, as it may seem, it's really the most enjoyable thing about this movie: the score is constantly trying to convince you that you're watching some great epic, instead of the low-budget, limited action movie you're really watching. With all that has been said, at least James Brolin is giving him a touch of credibility. * 1/2 of 4.
