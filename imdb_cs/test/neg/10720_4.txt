Unfortunately, it's not as good as the other movies that Jim Carrey (producing and playing) and Brian Grazer have worked on, but his pieces are definitely worth seeing. Basically, Dick Harper (Carrey) thinks he's promoted to a better job. This is until Dynocorpe sinks and closes. Of course, Dick and his wife Jane (TÃ©a Leoni) and their son have money problems. No matter what they are trying to do, they can't raise the money they really want. So they start robbing a few places. And then they decide to rob that guy who built Dick up, his former Jack McAllister (Alec Baldwin). I think the most ridiculous pieces are when Carrey is singing "I Believe I Can Fly" in the elevator and that bit when someone joins in a robbery and talks to a voice changer (that sounds like a crap). Good!
