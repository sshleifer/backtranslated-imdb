This film spends a lot of time preaching against marijuana. But the storyline and visuals are so crazy that it looks more like a poster poster for LSD. Plot: The heroic struggle of Michael to fight drug addiction while being subjected to the humiliation that brought him Yeah, yes, there's good news, but it's covered by the fact that the writers took a rather outdated PSA idea and tried to reach it within 30 years. minutes. This includes a succession of songs where you said there are a million, rational ways to say "No!" for example, "I can't smoke a pot, I have homework!" Writers can't imagine what to do with the characters they brought for free. Initially, we see that everyone has to hide from human characters, but in five minutes we see them all looking unconscious without being noticed. Soon they will start working with the human cast, and the only one who is still a little disturbed by this is not a drug addict, but he's a little sister who talks to her bear (Pooh, by the way). drug demon floating around. Because you know, rifles don't give children drugs. He is also ambiguous - although he might be symbolic of Michael's addiction, and therefore is not to be seen by other people, he laters goes and haunts Little Corey to get HER into drugs. So I think it's ... uhhh ..... moving on! The whole event will eventually culminate in some crazy succession in which Michael is in what appears to be a Saturday morning carnival, aka an amusement park from hell where various cartoon characters beat him and ignore him and all. For example, Miss Piggy eats him in a sandwich and drinks it. If the writers were not too high in writing this text, I would recommend that they try to get to college because they couldn't be crazier than this. Of course, the film ignores the fact that Michael has high values ​​for two years with this point, so why would this tripping sequence scare him behind me. <br /> <br /> I realize I was totally hunting this movie. But I actually saw it again because I went through the trouble of watching it on eBay because it's a total shame it's a BAD cartoon. The level of unintentional humor is brilliant. Take this scene, for example - Michael's dad took a beer in his fridge. He noticed that many of them were missing and mentioning it to his wife. Still attentive mom tells him, "Don't worry, you probably drank them last night watching football." While we are supposed to learn that Michael drinks beer (except pots and cracks), instead we read on and realize - Hey kids, it's okay to have chemical addiction if you're grown up! Scenes like this are worth the small price of this movie. Yeah, and the fact that you'll learn that Simon Chipmunk says, "Marijuana."
