I waited for this movie to improve, but that's the worst kind of escapist movie: a spun-sugar confection that falls under the weight of its own cumbersome own meaning. The pace comes across as a legionary stranded in the Sahara. The absence of good dialogue leaves little stars attractive to look good in white underwear. Irons plays more money that has touched the sun. Kaas is a nice singer, but not much of an actress. Fortunately, the screenplay often doesn't make her go away from the jazz club microphone. All hostile, nice and useless characters alternate with fancy scenery with air-tired sophistication. The whole exercise takes place as an infinitely long Ralph Lauren advertisement. <br /> <br /> If you are about forty and believe that Francophilia is the key to sophistication, you can confuse this piece of cardboard with a baguette. If you liked the movie, you probably felt smart when you appreciated Godard's lead Ã‰loge de l'amour, and maybe you're even through Le Divorce without crouching.
