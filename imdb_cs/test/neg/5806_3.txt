What one would expect from any Adam Sandler comedy is grandmother's boy predictable and so stupid that it's scary. Allen Covert plays as Alex in the film, a 35-year-old pothead who works as a video game tester and had to move with his grandmother and two roommates after losing his apartment. There are some common twists: it has difficulty adjusting to the new life situation, which in turn causes it difficulty in work, which is especially bad because it is trying to bring one of the new counselors to the office. Throw a strange boss, an almost extraterrestrial star of society, a really stupid best friend, a couple of scenes in the place of a burned potter, a really big party scene, and the original video game Alex is trying to finish himself into the mix that you have with your grandmother. Boy in full. Allen Covert is just a marginally good lead, Linda Cardellini is so cute that she has become a counselor to Samantha, a fair worker, and several scenes are going to splash laughter or two, but none of it does. Grandma's boy is worth having a lot of time. Most of the supposed humorous "jokes" or "gags" or anything you want to tell them is nothing but "humor" that would make a National Lampoons quarrel, Joel Moore is incredibly rude in his role World Champion of the Video Game JP, and the whole movie actually manages to be boring on top not funny or substantial. At least Grandma's boy had done something for someone: Adam Sandler was able to get a few payouts to his non-working friend David Spade, Kevin Nealon, and Rob Schneider.
