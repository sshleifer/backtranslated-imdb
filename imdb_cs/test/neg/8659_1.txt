this is the worst movie I've ever seen, and what disappointed me the most is that it is yash paradise movie so at first when you see promos that you think so, this is definitely another yash paradise hit But when you see the movie your eyes will be water with a disappointing plot being stupid and stupid we've seen it many times the boy is early to marry and falls in love with a girl blah blah blah. If you see that this poor movie isn't going with your family, there's too much exposure and a kiss. I don't even see why you would go to see it yourself. overall, it is a shameful disgusting and anything else that is wrong and starts with the movie d don't go see it you'll end up hating yash her and yash paradise movies
