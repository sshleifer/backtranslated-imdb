Here is. New horror icon for new millennium. Better than Freddy. More dangerous than Jason Vorhees. More evil than Michael Myers. Hard to believe, I know. But his time is here .... Ray The Prick. Yeah, adversary, Ray is a complete Prick. This is partly due to the naughty thing he does. Also because he has a scar on his face (oh, scary). But mainly because Ray The Prick was milked. Yeah, Ray doesn't do evil. He is neither cursed nor voodoo. No, Ray The Prick was milked. As DeNiro once said: "You can milk some nipples". And Ray was milked. Evil. <br /> <br /> How does milk ask you? Snake nipples, I'll answer. Nipple snake. Why do you ask Ray? Because it is a crap, I will answer. Capital P. <br /> <br /> Make sure the new pictures are fantastic with the title "Freddy Vs. Ray The Prick. Did you think your new horror savior was Jeeper Creeper? Not anymore, because Ray The Prick is here. And I'm afraid. Too bad that the atmosphere-less, PG-13, the non-original working class quality though, because Ray is a star.
