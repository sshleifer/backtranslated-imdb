You can't really blame the filmmaker for celebrating Che because the industry is about money. Most of the stories you hear about this "freedom fighter" are harsh, created by the Communist Cuban government after Che's death. Che was murdered from day one. Here is a list of the great things Che did for Cuba 1) He executed thousands of innocent Cuban men, women and children to satisfy his desire for power. 2) Destroyed the economy of Cuba and good standing with the rest of the world. The Cuban peso was the same as the US dollar. Now it's basically worthless. 3) Constantly failed in all things that included diplomacy, economics, and the military. He never did it through his first year in medical school, and he was only in one real battle, in which he surrendered with a fully loaded weapon. 4) He took over the largest estate in Cuba for himself. He had a yacht, a 60-inch television from America, a pool and ocean views. So much for avoiding a materialistic lifestyle. Cuba is now a very poor country, and for this you cannot anyone but Che and Castro brothers, if you go to Cuba today, you will not be allowed out of the tourist areas. would find slums, beggars, and prostitutes. <br /> <br /> If you think any of those I say is false, then do some study, compare Cuban exports from 1950/60 to today's; who have survived or had parents in the so-called Cuban "Revolution" of the 1960s, read all the reports of the innocent murdered, read the news from the people who served under Che and Castro and fled for what is evil, disgusting human being. it was. <br /> <br /> Please be sure to always read or watch everything objectively, stop taking everything at par and think about it.
