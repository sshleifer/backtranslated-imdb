About 5 minutes into the movie you are thrown into this brutally lukewarm cat and the romance mouse between the two main characters and it just gets worse from there. The biggest problem is the characters and how absolutely incredible they are. This is what 50-year-old producers and out-of-touch Hollywood writers think that stoner life is like, as if they gave a cast of friends some pot. Bland, boring, annoying and totally unrealistic. I despise this film.
