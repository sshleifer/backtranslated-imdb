What was it on Earth? My family and I took care of this piece of waste for 2 hours of life! There was no land, no tension, just a lot of boredom! My kids could do better movies with our video camera. But maybe we didn't get the meaning of the movie ... wait, my mom did it. She was the only one who liked her for the following reason: "At least a car-free movie that would be giggling ..." If you're looking for a war-free film, it's still interesting and appealing and has a powerful anti-war-message, then you should watch "The Trench". I give this movie 3 out of 10 because it's good for the afternoon and because I'm very nice ...
