Apparently, the writer and director of this direct film on DVD slasher is a fan of the 13th and other summer camps. This film has everything - a group of teenagers who want to spend a weekend of fun, alcohol and sex in an abandoned summer camp called "Camp Blood", an old man who warns them not to go there; and, of course, a crazy machete killer, who is still beating and hacking for teenagers without reason. But instead, special effects are poorly implemented. The killer walks around as if he was going for a Sunday afternoon stroll. The only good stuff about this movie is the acting performance of the talented main actress and the sex scene at the beginning. Other than that - boring and forgotten. Jasper P. Morgan
