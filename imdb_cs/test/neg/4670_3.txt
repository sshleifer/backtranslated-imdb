I remember loving this film because of the film, the theme, and the director. He entered the theater and took my place, I was like a dizzying schoolgirl, expectations for the opening scene. <br /> <br /> I was not disappointed with the introduction and I felt that I really love this movie. <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes can be seen as a spoiler, stop reading. I'm not going to give anything really important, but it could be seen as such, so it's a warning. <br /> <br /> Spoiler may be listed below, beware. I think the first scene that really struck me as absolutely absurd was the scene of the Russian space station. I mean honestly, refueling the shuttle without a real prior warning and then simply showing the station as fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the whole thing to explode. While all this is possible, it seemed to me that the road was over the top. I'm not sure if it was just a situation, or if it was a shabby acting performance, a stupid look at Russian technology, or just a camp stance of the scene itself. It just got worse after that, because then we endure what looked like 2 hours of constant super loud blasts in the universe ... you know a place where there's no sound because it's a vacuum. But the coup of grace to me, honestly, was a gun scene. (Spoiler Possibility) - Previously, in the movie, we see Bruce Willis tearing his land vehicle (the vehicle they use to ride when they get there and help them drill) when he tells him that's what they're going to use. He chooses pieces and complains about it, because much of what is on him is difficult and not necessary for what they do. So, when we wandered on asteroids, we see that they have decided to add massive gatling as a weapon to vehicles ... you know, standard NASA fare is to have heavy weapons on all space missions in case you know aliens or something. <br /> <br /> I could have taken an explosive 2 hours, silly Russian space station refueling scenes, cheeky love scenes near the end, the character Bruce Willis is nothing more than most of his other past characters, but Steve Buscemi's crazy and shooting gun Space vehicles all over that place and cause confusion / damage, well that threw the whole thing over the top for me. Save money and time and avoid this movie. If you want a good meteor film, see Deep Impact if you want a fun movie with amazing special effects, see Space Cowboys, but no matter what, avoid this movie.
