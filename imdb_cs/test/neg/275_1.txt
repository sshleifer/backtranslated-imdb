What a ridiculous waste of time and money !!!! This film was the biggest loser of the year. All the hype was a warning. I'm disappointed with Julia Roberts, by far the most talented member. I think her ability to really act was a film. The boy friend's boys were too fake and added insult to the injury, why bother casting Catherine Zeta Jones? He only has the ability to destroy the film. She lacks the ability to have chemistry on anyone's screen, not to mention the lack of ability to act. She lacks chemistry with other characters: a kind reminiscent of "American Swearteart". She made the terminal "Terminal." This movie is going nowhere, it's a shame, please don't tell me "13" is on the way!
