Overall, it took me three attempts to get into this movie. Although it is not a total waste, I have found a number of things that might be more useful to spend your time, such as removing nails with sandpaper. Involved actors must feel the same as people who play in herpes advertising; People will not really pay to see either, notoriety earns will not be the best for you personally, but at least ads get air time. <br /> <br /> The first was bad, but it gave the word a bad whole new definition, but it has one good feature: if your kids bug about you let them watch R-rated movies before you want them to tie them up and pop them This little gem inward Look at the whining stop and start tears. ;)
