Please don't see it. I had some laughter throughout this movie, but they were all due to an unintentional comedy. There were only three characters in this movie, so it was amazing how bad the character development was. Pacino was playing Pacina again, and he was troubled most of the time. The scenes in this movie look like they're made up of 20 other bad movies by a really bad editor. There is no continuity and I wonder why I left for 15 minutes. <br /> <br /> I would recommend that I never see a film by director D.J. Caruso. That was really awful.
