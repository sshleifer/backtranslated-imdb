I really don't understand who this film is aimed at. From the absurdity, no matter how ridiculously wrong, the kitschy dialogue, and that the villain is a child, I suppose it was a children's movie ... but I think it may be more swearing words than Pulp Fiction on drugs and general chaos and killing - so what demographic is it trying to please? This film is too schizophrenic, like trying to combine country music with heavy metal, but nobody likes it because it's a bloody paradox. I would recommend this movie because it's so funny (in the wrong way), except the actors are so obviously unbearable that I don't want to suggest anything else. I'm absolutely serious when I say I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes. Terrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriiiiiiiiiiiible
