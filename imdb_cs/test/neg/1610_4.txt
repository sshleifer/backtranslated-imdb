The story "The Stranger" reflects the somewhat 1969 film "Way to the Far Side of the Sun" (made by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson "Thunderbirds" and "Space: 1999" fame). The Earth's Parallel Universe is a prerequisite for both films. But there is a difference. Where the world in "The Stranger" represents a totalitarian regime out to foster freedom of citizenship, "Journey to the Far Sun" merely showed the true mirror world where manuscript, roads, houses, machines of all kinds, and internal organs were, of course, all in reverse (or mirrored) order. The similarity of parallel soils is therefore the only combination of both films. Similarly, the television series "The Land of the Giants" came before both films, which ran from 1968 to 1970. A world that was almost parallel to Earth except that giants inhabited the planet 12 times larger than humans. who landed there. The idea of ​​a totalitarian government to capture and cast "little people" was similar to the "Stranger" assumption more than the "JTTFSOTS" assumption. Perhaps because, like "LOTG", the "Stranger" series has been postponed. If it turned into a TV series, it would be a sci-fi version of "The Fugitive" with star Glenn Corbett being chased by baddies from week to week, hiding in different places, etc., to help this movie.
