Positive, I'll say he's awake enough. The negative is that it is useless to regret another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen. Long, adorable and pointless. And I'm not saying it should be, I think I wanted to like this movie, it seemed to have everything that's happening to it, it has a so-called "buzz", and besides, it's a quarrel to track down. There was a bit more effort on the side of the story, I think it would be amazing. And I expect that the team behind him will be a great job in the future, of course, with skills. But I recommend waiting for their future efforts to make it work.
