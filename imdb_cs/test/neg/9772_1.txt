I think "Bone Snatcher" should go after someone has joined this movie. Tracking will look like the longest 90 minutes of life. The story is boring and stupid. There were no scenes that were scary, even remotely. If you can endure this fine piece of cinema to the end, you will either be very disappointed or die hysterically. I bought this movie based on some other reviews I read. I wish I had my money back. Co skunker. If you're looking for a horror movie of interest, watch "U Turn". This can be based on a dirty plot, but it's full of those scary scenes that keep you on skis from start to finish.
