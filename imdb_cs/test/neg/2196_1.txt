[as a new resolution for this year 2005, I decide to write a commentary for every movie I've seen in theater (10%) or DVD (90%). I must admit that this habit has revolutionized the DVD. For example, I hear the right voice cast, which is a basic feature of personality. In my country, non-French films are dubbed and we end up with deviations: the French voice is terrible, very far from its original tone! same voice for different people or same people with different voices !!!! And well, if everyone found out that my comments are unusable, in 2006 I will stop my reviews ... Ah, AH .... So enjoy them now !!!! ] <br /> <br /> My summary means that the story, location, cast is not very pleasant ... <br /> <br /> Sandra Bullock's Is a talented actress, able to get a viewer to capture a movie .... <br /> <br /> Recalls a female "refugee" .... So if you look at the moment of escape from your life, watching this movie is worse because Sandra's life is a mess .... She doesn't have anything she could hold, just her poor mother (Who's Alzheimer's sick: touch again for depression) .... <br /> In fact, he has a sad life at the beginning of the film, a sadder life in him, and finally he finally comes back to him. .. what a happy ending !!!! maybe the writers wanted to make something about the life of a nerd .... <br /> <br /> very far from the best computer movie ever: * WARGAMES *
