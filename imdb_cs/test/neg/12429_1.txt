Something weird is happening in Loch Ness. The water is crystal clear or cold. A giant robotic plastic monster emerges and kills Scots! What is this film ?! First, I like reading stories about Nessie, sea creatures in general. When I saw it for sale, I thought it was cheap jaw pulling. No. It was terrible! The story was absurd, the acting was 100% rubbish, the only side was the cold mechanical Nessie they used. It was full of inaccuracies, bad places, and bad things. It's not worth your time, leave it on the shelf (or bin) you've found. On the second note, this film was shot in Cailifornia, not by Loch Ness, a major disc to Nessie fans.
