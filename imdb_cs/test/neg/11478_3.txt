I saw this movie when it first came to theaters in 1988 and although I knew it wasn't an award-winning caliber ... I liked it. It tells the story of 5 former young Boy Scouts unite to take on one task they never got to end up as children - which is to climb Mt. Whitehead. Of course, all the cubs grow up and develop their personalities in different ways, but not too different from the children. Richard Lewis is still neurotic, Richard Belzer is still a playboy, Franklyn Ajaye is still a bit dear to Abby of the band, and Tim Thomerson is still a group surfer. The most interesting star, of course, is Louie Anderson, "faithful faithful" in everything that Cub Scout is related to. He still lives in the same house with his mother, he still goes to the Scout Boy Scouts daily, is brave, respectful and clean, and he is the one who meets others for another spectacular scout adventure. Their task, however, is that the Grunski brothers, the two chicane drumming out of the aforementioned Scouts. Coincidentally they get into their old lair and decide to bother them a bit, though harmlessly. Not so harmlessly are the three refugees who think that Pack 7 is from the FBI and intend to wipe them out. All in all, the film still has charms. Watch Richard Lewis try to get comfortable on a crib and have a really fun piece for you. For another review, the entire film needed more of this type of observation humor. After all these years, it will not last well, but it remains a guilty pleasure.
