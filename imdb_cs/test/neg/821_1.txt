I've heard about Ali G in the Madonna music video "Music". I always think he's funny. (In fact, it really is.) Just last year I always thought about buying VCD "Ali G Indahouse". That's why I bought a few months later and started watching it. But the film surprised me. My older brother and I expected it to be a big laugh comedy. It turns out that "Indahouse" is just a stupid piece of waste. It was really bad. It also contains explicit sexual content and very rough humor. It was also not allowed to laugh at me, even a big smile. We definitely hate the movie. By the way, I plan to sell it. Ali G was really different in his film compared to his TV shows - so negative. Maybe he wasn't really well focused and serious enough to do it. Just because there are some sex scenes doesn't mean it's crazy merry (because too much is not so much laugh sometimes). I was disappointed at him for the first time. It really made me sad rather and happy. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend anyone who wants to watch good comedies that aren't too explicit or terrible.
