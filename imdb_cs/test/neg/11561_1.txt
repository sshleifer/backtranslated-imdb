The Holocaust Robot is about the most beautiful attempt to create a post-apocalyptic film I have seen. And I thought the Italians were masters of the miserable Mad Max. Some of the movies, like Escape 2000, are positively brilliant compared to this poo. Is the story absurd? even with a storyteller setting up every scene. And the guy's pulling. Scene after scene with no interest. Special effects (and I use the word "special" freely) consist of sock puppets. Yes, that is correct ?? socks puppets! Negotiations are pointless. Angelika Jager is running for the worst performance I've ever seen. Sure, it's French or German or what? but man is bad. I can't think of one positive thing to say about the movie. So I'll stop there because ten sentences on this waste is about ten too many. However, and fortunately for me, I have seen the MST3K version of the Holocaust Robot. Some of the things that made the film so bad helped this MST3K episode winners. For a season one episode, riffs come fast and furious and hit their mark almost every time. On this MST3K rating scale do I give this 4/5 episode? look for it.
