What a waste of precious time! My five-year-old daughter brought this house from my mother's house and we watched him as a family. None of us liked it. This pathetic little film, full of brilliant inconsistencies, obvious Christian themes and terrible film quality, is not worth denying it. He felt a bit like a bad filmmaking attempt at high school. How sad it is to see a talented actor (Chris Atkins, Gary Busey, and the company) who are losing in this clear and erratic story. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the dog is cute. The film should go straight into the pound. Avoid this movie - your time is better spent watching the color dry.
