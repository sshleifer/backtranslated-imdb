Tender Hook, or Who Killed the Australian Film Industry? Case No. 278. This apology apology for the drama season has cast and idea with potential? Rose Byrne, Pia Miranda, Hugo Weaving, in a jazz era gangster drama? and turns it into sloppy tempo and, in truth,. McHeath is a boxing promoter and gangster and works illiterate; for no apparent reason he is put to sing by Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen songs before seizures. How postmodern. How stupid. Anyway. There's a boxer, Art (Matthew Le Nevez), who has become McHeath's latest protégé, despite his unfortunate stablemate Alby (Luke Carroll). McHeath's cub of Iris (Byrne) makes goo-goo eyes on him. Under-surface sexual tension. Miranda plays Daisy, Iris's friend (these girls stick together) who still don't appear in the scenes. They practice dancing together and talk about "hook up" with boys. In the 1920s. After that I stopped counting anachronisms. There is a subplot involving Japanese beer and backstage Broome pearl fishermen. I don't know what it was about. For some reason, which is not exactly (at all) explained, Byrne gives cocaine to Art. McHeath thinks he's a drunk and throws him out. Byrne lands and plans to help him again. It's great for drawing and schizing. Most of them cause trouble. McHeath's two cannons, the horrified Ronnie (John Batchelor) and the Russian Donnie (Tyler Coppin), debated McHeath as he realized he was part of one of Iris's schemes, but Ronnie melts when he sees McHeath crying. Lots of virtually incoherent scenes get on the way to the film that ends. Director Jonathan Ogilvie spends a lot of time working with cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson and creates some nice pictures, but he does not create a sense of style that could compensate and embellish a lousy, pathetically underestimated scenario; Unfortunately, Ogilvie's sense of film grammar, lack of structuring of scenes and exposure is incredibly incompetent. In the early stage, Daisy suddenly appears in the car with the protagonists. As she got there and really who she was, Ogilvie's mind seemed to slip. There are many other examples of this negligence. Where he pursues poetic thinness, he achieves irritation. Gets annoying performances from actors who are usually reliable, poorly woven, and backed by Byrne's ability to project a scary doll-like doll while bothering her with an unintelligible character. It doesn't matter much if the story had more substantial characters and a stronger plot best not stolen from a dozen old noir films and festooned with thoughtlessly sprinkled pop-culture quotes. But not. It's boring.
