** Can contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The main character, a nobleman named Fallon, is stranded on the island with characters so looney and deadly could be drowned. Count Lorente de Sade (pronounced "dee-SAYd") speaks to his own hallucinations and sees all the intruders on the island as attacking pirates. She regularly beats mute servant Anne and tortures his reluctant dungeon guests. Unintentional laughter provides the giant "Nubian" slave Mantis, who speaks with the Deep South accent and helps de Sade hunt the Biggest Gamer cheaters. De Sade's crazy wife, ravaged by leprosy, provides some truly frightening moments as she walks through the dungeon and embraces the helplessly bound prisoner. (This scene was viewed on late night television by many children who remembered adulthood.) The only almost normal person in sight is Cassandra, who has self-depreciation for science. ("I used to be a nurse, I'm not too much now.") She and Fallon are planning their escape and eventually encounter an enemy that is more horrifying than de Sade and Mantis. This film was shot in San Antonio and directed by a man who is more competent in drawing horror comics than making horror movies. (I'll tell Mr. Boyett very much - he shows his fixation with the infection, as he did in his comics.) It's more like Andy Milligan's minus minus meat. A similar cabinet, music in the library, abuse of the handicapped, and versatile manthropia cause Andy not to speak as a consultant. However, Milligan made better costumes and wrote a better dialogue. Technical gaffes are too numerous to be listed here, but you know that this film is in trouble when you see a shipwreck that looks like it was shot in a fish tank. Also, a film made in Texas was supposed to have spiders and snakes rather than rubber. Glorious Eastmancolor gives this melodrama a greedy look that deserves so much. Fallon's initial meeting with the leper countess is really scary, as is the film shot. If the rest were half terrible, DUNGEON HARROW would be classic terror. Instead, it is a funny piece of schlock that sad apostates will love for all the wrong reasons.
