Imagine having an alternative universe where somebody created SEVEN, where instead of a talented cast and crew they cast a politically conscious ecologist and comedian who stood up as a leader. If your imagination can't reach that far, just look at GLIMMER MAN because it's another worse thing <br /> <br /> !!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! Jack Cole is a hidden past cop, and it's very ironic that Steven Seagal plays him because he's also someone who's been hidden in the past, but he won't tell anyone because he's Top Secret. Perhaps the biggest secret is how someone like Seagal has become the first movie star, because GLIMMER MAN continues the genre of all the other Seagal movies in that it is a sheer, sheer thing. Look at the way he is introduced when his partner goes to his office "Yoi I Love the Beads of Man. Being in the Wrong Office" Steven answers something that is slim or if someone can understand the bloody word because he just mumbles for most of the movie. In fact, the only time I could make out his dialogue was the scene at the school where he threw himself at the shooter who held the hostage class <br /> <br /> "Don't let me kill" <br /> <It's what would a cop say a suicide gunner? I just thought that in another movie, where Steven is not a hero (ie Good Movie), a cop would say "Don't kill me, I have a wife and a couple of kids waiting at home." saving his life by being a window in both windows, of course you shouldn't try it at home. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses Steven (I gave up his call to Jack, even when he signed up for the script for it) that he gave Steven a sensible name. He was involved in a plagiarism case where someone stole stunts from other outstanding serial killer films. As Steven finds more victims, you can see that he thinks "What was the movie that played Morgan Freeman as a cop? ", When he looks at the body, oh and the action keeps moving to the hero's home life, so we know this guy is good as a family man this guy is very good as a family man, he is that he is as bad as a movie star
