The film is a complete disaster. I don't know who to write scripts for movies like this, but I would definitely like to meet one of them and talk to him a little. do the screenwriters really not know about the situation abroad in the present or recent past? Or they just don't give a damn and write everything they think is interesting. great and eternal formula with a mad dictator + 1 lone hero (of course American) may seem like a good idea, but come on! we had such a bully in Serbia (milosevic) who did a lot of bad things to his people, but I just can't imagine shouting "shoot them, shoot them" with such barbaric passion as in the Middle Ages. maybe they wanted to show how bad he was, but it was a stupid idea. a much better impression would be if he did it in cold blood, as real monsters do. <br /> <br /> The list of nonsense is too long, but the funniest thing is: no matter how many national television stations there are in Russia, the Russian president has watched the US SNN (CNN) news? OMFG! <br /> <br /> Take a break! <br /> <br /> Burn this piece of waste! <br /> AWFUL!
