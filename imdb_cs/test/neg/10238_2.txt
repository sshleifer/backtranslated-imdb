Sammi Cheng and Andy Lau are again joined in their third movie - EVEN MORE - directed by HK's actioneer Johnnie To ... fans of Too action movies will be disappointed when you don't find one weapon in the shoot. In addition, fans of previous Cheng & Lau movies, WE NEED YOU & LOVE TO DIET, will be disappointed to find that EVENING is nothing that is so fun or cute ... Mr. Mr. & Mrs. To (Lau & Cheng) are divorced couple ... both affluent HK people ... both incredibly malevolent ... both were just professional thieves - "two birds of the same feather". A few years earlier, they had divorced themselves from the inability to find the middle ground for the split plunder ... Now he remarried ... with the son of a wealthy heiress - the overall boy's mother (Carl Ng) and through ... Mother-in-law (Jenny Woo) is suspicious from Toa's past and thinks she'll just marry her son for family jewels - an invaluable ruby ​​necklace of heiress ... <br /> <br /> The necklace is stolen ... it's the materialistic eye of Mrs Too who her gets the best? ... or is she her ex-husband, the way Mr. To confuses marriage to steal jewelry for himself? It is not a film about two lovers' love or love-loving ... about his two shawls who have always been in love but somehow foolish to realize ... they will leave pride and greed to overwhelm them ... <br /> <br /> Overall: Yesterday is one caper / heist film and one part of a classic Hollywood glamor from his golden years - that is, Cary Grant & Grace Kelly is to get caught. .. Johnnie It's riding too hard on Cheng / Lau's chemistry from their previous movies ... hoping that Cheng / Lau is a huge popularity and the fan base will be enough reason for this third movie .... I think Sammi Cheng is One of the most likeable / charming entertainers who work today. & Lau is definitely Tom Cruise from Asian cinema ... <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed the first two movies and considered Cheng / Lau pairing to be comparable to classic Hollywood couples from the 40s and 50s. but YESTERDAY is very few expectations ... horrible writing, ridiculous situations, plenty of product placement, and all the subplots and support characters were useless ... to figure out ... the movie was useless ... if you love celebrity watching .. .
