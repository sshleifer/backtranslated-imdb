I liked it if I didn't like Diane Arbus. Indeed, Arbus has not captured the unique visual aesthetics (as Stanley Kubrick did in "The Shinning," with twins in the hallway, a direct tribute to one of Arbus' most famous photos, and one with scary features that none of these films does not have), and certainly none of her characters (departures), resemblance (thin and Jewish, not wasp Queen Kidman), or life, saved some of the very superficial similarities, she was a fashion who later photographed "madman" and "outsidersky", among a lot of things. This film focused on "freak" as its symbol of artistic and personal empowerment, in a truly shallow and predictable spirit. Besides, it could be an interesting mid-class fetish movie, but I was too angry to take care of it. Maybe if the name of Arbus was abandoned, it might have been less annoying, but it wasn't her name in the title would be nothing I wondered to see in the first place. Cancellation from "Secretary".
