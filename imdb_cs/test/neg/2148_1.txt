You know you have a bad movie when you hear that the soundtrack is done entirely on one cheap, programmable synthesizer, without any melody or sense of rhythm. It's hard to figure out how anyone could take a movie seriously, even in bad reviews. This movie is under "bad". The continuity of this film is outrageous. In one combat scene, we hero (wearing a bluejeans and a tank top) turn a corner with two revolvers in hand; it doubles, only now has two semi-automatic machines in hand; he turns another corner and now has an automatic rifle in his hand; chasing the corridor and coming out (suddenly dressed in a standard army fatigue jacket) with a shotgun; after which he leaves the building with another automatic rifle. Or here's one for the books - the bus bumps into the car at a fast speed; the car goes to fly, thrown by a gigantic explosion - cut into a bus that is totally unharmed from the same explosion? Narrative continuity suffers from an equally insensitive sense of unreality; the evil boys really want to kill the hero - of course - but each time they go out or otherwise get into a vulnerable position, they suddenly decide they want to "live to see it!" Huh? One of the most exciting moments in the film is when a hero is released from isolation because his lawyer has come to visit him; then the evil man decides not to start after all; despite the fact that the villain, the hero and his lawyer all know what's going on, so the hero writes a letter to the lawyer and then we see a note that is passed on to the lawyer by another prisoner, though we never see the hero give it. (This lawyer, BTW, has full access to ATF in California, including confidential computer files.) Huh? Well, it's a mindless action movie - how are the action scenes? It's not surprising; unfortunately, they were stolen from about a dozen Hong Kong films that were made five or ten years ago. The opening scene, filming in the junk garage, actually has shots whose composition is stolen directly from "Hard Boiled" - so clearly it's a wonder John Woo wasn't looking for plagiarism. Other Hong Kong movies stolen from include "Prison On Fire", "Island On Fire", "Burning Paradise", "Police Story" I, II, and III (aka "Supercop"). I thought I met a couple of Sammo Hung clips. In other words, action scenes are exciting only to the extent that duplication of action scenes from other movies is successful. Nothing can be done with this movie if no one smacks a smack and just needs a lot of visual cues that may be meaningless. Very funny movie for all the wrong reasons.
