If you don't want to be bored half to death. I have never been a Gus Van Santa fan and as part of what the previous posters described as a new young generation, I was very disappointed and slightly angry at the stereotypical depiction of the characters in the film, especially since they were used to link the film's ridiculous story that is largely enforcing for viewers that skateboarders are socially refused and should be blamed for crimes. As a skater myself watching a lot of skate movies and filming during skate scenes, which is of course the main part of the plot as the main protagonist is a skateboarder, it was horrible and Bourne's identity esquire shaky camera technique was used with slow motion to give terrible effects. This film is just full of ridiculous stereotypes, as the emo soundtrack shows, adding to the media myth that all skateboarders are white rockers. Just a really bad movie.
