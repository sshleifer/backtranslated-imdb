First, I have nothing against Christianity. I believe that every person has the right to believe what they choose. But I can't imagine how stupid a man is to believe it! What is the loss of believers' money. They should rather use it to feed starving families in third world countries. I don't want to talk about talking or plotting this "movie" because I couldn't find any of them in it. The story is simple - two reporters, one (A) is an atheist, the second (B) for some causes left the religion. B regains his confidence in religion and teaches a lesson - believe in Christ or go to hell. This message appears after ten minutes and repeats until the end of the movie. People don't trust this "movie", read reviews first. I did not and did not waste my hour of life: (PS: Why is it classified as science fiction? Because of those few weird sounds and a little bright light from the sky? PPS: UFO = Satan's evil deeds? New :)
