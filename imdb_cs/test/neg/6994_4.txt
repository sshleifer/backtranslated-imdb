This short Harold Lloyd wasn't much; not one of his more amusing efforts. Of course, I never see brothers kids as something funny. This is what is the main part of this story, Harold and his wife, Mildred Davis, watching his in-law two little children. One of them is a child who is constantly crying and the other is a four-year-old terror who does everything but destroys the house. Leaving the child to create confusion over and over was not amusing to me. The best part was the last four or five minutes when a couple think that this big goon (Noah Young) broke his house. Half of the time it's a domestic scared couple cat, but overall that segment is fun with some good gag looks, reminiscent of another short Lloyd, "Spooky Spooks." <br /> <br /> However, a good end doesn I don't save the whole picture that I wouldn't see again. Lloyd did too many other good things to lose 25 minutes. It's just not that fun.
