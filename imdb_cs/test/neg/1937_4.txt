Reading other user comments, review A666333, expressed most of what I felt in this movie a predictable story, a cliché of lesbian / heterosexual versions (ie, a Straight Woman becomes a lesbian when she concluded that her husband was offensive and aggressive). Also the score was really disappointing. It was a bland, soft, sentimental elevator music - another common cliché in lesbian movies. The film would have some interesting dramatic moments if it wasn't destroyed by music. Several scenes related to sex and eroticism have also affected me as attempts to titrate and increase the value of shock, including parts of the final performance scene. Conventional "hot and steamy" moments were as boring as being too sentimental. For example, during a pool scene, women kiss and then the camera moves along an abandoned wine glass, flowing water, the sound of their heavy breathing over the soft blast of waves. The only elements I liked were costumes and arobatics. They are well choreographic and the development of attraction between the two characters was very natural during the training scenes. I really smiled during those and during the last scene with the cop. But they were not enough to balance the negatives or enjoy the movie.
