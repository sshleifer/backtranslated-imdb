Oh, what a disappointment this film is. I can't believe Wajda was directing it. It's virtually no conspiracy and 90% of the film consists of various people who go in and out of the screen, weakly trying to communicate with each other while talking about the Katyn massacre. The most interesting part comes at the end, but at that time I just stopped worrying while I tried to suppress yawning. Almost the entire film is shot by a camera to convey the feeling of "personal immediacy", but most of the film is nothing personal or immediate. Instead, the constant jerking of the camera became a sea sickness. To be fair, there are some great shots too (no pun intended), but nothing that would make you go "Wow!". <br /> <br /> If you're not familiar with the Katyn massacre, the movie leaves you scratching your head. If you are familiar, you will also scratch your head, though for a variety of reasons. The film basically states and reiterates that it was the Soviets who murdered thousands of Polish soldiers in 1940. This point repeats as if someone in the audience had to be convinced of this fundamental historical fact. But the film never tries to explain why they were killed. After all, tens of thousands of Polish soldiers in other Soviet prison camps were not damaged and were released in 1941. It is also never sufficiently explained how many people have died, even if the 20,000 number is thrown several times. Acting is sufficient only with Komorowska (old woman) and Chyrou (Lt. Jerzy), who have noticeable performances. Certainly not enough to carry the film. Many other actors seem to have been chosen more for their matinee appearance than their acting skills, but I won't mention their names. Suffice to say that they are definitely not an Oscar material, so any claim that this film has been "robbed" by the Academy is simply ridiculous. The film's tone is also bad. On the one hand, he seeks to be an accurate historical drama, on the other hand he resorts to cheap anti-Soviet propaganda, such as the depiction of a Russian soldier tearing a Polish flag and using it to clean his shoes. Then there are some mysterious scenes that have absolutely no effect on conspiracy, such as a couple climbing on the roof or liquidating Krakow University. There are many missed opportunities to make this film more interesting, such as adding a political angle to the story, or showing the German grave discovery, or even portraying Anna's journey from the Soviet occupied part to Germany occupied Krakow. All these aspects could be the main part of the film, but instead are reduced to a few minutes. Finally, we get a collection of loosely fallen, confusing, boring scenes about Poles' reaction to one of their greatest World War tragedies. It's not very convincing and not worthy at all.
