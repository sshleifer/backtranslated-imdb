4 Realz Son My Game Iz Mad Tite Yo I Can't Wait 2 Get On The Dis Show And Roll Up In Da Club n Make It Real 905 Style Wit Crazy Models N Bottles, Son! No, I'm just kidding. This is a sad show created by sad men and for the enjoyment of them. Men who are so modern castrated by modern existence that they are channeling their frustration into clubs, where fleeting self-control, which behaves on the chicks, is hoped that their little children will touch to try to dull the sting of loneliness and make them feel , even if only for one night, as if their Toronto sausage board was a little less permanent. I have read a few comments that show that this show is finally a Canadian TV that is on a par with American television or something else. Well, that's not meant at all. It's like, Yes! Get on your back, Canada - you finally cracked the elusive formula for such breakthrough American content as "Studs", "Change of Heart", "Elimidate" and "The Fifth Wheel". You see, the real idea is that "... with Candid Camera" meets on the field. Genius. And there's nothing that extends to the thin line between Fratboy's friendship and latent homosexuality, such as a group of adult men recording each other on a hidden camera, admiring each other's "play" at the club. The man-love display is so tangible that they should really consider the need to re-create the "Keys to the steam bath". On the note side, how interesting it is that people who gave this show such glowing reviews seem to register an IMDb account for the explicit purpose of such a procedure (I think I'm guilty of having used the same thing to he has done the opposite here.) My personal favorite is one enthusiastic reviewer who claims to be from "the United States" who rushes that "Now it's clear that talent in Canada has the ability to produce American television quality." <br /> <br /> Smooth. But why are you even bothering to make online buzz? You really can't be canceled, you're in Canada Comedy Network, baby! The viewing public will ignore your show for many years. In all likelihood, you'll be fine, running around this proverbly simple mediocrity with most of the original Comedy Network.
