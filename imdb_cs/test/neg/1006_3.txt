I would put Death Wish 3 in the same box as Cobra Stallone and Commando. A box I would sell for $ 2 to sell a garage with all the videos inside. The story is about the main character, who is returning from the success of previous films to destroy everything. Why did the creators want to destroy the reputation of the last two films with this cheap waste. The story is so lame that it must have been an outrageous sequel. I mentioned Cobra earlier because it has the same mood that one person can kill 20 or 30 gang members without scratching. Both this film and Cobra tried to show the hero that he was shooting from the gun to the hip level and the enemy fell in great numbers. Police officers spend hours at the shooting range, so why were gang members shooting them aimlessly from their hips? This movie was so bad that I thought it was Wish Wish 4 for a while.
