Well, I admit that I like Brigitte Neilsen in an unhealthy way, I just have something for 6 'tall women with swords. That's where I said it. <br /> <br /> What's with the movie? Every mistake you make has been made. You take a successful film series (conan) and drag it with mud with a bad script, bad casting, bad effects, and the worst of all ... you put a cute kid there for comic relief. Such a thing almost killed the Indiana Jones series. Cute kids are for Disney movies, not real movies. Neilsen, at least, took the film seriously, though no one else did. The storyline Schwarzenegger had repeatedly dragged Red Sonja's fat out of the fire and it cut her character considerably. A warrior woman doesn't need a dude to get her out of the way, that's her job! He must not reuse Conan's character in this movie was a crime. Kalidor? Sheesh. The film never set the right mood, and its stimulation was somewhat incoherent and sloppy, unlike Conan's Baran, who had several story lines that gracefully matched. When it comes to fantasy movies, it's okay to have kitschy costumes, its okay is to have a harhausen-style animation, it's okay to have stupid exorbitant sets that don't make sense, but having a terrible scenario is unforgivable. This movie could have been a classic, but the script felt like it was 12 years old.
