Good <br /> <br /> Carrey is a good actor and has done it in "Man on the Moon" and "The Eternal Sun of the Immaculate Mind". But hey, what an actor can do without a good story and proper direction. He can do "number 23". Poor <br /> <br /> Joel Schumacher is a poor, overrated director and has done it in almost every movie he made. What he did with Batman is simply a disaster, but probably Batman's films are supposed to look good. Well, they don't. Instead of gothic and horror we got Disneyland. Surely "Falling Down" was great, but can you destroy the movie with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas and with a great script? No. And so a good actor and a poor director finally met and did "number 23" ... <br /> <br /> Ugly (23) <br /> <br /> I know that it's stupid to start, but ... Fingerling's subplot (almost half of this movie) looks exactly like an introduction to the next chapter of Max Payne2. VoiceOvers, the quality of the detective story itself, the quality of the characters, even the colors, mood and music, editing and sound mix too! Maybe it works for the game, but it's definitely not in the cinema. Mission en scene is so bad that it becomes funny. It's not even unpleasant. Carrey reads walking down the stairs in the park? Why? Is it natural? No, but it looks good. Why did Suicide Blond cover the walls in a white paper apartment? If she wanted to kill herself? There's no logic in it, but it still looks good. Guess what it is, it doesn't look good. Instead, it looks unnatural. <br /> <br /> All female characters are flat. Why is that so? Who cares, let's go with the story. <br /> <br /> Who is Fingerling? A private eye on suicide? Hardly believable. Scenes where Walter Sparrow is arguing with his wife about the weather book is really about him, could be the best part of this movie. Instead, we get the Moulder / Scully routine. Disappointment. <br /> <br /> Interiors have no indication that people live in them, except for important objects (shoes, photos, etc.). Luck. The dialogues aren't that bad. But what about V.O.? That's another story. "There is no such thing as fate. There are only different choices." It was clear to the captain! "After Fingerling, the number is coming. Cliche. And so on. Obviously, the average housewife would get into a public building in the middle of the night. Successfully and undisturbed. Subplot of a dog pulling the main character to the cemetery. This is such an old trick and so comfortable for writers, and it should be forbidden. I mean it! Shots and adjustments similar to what happened in the last episode of X-Files are not the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie. It is? I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate, but not. It makes no sense. Said in chronological order is weak and incredible. All the time, we have undeveloped characters trapped in a chain of situations that are nothing but misspelled fiction. That might be fun, but - because the whole movie is dead seriously - it's not. For many coincidences, it's just bad for every story. And "secret"? It is predictable and easy to estimate. Losing contact with reality is a great theme for a good movie, but I've never seen anything like that in Hollywood productions. If you are interested in this topic, follow Polanski's "Repulsion" or something of David Cronenberg, "Spider" or "A History Of Violence", both of which deal with similar issues that "Number 23" wanted to show. He wanted but failed.
