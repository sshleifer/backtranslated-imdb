I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life. Date Movie. That was bad. But this ... that's just ... it's not good. House Party 4 is the worst movie ever. It's so simple. It's basically Ferris Bueller with the black people in it. And it's not funny. That's horrible. So awful. Chris Stokes can be a BET superstar, but he's an idiot. She can't write comedy. Or horror. I'd like to call him a black, less known Uwe Boll. Besides Uwe Boll movies, they're funny when you know what I mean. You can invite some friends, pop in Alone In The Dark, and have a great time to laugh and eat snacks with friends. Chris Stokes is, except you invite friends to watch House Party 4 with you, no one will laugh. Not even a distorted token or illiterate athlete. I'm serious, I wasn't allowed the whole movie once. Acting is terrible and the film looks like a bad independent movie. What was the budget for this movie? 5 damn dollars? What the hell? This movie just pisses off; Don't waste your time with this crap. It's disgusting.
