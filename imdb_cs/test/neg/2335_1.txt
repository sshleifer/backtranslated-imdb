Seriously, if I wanted to make a movie that makes no sense, it will never be, and it will have a lesbian scene as the only peak point I could have. david lynch is the worst like this movie. anyone could make a better film in which at least some answers were given, and the story was not so slow and long lasting. The story means nothing at the end except credits. what a waste of time. I'll never get those 147 minutes of my life again and hope others can learn from my mistake.
