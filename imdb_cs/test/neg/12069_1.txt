CAMP BLOOD <br /> <br /> Aspect ratio: 1.33: 1 (Nu-View 3-D) <br /> <br /> Audio format: Mono <br /> <br /> For hiking in Forests Near Abandoned Camp Blackwood - A Place of Unsolved Murder Ten Years Ago - Four young townspeople are targeted by a masked psychopath who kills his guide (Courtney Harris) and chases them with forests with murderous intent ... Low -rent time-waster, shot on camcorder using Nu-View 3-D sequential format. At least it is a conspiracy, but the script is close to the established blueprint (with an obvious nod to "Fifth 13", "The Burning" and "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"). interesting formula. Director Brad Sykes - also responsible for similar 3-D efforts like ZOMBIE CHRONICLES (2001) and BLOODY TEASE (2002) - quotes George A. Romero and Sam Raimi's early works as key influences on his career, but while those filmmakers attacked in the mainstream field with wasteful video technology effort to only imitate their film heroes, resulting in a home movie with delusions of grandeur. In addition to the 3-D format, there is nothing to justify everyone's attention. Followed by CAMP BLOOD 2 (2000).
