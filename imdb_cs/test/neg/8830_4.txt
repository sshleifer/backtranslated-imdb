This is a good plan for studying corporate power and dichotomoy between the required public life and the need for privacy. Robert Taylor was prepared by Burl Ives, the corporate head, to replace him as a leading corporation. He sends him to England to negotiate a deal where Taylor is both astonished by the ethics and morality of the men he deals with and can fall in love with a refugee while he is on it. He returns to his empty hands when he has fulfilled his duty, but told the English the truth about his motives. He attempts to marry a refugee rather than a boss's niece, and Ives' attempt to discredit a refugee as a suitable woman for a company manager begins. It could have been gritter, nastier, and less romantic - the amount of time spent on romance would distort the film away from the points that it strives for corporate ethics. Some costume design has been nominated (undeservedly) for an Oscar - these are all suits, and both women in the film dress conservatively - studio politics at work once again, no doubt. <br /> <br /> What is streaming is CinemaScope's black and white cinematography, which is worth the Oscar nom. (This was the MGM's first 'Scope film in CB'). It's not as good as it could be, but not terrible either.
