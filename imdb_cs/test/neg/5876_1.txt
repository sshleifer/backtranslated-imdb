The only good thing this movie created was that it made me hungry ice cream, minus parts of the dead body in it. The movie is one of the most cheese I've seen in a long time. When the "King of Ice Cream" dies at the beginning, I laughed so hard because the boy took it and started eating it. His mother asked him to say something and should say, "Leave me alone and let me eat free ice cream so I can watch my acting career go down." It seems right. Then I wondered why the ice cream prince was behind the ice cream king. Will anyone rob him of his twenty cents? I've never seen bars on an ice cream window. It looked pretty stupid. You can also forget about acting because it's just awful. Forget this movie and go down to the queen of milk and get ice cream.
