The Korean answer to "I know what you did last summer" follows a similar storyline to the American counterpart: one year after a group of high school friends accidentally kills a classmate, the masked killer begins to pick them up. Who might have seen them that night - or was their "victim" still alive when he was thrown into the sea? Originality cannot be expected from the genre of slasher teenagers, but efforts can still be made. Ensure that the films of this ilke are fun and frightening. RECORD is neither a crushing scene from "I Know ...", "The House On Sorority Row" and "The Faculty" (among many others) and has failed to release a decent shock in 95 minutes. Acting is decent from cast that seems to be the norm in Korean cinema, approaching an unprecedented scenario with taste and undeserved enthusiasm. Direction is at best average; a strange selection of camera angles and the worst killer costume * EVER * contributing to the fall of RECORD. The most disappointing thing is the end of the film, where there are two "surprising twists" that are obvious that you have previously rejected them as too obvious! The only saving grace of the record is its clear start - the first act is actually excellent and shows American counterparts how to develop character and mood settings - but it's a very bad movie. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> ** / *****
