If I had never seen the original Avengers episode, with Blackman, Rigg, or Thorson, I'd appreciate this series more. While the cast did its best to maintain the action and interest of the scripts, I was just caught up in comparing the episodes with the original series. There was an expectation Steed to participate more in combat scenes, and continuity seemed as though the writers were trying to keep up with the actors. To be honest, I can't blame them for trying to resurrect fans from the original series, but that just didn't work, as evidenced by the fact that it took one season. Watching Steed's work through this series reminded me of General MacArthur when he said, "The old soldiers will never die, they just disappear!"
