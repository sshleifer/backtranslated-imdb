The Toxic Avenger ... <br /> <br /> The idea behind this film is that a person who would call an ordinary population looser and completely mutilated after being thrown into a toxic waste barrel, it sounded well for 1985. This movie is listed as horror ... I even read about the cult following of this series .... <br /> <br /> This movie was even given when it was made so bad that I couldn't stop watching ... acting is horrible even for an independent movie that I think should be a horror part of this movie ... <br /> <br /> Drug Store Sumo Godzilla Entrance .... I'm all for movies that support drugs ... damn, i love both godzilla and well sumo ... i'm not into it, but i still think that sumo height would like to give this movie 1000 hands slap and ground salt into people's eyes who made this movie ... <br /> <br /> Personally, I'm almost ready n apsat movie company that did it and ask them about87mins of my life back. <br /> <br /> For me, 1 out of 10 is too high to be too bad to have 0 (zero) or even negative integers. Br /> <br /> In other words, this movie is JUNK ...... rather watch the colors dry and deal with explosive diarrhea then have to watch this movie again ... I'd be the first person to use not only the cover of this movie like ignition but i would be on a good movie and burning scripts.
