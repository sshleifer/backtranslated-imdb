Tru Calling was good, but it could be great. The concept was interesting and allowed seriously strange and frightening storylines to be explored in the future. Unfortunately, the writing and the actor left the show down. Writing wasn't too bad, but there were holes. In Episode 13, "Drop Dead Gorgeous", an incredibly poisonous poison was reportedly used to kill the victim. It was so toxic and killed so fast that the victim didn't have time to run or even scream for help. Yet there was no plausible explanation of how the killer gained such a strong poison. In episode 15, "The Getaway", a police officer reacted unrealistically. In the second scene of the dinner he (humbly) tells the raiders to drop the gun and when she does not follow the order, and in fact turns the gun in his direction, he allows it to turn into a standoff and then escalate into the hostage situation ?? the very situation to which he was warned. His answer should be (shoot) a thief when she couldn't follow his orders and after she turned a gun on him. There are other mistakes in the stories, but I leave it with these two examples. Although I wrote mistakes, I liked the show. Another problem I had was that I couldn't accept Eliza Dushka on this turn. In my opinion, she is too inexperienced and light to wear this part. She never went anywhere, marched; all too often she came to a sharp stop on her mark. She also lacked some really emotional facial expression or intonation. Either she has a pensive look or a cute smile; rarely are other emotions apparent. When he tries to look dramatic, he starts to look aside and 'then' turns his eyes to his colleague. Or, alternatively, she starts her line and looks at her opposite, then looks aside. Both are uncomfortable when they are replaced by real emotions. An example of her lack of intonation is in episode 20, "Two Weddings and Burial", during her second wedding speech is free of emotions (eg Heart in Our Hearts). <br /> <br /> I liked all the other actors in their individual parts and they were all believable. Tru Calling could do this with improved notation and change of line.
