The title is an incorrect title: the film is barely one year away from the so-called "divine marquis". It was a difficult time for him because he was threatened by the guillotine: the quiet pleasures of the reign of terror. Historically speaking, the background is somewhat superficial: "Fête De l'et re supreme", Robespierre's unsuccessful attempt to create a secular religion, his fall, the sky has sent an opportunity to depict the sinister machine of Dr. Guillotin at work (Full Speed ). As for Sad, this is an absolutely mediocre affair: waiting in a former monastery hall with other nobles, a golden cage, if you compare it to, say, Marie-Antoinette or Lavoisier's fate, and he exchanges futile conversations with a young virgin about death, love, and other trivia. There's a mandatory "brave" scene, but you have to be patient because it's a long time before it comes to the screen. can we call this risqué according to today's standards? Cy Enfield's "De Sade", which has one of the lowest ratings of the IMDb, is at least amusing, and Keir Dulle was more trusted by the Marquis than the aging Auteuil. And it featured John Huston.
