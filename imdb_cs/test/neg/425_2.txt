Well, I thought it should be a good event, but no. Even though Jeff Speakman is a star, there is nothing to be observed. Only two fights for almost 1.5 hours, yak.A lot of talking and everything is so artificial that you couldn't believe it. The story is clear from the beginning. If you want good action, don't borrow this movie.
