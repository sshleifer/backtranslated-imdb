Do you hear the sound? This is the sound of H.G. Wells rolled over to his grave, a difficult year for the classic novel between this version and Spielberg's film abortion. But at least Steven has a few things compared to this crapperella. Hi, the ships were not big insects, they had names. They were tripods and extraterrestrials worked in threesomes. Ships and aliens were all bad, in fact, you really don't get to extraterrestrials until the end. The effects and cast work well. But these actors are much better than this "movie" they deserve. Bulk, if not all movies is Howell's character wondering through devastation, meeting one person, they join him and he loses them for one reason or another. There are no more than two people in the camera at any time, though most of the movie. It's like shooting three at a time, so the movie would go beyond the budget or something. So thick and only the only traceable adaptation of the War of War story is the GEORGE PAL version way back in the 1950s. BLACK HOLE.
