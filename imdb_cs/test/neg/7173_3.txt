You have to be a fan of the little man, but I found Burlesque on Carmen boring, unimaginable and totally funny. Chaplin tells the story of Carmen and plays a big role himself as Don Jose. It's a story about the men and women they love, even though it's unclear why she would love a woman like Carmen while playing herself. <br /> <br /> As I said, I didn't think much of it. Chaplin has done dozens and dozens of better movies so you can keep it in the field. Oh and I'm wondering what the difference between this movie and the 1915 version is ... or is it just an IMDB error? <br /> <br /> Overall: 3/10.
