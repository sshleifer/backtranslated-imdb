Last night I was sitting in my TV room, a beer in my hand, a bowl of pretzels on the TV bar and decided to put the "Monster Man" in a trusted video recorder. I expect the movie to become a fun, bloody, crashing and bash cheesefest movie. What do I get instead? One of the dumbest, stupid, brave and predictable movies I've ever had, I didn't like the fact that I was sitting. And what's even worse, all during (& I use this other phrase loosely) "sex scene" girl holds all the clothes on! I will make this summary short and sweet: mix "Dude Where is my car" (about a good 1/2 film) with very diluted "Hitcher", add a version of redneck antagonist from "I Madman" as a primary villain and finally some incoherent black magic mumbo jumbo and you will have no idea how this film is rotten. It's also totally predictable in the world. The only notable factor to this buddy film disguised as "horror movie" is that some of the moments between 2 guys (even though "hero" is one MAJOR annoying geek and another is Jack Black Clone) are a kind of fun (just the average funny ie. like most SNL skits). In addition, "Monster Man" is a monster mess! 3/10 (This one will be given to Halloween time-only hope after a person looks at it I don't have my house tense or worse)
