I was looking forward to watching this movie because I loved David Lynch's version. The first time I tried to watch, I fell asleep. Nothing happened. The next night I tried to watch the rest, and it slept again! Nothing has ever happened to anyone in this film that anyone could keep an interest alive. The only thing that was a little more exciting was when I tried Fast Forward! The DVD came with a second disc that contained bonus material. Needless to say, I didn't have a hard time going through torture when I watched more Dune (2000). Here are the low points: Negotiations were bad, the plot was moving slowly, sets were and looked cheap, the direction was pathetic and visual effects CGI childish. <br /> <br /> To watch Dune, save money or rent 1984.
