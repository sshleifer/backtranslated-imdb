Christopher Guest is the master of the mockumentary. Werner Herzog is one of many documentary giants. Zak Penn is not good at one, but he could certainly take a lesson from the other two. The guest often plays with reality and fiction, but the line between them is always clear in his films, somehow essential with mockumentary. Penn could also learn from The Blair Witch Project. Even though you knew it was a fake document that you bought in you in the world, the filmmakers created it. It looks to the audience as if the whole thing is real, even if you know deeply, you watch fiction. In other words, the fiction was successfully disguised as the truth. In fact, many early viewers watched it, at Sundance and another premier audience, thought it was real. Penn, whose forte, by his own acceptance, is on the screen, should probably stick to it. Of course, there is no documentary or mockumentary film production (and it's hard to say where it starts and the other ends with this film). Penn creates a podium for what he is trying to sell as a legitimate documentary documentary, a meta documentary. Penn, however, confuses the audience, and loses their confidence, from get-go as he enters Herzog's house before filming the Herzog movie, "Enigma Loch Ness" about the myth of the Loch Ness Monster (a film that apparently was never finished? Probably due to Penn's interference ). Even though Penn is probably the director of the movie we're watching, it starts by looking at the cameras and saying, "What is the film crew doing here?" and they start avoiding them. He does it on a few other occasions. He stops and tells the cameras to stop shooting, forcing the guy to hide in the shadows to pick up the snippets of dialogue between Herzog and Penn. It seems to be a trick, but it is never clear and Penn apparently keeps us deliberately in the dark. It leaves the audience scratching its head wondering, "Who's in charge here?" If Penn Works Against His Own Movie Crew, What World Are We Part of? This is just one of many examples of how it confuses the line between reality and fiction. Penn seems to enter the fictional world only when the crew is observing what appears to be a Loch Ness monster. But at the time the monster first appeared, we were completely out of the fictional world that Penn was trying to create, so it all seems stupid and unnecessary. It is a potentially fascinating film and a real missed opportunity in that Penn has a chance to document a master at work, but he completely loses his attention and becomes a film about Penn and his antiquity instead of shooting a documentary. Penn's presence begins to penetrate and overshadow everything else in the film. The talks with Herzog are convincing and we really think they're not. We even began to wonder if he and the others on his crew were being cheated by Penn, just as he is an audience, but you're never sure. Penn, in his camera talks, tries to be unpredictable and unintentionally witty, as well as the characters of a guest interview in a mockument, but he only succeeds in being annoying. In the film Guest this effect is merry, as here it falls flat because you're never sure what Penn is about. The result is that we, the viewers, start getting fond of him as well as the crew. In addition to the beautiful scenery and redundant appearance, there is little recommendation from a beautiful model that is worthy of giving a spice to the film. Perhaps his only redeeming quality (unintentional) is that it is a great example of why the audience is important; and completely ignoring the narrative conventions about how you do them. For this reason, I think it would be a good movie to show film students? some kind of "what not to do" movie. I have nothing against the film that I told in an unconventional way as long as it is done skillfully, with a thematic foundation that gives it substance. This film is completely missing. I'd like to call it a brave effort on something, but I'm not sure what it is, except for complete mess and ultimately waste of time. (As a side note: It seems that bad art always calls for a good mind. This film was thinking of Lillian Ross's "Picture". Ross followed John Huston during the "Red Badge of Badge" and greatly documented for the New Yorker, in fact it would be a great movie. If you want a great example of meta-art, read it. "
