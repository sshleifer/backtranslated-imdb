When I first looked at the back of this movie, it seemed to me that they and my friends could look forward to 82 unforgettable minutes. And certainly it was unforgettable. Puckoon was the movie you asked how it was possible. How it was possible that it was released on DVD at all. Of all the movies that were available in the video store last night ... maybe we chose the worst. And yes, they had a Tomb Raider. There was absolutely nothing in this movie that I was interested in. Who came up with the idea that it would be funny if the narrator could change the story of the main character? Of all the stupid things you can completely destroy the movie, it's my favorite now. The character Foggerty, an idiot of the village, played by Nickolas Grace is the most unpleasant character because they started making movies in color. If there's one single movie you shouldn't see this year, please let it be Puckoon because I don't think it can be worse. I'm still wondering if it could be the worst way I spent my money, and I took the word that I had made many miserable purchases over the years.
