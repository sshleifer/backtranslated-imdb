I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this movie. He set the standard. I will never give film 1 unless it was as bad as this. I fully agree with other comments on this film. But since I'm a Dutch, I watched it with a Dutch translation. Apparently they didn't have the money to get a proper translation, so they decided to babble. With some happy results. Don't smoke, don't drink, don't drug, don't watch Demon summer. <br /> <br /> I was surprised that the actors (Wow, I can't believe I said it.) While filming he didn't keep the script (was there some?) in their hands. I think they also did a good job ... Well ... Uhmm ... No, they didn't do a good job at all.
