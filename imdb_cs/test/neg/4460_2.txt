British television director Alan Gibson, "Dracula A.D. 1972", qualifies as one of the least attractive entries on Hammer Studios on the immortal bloodstain of Bram Stoker's. Actually, this represented the first time since Terence Fisher's memorable "Horror of Dracula" (1958) that Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fought each other as mortal enemies. A few years later, in the final Hammer Dracula: "The Satanic Rites of Dracula." Furthermore, it was the second-to-last Dracula for Hammer in which Lee played as the infamous fangster. For Recording, "Dracula A.D. 1972 "was the seventh Hammer Dracula. An exciting prologue from 1872 will prepare you for something vastly different from what the rest of this horror disappointment wins. Eternal rivals Count Dracula and his nemesis Professor Lawrence Van Helsing is literally on the run in London's Hyde Park, where we are on the neck. The cart crashes and Dracula emerges as she hugged half the wooden wheel with the broken rays embedded in her chest. Of course, Christopher Lee has to grab this broken bike against his body, but the image is pretty striking in his own way to go through the cluster. The count ends, as does his opponent Van Helsing. However, one of Dracula's disciples rips the Earl's ring and picks up some of the vampire's ashes into a safe hold bottle. Meet the Charming Young Man, Johnny Alucard (Christopher Neame of "No Blade of Grass"), who loves to raise hell with a group of hippies that run and control the British police with their opposites. Alucard happens to be a descendant of one of Dracula's servants. Alucard now has a counting ring and a bottle of his dehydrated blood. Alucard chooses a view of the desecrated church to organize the black matter. He invites his fashion friends, among them Laura (super sexy Carolina Munro of "The Spy Who Loved Me"), Gayner (Marsha Hunt) and Jessica Van Helsing (Stephanie Beacham) to attend this black mass because it offers them something else. No wonder the Earl and the evil bloodbathers had their eyes on Jessica. Meanwhile, after Laura's body is discovered, he is depleted of blood, Scotland Yard Murray (Michael Coles of "Doctor Who and Dalkes") asked for help from modern day descendant Van Helsing Lorrimar (Peter Cushing). Dracula wants to avenge Van Helsing by taking his granddaughter to his bride. Lorrimar watches Alucard; they fight in their apartment Chelsea and the young vampire drowns in the bath of water. Remember, running water is as deadly for vampires as sunlight and crucifix. Van Helsing finds Dracula in an abandoned church and his daughter waits for the Earl. Van Helsing and Dracula mesh. Van Helsing flings Holy water to Dracula's face. The vampire falls into an open grave with a ridge waiting for it, and decomposes again. The main problem with "Dracula AD 1972" is that we don't have enough Lee as Count, though Cushing as Van Helsing has a lot more. Additionally, screenwriter Don Houghton holds Dracula confined to a dilapidated church and never allows a vampire to leave the city. Despite the low budget, "Dracula A.D. 1972" could be much better. The scene where contemporary Van Helsing has to write Alucard and spell it back to get to Dracula seems to be almost laughing. Do you think he would know about this reverse spelling trick. If you're not afraid of horror movies, this will make you angry. Occasionally, Gibson introduces us to Dracula's superb detail with bared fangs and blood eyes, but this is about as scary as this cooler gets, and it doesn't say much.
