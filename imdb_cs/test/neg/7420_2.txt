The development of films based on real events involving cryptozoology or supernatural has always been a challenge for directors and screenwriters. Above all, you have to reconcile the announced statements, contradictory information sources and Hollywood creativity to get something that viewers can get. Unfortunately, none of these things seem to be for SASQUATCH. The film begins in a typical noir movie when a research team crashes somewhere in the Cascades over the plane. From there, the research team will disappear and will remain missing for some time despite attempts by law enforcement officials and local rescuers. While one of the passengers is walking, infrared images (la Predator) alternate on the screen, suggesting that the legendary Sasquatch is the cause of passenger fate. Cue Harlan Knowles (Henriksen), CEO of BioComp Industries and father of one of the victims of the crash. Knowles connects his own search and rescue team with an explicit mission to find his daughter and the rest of the research crew, along with the invaluable technology that has been lost during the crash. <br /> <br /> After Knowles has made a customized rescue The team is composed, the whole film is traveling along the way of uncoloured characters, dizzying cinematography and a totally non-original line. I literally had to refrain from falling asleep during this movie because she was trying to scare me. The only cast member who held his own was Henriksen, which does not replace the lack of depth introduced in all other characters. Excessive sound effects were also unpleasant; Basically I didn't know if I was watching a movie about Bigfoot Bear or Grizzly Bears. Not even the plot was so great. It was too underdeveloped because the viewer is mainly exposed to the typical fright music found in something similar to the genre. Of course, you don't have to be a genius to find out who in the middle of the film would wear all the clothes or who would be the first unfortunate soul Mr. Sasquatch would get. There are no good points, so I made this 2 out of 10 movie.
