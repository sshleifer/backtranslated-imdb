Shemp finds himself worth it to inherit a million dollars if he is married within 24 hours. Considering how disgusting he looks and his personality, it's no wonder he can't get to the recipient - that is, until an article explaining his difficulty appears - at this point, five unhappy women appear out of them where they claim their new hubby (plus money, of course). Although I hate Three Stoogs and like to watch their shorts occasionally, the brilliant comedy of Buster Keaton never came close to the best day. That's why I didn't like this movie because it was a lot of conspiracy from Keaton's masterpiece, SEVEN CHANCES. With Stooges it was not uncommon for Columbia images to steal the old comic plot or just recycle the older Stooge shorts. From the beginning, this film is a pale imitation of the original. It is also clear that this film lacks the charm and subtlety of the original, and gags generally appear to be highly enforced (especially the scene of telephone booths). Cousin Basil, however, was quite cute and funny - though far from tiny! However, the worst aspect of the film was an extremely funny conclusion. In the Keaton version, hundreds of women seemed to marry him, and the action became very fast and furious - all that remained in one small room and lacked a comedic punch - ending fizzy. <br /> <br /> Overall, blunt repetition. Also, before you mark this review "not useful", make sure you first see SEVEN CHANCES to see what I am talking about - then you decide.
