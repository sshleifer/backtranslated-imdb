The main mistake in this Spanish slasher / shocker is in his script. The first half-hour is all right effort, building tension and an atmosphere of fear and fear. We even have some nice murders! Then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of "your basic slasher clich√©s". I must admit that I was quite disappointed because the trailer promised much more. The last thirty minutes consists of several kills and a lot of running in an abandoned monastery. It should have been much better (though the final scenes in the flooded room are fine)! First of all we have a dialogue. Most of the time, it's horrible (in the viewer, when I saw it), he just chuckled and only elsewhere. It is hardly audible during a lot of scenes, drowning under the pressure of sound effects and soundtrack (however, it may not be such a bad thing to think about stupid lines!). There is one line throughout the film that refers to "I know what you did last summer" - movies that suggest that filmmakers wrote it all as a big joke, but I doubt it. And the end ... well, some will hate it, others will kick it. For me, it was mostly a former question, because the last twist comes from nothing! If the audience were given some clue to the girls' mental status, I might think otherwise. It also throws all the logic out of the window because the killer could never be in place for some kills! But as a passionate horror fan, I learned to live with these irregularities in Spanish and Italian films. But everything is not bad. The film has a great budget look, mainly due to the excellent cinematography (scenes from past times really shine here), tight adjustments and atmospheric soundtrack. Although most actors are bad enough, Anita Briem is the exception to make the most of what she has to work with. Real presence on the screen! And as I mentioned earlier, killing is bloody enough for fans of such things and are usually accompanied by very good special effects including water images (but "water theme") tends to get tiring at the end though). <br /> <br /> So, to end this review, it's a movie that's pretty fun in "so-bad-that's a good" way, and it's also nice to look at. because it doesn't give you how you probably think it will be, judging by the description of the trailer and the plot.
