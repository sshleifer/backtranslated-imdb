This is a road movie. At least that movie is in a yellow anf I think it suggests a road movie (?). I can't say much about the delivery. It's a bad deal, definitely their English. The camera looks like it was a baby, there's a counter-bomb and suddenly the Beetle falls from the sky. Since it was such a cliché, we are all the time - and that was the funniest of the movie. This movie should be released in America, but I'm not sure you should go because it might suggest that the quality we produce. Explosions look boring. Basically everything is up. Everything is just too much: yellow quality, sound, baby, etc. Find all the cliché parts in other movies, put them together and you have Delivery.
