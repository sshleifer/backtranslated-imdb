Slayer starts in a South American rainforest where Capper Hawk (Casper Van Dien) and his men are attacked by a lot of vampires, barely escaping their lives. A leap forward six months later and Hawk is called to see Colonel Weaver (Lynda Carter), who informs him that there have been other reported Vampire observations and that his ex-wife and her goddess Dr. Laurie Williams (Jennifer O'Dell) went out there on a beetle study trip worried she would ask Hawk to take troops back to South America and officially return to Captain Grieves (Kevin Grevioux) and his men while unofficially looking for Laurie and didn't kill the Vampires who decided to go out of the caves into the civilized world ... <br /> <br /> Modified, written and director Kevin VanHook is another badly crafted original Sci-Fi channel that's just not in any respect is not very good. This humorous scenario has nothing to see, it's one of those modern Vampire movies that choose to choose and choose "traditional" vampire rules to use as these Vampires can be killed by heartbeats and fangs but at the same time they can freely walk in the sun and not sleep in coffins. The film moves at a reasonable pace, but it's all very boring, bland and lifeless. The story is bad and just a little stupid, the character is horrible, the dialogue is forgotten and there are very few recommendations. Slayer is also trying to have an ecological message, because the Vampire's head claims to be killing human beings only because of their systematic destruction of the rainforest, where they have been secret for centuries. a line that fills the time before a serious statement. There is not enough exploitative content and it's a rather unsatisfactory way to spend 90 minutes of your time. The creators didn't do anything about setting up the jungle, I haven't expected hell Predator (1987), but I was hoping for a little more than that. Director VanHook made several horror movies of all I saw, they were just as poor, I'm sorry, but he does nothing and turns into a completely forgotten looking movie. There is no atmosphere or tension, and just as with real ghosts, forget it. Gore is restrained, there are bits of neck and a little blood spraying, but nothing we have not seen before or have a big impact. There is also a huge Vampire monster creature at the end, but it doesn't seem impressive and gets itself killed too easily. <br /> <br /> With an estimated budget of about $ 2 million, it actually had a decent amount of money to spend on it, but it's still a garbage movie, it's pretty well done, but nothing special or memorable. The actor sucks, I'm sorry, but that's the way I saw it. <br /> <br /> Slayer is another bad, stupid and boring made-for-TV Sci-Fi channel garbage that I just can't recommend. Don't be fooled by the somewhat subtle British movie "Video Nasty" Gore of The Slayer (1982), which is 100 times better than this and watch it.
