this caricature is not right, lol totally disagree with many of the things she displayed, but it ended up positively, but as for me and mine, we will not observe it in our household mainly because every day we fight against stereotypes and that caricature just confirms what most white people feel that black people behave like <br /> <br /> a comment one of the little black girls made on the cartoon was that her boyfriend was so conscious (he was white) that really offended me that it wasn't something that blacks consume lightly is when blacks realize when they realize their true ability
