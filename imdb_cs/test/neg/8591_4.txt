Beautiful images, propaganda and history as a toy. The ingredients of this movie, good, interesting, but with many shadows. Political shadows. Jefferson is more than a hero of mythical America. It is a silhouette of a vision of life and society, an extraordinary thinker, a teacher of much of North America. There's only Superman in the movie. Delicate contours of ideas are crushed. Forgetting the subtle birth of the fundamental truth. Jefferson is an essential tool for creating a good image of American reality. The end, triumphant and false, romantic and heroic, is a suicide from a storyline that can be tall with greater wisdom. And the war against "Avatar" is another gray spot. For those who have heard nothing about Jefferson, the film is a good start. For others - disillusionment. It's like precious tailor-made silk. But the tailor is fascinating about silk, and clothes are just plain fabrics. So, a sad experience. Slices of beautiful and boring lakes, patriotic lessons and excitement expectations. A film that has to be impressive. And the ashes of the story that could be magnificent.
