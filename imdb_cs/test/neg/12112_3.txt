This movie is bad. I've seen rated and unrated versions. They are terrible !! Now I know it's supposed to be a low budget, spiderman porn spoof, but Spiderbabe just isn't good when she's bad. Its not funny! Not funny a little bit !! I wanted to laugh. I tried to laugh. But this movie left me. At least an unrated version has a lot of nudity I look forward to. And it's me because Mundae isn't a great looking woman. She is fine from her waist down, but on the way up she leaves a lot to be desired. She looks good in this school outfit. Please, if you have to look at this spider, rent it first. Rated or not rated, actually doesn't make a difference, it's bad for me !!
