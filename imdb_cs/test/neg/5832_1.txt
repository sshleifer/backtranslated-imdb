I come from Bangladesh and here, C.C.Costigan is the goddess of wonderful sex. We all married aside, my friend and I woke up in the middle of the night watching movies on Encore: Action when we came across sli-fi-esquire. There was RoboCop 2 (not bad, ... not bad at all) ... then Judge Dredd, (Stalone almost destroys his career), then a movie called Deadly Target. One would think that the title "Deadly Target" could only be awarded a really great, and really cheesy Rambo knock-off. But no, what's delivered is what I'd like to call "Semi-softcore, semi-pseudo action, semi-sci-fi film" ... in fact, I think I can say it's not even a movie for everything. If it weren't for the ultimate glow of the main character, my friend and I would turn the movie off when the opening credits open. <br /> <br /> I have a few questions about people even dare to say "pros" who made this movie. -One, in the future, why do they use weapons used in 1999? Oh, wait, I'll get it, it's all they could get in their hands, ... right ... so well, why is the main character wearing what looks like everyday linen shirts of flax and vests, kind of like what people wore in the late nineties? .... oh ... I'll get it ... in space, it MUST be a fashion statement .... well, then ... WHY, OH, WHY the main character pulls a 3.5-in-one disk in the movie to could she record some bullshit ?! WTF!? ... we've gone so far as to have space travel, but we haven't progressed around 1.44 megabytes of space. I think I'm asking too much. The second question, let's say ... yes ... this is erotic. So why is there only one real sex scene and why does it take 2 minutes? I mean, you're taking REASON people who stay in the middle of the night to see this crap (dare to say 'movie' already?) ... and crush it for 2 minutes. Damn, they should just take this sex scene and sell it to another porn movie, and they'd make more money out of this "stupid" thing than they did. CCCortigan is hot. And no offense to the actress, but she behaves as well as I do. and I'm mentally retarded and I have only one testicle ... (C.C. Cortigan, ... email me ... we'll have lunch) I'd write more, but I was out of place.
