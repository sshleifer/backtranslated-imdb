I just read the book and I was looking forward to this TV adaptation that was broadcast on Monday night on Hallmark Channel (May 30, 2005). The key to the book was a man-stolen manifesto, but I watched the hour (from 3 1/2) and saw the man with the steel teeth, but I never saw him steal the manifesto. . I saw someone stealing a virus, but what does this have to do with the book? It's too bad, because this movie has great production values ​​and good cast, but it's not the idea to turn a book into a movie (TV or movie) so that people who have read the book become part of the audience. They only kept me for an hour. I thought the book's assumption was great and what they did, but they blew up the premise. This book had a great McGuffin (paraphrasing Hitchcock), but they ignored it. And the headlines say Forsyth was involved in the production. They must have paid him a lot of money.
