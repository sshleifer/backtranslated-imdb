There were a few nice moments in this movie and it was quite funny a few times. But this did not replace the fact that it was a totally boring film. There was no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would even consider leaving his wife-to-be for this cat that he probably was eliminated. There was a better chemistry between him and Liv Tyler at Armageddon. Hell, there was better chemistry in Demolition Man between Sly and Sandra. There were a few moments in the movie that just didn't have to be and were unbearably slow. That was a bad remake of "My Best Friends Wedding". Wait for it to be out for a year and a half on the video and rent it in .49 cent bin if you have nothing to do on a rainy Sunday afternoon, and you can't think of any better movies for rent.
