I saw an episode about life on a minimum wage. It went as far as Oprah Winfrey's appearance for that episode. It's bad enough when people struggle with the end of the week. After this hypocrite took advantage of the problem. I have not felt a constant complaint about him or his other significant. Queston is how people have the opportunity to pay their health care bills from ER? Sure he shows that the law is high, but paid the remaining balance (from his own pocket) after wards from his "embarrassing" experience. How many poor people have after 30 days of such privilege to pay their bills. Instead, they starve and "rob Peter to pay Paul." An episode complaint is not a humble thing for him. The movie scene and restaurant is scary. Another privilege that poor people have.
