The highest sanction is a film about a female killer who works for the US government. He has to kill a famous TV reporter, but he saves his life when he sees that he has a little daughter. Because he did not kill him, he became another target of her employers. <br /> <br /> The script isn't good even though I've seen worse B-movies. A striking man with remorse, the government has killed innocent people in the name of fighting terror ... What will happen next? Aliens save the victim ??? No, the highest sanction will never win any prize due to the scenario. I'm afraid acting is no better. Several well-known actors (Michael Madsen and Kristy Swanson) who have clearly paid a lot of bills and therefore accepted to play in this movie, along with some other actors who probably don't even know what the camera really looks like. Don't make a good movie. So why should you watch this movie? Well, if you have nothing better than watching some action and you are tired of 10 531 reps of Mc Gyver or A-Team, it may be the movie you want to see. Otherwise, it's better to leave it. I give it 3/10.
