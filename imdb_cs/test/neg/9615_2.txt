Oh, dear - as Alfred Hitchcock (north of the northwest, Spellbound, 39 steps) could hit this ugly, cheap shock, he's behind me. Do not bother to search for hidden depths or deep meanings - there are none. This is just awful, dirty and cheap. One of the redeeming features is the investigator's home life - his wife acts as a gourmet cook and constantly serves her experienced culinary attempts to her poor husband. This is fun and just saved me putting the movie in a terrible holder, but the film as a whole is one of the most unpleasant things I've ever seen. I believe it was Hitchcock's next film - maybe someone told him something.
