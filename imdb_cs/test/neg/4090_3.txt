This film was a failure as comedy and film in general. It was a very slow movie that tried to convey the message, but the message was a clich√©, a hopeless beginning. This film falls on a shameless ecological point, even doing a self-righteous point of destroying SUVs and supporting Animal Planet. Sitting in this way, I couldn't help but notice that Steve Carell had no more than one really funny line. The only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to put the comic strip on Wanda Sykes. Her character gets frequent lines where she doesn't fit perfectly. Away from the brilliance of Bruce Almighty, Evan Almighty throws out his entire record-breaking budget for special effects that can hardly get into the world. The film spends the first half of Evan's Ark building, but until the end we learn that the Ark was utterly insignificant, and the whole story was just a vessel for stupid gags and even stupid messages. The film ends when we find that the whole ark, the flood, and the gathering of animals were just a weak political statement by anyone but God. Yes, God tried to influence politics.
