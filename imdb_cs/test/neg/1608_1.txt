It's so bad, I can't break away. I still ask, "Why?" "Why?" with every scene. There is no continuity, but then again, if you want to make a very obviously gay movie with a fetishistic attitude to all the things Big, Big Boats, Big Boys, Big Aircraft, then you don't have to worry about things like storyline or character. I'm confused and very concerned that CAG looks like Richard Pryor. It seems wrong to give Pryor a similar look in such a horrible movie. But I can't break away. This movie is the first movie I've ever checked. That's how phenomenally bad and bizarre. This motivated me to join this site. I counted 50 main characters. Perhaps if I were stoned, I could follow, but as it is, I feel like I'm in some never-ending bad dream where it's always 1988, and we were the biggest cock on Earth.
