Dear friends, I've never seen such a movie as NIGHT DONONS (1988). Director Kevin Tenney seems to have intended to copy the classics like Sam Raimi's Evil DEAD (1978) or George A. Romero's RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD of the same year. The cinematography was lousy, the movie was very dark, so I had to change the brightness control to the maximum. Indeed, the horror images must be dark, but not the night of the night. The whole movie was ridiculous, tense, worse actors besides Alvin Alexis in the role of Rodger and terrible makeup effects. Average 5 stars for this movie? I can not believe that. Perhaps the users were happy with breasts, asses and pussy actresses, they were really worth 5 stars. Greetings, Hans-Dieter
