The inadmissibility of the conspiracy was reported by several commentators, especially the tremendous number of problems McKenna would have to face, and the utter impossibility of some of the calculations he had to do, including that Langdon was going to decipher each track in minutes. McKenna is branded; A few seconds later he gives orders and runs a few minutes later (literally) in charge of operations - in real life he would be shocked. And as usual with thrillers, the killer doesn't kill the hero, he gives as his only lame explanation that they weren't on the list of those to be killed, like any other innocent passerby he shot. I have always used Independence Day as a distinctive feature of a really horrible film (the US president is in charge of jet aircraft and beats aliens, ha ha), and this effort is close to each other. For such an unlikely film, Angels and Demons contain a remarkable number of predictable incidents. Who was unwittingly not allowed when the killer went to get a reward in Volkswagen? I felt like shouting, "You'll be fired". Who didn't know the heroine would find the body in the lab? Who didn't see it? Technically, the film was terrible. Dialogue was more often incomprehensible than clear, while races through Rome to the next church were accompanied by deafening music. In addition, many scenes looked like mud. One of the redeeming features was the footage of Rome and what looked like the Vatican - a success because I am sure that Vatican officials would not want this slag shot in and around Sts. Rome is a magical place and I enjoyed it carefully.
