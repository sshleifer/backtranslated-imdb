Although I am very interested in biblical movies, I was bored every minute of the movie to death. Everything is wrong. The movie is too long, acting is mostly a joke and the script is terrible. I did not make sense to mix the story of Abraham and Noah together. So if you value your time and common sense, avoid this horror.
