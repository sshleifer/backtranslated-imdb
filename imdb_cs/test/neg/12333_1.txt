The worst movie I've ever seen. The sound quality was bad, cutting the scenes was even worse, and above all it was not logical and had no speed ... <br /> <br /> At first I thought, "No, I don't want a trail that proves poor Patrick was an innocent murderer" But it turned out to be worse, typically you get a super-tip or no advice at all in this American movie, I want very small little advice to direct you to the killer. that there will be a few killers at the end, and that's not all ... ah ... This is hopeless, lets you quit ... <br /> <br /> In a word: disgusting .. <br /> <br />
