"Reckless," which feels right is not much, begins with starting off-putting (thanks to screenwriter Craig Lucas, who customized his own game, brought the title with him) and continued to cast (Mia Farrow Plays a Woman) Tony Goldwyn, who is young enough to be her son). The couple live in an idyllic winter world that seems to be inside a snowball, but Farrow gets a surprising dose of reality after admitting hiring a man to kill her. She runs into the night and enjoys a very strange couple who wants to help her restore her life. The production design and artistic direction of "Reckless" are fine, but they are services provided for a totally unreasonable, often alienating scenario. It is assumed that it is a dark holiday comedy, although with this failed, sometimes offensive material is a loss. * 1/2 from ****
