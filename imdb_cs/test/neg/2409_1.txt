If you tried to make a bad movie, you couldn't do the worst of that one. I can't imagine anyone paying good money to see waste in such a theater. The thing that really gets you is fascinated by the fact that you look at the whole thing just for wonder when you see how bad it is. The climax of this movie was to see the words "End"
