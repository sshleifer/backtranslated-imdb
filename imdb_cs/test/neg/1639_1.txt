This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not the worst - Manos's fate holds the honor. This movie has a lot of problems. To get started, this whole film is a cheap Conan movie. It is a kitten in a modest dress wearing a beanie, a silent Asian warrior, a scraper guy, almost mindless soliders, and so on. There are a lot of continuity errors in this movie. Some of the stupidest mistakes I've ever seen are in this movie. Fortunately, when I watched this movie, I saw the MST3K version. Joel and the 'bots make the movie observable, otherwise I'd have turned it off for about five minutes.
