Jeff Powers (Lou Diamond Phillips, "Young Guns 1 & 2"), a policeman with a history of roughing criminals, is recruited into the LAPD elite secret division. That doesn't fit well with Jeff's girlfriend Jeff, Kelly (Chelsea Field), who is looking for a team story. Soon enough Jeff's conscience will get the better that gives him a chance with Dan Vaughn (Scott Glenn, "Hunt for Red October" & "Backdraft"), the leader of the unit. quite routine, I dare say a secular, police action / drama that has no surprise thanks to a cookie-cutter fence that is content to go strictly from point A to point B. Acting is fine for it But what the actors got to work with is not the real reason to watch the movie. Kinda sad to see how six previous Mark L. Lester directed the movies just before this (from 1984 to Showdown in Little Tokyo) were all very fun vehicles. <br /> <br /> Eye candy: Chelsea Field is up short without <br /> <br /> D:
