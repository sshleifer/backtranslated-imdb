Although the performances were excellent, I spent the whole movie waiting for the ugly boy who caused so much grief to so many characters, won his last nemesis, and instead all suffered except him and he got the job of a husband whose wife is the death he causes by escaping his friends, wins the girl he overdosed, and tried to rape. Even his friend gives money to his father, but the butterfly effect does not completely return to his cause. This is a very dark movie because every character who is affected suffers from never-ending depression. None of the usual ways of relief seems to be effective, and the only thing the authorities seem to do is to hand out a lot of load powders. If it is normal behavior in Finland, I will never go back only if I am affected by such an amoral butterfly and end up being destroyed as characters in this movie.
