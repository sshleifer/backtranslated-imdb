The film had moments, but it disappointed me anyway. It was a reworking of Trespass (Walter Hill) and thus a treasure of Sierra Madre, with less tension, bite and human emotions. There was nice playing, but the story was lame and lacking in real depth. I watched the film for Mr. Reno and Mr. Fishburn, nor were they inspired, and they both had nothing to say to get out of their skin. This movie has been killed in the past and it didn't have to be made to eat money that could be used for better movies. It was a rare event for an action movie and it wasn't exciting as a thriller. Better than watching snow, but not for me.
