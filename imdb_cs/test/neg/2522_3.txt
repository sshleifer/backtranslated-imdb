This movie was really stupid and I thought it wasn't so bad and I could tolerate a movie about bed eating people. Then take a part near the end where the guy's skeleton hands ended up like a cherry on top of a bad movie. I saw the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for good. His brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones. The funny thing was, he could still move his hands that were just wrong. You can't really move your hands without muscles, but you did. His brother was to bleed out before he moved his hands. The movie wasn't great, but it was fine until the scene. I laughed so hard that I don't remember how it ended. He had something to do with foam or something.
