If I was 5, it might be scary. It's a (low-budget) movie. Acting is not good, but it could be worse - filming and special effect is terrible. The story is thin and not worth it. Too much time is being used for boring screaming scenes. Chase or fighting aliens remind me of children fighting with scary masks. Some gore with blood and body parts - would frighten a 5 year old baby I think. Apparently scare the crap out of some people in the movie. It's far from achieving something like Tremors. It turns out to be an "incident" and we see strange ships near the country. This wonders if any will continue ...
