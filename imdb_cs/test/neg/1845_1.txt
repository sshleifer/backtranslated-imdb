When I first saw this movie, I quickly noticed an actress who played the role of Lucille Ball. The image of Lucy Rachel York is absolutely terrible. Lucille Ball was a stunning comedian with incredible talent. Thinking about a legend like Lucille Ball, which was portrayed in the way she was in the movie, is terrible. I can't believe all the actresses in the world who could play much better Lucy, the producers decided to get Rachel York. She could be a good actress in other roles, but playing the role of Lucille Ball is tough. It's hard to find someone who might resemble Lucille Ball, but could at least find someone similar in appearance and talent. If you noticed York's view of Lucy in the episodes I Love Lucy, such as a chocolate factory or vitavetavegamin, nothing is in any way â€” her expression, her voice, or her movement. Pino plays Desi Arnaz is terrible. Pino is not entitled to play as Ricky. He is small and thin, his accent is unreal and his performances are incredible again. Although Fred and Ethel weren't similar, they weren't as bad as Lucy and Ricky. Overall, an extremely horrible casting and story is wrong. If people want to understand the real life situation of Lucille Ball, I suggest watching A&E Biography Lucy and Desi, read Lucille Ball's book, or PBS 'American Masters: Finding Lucy. If you want to see docudrama, "Before laughing" would be a better choice. Casting Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in "Before the Smile" is a lot better than that. At least a similar aspect to nothing is displayed.
