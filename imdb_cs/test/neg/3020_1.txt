This is exactly what we need, a show about people that nobody likes at high school or at university. Man or woman. People who objectify others and congratulate them are precisely the opposite of intelligent thinking. And this show is just disgusting when you do exactly that. So four men are sitting on chairs watching the other two boys and picking up the women to have sex with them. And finally one of two victories, great ... just f-n big. I also assume that I should accept these four bags as "judge" of "game" people. The term "game" must be the most moronic thing that has come out of modern English since the term "Bling Bling", added to the fact that these men are called "experts", just makes me degenerate what's left of respect for modern culture. They're not damn patterns, they're the result of MTV culture coming to bite us in the ass. If you like the crap spilling on the sides of this monstrosity then you probably think that Paris Hilton and Britany Spears have talent. It's not true, and you should be ashamed of thinking that. And for all those people who say I wish I had it, or that I was just jealous. Screw yourself, because it is obvious that the real girl will definitely not.
