Maybe I was young when I saw it. Perhaps I did not grow up with the films of Grease and Elvis. <br /> <br /> I couldn't get it. I have a "black" comedy (Black Adder, etc.). I have irony and spoofs. I don't get it, though. I did this search to find out the title of this movie (getting help from people on usenet and the most excellent IMDb Message Boards) so it could be my first 1-pointer. Terrible!
