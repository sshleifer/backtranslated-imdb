Something not so great. "Silence Lambs" remains the only good Demme movie, and of course I am, of course, including all the overrated left-wing exercises in the big canvasses, some of which I have never seen - and will never be. This is a light comedy that turns halfway around. The first half is a little hard to sit on; it's neither funny nor interesting. Daniels plays a stupid, naive moron upstairs who is so trusting and trusting to give up faith. His animated acting is often unpleasant and barely funny. In fact, he is at the beginning of Griffith and tells her he is married to children when he is in fact divorced! In all the history of mankind and films, every man who is married will meet a woman he loves - if he lies - and says he is not married. (Later, an unjustifiable or believable justification for this intention was revealed: he wanted to "protect himself." What kind of bullshit ...) The fact that his character makes all the wrong decisions and does all the stupid things in the movie really enjoyed me on Liotta how he beats him when he caught up with him in the former apartment. What then happens in Daniel's apartment is the classic end of the fight-to-death movie, which a good man - though a very stupid good guy - predictably wins. He has some action at least for the last half hour, something is happening, and Daniels is no longer able to be animated. The film lacks credible characters (whether major or marginal) and feels that it is 80 years old, which means that the film has a rather bland appearance; visually ugly. Sayles again makes a portrait as a policeman. The movie is also perhaps a bit heavy on the side of coincidences. Again, Griffith plays the soft-talking, silly-sounding bimbo, but as usual, he is convincing because he's a stupid stupid fool. It was an earlier film before a lip augmentation and breast augmentation operation; Compare the natural breasts that exhibit in this movie with the balloons ready to explode, which briefly flashes a few years later in "Nobody's Crazy".
