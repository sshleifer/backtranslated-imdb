I couldn't believe how bad this movie was and believe me, I didn't expect a masterpiece from a cable film. I only recorded it because I liked Jane Seymour. I saw her enough to know she was a perfect actress, so I just don't know what happened here. The characters were shallow, in dialogue stilted, acting badly, and yes, which includes Seymour. It was nice to see her game against type, but not so bad. I noticed that she was carrying a loan for the executive producer, so she could not escape the guilt for the sheer badness of the film. And oh, yeah, they had Barry Bostwick on the men's lead. Said Nuff.
