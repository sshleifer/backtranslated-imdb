I'm used to the fact that I suffered from movies because I generally found it worthwhile. But a few works are going to new levels and entering the realm of provocation .... "Last year in Marianske Lazne" comes to mind. "Pola X" is not "last year in Marianske Lazne". On the one hand, I can calculate the number of movies I have come out over the years. "Pola X" has become a member of this August group. In my defense, I believe that I have made a brave effort to stand on the ground - hoping that things will turn around. However, I finally threw the towel just shy of the 90 minute mark - pretty decent under the circumstances. "Pola X" is nowhere near the living promise of Carax's earlier work. After a ten-year break, it had to be really bitter for him. Melville is still spinning in his grave!
