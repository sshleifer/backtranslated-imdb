If you really loved GWTW, you'll find a pretty disappointing story. Those who may think this is just about the romantic story and the south are likely to be happy with this decent TV production (I think I consider Scarlett a significant mistake). But let me say that nothing has worked out of the novel. I read GWTW more than 20 times and I really appreciate Mitchell's adaptation she made for the movie. It took me some time to understand how good the end was: Scarlett knew for sure that she wanted to restore Rhett, because she always got what she wanted. But in the end there was no kiss. Then Alexandra Ripley came to "fix" by showing us how perfect and powerful Scarlett could be, and of course she described in detail how exactly Rhett was getting back, even though she had an important affair with someone else ( nothing was possible from Mitchell's mind, I'm sure). The story between these points is, in my opinion, just a long and boring ride at the end of a tie, showing costumes and scenarios to give us a clear and unnecessary end. If Margaret Mitchell could live again, she died once more to find out what happened to Scarlett after GWTW. Of course it's not fair to compare it with the original, but that's not GWTW's fault. It's not? Is it good if I don't compare it to the original? Maybe. I'm sorry I didn't really care. <br /> <br /> I would expect him to continue compromising on the continuation of someone else's work, otherwise don't try.
