STAR PACKER is one of about 152,000,000 Westerns that John Wayne has been working on during the 1930s. Well, the number is a bit exaggerated, but it was almost like that. This is because these B-movies were quickly made with very low budgets to be the second or smaller feature in the theater. Most Bs were quite inexpensive and tended to cut corners to reduce costs and STAR PACKER is no exception. To save costs, random music is not used, running time is less than an hour, writing has often been derived, and actors are mostly small talents - and Wayne himself was definitely far from being the household name at this time. Some of these features of Wayne are quite good, while others like this are attentive, but also somewhat stupid and insignificant. I liked this movie and most others, but it's probably because I reduced the Bs a lot. Wayne Plays Like John Travers - American Marshall who explores the actions of a local gang to chase local and steal from the stage. This is strange because the film was probably set in or near modern times because they used phones and modern machine guns - things you wouldn't expect in the Old West. Such anachronisms are actually quite common in B Westerns - as Gene Autry's films (for example) abound with them. Wayne's Sidekick's Yak - played by stuntman and real life friend of Wayne, Yakima Canutt. Bad Man is an unknown character called "Shadow" and he gives his instructions over a black screen that hides his face! That sounds exactly like a movie character - a baddie who loved kids, but the adults groaned because they were so stupid and kind of like Blofeld or Dr. Evil! The problem is that when you listen to his voice and pay attention, it is clear at the beginning of the film that this "shadow" is George Hayes. Speaking of Hayes, he's the same guy who later in the movies was known as Gabby Hayes, but here and in the few other morning movies Wayne looks and says nothing like Gabby. He was well dressed, articulated and cleanly shaved in THE STAR PACKER - imagine it! In real life, it was probably more than the real George Hayes - though I doubt he was bad! Now, as you can say from the last paragraph, there is really no secret in this movie. You have the acting (passage and nothing more) and stunts - which were really amazing. Again and again, one stunning one by one appeared - for example, men jumping from horse to horse and some great fighting scenes - all by the way, Canutt and his friends. Canutt was often double in the film John Wayne - and it continued for decades. The problem with some bits, however, it is that it seems that filmmakers actually killed a few horses to get those big "stumbling horses" bits to see later in the movie. Until 1940, filmmakers often put a thin metal wire and ran the horse through it in full gallop! In this process, the horses' limbs were usually broken and the horses were subsequently killed! One of the worst examples of this film was JESSE JAMES - where several horses were brutally killed - which led to the American Humane Association, which insisted that the organization's representative be on film shoots to confirm that the animals were not injured in production. Thus, since 1940, the films have had this little statement. STAR PACKER was made well before disclaimer and I can't see horses doing these "tricks" without being killed. Overall, it's at best a time trial for a bad chart occasionally a bad deal and an incredible cruel attitude towards horses. I'm not a bleeding heart, but I just can't understand this disrespect for a poor old animal.
