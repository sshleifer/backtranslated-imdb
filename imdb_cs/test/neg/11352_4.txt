"You can survive anything". Anything but stupid horror. The director couldn't even decide whether he wanted a demon or just a serial killer. You can't have both. It's like Michael Moore, who is trying to have his cake and eat it too (or in his case 1500 cakes) by making his specific "dock-comedy" brand: to be oh-so cheerful and zany, yet you were it is also intended to treat them as truth-based, earthquake and hard documents. Some genres cannot be mixed. "Anyone can happen anytime, anywhere." (Translation: This is a horror genre, so we can do whatever kind of nonsense we want.) It sounds like something "wise" that is on paper of Chinese wealth, but rather as the creed of every bad horror film director. We received this balloon of a statement that was soon delivered to us as a preparation / justification for the absurd buffooner. <br /> <br /> "My phone doesn't work!" Of course it is not. There is a much greater chance that Sean Penn's brain will start working (after decades of catatonic apathy) than that of a horror-movie cell phone. The only horrible and predictable horror cliché of the last decade. Why say that? We know that help will never come over a phone call, so horror dimwits could also mention you. The last 50 horror movies I've seen have used this plot. It becomes embarrassing. <br /> <br /> "You must always expect unexpected." The final twist was somewhat surprising, I'll give them so much ... However, a lot of nonsense on the way there. <br /> <br /> Look at the sophisticated traps that the heroine prepares with the speed of a dazed - lab rat - in cold, damp and almost complete dark conditions. I like horror realism ... <br /> <br /> When a blood-thirsty demon tries to be funny (by "sacrificing" its victims), then you know that your horror-watching pleasure is in doubt. The less the old geezer was called "the crackling of the wise", the better ... Another stupid cliché that is served by a tired, lazy, uninitiated director. <br /> <br /> What are the chances that your husband will attack you and then the charming demon - the same day? "Expect unexpected". It could also squeeze if an aircraft crash survives, and then another that meets aliens trying to anal-probe it ... <br /> <br /> The fast forward button needs a temple or shrine built in the picture.
