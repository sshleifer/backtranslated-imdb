I've never heard of the SINGLE NIGHT until someone on the horror board recently mentioned it and read it, I was interested in Mega Tilly's participation, and realized it was an early concert on Friday, 13 VI: JASON LIVES director Tom McLoughlin. Unfortunately, unfortunately, it is nothing special. The assumption is familiar with the fact that the student must survive the night in the old mausoleum until dawn to join the club. The girl is a young Meg Tilly, like Julie, who wants to show her loving loving friend, Steve (David Mason Daniels), that she can do her cruel, pleasing ex-girlfriend, Carolina (Robin Evans), regardless of tactics. she pulls to see how she failed. Together with Carol's gang, Kitty (Leslie Speights), always with a toothbrush in her mouth, and Leslie (Elizabeth Daily), who really doesn't want to cause Julie such trouble. While Leslie insists on leaving Julia alone when she stays in the mausoleum, Carol and Kitty plan to torture a poor girl. Meanwhile, Steve is looking for her while Julie, Carol, and Kitty meet evil they can't imagine. The corpse of the recently ill "psychic vampire", whose telekinesis was dangerously strong, will try to get rid of its own life. life. The only one who can help these girls is the daughter of a dead man, Olivia (Melissa Newman), who has the same psychic power as she has. I think that what many find exciting is the unusual evil that threatens girls in the mausoleum, it's certainly different than what you commonly see in the slashers that were at this time. Like Adam West's character (.. he was a cynical Olivia husband who found out that the idea of ​​his father was too ridiculous), I had really hard times adapting to a cheap conspiracy, and I personally never found anything in the movie I was thrilled. . The mausoleum has never been so scary for me (.. it really does not reach the same kind of frightening PHANTASM quality captured) and the corpses that are used to attack girls are ridiculously unconvincing (.. there is one great scene where the corpse's face melts). I have a soft spot for low budget movies from this time period, but I could never find a reason to get involved when you have this disgruntled dead body that shoots electrical screws from the eyes, causing other bodies to break out of the crypt. Listen to your master. It's too stupid to take it seriously. Carol is your typical blond bitch who wants to punish a pretty girl who walks with a former flame. Steve is your typical, absolutely pure American friend, handsome and gentle, who becomes a hero trying to save his girl from any sinister force. In order to balance the small budget director McLoughlin will try every trick in the book's excitement audience, using a series of ooga-booga effects such as corpses that track young girls, chairs that tremble and shake, doors that slammed, and levitating objects themselves. Of course, the movie has its fans and I'm glad I had a chance to see it, but I was a little disappointed that ONE Dark NIGHT wasn't the horror sleeper I was hoping for. Adam West has a very small role, because the husband in question hopes his wife will break out of her depressive state when it comes to her father who has nothing to do with her. Melissa Newman is a troubled Olivia who realizes that she must stop her father once and for all, otherwise she would continue her life. Donald Hotton is Dockstader, an associate of Father Olivia who informs her about what he was. Tilly's performance here wasn't particularly blown away (... basically scared of most of the time), but from now on she would have a chance to show up to a greater extent. This will undoubtedly be of some benefit to those who have watched it at the time, and could seduce fans of films of that time for nostalgia purposes.
