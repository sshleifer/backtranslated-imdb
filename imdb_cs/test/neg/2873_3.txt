wow ... I've just watched this movie ... Americans have this stereotypical view of Hindu films such as ALL Indian movies have dances, songs and love stories .... It's pathetic as far from the truth. This film simply reveals a stereotypical Western view of Hindu films. Terrible dealings, terrible direction, terrible cinematography. And all this with a Hollywood director. Most of today's Indian movies are much more content-driven, realistic, moving and meaningful than this piece of crap. Indian cinema (not only Hindi) also covers a wide range of topics. Like most Hollywood movies these days, it shows a very stereotypical view of another country where the truth is thrown out of the window. This is a movie that is NOT recommended. Instead, watch good Hindu movies like Black Friday, Eklavya, Omkara, Khakee, Awarapan, Gangster, Don, Zakhm, Dor, Skipping Rope, Mother India, Lagaan ... These movies are what real Indian movies are all about.
