This representation of the popular children's story on film is quite pathetic to watch. I know it's one of the first filming attempts, but this 15-minute picture is unimaginable and badly shot. "The Great Train Robbery" (1903), which I also commented on, is much more creative and exciting to watch. We see how little long-haired Jack trades with a cow (2 men in a cow) suit) for hatful beans from a merchant and later beanstalk grows from where his mother is thrown in the yard (I think poor Jack achieved the wrong kind). Jack dreams of geese (it actually seems to be a chicken) and a golden egg and the next day he rises to the sky with a stalk. There's no effort to be creative in this movie. The stem looks like a rope with leaves on it, the giant is just a tall bearded guy in a house with nothing unusually big compared to Jack and the culmination of a movie where Jack makes his goose with his goose chicken and his golden egg is unhappy when a stuffed dummy falls off the screen in place of a giant and then the actor takes his place - he rises to his feet in an exaggerated dance of death as in most early movies. Leaf cap (rope with leaf cover) comes from top to bottom and neatly touches the giant's forehead. <br /> <br /> Watch something else.
