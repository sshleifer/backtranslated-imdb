I must say, I'm not a massive fan of Troma movies. It is true that I have only seen three of them (or four of them), but two (Blood Sucking Freaks and Mother's Day) are generally considered the best, which leads me to believe that everyone else is not worth it. vision. This would surely seem to be a Graduation Day, which is Troma, who is in charge of more than the popular 1980s slasher. While the film is never particularly bad (given the type of film), it's never particularly good; And to the end, all I could think of was 'Why did I bother to watch it?'. However, the plot sees any girl dying on the racetrack, and shortly thereafter; more people are beginning to die. Of course there are several possible suspects; But it's hard to really worry about anything that happens. Of course, in slasher terms; it is the most important thing, and since Troma learned that it was a red thing, I expected it to be. There are some decent kill scenes, and some of them are bloody; but it's never shocking, which really makes this another harsh slasher based on a festive event in the American calendar. It is worth noting that in this film there is a small role for sleaze queen Linnea Quigley, but the rest of the cast is not worth mentioning. The direction, action and its execution are very mundane; and I will say if you are not a big fan of Troma or someone who wants to track down every slasher he has ever done; Don't bother with this movie.
