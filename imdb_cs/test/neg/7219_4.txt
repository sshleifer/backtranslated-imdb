Let me start by saying that the movie is running poorly when the accessories are making cover. With that said, anyone who says it's the worst movie ever is dramatic, and anyone who says the movie is great is totally deceptive. The movie "is what it is." And what is it ... A modest budget ($ 4 million, estimating) studio sequel. The film is not terrible, but it will be disappointing for Road House fans. And that brings me to the problem, just as Dirty Dancing wouldn't be what was without Swayze, Road House isn't the same without him. Leadership lacks depth, character, and likability to carry the film. I feel that lead was poorly occupied and manufacturers should fold back to make Patrick do it if they did. The second cast was uneven with excellent actors like Will Patton, alongside players who couldn't get out of the paper bag. Busey, which I saw, seemed to look great as if he had just sent him. Ellen was playing well, except she wasn't believable as a chick raised like a bayou. Sherri, DEA agent at the first bar was a hot and good actress, but her part was clumsy little and underdeveloped. The writer has completely missed all the options to add story and character depth and interest. Instead, he opted for a basic one-dimensional film. Which leads me to the biggest problem, the scenario ... I got a bad feeling when the credits were rolling and there were three script writers separated by "a" and "&". It looked very amateur. And that's what he wrote. I heard that the original script was better and then overwritten and the hard core sucked. Some of the hairy parts of the movie to watch are ... During the first secret meeting, an apparent drug deal under the table. "Hi, let's get together in a crowded nudey bar, pull the coke block out of my coat and pull out the money, then send it under the cocktail table" WAIT! "Make sure you look great when you look left and right to make sure no one is looking!" Second, I love it when someone gets in the chest and then you see him sitting happily like a lark 10 minutes later. There are some nasty cut adjustments to the end of the movie, especially during the battle scenes and when the main character chases through the door and runs into the patron. Which brings me to the realism of DEA training, I will not be both technical ... But jumping through the door is not a standard practice ... Even the typical female agents who keep their butts to do it in a male-oriented field, behave like weak characters. Boring! Thanks for the chauvinistic view of Heir Director. There's another thing I could teach the school course about ... Accelerated fighting, exhilarating dialogue, a recycled story ... etc. But besides everything you can't like a former Mr.. Applegate, he completely lacks the humble Zen that made Mr. Patrick Swayze such a bad ass. He just hits me like one of those 5 feet of actors who think it's a bad ass, but like Van Damnit runs into a real bad ass (Chuck Zito in Van Don't Case) and gives him a bad lesson. "Because I feel it's the main line of the film, if you're a bad ass you're a bad ass, you don't have to try. Example: Swayze! If you're a handsome boy who tries hard to prove you're a bad ass, too ... So Well ... You're what your audience, Average Joe ... They won't rent this movie and if they do, they'll write reviews like this.
