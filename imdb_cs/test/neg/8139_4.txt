The cast and crew of this cheap horror boiler are more interesting than anything that happens throughout the film; in front of the camera and director Curt Siodmak, cinematographer Charles Van Enger, editorial editor Francis D. Lyon and production assistant Herman Cohen, we have a cameraman Barbara Payton, Raymond Burr, Lon Chaney Jr, Tom Conway, Paul Cavanaugh and Woody Strode. it. Unfortunate Payton turns his head to virtually every man who comes into contact with deep in the African jungle where he lives on Cavanaugh's husband's plantation: Dr. Conway coverts her secretly, while Master Burr's approach is literally more hands. on. On the other hand, Chaney is (surprisingly enough) lying, but a knowing authoritarian, and Strode is a native police official. The storyline is very simple, but frankly, it doesn't make much sense: after an extremely disturbed dinner with a storm, Burr and Cavanaugh (art imitating life later on) comes to blows in the garden over their affection for Payton and, suitably for Burr, the big snake just happens to crawl near where Cavanaugh hits the ground! Payton's mysterious maid (native witch, no less), for some inexplicable reason, testifies to an event from behind the bushes, and for Burr (who in the meantime got married to Payton) a curse on Burr (who in the meantime got married to Payton) who turns him into a gorilla ... from his wedding day (when he briefly turns his hand)! As a result, Burr loses his loss in the jungle for days at the end ?? even though the monkey creature itself is barely spotted throughout the film. However, it should be said that the version I was watching ran for only 56 minutes when the "official" length is listed either as 66, 70 or 76 !! That is why the film feels naturally rushed and disjointed if it is never less pleasant than campaigning because it culminates in a subjectively shot gorilla chasing Payton in the jungle, while the former is haunted by Chaney and Conway. To return to the film a tragic blonde lead lady for a minute: after a promising start in the movies next to such Hollywood legends as James Cagney and Gary Cooper? v, respectively, KISS TOMORROW GOODBYE and DALLAS (both 1950) ?? her career soon nose-dipped into B (and less) grade territory thanks to her own 'color' off-screen antics: her best-known offense was the cause of a much-publicized bar-quarrel between suave husband Franchot tone and brutal who ended up with former coma and Payton actually left him for the latter shortly thereafter !! But it wasn't all: the nymphomaniac Payton also boasted that Woody Strode was one of her conquests (a controversial issue at the time); short-lived husband Tone, having caught Payton's infidelity at the camera, expanded the moving photographic evidence around Hollywood, and it practically served to end his days as stellar? her latest film look is Edgar G. Ulmer MURDER IS MY BEAT (1955), which I had in my pile of "Unwatched Movies". The last 12 years of her tumultuous life have been spent on String Order in the throat of booze, drugs, prostitution, beatings, arrests and even stings? before, finally, dying in 1967 in the house of parents at the age of 39!
