I went into this movie with semi-high expectations after making a love series in my childhood, and it almost ruined that love for me. Jason Lee, David Seville in the movie, is scary. I understand that it cannot be easy to deal with CGI characters that are not really there, but I really found that his performance was cruel, along with all the other animated characters. The Chipmunks were delightful, but sometimes the scene of the story seemed apparently manifested when moving, and so they didn't try to stay in the cinema for more than half an hour. If you feel you have to see this movie, rent it the most. It's not worth eight dollars to see in theaters if you'd like a good laugh at horrible acting.
