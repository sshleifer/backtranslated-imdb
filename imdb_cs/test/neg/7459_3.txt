Before I saw this movie, its 1998 version was the only experience in this story. I didn't really notice the movie, but this 1974 adaptation is moving in a strange fashion. The actors do not shine, the main pair of michael york and sarah miles are mainly wooden cases. The only real interest in me was the intelligent anthony quayle. The so-called land is ridiculous, but the story itself is great. it is a real lesson about how distorted values ​​and obsessive principles can destroy you. living with an open mind and not worrying about what other people say is what you are, unless others can accept it, '' em. Pip was told early, but he wasn't listening. the girl, taken by a strange old lady, reminded me of an old kaspar hauser story, not at the same horrible level, but at the way she made the child to create her personal vendetta against the opposite sex that deceived her. Pip's childhood didn't seem much better. the end did not seem to match the rest of the story style. the sets looked cheap and out of the question when I found out that it was a real TV movie (which I didn't even know when I borrowed it from the library). live and learn. so many good movies, so little time. therefore the reviews are here. so you wouldn't have to waste time on this kind of movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10
