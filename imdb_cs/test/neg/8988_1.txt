I watched the movie for the hot guy - and even he! It was the worst - well, well, I have to put the props on the rough policeman, who is also a rapist, was even worse. The guy wasn't so cute at the end, he had the most terrible accent, and he was the most distinctive definition of the hicksville idiot who can't stand his mother for what he "loves" it has ever been. Overall, and if it makes sense for me to pick up movies in a video store, I think I read the back of a movie that looks so, "Well, at least it can't be worse than Carolina Moon." writing, playing, conspiracy - all that made it, my gags gagged to make a back. It was the worst movie I'd ever see, and Gabriela was there, too. I hated it, and believe me, if there were any number under 1 IMDb he had for rating, I'd get it at pulse.
