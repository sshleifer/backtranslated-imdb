After all I heard about Jane Austin's novel and various film versions of the book, I was very disappointed with the film. I was expecting a classic drama, but it wasn't. Above all, let me preliminarily evaluate that I like old movies, especially mysteries and dramas, but not women's movies. That's a huge difference, so take my review with a large grain of salt. I thought acting was a bit over the top, but it's very common in the movies of this era. June Allyson was good as Jo, but I found that every nurse was stereotyped and formed. There were no surprises or too dramatic moments. I hate writing negative reviews, but the movie left me very cold. It was always my intention to read the book, but after what seemed unlikely. The only warm line of stories was between the old masters and the youngest sister, who was a very welcome bright spot in an otherwise unsatisfactory viewing experience. Again there are others who love this movie, I'm not one of them.
