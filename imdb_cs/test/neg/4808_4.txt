When I first saw this movie, I said to myself, "Hey, what the hell is that good movie, why rent it?". Okay, I rented it and went home. When I put it in my DVD player, I was shocked. First of all, nobody told me it was a Mexican movie and was spoken in Spanish, a good thing that had subtitles. Second, it was naked, naked NUDE! Since I have no background in Mexican movies, you can see my shock when I saw it. * GASP! Virgin Eye Coverage, NOO * <br /> <br /> THIRD, predictable to say the least, but in fact it is predictable, not confusing to me when I like movies because it doesn't seem to matter if it's predictable if it's not over the top. Fourth, as Heidi and Kike were reconciled, and kitsch. Fifth, as the movie ended. It was BAD, BAD end. How suddenly Mr Van der Linde's approval for election of the mayor was due to her daughter knowing how to throw the party ... BLAH, Blah. I was hoping it wouldn't be so easy to accept, maybe the director was just in a hurry. After all that is bad, it's good. The film was actually quite hilarious at some point with Maribel being clumsy in the kitchen and all, Heidi's attitude, Valentina being poetic with the lyrics. What I also like was the song Valentina made with her girlfriend. That's all, and for the other products I didn't mention, they were just that.
