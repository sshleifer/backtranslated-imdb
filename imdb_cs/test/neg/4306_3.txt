I really should learn more about this film than hire it. It was one of those movies where you are still watching him, it must be better. Then, when it ends, you feel stupid for having lost your precious time in your life that you will never get back. Ice-T did his wrong thing and it was the highlight of the evening. The shuttle's images seem to be done with a small toy inside the box, and the scenes that went through the universe were funny because you saw the strings attached to the suits. The scenario was missing and the scene with the haunted car with a bleeding guy and unconscious was incredible because it was better than I could have in one of my best days. All in all, I've seen worse, but it's definitely not the one I would recommend or want to remember.
