I was just in the cinema in Prague watching this movie. It's not because of the poster I found a very Holywood old-fashioned heroic <br /> <br /> style. It's not because of the high level that reminds me that most <br /> <br /> of the best French movies are usually pathetic. But just <br /> <br /> because in my French mother tongue there aren't as many movies in the city as Prague. And because I like Adjani, Depardieu and Rappenau is Cyrano. Then I decided to write this little comment because I think <br /> <br /> I really disagree with the mainstream commentary on this movie on imdb. <br /> <br /> I wasn't disappointed. The movie looks like a poster. Characters <br /> <br /> are just as stupid as they look. For a moment I thought <br /> <br /> it would be like a cartoon - just a funny character <br /> <br /> you can laugh. No it is not! For example, when Depardieu decides to say, it is the one who murdered the fat she killed at the beginning of the film, and then came to the violin in a great fat patch. You should cry and realize that the character of Adajani is <br /> <br /> the deeper person he looks like. Maybe it was humor level 10. <br /> <br /> but I'm sorry that my sense of humor isn't that high! If I want to see some funny French movie about World War I watch again La Grande <br /> Vadrouille! It's definitely more fun! I also read about imdb <br /> <br /> that Lemoine is doing great in this movie. I have to say that I have never seen such a bad deal! (Well, I've never seen any Ed <br /> <br /> Wood's movie). However, the film is filmed with many good <br /> <br /> (very costly) scenes such as the Pantheon in the morning when the German army arrives in Paris or when refugees settled on the bridge at Bordeaux. I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker, but <br /> <br /> that he is doing better with a good script. It was easy with Cyran. <br /> <br /> He didn't have to write dialogues! I give 1/10.
