This is one of the worst series I've ever seen. When I was watching a manga review in a magazine, I thought it was interesting, but when I got the chapters, I realized it was a total stupidity. OK, the first 2 or 3 chapters are fine, and the series is standard. But as the plot progresses, it becomes completely incoherent. The series is trying to show some mystical based on Christian mythology, but it is total stupidity. It contains some demons and stigmata scenes ... Absolutely nonsense. The series seems to be trying to look deeply thoughtful, comprehensively or mythologically reviewed, but an observer with a little brain and cultural references will soon realize that all the elements used do not really make sense: they are just impressed IGNORANT WATCHERS !! The final chapters are full of utterly absurd elements: battles with demons with cat ears, references to the supposed fight between demons and demons who control time (for no apparent reason). The final is absolutely pointless; the unconscious observer will see a floating finale that gives them a place to meditate; but the truth is that: THE FINAL AND COMPLETE SERIES IS THE TOTAL INCOHERENT AND INCONGRUCTIVE NOTHING.
