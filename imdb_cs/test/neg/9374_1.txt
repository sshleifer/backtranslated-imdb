After some quite OK Dutch action movies, such as Lek and Van God Los, Gerrard Verhage wants to make a film about the life of a Dutch gangster. Well, the gangster is a big word for Klaas Bruins. He's not a real international big guy like George Jung (Blow) or Pablo Escobar. He's just Amsterdam lowlife who made some money selling drugs. Things are often thrown away in Holland and this film is just another example. But even then, the film could be very nice if the story was fine. Now there are big jumps in time: one day KLaas is just an ordinary drug boy, another shot seems to be a big player on the drug scene. No one knows how it is possible (except for those who read the book). Acting is really bad, non-Dutch movie watchers will see one of the worst actresses in Holland: Chantal Janzen. When you think she finally gets naked, then you're watching the rack in the model. So: bad behavior + bad haircut + crap story = De Dominee. Please don't look at it, though other people say it's good because it's not. I warned you.
