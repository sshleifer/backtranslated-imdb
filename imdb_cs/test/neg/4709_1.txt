There should be some prosecution to punish producers for funding this silly scenario. I feel that some criminalization of a bad movie could prevent more movies from this idiot from happening. Of course he has an interesting cast of characters, but I don't think I've ever seen more cardboard shows from the entire cast than in this uniquely crappy piece of crap. The director should be somehow punished for not making at least some performance from these people. So secession is a theme (not really, they beat you over your head with this one), it does not mean that each character must recite their lines as if on NPR. Did I mention that the movie was miserable? Finally, I'm not sure what kind of connections would have memories with cancer of the ultimate bone, but I'm sure you're completely dead that your cancer will continue to grow no matter what. This film is an insult to cancer patients, healthcare professionals and people without retardation. Finally, bumblebees fly because they produce enough lift for their weight by defeating the wings just like any other flying insect. I absolutely despise people who represent false knowledge as a reality. Next time you do a little research before using an imbecilic misconception as a prerequisite for a whole crazy movie. KIDDING ONLY BELIEVES IN JESUS!
