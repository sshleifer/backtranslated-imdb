I'm not from America, I usually watch this show on the AXN channel, I don't know why this respected channel air such a sucking program in the main time slot. Making Jerry Bruckheimer's Hollywood Bank Bank, this time spending a lot of money on a small canvas. In each episode a bunch of people having two team members travels from on earth to another for a large sum of money; where the camera puts its paths. I don't know who the hell put that stupid idea on the show. It has nothing to observe, in all the episodes we see people running like beggars, sometimes screaming, crying, beeping, jerky cameras working ..hh it's harmful to eyes and ears. The most disgusting part of the race is that viewers finally know that each team member cannot enjoy his race / travel experience. Although ratings were added, producers came up with ideas to include Gays in one show, sucking the American reality show. <br /> <br /> There is nothing you should look at, switch to other channels better. <Br/> <br /> Amazing Race = Disgusting Show.
