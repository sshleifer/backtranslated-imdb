Chupacabra: Dark Waters must be rated as one of the most serious moronic films ever made. I expected at least some passionate entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved, and when I saw this movie, I can honestly say that I have substantially reduced my opinion on Mr. Davies. Why? Acting is incredibly bad. An excellent actor like Davies should demand more from the cast and the director. It was painfully obvious that Mr. Davies was just looking at the clock and hoped the check would not be bounced. To say he just showed up would be underestimated. But at least he showed up. The rest of the cast seems to have sent him from their jobs at various restaurants in Los Angeles where they work as waiters. Talk about casting unknowns! This is a kind of cast that never appears in movies again. They act as if they were waiting for the office to work in bankruptcy. <br /> <br /> What about special effects? Shop bought flip flops, polystyrene, cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that seem to come from my 1980 Atari game. I saw some horrible special effects used on Sci-Fi Channel movies, but this looked like cut-and-paste done in kindergarten to some kids. I expected Mr. Crabs and Sponge-Bob to appear at the end of the fight with Chupacabra. Not to mention that all creature descriptions describe him as a small gremlin-like animal. It would be a good movie for a character similar to Leprechaun. Instead, we get a gigantic mighty creature that is shown to go with stop-action accelerated effects that are ridiculous. Chupacabra is in one place and then shuffles at the super-speed of the hall and is worth a few laughs just to see.
