I had to read I Know Why The Caged Birds Sing in my English class and after the movie we watched. After watching the movie, I regret seeing. It completely eliminated any impact the book had. The scenes in their succession didn't make sense, the acting was terrible, and the screenwriter seemed to never actually pick up the book, but instead chose the cliff notes. I was outraged by the film's end. Almost half of the book was cut out and some aspects were extremely important to Maya's growth as a person. If you read ... Caged Birds, this movie will destroy the book's experience, so I warn you not to see it.
