Let me start by never wanting to see this movie in the first place; One day I had to watch it, and I thought I thought I could brighten up and enjoy what it was, and it could prove fun. What I did with this expectation was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, no bar. There was nothing funny at first. The creators expected humor to be ridiculous / passable if they include sarcasm in each line that comes from the mouth of Underdog and uses the scene after the bland scene, played out of the aspects of "magic" viewers of the light-heart side, while still making them "ooh" ah "for more with boring action scenes and insipid, the lackluster performances that made me want to scream at everyone in the audience that enjoyed it. The acting was boring, the humor was tiring, and the characters / plot seemed to have spent about 10 minutes and created their entire personalities that gave non-inspiring actors / actresses any scope to depict their characters with minimal depth. This movie is plain and just horrible in every field and really only kids under 10 will be able to enjoy it, though that is what the age range was aimed at, it doesn't apologize for being so badly daft and causing you to feel so penitently. Parents spend their money on Up, Wall-E, The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Water Horse or Hotel for Dogs for the best, recent family / kids flicks, or even Alvin and Chipmunks is better than this dirt!
