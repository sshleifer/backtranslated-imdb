does not mean that this film is good. I was really frustrated at that on many levels. it's a kind of tip hat that bukowski. Hey, I read this guy in college - we'll see what makes him dull dillon. and I like matte dillon. I thought it was a bit like a hank, but mostly just red cheeks. But I have to take care of the character, and there wasn't much to care about. I think the time could be cruel to be Bukowski, and it bothers me a lot because writing was solid at some point after the culture counter. difficult to sit, scenes that went nowhere, and the soundtrack that made me puke. I ask very little, got less.
