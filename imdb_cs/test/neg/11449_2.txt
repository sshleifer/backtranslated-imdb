The subject was good, the direction was OK. Mohanlal was a major in his role. The side actors' behavior was at best amateur. The director and casting director should be responsible for this debacle. Hawaldar Jai was terrible, sticking out like a painful thumb with his poor history. He didn't even look like a soldier. There was a scene where satellite feeding was required from the skirmish with the militants and showed it from the camera angle. The satellite is a hundred miles in the sky, so the only angle is from above. It was a pretty embarrassing moment. These days, the audience is mature and recognizes when someone tries to pull the wave over their eyes. The director is a major, so the story could be from his personal experience. There is no problem there, but the film is just as good as its actors and director. So if Major Ravi goes to other projects, he should pay more attention to casting.
