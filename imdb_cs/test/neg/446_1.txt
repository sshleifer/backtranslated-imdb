Damage and unnecessary sequel to bonafide classics. The American werewolf in London was, undoubtedly, the jewel of the film: humorous, demented, with just a little bit of romance and so very, very British, that he made me stand up and sing God Save the Queen every time the movie was over. Then this abomination came. You know you are in real trouble when leadership is so unlikely that you like being beaten, and actually start lycanthropes. I'll tell you the truth, guys, I just got halfway through this CGIed travesty before I lost my will to live and shut it down. Absolutely pitiful and ugly waste of one's time.
