How dare you? Adam Low, without obvious shame, gives his name to this false honor. It is not even a serious study or analysis or commentary of a great Visconti work. Yes, it is long and imaginative, yes, we have some amazing clips from the movies that most people interested in this topic have already seen. But what is the longest departure the most enduring impression is gossip. The last and loudest voice comes from the third German actor, bragging and waving. Properly named Mr.Low ordered it, hoping to imagine having a better ranking than his previous, rather pointed but deadly boring documentary about Kurosawa. Well, I have news for you, Mr. Low and your cohorts. You missed a great opportunity and I for one, I won't give you another.
