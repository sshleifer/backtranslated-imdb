Talk about being boring! This was what I expected a fascinating look at the life of a man who wrote the mythical Night on the Galactic Railroad. I expected to see crazy stories and hijinky of an eccentric man and reveal his inspiration for such bizarre material. Boy, I was wrong. Spring and Chaos are usually boring with the unique moments of innovative animation. It's definitely nothing to write home about as good as NOTGR, which is something I suggest you watch. Let it bore yourself. If you absolutely MUST see then either rent it or find it somewhere cheap. Don't pay the best dollar.
