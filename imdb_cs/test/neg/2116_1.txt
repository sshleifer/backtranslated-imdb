I think this film can be called a film of misguided anger. The characters of Joe and Bob were the remnants of the Second World War generation that did not understand their children who opposed the war, used drugs and listened to Rock 'n' roll. But I think their real anger was that America began its long decline from the heights that the war left. "Joe" alone is a low-rentable Archie Bunker, who rants over all the things that make him angry, lived their lives in silent despair when he joins Compton, the man who wants revenge on the hippies who destroyed his daughter. Frankly, most of the movie looks stupid, the characters are worse than one-dimensional, they're ridiculous. Peter Boyle did better.
