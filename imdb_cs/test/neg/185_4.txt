Don't get me wrong. I really like the "genre of martial arts arenas", and I'm increasingly surprised at how many movies like this are there are there. This one is one of those, and it's not so close to being one of the best. With Mathias Hues I thought it would be good. But this movie can't save and be honest. Ignore what other people say; The fighting scenes in this movie are not good at all. I really know what I'm talking about because I've seen so many movies like this. There are also lots of scenes that have absolutely nothing to do with the chart at all. I think they added them just to keep the movie a little longer, except that it turns out to be a bad person, uuuuuuh ....... bad (as we didn't know).
