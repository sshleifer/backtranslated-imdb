All the great horror movies of the 70s, 80s, and even the early 1990s from Psycho, to Chainsaw Massacre (Original, which did not warm up over WB crap), to Silence Lambs. The characters in these films were based on the crimes of Ed Gein. Writers and directors have used a true story to inspire some of the greatest fictional film killers of all time. Old horror movies were great because even though the crimes were loosely based on the Ed Gein Case Facts, they were truly fictional and far from the true story. In the case of this film, they created a fictional horror film in which they tried to make a true story to sell a cheap, bad act, a love story between two characters that no one really cares about. In a good horror movie, these two characters would be excellent victims. End of Lecture ... <br /> <br /> In short, this film was like a mother underwear on a cold afternoon drinking a nice cup of chilled puke.
