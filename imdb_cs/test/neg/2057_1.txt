This film is probably one of the 3 worst films ever made. I rented it by accident, without reading reviews, and wow, I regret it. He really has no conspiracy, in fact he does not follow the vampire genre. Simple god terrible. Watching this movie will paint your enthusiasm for vampire movies. I felt like a writer / director / producer went on this cure for binge and had hallucinations and tried again on the film. All the time I wanted the movie to end .. but the end was even bigger. If this review can only save one person from watching this crap, I felt that my time spent on registering and writing this review was well worth it.
