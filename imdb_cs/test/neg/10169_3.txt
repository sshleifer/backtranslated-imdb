An antique-store owner in New York City, played by Joanne Whalley (Valerie Alston) gets to the American District Court jury, to rehearse the famous Mafioso Armand Asante (Rusty Pirone), and most of this very slow-paced film revolves around Pirone's attempts to induce Whalley, to rid him of murder, by threatening to kill his son and himself. There are many actions that include a horrible mob-rub that intersects with Willam Hurt. Much of this stupid, incoherent mess surrounds Hurt and Asante's obsession with Whalley, the courtroom scene we've all seen over and over, and the ending that is incredible. Apparently, this waste of time will be easy.
