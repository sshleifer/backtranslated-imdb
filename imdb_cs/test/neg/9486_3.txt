This movie was fine. Mary-Kate and Ashley play twins (sorry for being obvious), who are sent to Paris to spend a week with their rich uncle or something against their will. who looked slightly inbred) began to talk to them and be interested. Blah blah blah. It's Olsen's double film - we already know what's going to happen between them. Along with this, the twins meet the French model FABULOUS because they are in Paris, the capital of the world. They make bffs with a model and spend fun fitting shopping in the city of lights. Yeah. In the strict sense, I can't remember what happened. I think it might say something, but hey, it's Olsen's movie. "Film Olsen" seems synonymous with "light entertainment". Overall, this film was annoying. Can I really identify the two girls who are destroyed at the hearing that they are going to Paris? Really? Also jokes really were not so much fun. But I watched the whole movie. So it must have been somewhat fun. The fact that it takes place in Paris probably followed me.
