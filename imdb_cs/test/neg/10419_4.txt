"Yesterday" as a movie is hard to evaluate. The film is excellent and deserves 9/10. The story is bold and real and does not threaten. But translating the story into a screen through an actor does not match the work of the camera. As a man born and raised in Central Africa, I appreciated the authenticity of the film's appearance and honesty. view of Zulu's everyday life. But that and working with the camera is not enough to make the average viewer see this movie. It requires recognition of the true film and not just the love of films to see the purpose and power of "yesterday". Unlike the 1980 movie "The Gods Must Be Crazy", which was a comic look at one African culture that meets modern technology, "Yesterday" does not intend to appeal to any crossover audience . The film is simply not suitable for ordinary Western minds - and I doubt it was meant for the Western mind. The scenes are long and slow, editing is not stimulated for a 60 mph + world. Dialogue is not a chisel or funny, it's real. Health Crisis Films Do Not Make the Best Fun and This Movie Is Not Entertainment, It's Education. This film is best seen by people who know, appreciate and love the way of life and culture in the sub-Sarah Africa world. If you lack a broad world view to understand other cultures, especially African cultures, you should skip this film. Don't waste your time with it. Check out "Talladega Nights" or "Larry the Cable Guy" instead of seeing your culture. I give him 4 for most people who would like to see a movie, but don't have a precise knowledge of African cultures. . For viewers with a film about human experience anywhere in the world, I'd give it 7.
