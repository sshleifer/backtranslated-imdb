Minnesota's feeling is not really a road movie, but it is still the best categorization I can generate. Road film does not primarily depend on a great story, and because the storyline of this film is truly pathetic, it meets this description. To be interesting, such a film must rely solely on moving and interesting characters, and chemistry between them. Unfortunately, Feeling Minnesota employees are failing to create this excitement. <br /> <br /> Initializing the character presentation is unsatisfactory and confusing; For example, I can't see if Jjaks (Keanu Reeves) grew up in his mother's and brother's house or not. It is said that his mother (Tuesday Weld) has to live with his father, but nothing in the film suggests that it will ever happen. The same is true for other characters - I never know them. They seem to be irrational, and no real explanation is given why they do it. The bottom line is that I leave the film without any feelings for the characters, with the exception of numbness and perhaps even a little bit of attraction. Cute Cameron Diaz.
