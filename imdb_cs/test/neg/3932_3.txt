This movie wasn't that good at all. Here's the first clue, and it's not going to be a strong movie, Harrison Ford's name not only appears first, but it's also bigger than the title. The music was nominated for an Oscar, what the hell was that? This music was probably the most pleasant thing in the film. Acting was at best under the steam, except for Amisha, a boy who did a decent job of being so young. Then you have that story that was weak and a little over that place, and won for customized! The music was terrible, I know I said something, but it was really bad. The premises were really good and should be redesigned. That's all I really have. <br /> <br /> Average Movie Boy, <br /> <br /> -Trever
