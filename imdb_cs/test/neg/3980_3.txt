Like most other people, I saw this movie on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". Although it has received some well-deserved spines, it is one of the better films to be featured on this show. The assumption is better than your average Hollywood blockbuster these days; presents some interesting moral dilemmas. Although the score is sometimes disturbing, it also provides a few beautiful moments when Richard is walking by the river. Watching a movie, you can see where a lot of development development probably looked very good on paper. Richard's uncomfortable feeling in modern society is an interesting problem to think about, and the end would probably be a nice "mindfuck" in the style of the 70s if the previous issues were not so crazy. Unfortunately, the film is visibly cheap, making the mistakes even more obvious. The "clone farm" is obviously a college campus, and beer can serve as a major plot. Lena and Richard have zero chemistry - we should believe it is a meeting with related minds, but there is no brain cell between them. Schtick also "old, old couple" gets really old, really fast. There are also some mistakes that can be blamed on bad overhead choices, such as the decision to hold a climactic interview out of reach of any audio device at all. <br /> <br /> In all, noble efforts, but still best seen on MST3K.
