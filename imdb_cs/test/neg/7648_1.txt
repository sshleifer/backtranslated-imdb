In general, political messages are made on television, so if you are a big fan of environmental accuracy, watch your heart's content. Most people go to movies to have fun, not sell some poppycock political nonsense. The hook is a big name for the cast. Unfortunately, the sum of the performances is equal to the whole film, which has not gone anywhere. The two best performances, Chris Cooper and Richard Dreyfus, have minimal time on the screen. In short, "Silver City" should be avoided as entertainment. It is nothing more than a documentary, disparate political exhibit about illegal immigration, pollution and any number of other causes that do not belong anywhere else but on a canvas. - MERK
