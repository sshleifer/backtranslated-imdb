It is very sad to see someone from George C Scott in a low budget thriller that would be better if the original novel was written by Graham Greene and directed somewhat more experienced in the genre. DO NOT CHANGE BETTER CINEMATOGRAPH. There are so many missed opportunities as the scenery and carnival just overlooked, rather than captured, so that the film can be found in the exotic setting of the novel. Elsewhere in the audience comments on this site, one very stunning observer complained about various devilishly bad accents in this movie. Ever since I saw George C Scott as Rochester in Jane Eyre, I have prayed for NEVER to ever accept a role that would force him to take over the British accent. Every now and then he could just walk behind a British or a very British, sounding South African game apparently an American actor. Meryl Streep is an extremely strenuous accent (British and Australian) - I can take it, even if he asks every talk to wonder about her ability. I'm sorry that Mr. Scott is not Meryl Streep, and it just destroys the illusion - as if Michele Yeoh spoke unbearably to Mandarin with a strong Singapore accent in Crouching Tiger, etc. to CSI. Except that he is still very handsome and more or less slim in this film. He's Harrison Ford Television. Same old expressions for every emotion, every situation. Not for a second thought, Ford has two - confused / painful and happy. I've never seen a smile on Mr. CSI!
