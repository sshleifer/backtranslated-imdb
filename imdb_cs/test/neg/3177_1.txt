The event was episodic and there was no narrative thread that would link the episodes together and move the story forward. The plot conspires. With a few exceptions (eg, Graham Greene), acting was unnoticed and, at best, a pedestrian. The actors seemed to mean something other than the scene they were in. It is boring to watch a man driving a car through the semi-desert land of this movie, whether it goes bad or well. Such scenes are typical of the voltage level in the video. There was nothing on this video to block or draw the observers. I am doubly disappointed because I rented this film based on the reputation of executive producer (Redford) and the novelist of the novel (Hillerman). I noticed that the jewelry box states that funding is provided by PBS and Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as well as Carlton International. I hope this video, as well as for me and my wife, was disappointing for them not to fund other disasters coming from the same source.
