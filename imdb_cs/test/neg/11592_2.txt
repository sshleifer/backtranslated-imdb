If you are looking for a movie that is fun to watch simply because you can make jokes about not so great acting, shabby "special" effects, and the typical sci-fi plot ... then this is the movie for you! Not for acting was bad, in fact, a few actors were actually pretty decent. Special effects were not the greatest (at least); the animals looked completely computer animated. There was annoying squawking to cover up the swearing and there was only one song played again and again throughout the film. Overall, a good movie if you are looking for something totally cheesy and fun to make out of it. It's not a good movie to watch if you're looking for something serious.
