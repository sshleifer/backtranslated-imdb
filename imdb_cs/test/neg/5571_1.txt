Wow. So my friend and I went to the movie shop where we rented a movie. I like silly horror movies so I went through a whole host of horrible movies that they had to offer while he went looking for Michael Moore 'Sicko'. So I found the worst of all (as I soon discovered). It looked good on the cover and the description on the back looked decent. The fact that it was quoted by IMDb was proof that it was wrong. So the next night we put it on a DVD player and we were so incredibly confused from the first five minutes. You let you ask for a great "WTF?" The story has no coherent story - other than a vague allusion to the local murder myth, but that actually comes in the last twenty minutes. Almost in the first hour you have it: random, confusing time jumps; incoherent plot; parents who do not age; bad behavior; bad dialogue; a boy who magically changes hair color; and lots of annoying characters for you to get bored with! The movie moves so slowly it's a chore to actually sit there and watch. I'd rather honestly scrub the toilets. Don't bother with it.
