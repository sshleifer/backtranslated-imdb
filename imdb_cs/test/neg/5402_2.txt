Many people who have seen it are clearly confused. The original title "Cottonmouth Joe" would put things in a better perspective for many viewers. Personally, I have experienced a state of cotton (often accompanied by a really bad hangover after a weekend bender) and it's really a lot like the Skeleton Man movie - a dry, filthy movie that regrets the recent election and pleads for a hot shower. It is unfortunate that the choice of "Skeleton Man" for the title was completed by the distributor (probably the work of some meddling Hollywood who did nothing). not "Cottonmouth Joe." Those of us who saw the film know that the Skeleton Man is actually Cottonmouth Joe (a skeletal man's apparition, not a true Skeleton Man). The fallacy of the people who put this film on the market is unforgivable and I cannot give this movie a high rating. Imagine it: when future filmmakers come together to create a true definitive Skeleton Man movie and need a title, they will be all right and we all, as serious fans of the genre, will shrink. Cottonmouth Joe could become a horror icon next to Madman Marze, Black Claw, Mansquito, Humongous, Billy Conners, Morty's Wooden Doll, Boogen, Eegah, Moon Beast, Bloody Bill, Driller Killer Mickey Rooney, and so on, but he'll always be remembered as a sword who controls the skull, a skull with a skull on his head that is tied to the side of a skeleton he likes. That's too bad.
