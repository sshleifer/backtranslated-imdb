Junior and his dad start a new life in the new city. It's the same life, because Junior hasn't changed a bit. He is still the same rotten brat, as before before he got bigger. This time he has a friend named Trixie and is a little worse. Junior doesn't like his father, who goes on a date and spoils every opportunity he has. Then the grandfather moves and the dog comes. I thought two of them would make him a good movie, but they didn't even become friends until the end. This is a movie for the most mature people. She has diapers, farts, dog doo and toilet humor. Only someone younger than twelve would consider it super cheerful. I hope that if I have a son, he's exactly like Junior.
