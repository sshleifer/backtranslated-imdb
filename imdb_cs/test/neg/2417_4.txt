If you're not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan, here's the rundown: They're two film producers and finaers from Israel who founded the Cannon film company in the early 1980s. The only Israeli who got worse press than these two was Menachim Begin. Beginning probably deserved a bad press, but Globus and Golan were the gods who sent filmmakers because no matter how bad your script is, your movie happily finances and would normally employ directors who couldn't act directly and the actors who they could not act. In fact, you often had the impression that people would just go to Yoram and Menah to ask for some money and they would have to commit themselves without seeing the film's biography. If only producers were so confident today. Young soldiers are not a cannon movie, but Globus and Golan are financing it and have their signature. It's badly directed, mismanaged, poorly edited, but it's a scenario that jumps and attacks you with its horror. It starts with a lot of high school athletes who are involved in all sorts of jokes, in fact the first 20 minutes of the film take place as a sexual comedy and it is a shock when young soldiers become a vigilant movie. But it's not just some type of vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3 (note the link? They're both sequel and both are vigilants of Cannon movies), no siree's ridiculously bad movie vigilante about pretty high school boys athletes and their poodle on a mission to wipe out the scumbags. This film proves that Globus and Golan were giving money to people regardless of their filmmaking ability, and you have to worry about people who are apparently spending their entire vigilance reserves on the vigilant.
