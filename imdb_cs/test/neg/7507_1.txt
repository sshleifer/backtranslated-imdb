Just when you think you've seen the worst that a zombie sub-genre can offer, comes Romero and his team of non-talented friends who can show you that you were wrong. I suffered from the Zombie Bloodbath trilogy, endured Death Valley: Revenge of Bloody Bill, sat semi-comatose through The Zombie Diaries, and laughed hysterically during Zombie '90: Extreme Pestilence, and really thought the amateur film-production could drop no lower. However, when I was watching Zombie, a two-hour festering pile of drivels from writer / director George Bonilla, I think I found the best in scary zombie movies. <br /> <br /> In this terribly ambitious effort, which is part of Mad Max and part of Dawn of the Dead (but all bad), Frank Farhat plays as TK Kane, a tough fighter who digs a zombie's ass for a hobby, armed only with knives, machetes, some shocks to the shaking of the brain, and what he apparently feels to be a truly average glare. After a desperately inexorable start-up on a horde of lengthy-looking zombies, Kane team up with a group of survivors who not only have to fend off the undead attacks, but also have to reassure a group of criminals over this. areas (by searching and passing on the valuables they find). Of course, Kane is not the kind of person who takes orders from a bunch of post-apocalyptic boys in class, and it is a lesson lesson lesson (mostly by looking at them in a threatening way), just pausing to rescue zombie friends periodically. It is a terrible act of almost everybody involved, a horrible scenario, mixed effects and poor production value, there is practically nothing worth the watch in this movie. To be fair, I quite like the basic assumption that zombies are the unexpected result of a highly popular weight loss drug that blocks the desire for carbohydrates (it is learned when one character comfortably explains the story to Kane who strangely has no idea what happened), but this is probably the only vaguely interesting aspect of the entire production. <br /> <br /> I have some respect for anyone who can finance and make their own film, but when the results are this poverty is lost when they decide to make it public. If I did, I'd leave this behind.
