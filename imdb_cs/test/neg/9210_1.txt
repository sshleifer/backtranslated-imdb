Must be a 0/10 option for bilge like this. It was painful to watch, but strangely convincing everything was the same. Convincing because it seemed incredible that the movie could really suck. I thought it must be better. It was worse. And worse. How on earth people were called to produce such a categorical piece of waste that I never know. The most surprising thing is that I see all these reviews in people who really love the movie. Yes, acting was good, but the movie was very bad. Worst movie ever!
