This is a boring movie. Real villains are a clumsy adaptation (it's embarrassingly easy to say that the source material was a novel) and a rude scenario. the film is not bad at all. And the performances are largely fine, except for Phyllis Calvert, which is amazing - a miracle with regard to the potential for winsomeness, a pit that certainly won't fall. Mrs Calvert, with much less effort to continue, is as perfect as Olivia de Havilland in Gone With The Wind. The only unbearable aspect of The Man in Gray is the terribly depicted portrayal of a black boy. No matter how nice it is. He played a bad white boy in black face makeup, it is impossible to circumvent this example of condescending racism. Grim.
