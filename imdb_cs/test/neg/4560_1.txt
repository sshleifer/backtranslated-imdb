Comments on the community sound like a very interesting film that I would be deeply interested in. Unfortunately, producers did not find it appropriate to include closed captions for the hearing impaired and the deaf. This will leave me and countless others, like me, who are dependent on closed captions to watch the movie, completely off. It is inexcusable for any film produced in 2005. In a world where all kinds of disabilities and disabilities are adapted, it is angry and ironic that the still entertaining entertainment industry does not require all production and cinema to be closed captions.
