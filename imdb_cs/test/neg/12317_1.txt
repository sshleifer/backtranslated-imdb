What does he think of this country? Mike Myers looked more like Micheal Jackson. Some Chinese lady who falls asleep in 3 minutes. Poor conspiracy with dirty jokes. It's grotesque and terrible. When Green-Eggs and Ham come out in 2005, I'll be so happy! (Not) Eddie Murphy and Tracy Morgan are likely to play two hipsters trying to find the lost Green-Eggs and Ham. He's trying to chase Sam-I-Am and that means he's running away with him. (I hope they don't destroy the classic book.) Don't waste your time and money by seeing it.
