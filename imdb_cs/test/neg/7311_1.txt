This movie was bad. I believed Elton was playing in it (or it's Mike). Anyway, it was Wong who didn't have that goofy smile and looked more significant. He plays a man who is hit over his head and suffers from brain damage. He recovers and gets revenge. Gordon Liu is the only one worth seeing in this movie. But what he does little seems to do others in the pale light. Also, the film has some cheese gum hawk that dominates the Wong Guy. This film is not worth renting or buying.
