As a retired USAF MSG (Maint. Spec), this must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The fact that a teenager could get on the flight line, much less gets into f-16, is ridiculous. the army spends millions on every pilot to be the best in the world, and this film makes the Air Force and all its members stupid at best. Yes, I know it's just a movie, but it transmits the message to the younger people that we're all idiots, and believe me we're not. logistics involved in setting up any type of mission is very involved, even in the 1980s, military computers were too safe to be hacked by a teenager, and other shortcomings in this film made Peter Pan more believable. I'm sorry that this movie has no fun value at all.
