This is not a very complicated story. It's not a mystery, or a conspiracy you have to spend time watching, because you have omitted your own part of the dialogue. Claiming a movie must be seen several times to use it for several movies, but it's not one of them. These types of films are inherently simple and easy to skip, or a subtle nuance of details that you may have overlooked. It's not true with Goya's ghosts. The main drawback in this film is the absence of detail. He moves from one character to another, never giving enough substances to any scene that would allow those who follow them to participate. For this reason, you are not joining any of the characters. You don't have to get to the point where you care. Either the main actor is gone as well as the movie seems to be going to redeem itself, or their actions are despicable and you are not inclined as well. A good example is Goya's refusal to go very far to help Ines. His refusal to commit further reflects the overall tone of his part. The only characters you can feel at the moment are Ines when asked and then tortured. After her rape by Lorenzo, any focus on her character is almost gone. Following, only the other in depth involvement comes from the best scenes in the film centered around Lorenzo's invitation to dinner with Ines family, and her fathers all try to get Lorenzo to sign a false confession and get his daughter back. Then when things start to evolve, they're gone from the movie. I read a lot of comments about how the film didn't know what it wanted to be, etc. I found out that basically he couldn't make it out of anything. From Lorenzo's return and the accidental viewing of Ines's daughter Goya, everything seemed more than fancy. Without a great story, no attempt was made to truly explore the turbulent times in which they lived. The essence of who was Goya did not materialize, other than his actions, or his lack, which shows that he is more focused than anything else. As far as his art was concerned, the film seemed to be focused on exploring several of the paintings he had made, but again crushed another opportunity to explore the responses to that work rather than the work itself. To sum up, the film had no coherence, a material that could be immersed in the historical environment it covered was absent, and when you ended up feeling like what you just saw was a series of interrupted viewer engagement attempts . switching from one thing to the next without the viewer getting involved. You can't watch something like this a few times and expect to improve with the added test. It's just not enough to lose time. This is not the case when you lose something, it would only prove that the ingredients needed to make this film good are not. As for the best movie ever? It's not even the best movie I've watched today.
