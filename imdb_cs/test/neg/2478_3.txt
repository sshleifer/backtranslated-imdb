1) If you want to make a movie that deals with social realism, it is very important that the audience identify with the characters that are being portrayed. 2) The audience cannot identify with characters that are highly stereotyped or with obvious situations. 3) If you have a bad actor, then you can't build any character. In any case, even if you have nice actors, their work will be ridiculous if you force them to talk to a fictitious Andalusian accent. Jes√∫s Ponce ignores these 3 points and also makes some cheap jokes that are completely out of place. His screenplay is so predictable: a woman comes out of jail, meets her old comedian friend, life is tough, etc. Whatever it is, the original wouldn't be so bad if only Ponce wasn't a complete incompetent writing and filming. I wonder how long they'll keep putting our taxes on movies like this. <br /> <br /> * My rate: 3/10
