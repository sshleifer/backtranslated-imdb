In my opinion, a good document - especially one that deals with controversial political issues - should be informative and as clear as possible. The aim should be to uncover the truth. In particular, there are experts on the subject and representatives of all parties among the interviewees. This film is a failure in this regard. Most of the interviews in this film consist of "street men" who deal with the question of peace in the Holy Land. The wall itself, the supposed subject of the film, has no serious treatment. For most interviews, the interviewer simply waits for them to approach and asks general questions like "what do you think about the wall?" - Do not approach random people by the wall and ask them how they directly touch them. In addition to one interviewed Israeli general who is in charge of wall construction, we have no "experts" on the subject to provide us with the wall context (eg, how and when the project started, whether it was successful, which groups are for participants ). and against the project, etc.) In addition to the interviews, a very large part of the film consists of widespread shots of erratic scenes such as wall shots, building constructions. walls and people stand out from the bus. These shots take up too much time, in my opinion. It's nice to see what the wall looks like, but 20-30 minutes of head-on wall shooting (and just walls) are excessive. Obviously, these shots (accompanied by Arabic music that expresses sadness) are only included in order to arouse the viewers' feelings of hatred towards the wall.
