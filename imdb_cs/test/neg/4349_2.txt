Me and my brother are very big Asian movie fans, so when I hid this movie in the store I bought it on DVD because it sounded very hopeful and I couldn't wait to look at it. So I watched this movie with my brother and I must say that at the beginning it was very promising. On the first scene we both really loved this brutal ball game. But I think it was all. There are some interesting fights, but it is not an action movie as it claims to be. Instead, it is a film about love ... with a clich√© of love that has played so much at the top, even Shakespeare vomits on this title. I'm sorry for my language. By the way: Characters behave like picking up the street and got 100? for playing in this movie. Well, my brother and I followed it to the end because we thought it might be better. But, hell, he never did. This movie attacked instead of # 1 on my and my brothers "worst movies ever seen" -list, just followed by "Fantasy Mission Strength" - don't look at it either.
