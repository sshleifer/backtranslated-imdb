To date, it's still the worst piece of waste I've ever seen. Even so angry I even complained about the blockbuster for storing it. I and some friends rented it after we looked at the back cover and thought we had a good horror movie. The plot line changes during the film, and there were plenty of irrelevant padding. The movie ended quite suddenly, I guess they got the movie. The sound quality was terrible, and the first female character had a very strong Spanish accent, even though she was utterly absurd. The guy gave a short piece of eye-catching until his bizarre attempts at murder were done. After wasting all the time going into an in-depth discussion of the workshop and his many power tools, he decides to put a plastic bag over his head. All in all, thoughts, I think you have to watch this movie to really believe it exists.
