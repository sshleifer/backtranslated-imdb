How bad? Compared to this film, the cannibal Holocaust is Citizen Kane. There is agile action, a cruel dialogue, a half-baked piece of land, and, as a piece of his accompanying work, too much on the way to killing animals on the screen that was actually done. Unlike the Holocaust, Ferox is a straightforward film. He doesn't pretend to be a pseudo document. In some respects, this helps produce the fact that the film is very sharp and sharp compared to the Holocaust grain. Unfortunately, we have a group of people who are morally reprehensible. They tortured the natives and basically bring everything to themselves. There's nothing worth it in this movie. I was quite benevolent with my holocaust review because of some real attempt at declaration and style, but in Ferox's case there is no reason to look at it unless you are only acting on blood and gore.
