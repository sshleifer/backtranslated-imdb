If you are looking for an accurate representation of Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara, who helped Fidel Castro in his quest for power, read the history of Cuban history or even write your name in the search engine. Internet, after all. <br /> <br /> But whatever you do, DO NOT "CHE!" <br /> <br /> If you don't just want a good laugh, of course. <br /> <br /> All reviewers of the time (and viewers) gave "Che!" their voice for the worst movie of the decade. And no wonder; Have you seen this travesty? Her facts are, at best, unclear, Sharif is even unconvincing as a corpse, and as in the case of Fidel Catsra's imitation of Palance .... As I said, if you want a good laugh. It's like watching a co-production between the Learning Channel and Mad Magazine. <br /> <br /> One star. I wonder if Palance can do W. C. Fields, too?
