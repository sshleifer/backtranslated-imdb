Review: Angels and Demons <br /> <br /> Ron Howard directed the film. He also made famous films like Da Vinci Code and Cinderella Men. He also directed the famous TV series 24. The most famous actors are Tom Hanks (Da Vinci Code, Green Mile, Forrest Gump, ??) and Ewan McGregor (The Dream of Cassandra, Moulin Rouge, Star Wars: Phantom Threat, ??). At the beginning I was shocked because they changed the beginning of a movie so big. Because they changed father Vittoria Vettra (Ayelet Zurer) in someone else, Silvano Bentivoglio (Camren Argenziano). Another change is that Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks) never goes to CERN. It was nice to be able to film on the spot at CERN. Then the movie goes on, it's a grand car race in Rome. I also like the Chirstian Archives section when it destroys Galileo, it was funny. It was also funny that when they were locked in the archives for the second time when they got inside, Robert Langdon destroyed half of the archives, and when they went out, electricity went on. I found it very stupid that Robert Langdon did not go in a helicopter, but that Camerlengo (Ewan McGregor) enters alone, another detail is that Camerlengo is the adopted son of the Pope. In the book He is the true Son of the Pope. <br /> <br /> When I should give the best performance, I should say Pierfrancesco Favino, who plays Inspector Olivetti. The worst of the actors was the killer played by Nikolai Lie Kaas, I think he was underestimated because Faboulous was playing at Adams Apples. I think the whole movie is underestimated because director Ron Howard has made some stupid changes. I would rate the movie by 4/10.
