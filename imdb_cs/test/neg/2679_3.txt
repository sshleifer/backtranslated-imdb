A man, 90 years old, was really a terrible decade for movies. Films are lacking in good style and often lacking narration. This 6th entry into the long running Halloween series is certainly bad. You will never really get into the story because it is not a very well designed and built movie. convincing characters that are in it. Dr. Loomis seems to be in him just to be there. It's really a pity that it must have been Donald Pleasence's last film role. It's nice and also appropriate that his last role is in Halloween, but he definitely deserves to be better. Michael Myers just never comes across as menacing or frightening. Maybe it's because he appeared too prominently in the film, from the beginning. He does his usual things again, but without too much class or originality. Also, attempts to reveal Myer's past do not really work, because it is simply not well explained. Obviously, the script passed through various re-writes before and also very likely during filming. Several scenes even re-shot or added after the first cut turned out to be far from pleasure. <br /> <br /> The movie looks and looks more like a TV more often. This is also due to the lack of any true good gore. In fact, as a horror film, it basically lacks everything to make it good or even original to look at. 10
