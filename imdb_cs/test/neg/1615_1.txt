Regards; I never thought I'd see a day when I was so disgusted with the film that it would be a burden to finish ... I was always a horror fan, B 'Including C and C. But in this case It's hard to describe how a movie couldn't qualify for some letters on this scale ... <br /> <br /> The film focuses on a poorly developed back story, a mixture of folklore with poetic taste. And in addition, the performance of the actors is questionable. Horror B movies usually fall into two categories ... 1) The jewel that was under the spectacle, and under the funding 2) So bad that it's funny, laughter or your money back. Well, this movie falls between. I wasn't scared, I wasn't laughing ... So I think if you really need to see it, you can, but I suggest you ...
