It is a typical college comedy and its average. The story is fine, but not too fun. It is an unfortunate guy named Reno who loses his job, tears the car and then his uncle dies in the lane. His girlfriend (but nice btw. :-). But this uncle gives him his LA seat and the Mercedes as a heritage, and soon Reno and his girlfriends move to LA to this new house. The problem is that they need a roommate to pay a high rent for this house, so the movie is developing ... <br /> <br /> The movie starts OK and has some funny jokes, but here and there the movie turns straight down to hell ... The end is BAD. Really bad. It destroys everything about the film. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see a movie ... <br /> <br /> 2/10
