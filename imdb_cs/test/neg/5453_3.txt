I've never figured out what attracts Karen Black. She always had those lush eyes and a strange strange look at her. He often seemed eccentric or occupied as a "different" woman. In this, a psychological counselor and expert on the occult slanderous producer of bad ads is learning astral screening. He's an average fool, even without new luggage. It seems to be the way to immortality, because if you get it well, you can inhabit the bodies of future generations. I believe Star Trek had such a story with Jack Ripper for several centuries. This guy is really dangerous. She has a nice family and makes them unhappy. He begins to murder friends, just because they have a harsh comment on them or they don't like them. You can see the end coming from the back row in the left field. It's a very rough, humorous movie. Most of them must be considered right. Why are some called, but few chosen? I found it long and not very satisfying.
