The mummy's curse is the latest in the Kharis mummy movie series, and creativity seems to have run a bit dry at the time this one. Kharis and his friend Ananka both end up in Louisiana Bay and search his resurrection for his beloved princess. As it ends up in Louisiana is not entirely clear, but with different people trying to find, the viewer can be sure of some murder mummies. The mummy curse was traceable, but it really wasn't anything special. I had the feeling in the whole movie I saw before. Frankly, in addition to the original Mummy with Boris Karloff, mummy movies are not my favorite among the old universal horrors. They're not bad, but they get a little repetitive. There are some great scenes in the movie (for example, Ananka's swamp scene), but overall, it wasn't much for me to do. It's worth seeing if you want to be complete and see all the mummy movies, but otherwise you want to pass this.
