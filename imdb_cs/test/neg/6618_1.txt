Why wasn't the Best Picture of 1998 voted? It must be the best movie ever. It makes something like Citzen Kane look like totally stupid, come on, Citzen Kane wasn't even in color! I love this movie, it must be the best movie I've ever given. I'm still shocked he wasn't nominated for NIC !! <br /> <br /> If 10 is the highest you can give it, I give it 20!
