I just read an extra long review on the cover of this movie on this site and he explained in full detail that this movie is worth watching in the TV show "Mystery Science Theater 3000 !!!!!" And yes, I find this advice really useful! I think the movie that is trying to be so good and exciting isn't really what the movie wants to be !!!!! So yes, watch this movie as seen in this show, and instead of having one star of ten stars, you can give it ten out of ten stars! In the meantime, my star review is for a real, clean, untouched version of this movie only !!!!!! Now?
