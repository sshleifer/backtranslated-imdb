I'm a Boorman fan, but that's probably his least successful movie. Comedy has never been his strong suit, and here his attempts at a scarlet farce are awkwardly done. Yet, for Boorman, it is hard to see that it is one of Uma Thurman's first roles, and as always, to praise. (On a sad side note, Boorman wrote a screenplay with his daughter, Telsche, who died a few years ago.)
