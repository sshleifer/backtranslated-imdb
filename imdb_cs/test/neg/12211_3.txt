This film was so frustrating. Everything seemed energetic and I was absolutely ready to have fun. At least I thought I could do it. But I was wrong. First, a strange loop? It was like watching "The funniest home videos in America". Damn parents. I hated them so much. Stereo Typical Latino Family? I have to talk to the person responsible for it. We need to talk. The little girl who always hung on someone? I just hated her and I had to mention it. I must say that the final scene goes beyond. It's so beautifully bad and full of wickedness that it's his own movie. What a lousy dance. Terrible and beautiful at once.
