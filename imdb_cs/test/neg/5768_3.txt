The plot is a ticking off claim jumper made a deal with the devil to find gold, and is forced to protect him forever. A bunch of friends will find gold and will talk to an old miner and they are forced to blow gold smithereens to send him back to hell. I mean seriously ... how did this movie NOT win an Oscar for the film of the year? What is a compelling story older than 20 years running out of the jumper right out of the 1800's. I love how you can't kill a monster in other movies, but they can knock it down ... this movie that writes a monster as totally indestructible. The launch of the movie clearly tears the nightmare of Elm Street Part 4, but what the hell, not like the movie was the classic 5 stars. Highlighting the movie is when we are introduced to a girl who has never been to school, has never been outside the city, never learned to read or write yet ... yet she speaks perfect English, smoking is hot and wears the latest fashion . What's missing Oscar? OK I'm done with bad jokes, this movie is pure crap and I just watch if u has anything better to do and all the spices on the basket are already in alphabetical order. /> <br /> 2 of 10
