Hey, remember when Hal Hartley was great? What time it was. I'd say the book of life was when things started to roll down the hill, but I said at least that was going uphill. A film that looks like being shot on someone's cell phone might not be a bad thing if it has an interesting story and dialogue, but unfortunately, it is missing, along with Hartley's substitute, unpredictable dialogue. In their place is a boring exposition on the Christian end of time and trite the story of modern Jesus in a quarrel, wrapped in a modern modern world where everyone looks like someone from Hal Hartley. Even if it rises a little in the second half, it's never pleasant or particularly reasonable. What the hell happened to you, Hartley?
