I originally wrote what is a sarcastic, scary review of this poor piece of dung, but every time I made a review, I got "this contains a very long word that is not allowed", and words that were not misspelled were considered incorrect. Now a word that has been judged too long has never been identified. After numerous attempts to remove words, I finally got an irritated suspicion that the IMDb pages were politically sensitive and would automatically reject certain words. Nothing I wrote was obscene or racist in itself. But after removing all the longest words the same message was repeated over and over again, also words that were not mistaken were suddenly considered erroneously! The PC police are everywhere.
