The best thing about this movie for me was that Bryan Dick played Rafe and made me a -melt-. Rafe and all his splendor made the film a fitting one, though I tried to get up and scream. I've never seen a warmer man. But that's no reason. <br /> <br /> Name? This is really what it is. They took a beautiful story written by Annette Curtis Klaus and fired him. I will, in all my anal retention fame, point out what is missing, what has changed, and everything else wrong with the film. Apparently RAFE is the son of ASTRID and GABRIEL, and the ULF does not seem to be a ASTRID child anymore, as in the book. And as I remember from the book, RAFE and ASTRID were LOVERS. <br /> <br /> -ASTRID is probably BLOND, unlike the remarkably RED HAIR described in the book. I believe the book says it looked more like FOX than WOLF. The film also shows that ASTRID is an aunt of VIVIANA. <br /> <br /> -YOU A AXEL GO? She is 16. In her book she was 16. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN and AIDEN meet at a college they both attend in a book. VIVIAN goes to see AIDEN due to his poem 'Wolf Change'. But according to the film, AIDEN defeated his father, escaped and now lives in Romania and draws Graphic Novels. That brought me to what F ** K. <br /> <br /> - There's no Kelly in the movie. WHERE KELLY WAS IN FILM. But KELLY hated VIVIAN in the book. And she also dated AIDEN after they broke up. Even in the book, Vivian gets drunk and scratched in the room. <br /> <br /> -GABRIEL has a strong resemblance to the Columbian Drug Lord in the film. And something like sounds. His performance was very good, but his performance threw me away. <br /> <br /> -VIVIAN had no parents in the movie. Her father and mother and two other siblings died in the film. Yet in the book, when she returns home one night, Mother, ESME sits on the couch after fighting ASTRID over GABRIEL. A VIVIAN has no siblings. Only her father died in the book. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN accepts VIVAN for what he is. That really got me. He kills the RAFE in a haunted church, confronts VIVIAN and saves him from other wolves, except AIDEN shoots her, so they go to find a cure and then try to leave the city together. WTF ?! In the book, AIDEN gets angry when she turns into a wolf and cries like a chick, throws things at her, and so panics and jumps out the window. Then she devises a story that she tried to break with her and threw her chair out the window. That doesn't seem acceptable to me. <br /> <br /> -AIDEN wants her to run away with him. She doesn't want to have anything to do with Vivan after she turns to him. And she doesn't even hold her face with love and does not say she can control her. She is crying like a woman because she is OUR. And the last indignation ... the one who almost gave my three best friends and I HEART ATTACKS IN OUR SEATS: <br /> <br /> - In the movie, AIDEN and VIVIAN run and VIVAN killed GABRIEL. Just like in it STOTS. GABRIEL is dying. Not only does VIVIAN kill GABRIEL in * BOOK *, but I believe END UP TOGETHER. As she does not end up with AIDEN, she ends up with GABRIEL. What kind of hell is that? Such little things have been noticed: Ulf's red hair, which he received from Astrid, was turned into brown in the film and Vivian worked in a chocolate shop. Terrible shock; I am ashamed. The book wasn't really hard to follow. If Disney can use a random H! School, why wouldn't the director find a H! sigh * I was really looking forward to this movie, I loved the book, it's sad that it didn't work a bit. I give it 2, just because (as the top of this review) Rafe (played by Bryan Dick) was dead sexy and Agnes Bruckner did a great job. And, they held a Steppenwolf poem <br /> <br /> With love, <br /> <br /> Caitlin
