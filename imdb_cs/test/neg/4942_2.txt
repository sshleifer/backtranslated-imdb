In order for the thriller to cause fear, tension or emotion, the story must be believable. There is nothing credible or realistic about this film. The protagonists have several opportunities to escape or turn tables, but each time it succeeds. The antagonists, who supposedly plan and modify their shuttle specifically for traps, have left a lot of improvisational weapons. There is actually one scene where the "smart" girl has a gun to the head of the main evil guy and decides to scold him instead of pressing the trigger. It was a thoroughly predictable "thriller". Each character was one-dimensional. "Victims" were the usual expressionless sheep that deserved to be defeated. Is anyone on this planet able to write an intelligent thriller?
