Terrible adaptation of Heminway's low key love story. An American soldier (Rock Hudson) falls in love with a British nurse (Jennifer Jones) in Italy during World War I. Practically everything. Hudson's here from his depth. It could be a good actor, but not in this movie. Jones is too old for her role (she is 21 in the book - here's 38 ... and it looks!). Also, her actions quivered between exaggerated and imperfect! They took a simple low-key love story and blew it all out of measure. The film is deadly long (just over 150 minutes), confident and padded to a ridiculous degree. It seems producer David O. Selznick thought he was doing "Gone With the Wind". Some scenes are really stunning (even on a small TV screen), but there is not enough story to match the pictures. <br /> SPOILER !!! The end where Jones is dying is supposed to be tragic, but bad theatrics and theatrics have forced me to fight so I can't be! To make matters worse, actor Vittorio De Sica is truly embarrassing. Burnt, confident, poorly occupied and slow. Pretty terrible. This was (understandably) a financial and critical bomb and ended Selznick's career as a producer. You may want to tune in to some of the scenery at the end, but it's really not worth it. I give it 3.
