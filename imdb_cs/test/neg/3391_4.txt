Some of the biggest and most popular horror movies have a bad sense of humor, but when the movie comes, it's not as original as a "classic", but it's just to be laughing, then a bunch face to face with the critics. This movie has made me laugh several times, that is a proof of how this film has been addressed and shown. These two main clues look natural and believable together and this really helps this film. Rooted for them all the way and laughing with them, everyone has friends like these two guys. Another highlight for me was the monster truck, it's amazing, intimidating and really well shot. Taking inspiration (totally theft) from a number of movies, the most visible is Duel, Jeepers Creepers and probably referring to Jack Black, co-star of Orange County. But you can really choose any trip to the wrong movie and find a link here. But what, it's not trying to win any Oscars just to give the viewer a good dose of frights and laughter and to score it it's 10! Obviously, this is not getting 10, I give real reasonable reviews and scores as opposed to 99% of people on IMDb. There is no way this movie can get zero, as many lazy idiots give too many movies and how fun as it was that they don't get 10 either. It's just a good fun movie for anyone who has a sense of humor and fondness for terror. You can't really be so simple anymore.
