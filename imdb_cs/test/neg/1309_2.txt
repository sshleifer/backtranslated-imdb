Incorrect, poorly managed and ominously written, this is observable if you have an hour or two to kill or suffer insomnia, but just. Robert Carlyle is fully aware of his potential as an actor of highest mediocrity with a single expression on his repertoire (that is, the chronically constipated football hooligan treating the crippling inferiority complex). oblique yellow teeth (this suggests anger, tenderness, sadness, surprise, horror, cheerfulness, compassion, etc.) In his role as "best naval engineer in the UK" and a university professor's son, he is as convincing as my neighbor's cat. Tom Courtenay, just as bad, miserable and thoughtless every line, seems to be permanently attached to the eyeball and seems unable to tell the flood of his own urine puddle if he stood there. All in all, another stupid attempt on the part of the British to emulate the Hollywood pith in the most rubbish. Dialogue is a series of poorly issued clich√©s; the action is discontinuous; the land is absurd and amputated; and characters, if you can call them, will not even get into the basic two-dimensional sphere of their American counterparts.
