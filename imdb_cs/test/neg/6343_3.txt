I know these types of movies sell tickets and make profits for filmmakers, but it just won't do it like a movie about Vietnam. Vietnam was filled with horrors for men who lived day after day. This movie stars Gene Hackman, who is a Korean war veterinarian for training a rag-tag Vietnam veterinarian to return to this country to rescue a group of US prisoners of war in the camp. These men include a former tunnel rat, a crazy acidic drop of a sailor, a blond tanned surfer from California and a few inexperienced boys (Patrick Swayze) who are doing so that there was a dad who was killed in Nam. They train first in some Texas camp and once in Nam are found and lose all their weapons. They are able to find replacement weapons and continue on their way to the liberation of captured men. Most men are found and rescued, but a group of rags is mostly destroyed. This movie was played as a video game in which you could figure out what happens next, and who would pop from behind what bush, and who will die and who will live. Vietnam, which I guess, wasn't like a video game.
