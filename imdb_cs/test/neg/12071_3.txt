Woody Allen (I must admit I was never a big fan at the beginning) directed this quasi-documentary about the life of Emmett Ray (Sean Penn), a 1930s jazz guitarist whose star seemed to shine for a while, then faded out. Penn does a credible job in this role, depicting a complicated and somewhat neurotic person (not unlike Allen himself, who might explain why Woody would be attracted to this project) who can't maintain relationships and whose dual passion (except playing guitar) ) shooting the rats at the dump and watching the trains. The story is not very consistent. It is narrated in some sense by a series of modern jazz "experts" (one of whom is Allen himself) who relate to their various theories and interpretations of the various events in Ray's life. The end result is a wildly inconsistent account of the life of a fictional man who seems to have been given a fairly interesting life story by his creators, who probably had to do a better job with it. Jazz fans and Woody Allen fans will probably enjoy it. What concerns me? The best thing I can give is 3/10.
