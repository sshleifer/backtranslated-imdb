As a child of the eighties, as many other reviewers I hated the original V and V: The Last Battle. I own VHS, so I never plug in a VCR to watch them. I remember not liking this short-lived series, but I couldn't remember why I rented the first disc. In the third episode, I recovered my memory. It's scary. Writing is out of horror. It's not even fun. They had a lot of material they could work with, but they just didn't seem to know what to do and turned them into "Days of our lives with aliens". How cold and full of potential is the concept of Elizabeth Starchild? All they could think of is that they grow into a lush, boring teenager who will compete with her romantically mother? Marc Singer looked less embarrassed than being in Beastmaster II than when he was imprisoned in this drive .... the point is whether you are one of the younger people who have just discovered V or one of our older sci-fi fans looking to rediscover some old fun, save yourself and SKIP THIS!
