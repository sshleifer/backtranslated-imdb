This gawd-terrible piece of dragon is everywhere. The script is bad, the plot is bad, the deal is wrong. There are a few decent actors (eg Charles Durning), but the director didn't get anything from them. The plot line has Santa, feels depressed and thinks no one needs him, takes a little girl across the country to try to get her father back with her mother. It includes a con-man in a Santa suit with a full parrot on his shoulder (played by "Isaac" from Love Ship), the world's largest elf (played by Bruce Vilnach - a very funny man, but no actor). a stiff factory owner who works with his employees overtime on Christmas Eve, and a sleigh race where someone cuts one of Santa's skis trying to win. If the conspiracy sounds bad, it is worse on a small screen. If you see this movie coming next, run, don't go to the TV and unplug it. You may want to cook the TV to remove the remaining infection. If you happen to be watching for more than 10 minutes, you may need to burn your TV and let the cable company install completely new lines.
