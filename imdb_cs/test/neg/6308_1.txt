I must say that I was surprised to find some positive comments on this turkey (in desperate need for a feather transplant)! I give it 1, because I think the idea of ​​the wild man movie rock'n'roll - Jerry Lee Lewis, is honest, but it's a shame to release such a waste and "killer" won't do you deserve it! It's good that he came late in his career ... they said that Elvis practically destroyed his career movies he released in the sixties, and it could do the same for Jerry Lee if it came out about 15-20 years earlier! It's based on Myra Gail Lewis's book and it's a shame to start. It's a bad and inaccurate story of her life, along with Lewis, and there are far better books about Killer that could make a much better and more interesting scenario. Add to it a lot of actors who don't know if they are involved in drama, comedy or a bit of both! Otherwise, the fine actor Dennis Quaid builds on what must be one of the actor's worst performances in many months! He walks in the picture, talks about his "god given talent", and as a viewer he wants to show something on the screen! Silly gestures and funny faces, and Jerry Lee had to feel betrayed when he saw what had happened to him in this really horrible movie! The rest of the crew is almost as bad ... except Winony Ryder, who does the best with the miserable lines that are given to her. It's "Grease" and again, and whenever Jerry Lee goes to Memphis in his convertible, he has a car radio, the whole city dancing to it! Everyone in this movie is like a cartoon character of the real people involved in it ... from wild man to Sun Records Sam Philips! And it's a damn shame! A charismatic and interesting artist like Jerry Lee Lewis deserves better and I hope he took the $ 500,000 he got from the store and told the company to go together ... twice!
