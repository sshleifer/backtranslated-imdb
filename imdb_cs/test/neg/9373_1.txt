Brands in this movie, such as Suit Supply, are taking away the story because it should be set in the 1980s. It's not a very exciting movie. Also, the Intwine single on the soundtrack is very bad, my choir, which repeats many times, as "I'm a cruel man, I'm taking it all away, I'm a cruel man, I'm here, staying .." ? I think they wrote it in a few minutes .. <br /> <br /> It's really annoying, as well as product placement in this movie product that pays off for the controversy and publicity around a criminal who shouldn't be a celebrity just like him He is now to be, but he should be forgotten, as rats should be.
