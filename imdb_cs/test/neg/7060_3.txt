I like many Myrna Loy movies. This film was created before the actors' personality was developed. It would be fine short film, but it seems to go forever in its complete form. It seems that Myrna Loy says what to do with her actions and does her job. That's all you can say about it. Her gypsy character is delicate and the film has many shortcomings, such as the jewelry scene. This movie is likely to be interesting for Myrna Loy fans, but it's still a disappointment.
