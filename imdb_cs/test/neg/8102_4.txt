That was a strange movie. A bit of a horror movie and definitely a film noir. Some fifth colonists meet and mysteriously begin to die with a Japanese dagger in hand after Monsieur Colomb (Bela Lugosi) appears. Soon the Lone Ranger will appear in the FBI agent Richard "Dick" Martin (Clayton Moore). Martin is ineffective in finding a killer because he is more interested in the niece (Joan Barclay) of the missing doctor who is part of the gang. After the last person dies, and the doctor is terribly disfigured by some strange serum, the true story of the group comes out and that's where it gets interesting and strange. I'm not gonna spill it. Lugosi was amazing as a skulking killer.
