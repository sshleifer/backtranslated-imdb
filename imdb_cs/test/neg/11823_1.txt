This must be one of the absolutely worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Writing and playing are just pathetic. With Uncle Sam, he ranks to the worst movies he has ever made. However, when I see crap as possible to make this video, it really inspires me to watch my wild dreams about filming movies because I know I could do a better job than what the makers of Killers did.
