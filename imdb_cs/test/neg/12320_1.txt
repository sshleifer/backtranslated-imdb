Inappropriate. The PG rating that this movie gets is yet another huge misstep of the MPAA. Whale Rider gets PG-13, but this movie gets PG? Please. Parents are not fooled, with a primary school kid making this movie a huge mistake. It has been many times that I was uncomfortable not only because humor was inappropriate for children, but also because it was totally out of the sky and useless. But all this, Cat in the Hat is still a horrible movie. Casting and the overall appearance of the film are the only saving graces. Beautiful Kelly Preston and always likeable (or hateful) in this case Alec Baldwin are both good at their roles, though Preston is almost too beautiful for such a role. Children are conditioned by actors and this shows, especially with Dakota Fanning. Fanning is the only human aspect of the film that has been watching me and not throwing things on the screen. Did I mention that the talking cat was too big in this movie? Mike Myers is absolutely pitiful. I didn't like Shrek's voice, and now I believe Myers should not be allowed near the children's film empire. His view of The Cat is a slightly tinted version of Fat Bastard and Austin Powers. Finally, the cat was not supposed to come, he should stay away, but he came, though only for one day he destroyed 82 minutes of my life, 82 minutes of personal anger and strife. The cat in the hat can be the worst movie for kids.
