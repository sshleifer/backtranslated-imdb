Review: Nunsploitation Movies. They're forever. A few of the pop's in mind are the Mexican devil worshiping the film Alucard, the Night of Demons 2, the Monastery and of course Dante Tomasellis desecration. You can't blame someone for trying to exploit a religious / holy image and rotate it to frighten it. If done correctly, it works. Here comes the latest addition to the nunsploitation sub-genre simply called The Nun. The story is about this group of girls living in a Catholic school. In this school there is a nun who is particularly cruel to one of the girls. Girls in self-defense against a shameful nun kill her by mistake and then decide to bury her and not tell anyone. Fast forward 18 years later and a nun is back looking for revenge from those who killed her. This film was made by Brian Yuznas Fantastic Factory. You know, the company that makes horror movies in Spain. Need a reminder of the kind of movies that this company spews? Here's a small reminder: Arachnid, Darkness, Romasanta: Werewolf Hunting, Rottweiler. You'll get a picture. The only really good movie this company produced (in my opinion) was Stuart Gordons Dagon. And it is done. No, wait, I believe they also made an excellent chair by Christian Bale The Machinist. But that's it. So when I consciously rented this movie, I knew I wouldn't watch anything that was false good. Still, with all the psychic preparations I was disappointed. <br /> <br /> One of the best things this movie has is its slick look. The film has nice cinematography. It doesn't look like a cheap horror movie. The special effects of the films were fine because the nun could travel the water. Well, that was the picture that gave him himself for some cool fx moments that sometimes scratched the shabby territory, but sometimes they were cool enough to watch. I dug the scene when Nun plunged into people like a bucket of water. It's not a particularly deadly move, but it was for a cool visual. There's a blow, but not much. One particular scene included lift death was fine, but unfortunately the film hit its peak with this scene. And it was only half way through. After that, nothing really cool happens and the movie deceives into incredible borefest. The film is just going to turn into a Nun popping up every now and then give us a fear of fear, it would kill someone and then CUT! We go back to the bull-talking characters, walk through the rooms, open the door, get the drill. And I personally hate him when he turns horror into it. People opening doors and going to the rooms. Boring! And when the characters talk about their horrible dialogue. In one particularly stupid scene, the character decides directly from the blue that the nun goes into flesh and blood whenever he is in the water, so it's a way to go and try to kill her. And everyone just says OK! And they all work out this plan to kill the nun in the water tank. Who gave this guy this information and why others simply took it for granted? Who the hell knows, but his scenes that make the film look stupid. And one more thing that got into my way of enjoying this movie was the fact that they used Spanish actors who have a very strong accent. When trying to speak English, it is very difficult to tell what the hell is trying to say. Id prefer to have dubbed then try and find out what they say and become frustrated. The fact that this DVD has no English subtitles has not even helped. So, in the end, it's a movie that has some neat visual appearance, nice sound effects, but a terrible horrible scenario. I think it only shows that you can have the biggest budget or the best special effects, but if your movie has a bad script with horrible characters and situations your audience can't connect to, then you still have a bad movie. That was the case with NUN. <br /> <br /> If you want to have some real fun with the evil sisters, rent one of the movies I mentioned at the beginning of this review. Now, just like the creators of this film, they should go tell hail marie and light fifty candles into their saint's election to see if they will be forgiven for making this sinfully frightening movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 2 of 5.
