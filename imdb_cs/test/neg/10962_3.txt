This film was terrible, especially with regard to the work that had to go into its production. Although not as bad as Ax 'Em, it's pretty horrible. Take into account the apparent rip-off of Gladiator and Raiders from the lost ark, and what do you get? This smorgasbord terrible makeup and wooden playing. The movie begins as most zombie movies today. Montage of interesting jumps and radio broadcast outbreak at hand. We see our hero (Ryna, perhaps the worst "zombie hunter" in modern times, counting about four or five times, where he either scratched the gun's barrel head or looked down at the barrel while it blew). . You will later learn that these fingers are collected for rewards. Well, Ryn seems to be a rebel in his zombie release methods; go so far as to buy a chum * gasping from his French friend Hans (who is not really French, talking to a strange Middle East accent). As Ryn uses a friend to collect a rich reward from Lost Hills, all hell is released. And frighten the horror of the movie. Zombies are assembled quite badly. I saw the comments praising their makeup, but it was pretty amateur in my opinion. Apparent Halloween glue was used on the zombie's faces, and there were points where one girl looked like she was wearing a clown mask instead of a freshly peeled face. Oy Vey. To sum up the next sixty minutes in a few lines: Ryn is back stabbed by Hans (who has agreed with some other zombie hunters, Blythe's leader), gives him a second chance, gets back stabbed again Hans, then shoots Hans and gets to Union City where he finds Blythe's city poisoning for profit. This is really a conspiracy. When Ryn reaches Union City, all the baddies are gathered in a house that is obviously so massive that it takes hours for Ryan. People die, Ryn lives and the film ends with one of those cynical "wants to kill?" <br /> <br /> * END SPOILERS * I will have to blame most of this mess on Nott. The direction was terrible. Each character featured a cloud than Hans, who was easily the best 'actor' in this band MacBeth refuses. When they reach Union City, a bunch of zombies attack the crew, and the zombies obviously have no tips or ideas on how to walk, as if your pendants were rotten. One woman swaying, as if swimming in the air for a Sunday walk. Some movies are terrible. This film is just one of them just because logic seemed to be abandoned to make the story flow. It works occasionally, but in this respect (where the story was already in ruins), it doesn't. <br /> <br /> Avoid if you don't want a decent laugh.
