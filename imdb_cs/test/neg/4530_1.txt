The audience sat in silence with almost all the film, with only a few rare, occasional laughs. The character of Maxwell Smart was so contradictory that I felt flogged. When it is appropriate for conspiracy, Smart acts like a master. At other times, he acts like an imbecile. They pick up many classic lines from the TV series, but they don't work in this version. The classic "missed it too" is funny if it is spoken with an attempt to braggadocio someone who is obviously a failure - but loses all the humor when someone who is qualified speaks. To a lesser extent, many of the other characters move at a dizzying pace from skilled to cartoonish incompetent. Siegfried, the main villain, seems intelligent, but makes decisions that have no damn sense. Still, none of the characters in the film are as incompetent as the writers of this mess. I'm totally depressed that so many IMDb users think it was good.
