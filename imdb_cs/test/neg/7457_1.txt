This Canadian "movie" is the worst ever! Amazingly amateurish. When thieves rob a ship, we see two women with machine guns and one of them says, with a very low voice, "We rob you!" She winks and she's absolutely shy! Very intimidating. ROTFLOL !!! Two karate heroes are 40 years old, five foot tall brothers! They are really bad actors. In fact, everyone involved in this production is a non-actor. <br /> <br /> There are so many continuity mistakes in this cheap production that it's amazing. In one scene, boys wear one type of swimsuit. In the following shot they are wearing completely different swimsuits. <br /> <br /> Absolutely awful! He must see every fan of bad movies. I got it on VHS. It's very rare. I appreciate it.
