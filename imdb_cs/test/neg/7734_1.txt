It is impossible to avoid comparing Zhang Yimou "Hero" to Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger". Both were big-budget Chinese kung-fu movies with breathtaking Chinese landscapes and superstar casts. But apart from the obvious, there is actually nothing else to compare. "Hero" fails to meet almost every level that matters, proving that stellar stars, beautiful scenery and action effects do not replace the director's art and vision. <br /> <br /> All the marketing humor of the premier "Hero" has done nothing but make his failure spectacular. "Hero" is expected to draw audiences when it first opened in theaters in China and Hong Kong, making it an immediate success. However, although the script likes government censors, the Chinese audience went to the newly found heights of caustic criticism and sarcastic wit to express their contempt. Online critics, both professional and amateur, have declared the film "ideologically disturbing" from the perspective of deep slavery, written by either an amateur historian or someone with side motives. One article was simply called, "Hero, you make me sick!" The deepest film failure is in his conspiracy, which is not only morally reprehensible, but also based on an unforgivable historical error, but - the worst thing for the film - is boring! It is known that all epic stunt films take some freedom with historical histories, but "Hero" goes beyond an artistic license to unforgivable ignorance when trying to celebrate an emperor who was as brutal as Stalin or Hitler. "Hero" does not replace this lack of moral compass with fun or entertainment. Instead, it is a woefully bad attempt to be "deep" and only succeeded in being conceited and preaching. he admired this ruler - no surprise, given Mao's own tyrannical rule. Similarly, the communist government in Beijing sees an allegory that can easily be transferred between the First Emperor and his own iron-fist methods, so they were particularly pleased with this latest work by Zhang Yima. Tony Leung, one of the "Hero" stars, commented during the interview that he is promoting a movie that the Beijing government did in 1989 in the right way by crushing student demonstrations because of the need to maintain "stability" in China. For these comments, Tony Leung received a shocked criticism in his home town of Hong Kong, but he only said aloud the basic message of the film. Director Zhang Yimou said his goal was to overcome it. the values ​​of loyalty and revenge that are traditional in kung fu novels and movies to reveal higher wisdom. Unfortunately, his version of "wisdom" turns out to be: THE WORKER IS RIGHT. In China, where thousands of years of historical reality have thrust this message, art has been the last refuge in which an individual could truly find freedom from such tyranny. The great popularity of the kung-fu novel can be explained by its ability to escape into the alternative world: one where kung fu warriors roamed the country seeking adventure and fighting for justice, freedom from fear and victory in all directions with their super-human skills. Only in the novel an individual ever won over institutionalized power in China, and only in the novel did the oppressed find their winner. Against this tradition of kung fu hero, Zhang Yimou did not go up to the higher truth as he hoped, but downward, to the level of government propaganda. No wonder the government was so pleased. Some movie lovers may wonder: "All moral judgments aside, is it at least amusing?" Fortunately, the answer is stunning "No!" Because the same story is told again and again only with slight variations, it's boring to watch. In addition, these three contradictory versions of the same story merely confuse character development because it leaves a rare time for the viewer to feel sympathetic to one of them once the "real" version appears. The film is not without beautiful images. However, all scenes fall flat because they do not connect or improve the plot. The use of different colors to distinguish separate versions of the story comes as simplistic and crafted, and cinematography appears self-consciously rather than really beautiful. Great for a trailer, but disappointing when you're there to watch the whole movie. For those who have been disdained in China for the unrealistic kung fu "Crouching Tiger's", `Hero was expected to be a lot. "Jet Li, who plays the title role, is a true kung fu artist who had national titles before starting his career as an actor. His previous films revealed limited acting skills, but many hoped Zhang Yimou could use Li's moving body movements to full "Hero" is trying to overcome the kung-fu genre, so there aren't many battle scenes and it is expected that Jet Li will perform a difficult piece of acting: the inner transformation leading to deep wisdom and self-sacrifice: As the cast director expected, Li would fail miserably, meanwhile, the only battle scene that reveals any true kung fu skill is the first of the film, between Li and Donnie Yen. are disappointing, so "Hero" cannot satisfy even at this level. <br /> <br /> Although most viewers outside of China she probably won't know about the historic smashing of the cruel story It seems that the first Emperor is even more likely to accept Zhang's version of "Chinese Wisdom", which is different than. The only time the viewers who stepped out of the screening of "Hero" saw with a smile - instead of yawning or frowning - were on a special screening for Chinese government officials. <br /> <br />
