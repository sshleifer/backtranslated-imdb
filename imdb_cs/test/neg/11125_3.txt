First and foremost I deal with the title of this film. "Chupacabra" is not a Spanish word. The name they refer to is "Chupacabras". I imagine they dropped 's' because it sounds pluralist, but I assure you it's singular in Spanish. Next I thought this movie was made years ago. It looked like one of those horrible movies I watched when I was home when I was a stepfather at home. Then it would be a little scary. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about special effects. The most important "effect" is the costume used for Chupacabras. Since this is the main character, you think some serious money would be put into it, but it is not. The shape, color, and texture were all goofy like some stupid haunted house at Disney World. There were times when Chupacabras went where no one could walk. His movement was jerky and weird in these times, but moving across the floor looked like any normal person. Another thing I mean is the fact that there is no animal in the world that takes up everything that would kill everything. regardless of how he actually consumes it. Chupacrabas would kill one, then the other, but it never seemed to be a victim. You say, "It's just a movie," and I agree. But the idea is so far away that it's stupid. <br /> <br /> In what country is Dr. Foam? Sounds like Jamaincan / Hawaiian / British / Something-Else, but I think it's supposed to be Latino. The problem is that his accent is so bad that even Russian couldn't say it's not Latino. The soldiers fired around this thing and did not make a tooth, but went on to the fire. I'm not a military man, but soldiers, especially special tactical forces like this, have no testimony about them to fulfill their duties? Wouldn't they understand that it's a waste of time to shoot and try something new? No. They just shot away while Chupacabras continued to defeat and didn't eat them. Did they have to kill a small dog? :) Anyway, my vote was 3 for this movie because it was bad. Why did I watch the whole thing? I'm sure you did the same for the opportunity, so don't give me a flack. ;)
