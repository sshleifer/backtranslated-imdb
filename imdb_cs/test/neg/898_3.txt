I didn't want to get Barnens O? It is one of the strangest I have watched. Was the soundtrack quite unusual also? wrote and played Jean Michel Jarre - it makes the movie stranger than it was. I have to admit that I almost changed it and instead looked at the next place? or confusing. Are there quite a few sex links in this movie? The troughs are also a little broken. Probably the only phrase I will remember will be "When you are alone, can you control things"? and "I'll show them" - or something like that. The boy in the movie was obsessed with the idea of ​​not growing up? "last summer as a child" he thought once? and he certainly lived to the maximum. So if you have a few hours to spare, can you watch this movie? but you won't be missing if not.
