Includes spoilers! These guys are totally underwater, they made the lost scrolls of Judas, saying Judas was a huge friend of Jesus ... And now this? This is clearly an attempt to destroy religion and should be illegal. They have no proof, it could be clearly set. How can we know and trust these people? What if they carved a tomb and "said it"? And finally will the tomb nest forever so that no one can investigate? How stupid they think we are, really? Should we believe that they are trusted people? Who truly found the tomb of Jesus? And how can you stab all Christians like this? I think no religious person should ever do this document. This can only be done by a Christian and I mean DIRECTION AND SCRIPT. It should be illegal for Jews to shoot a documentary related to Christians, especially if the documentary is accused of not being "the Son of God who has resurrected" (nothing against it, could be Buddhists or atheists, nothing but Catholic). /> <br /> For me, it's a total scam, pure documentary fraud. They sealed the tomb so people wouldn't "think" of things. This document is a total failure, how stupid do they think Christian people are? And what about the lost pages of Judas ... it was also a total scam, at the end they seriously said something like, "We know a few people who could make fake scrolls like these, and no one would know it was a fake" ... my God, they just said it ... "Dude, we could do it" ... This document should be illegal, it's a stab at all Christians and Catholics, for which they should be. A Jew, now an atheist, but I have coronets, and I will always respect the religion of other people.
