This film was strongly recommended by a friend, and because he is a big fan of Brando, I ordered this movie from Harrods and eagerly waited for it to arrive. I was rarely disappointed with the film. Brando was good as a German officer, but the rest of the film was simply unbearable. You never like or care about any of the characters (except Brando, maybe). The meeting was fine. The story, what story? Maybe it's right. After all, it's a war, but I've seen much better war movies. (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now, even Star Wars) It was so boring that I was watching my watch ... <br /> <br /> Overall, it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Please don't waste your time and money. I can also add that this is the first user comment I wrote, I just had to let my feelings about this movie know. By the way, my favorite times are: Casablanca, Godfather 1 & 2, One was flying over the cuckoo's nest, Pulp Fiction and Amadeus. If you haven't seen them before, you'll save time. And Amadeus MUST be in 2.35: 1 widescreen format
