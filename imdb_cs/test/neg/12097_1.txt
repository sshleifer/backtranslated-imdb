Baldwin's direction is terrible - these actors could do better themselves. Jokes and wisecracks are falling. Shooting shots are clumsy and incredible. Baldwin directs himself as a wise proud hero, but spends most of his time in power struggles with women, especially with a caricature repressor in their tunneling team, who always asks for denial and denial. The conductor suffers from absurd incompetence, an inability to use the gun he has come. Anomaly: a man with a hood shaking with firearms over a railroad car, surprising people. Next time we see that they are going to their business sitting on their seats, talking, eating, reading, knitting. In New York subways people sometimes come to the train to do some musical or dramatic number --- maybe that's what they thought, that it is happening.
