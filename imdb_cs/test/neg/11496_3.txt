I recently rented this promising mini series, nor did I know that it was adapted to television. I was really looking forward to it because Icon is one of the best spy thrillers I've ever read. What a disappointment. The storyline just resembles the one in the book, the characters are totally distorted, and there is some frightening behavior. Damn really. The story behind the icon is ideal for the silver screen, but I think television budgets aren't big enough to make this magnificent book decent. Forsyth deserves much, much better than this. Avoid and stick to books that need to be read.
