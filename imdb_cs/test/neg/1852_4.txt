Michael Caine usually appears in either very good condition ("Blame It On Rio", "Sleuth", "Without A Clue", "Gambit", "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels") or really bad comedies ("No Off Off", " Death Becoming Her "," Harry & Walter Go To NY "). This falls into the second category. TA is a comedy that succeeds only in two things: coping with the waste of cast that includes Caine, Gambon and Richardson, all of which have comedic abilities and succeed in their mission to make the viewer laugh. There's no one really funny moment. The main reason is a lousy script; There have been so many futile attempts to write an absurdly convoluted story that is just too unpleasant to follow (given that it's just comedy) that a writer has forgotten to do a damn funny thing that, if I can remember, is what should be the whole sense of comedy. I've never seen Moron before. Some people even say "if you are a Moron fan, you will love" blah blah blah. Fan Moron? Does this person really have fans without description? Comedy so poorly written as it requires mega-talent to make laughs or two of it, someone like Steve Coogan and not average Moron. If you are going to make a comedy about actors then at least make them totally morals that are usually. The characters of Caine and Moron are not stupid enough. The only nice thing about this unfair collection of scenes is a little girl. Only a really horrible writer would think it was wise to include a super intelligent girl to spice up a lousy script. Smart-a ** kids are no longer even entertaining fans of Bill Cosby. In "Little Miss Sunshine" we had a very normal baby and she was very funny. This stupid stupid boy is smarter than adult shtick belongs to the century-old Marx Brothers movie.
