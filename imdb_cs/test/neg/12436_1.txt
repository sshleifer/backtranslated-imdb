Look, don't get me wrong I love independent movies, but COME! I could barely sit without wanting to kill myself. The director had absolutely no talent and turned something that might be okay for a nightmare F *** ing. it is bullshit. <br /> <br /> I'm usually a bleeding heart for these low budget movies, but this one doesn't even try. Please don't waste your precious time and money. I'm sorry I'm so cruel, but come on! he continued to move on and on and on and on. Remember when the kids got into that party with strange cupcakes and melon? how did they mix? It frustrated me how they could just go wherever they wanted to get in trouble and have sex and "meaningful conversation" with anyone they wanted. I know I'm blathering, but my mind is just buzzing with everything I hated about this movie.
