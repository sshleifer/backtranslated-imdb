OK, number one - this "movie" is a "90 years" version of a miserable 70's show that nobody remembers! The number two-once the movie started, I was confused, it was like I walked in the middle of the movie! There was no conspiracy! it was very annoying! Terrible wardrobe! Call me crazy, but it's just incredible to me that the little skinny Omar Epps can chase a big adult man without a gun and scare him into speaking! It's a ridiculous conspiracy. I'm sorry, but these days, kids can't even put their pants on one leg at a time, let alone catch some "evil, underground, murderers". I came out of the theater and asked me to get the money! I do not recommend this movie to anyone over 12 years old!
