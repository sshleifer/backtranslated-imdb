I'm sure the people who made this film think they're doing something beautifully politically correct because they manage to criticize the American wars in Afghanistan and especially Iraq by suggesting that the US is fighting well, but then not clearing it up, thus seeding seeds for future problems. In addition, they do it without becoming Islamic enemies And without Republicans becoming an enemy, because they are Republicans who are in office and doing this supposedly great thing that the USSR is plaguing with a secret supply of war in Afghanistan. But now, seriously. . . We really want a movie that repeatedly says "Let's kill some Russians!" like this is the biggest thing a red-american American can do? And should we find this congressman adorable because he surrounds women with big hair and revealing clothes? Even his supposedly clever assistant, who is always professionally dressed, is still looking at Charlie as if he were the most beautiful, nicest, greatest guy. Like she was Nancy Reagan for her Ronnie. Julia Roberts has a bang-up job in her role, but women are really humiliated in this movie and it was really annoying.
