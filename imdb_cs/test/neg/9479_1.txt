This movie is so bad. It's funny to see what a bad story it is, where two American pea twins who know of nothing outside their school can come to another continent and do unimaginable things there. It's so stupid and so bizarre. How can they just find two French boys, hit them and finally kiss them, do they know anything about them? It would be more realistic if the guys took them and raped them, which could easily happen in such a situation. As for the bits when the French president drinks "bad water", it was just lame. I don't think he would be too happy in real life. Everything worked too easily for girls, and they could have been in the real problem many times in the movie if it even depicted the real life. <br /> <br /> My rating: 0/10
