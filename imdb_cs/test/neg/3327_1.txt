My daughter liked her, but I was horrified that the character was smoking in this movie. As if it wasn't awful enough to see "product placement" actors like Bruce Willis who smoke in their movies - at least kids movies should be more considerate! I wonder: was it intentional? The film "sponsored" big tobacco? What do you need to ban smoking from movies? Least films for children and adolescents.
