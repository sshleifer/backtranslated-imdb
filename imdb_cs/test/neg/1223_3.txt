I've been watching all three segments and I'm so disappointed in the story. Zahn spends so much time imitating Duvalla that he will do nothing else in the show. And Tommy Lee Jones would never be as weak as a young man. We never see how and why they go back to Lonesome Dove ... which is a hole in the original ... why would they ever leave Austin, where are the heroes ... for not doing anything throughout the movie ... He was rooted for the Blue Duck and was totally wrong. There is no warning about how many segments are ... just ending. This mini-series could be "someone" ... tragic. They seemed to be directed by Parrot and Jag
