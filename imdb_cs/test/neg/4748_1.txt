I really hoped with this film that the idea was to eradicate the disaster along with the irreversibility of the first AVP, and yet to my horror: the Requiem is much worse than I could have imagined. My hopes were in the opening moments of the movie inside the Predator ship and I almost exhaled with relief as we finally saw the Predator home world (a remarkable digital matte painting, but still nice to finally see it) and then of course people (if such badly written characters can be referred to as such) are introduced ... <br /> <br /> You must wonder why it seems impossible for Fox to make a good movie of aliens and predators. At the very least, imaginary filmmakers could do their homework. <br /> <br /> Characters are set in the same way we would expect from the worst of the 13th Sequel. The pizza delivery scene, like any other scene, caused the interaction of the character to follow. Bimbos and teenage non actors don't do for a REAL movie, they do for a cheap movie, and Alien 1-3 and Predator movies were good because they were produced over the concept (remember that the first stranger is "B" movie missing an opportunity that could be remedied simply by knowing their roots Alien + Predator: In Alien and Predator, we are familiar with characters that are part of a larger group (Alien: Refinery Workers, Aliens: Marines, Alien 3: Convictions and generally follow the main heroic part of the unit, Predator, Arnold - Special Forces, Predator 2: Danny Glover, Police) and it's easy to see where the filmmakers of both series started to go wrong: we have pirates in Alien Ressurrection ... or something, AVP we have ... explorers ? ... with weapons? And of course we have a teenage slasher cliché in the AVP-R. the small town and the war veterinarian who came back seemed to be a First Blood-type hero, but like many things he never paid. The movie - just as it has no sense of reason. There is no sense of forward momentum, just small sequences that build the most inexhaustible levels of tension or interest just to cut off when they become interesting. The action scenes themselves, even though they are much ballyhooed in the trailers, are so darkly lit that it is literally impossible to tell what is happening during the battle scenes when they finally appear. Basically, the film is limited from many levels. Bad actors combined with the wrong direction and the cruel scenario (which I noticed as a screenwriter, seemed to hit every bad comment and cliché that only the coolest writer who had no thoughts could swallow it together). , there is no direct quality video, nor does it show respect for the established tradition of previous recordings in the series. Why do Predalien suddenly have the ability to shoot extraterrestrial embryos into the neck of a pregnant woman to use it as a chest incubator? More than likely, because a dead script writer needed a way to have more extraterrestrials for predators to fight (and given the accelerated growth time even more than the first AVP: as quickly as possible. (This means that the anticipated characters replace the actual character development) (Remember that a character is defined by what they do, not say) Why does a sheriff lead a civilian into a weapon cache?) How bimbo of all people know where they are? Why Predalien Waiting for Predator VERY SLOWLY to Remove its Mask Before Attacking? Why do aliens still fall into that ugly series-post-Alien 3 habit of hissing all the time for their prey to know how to escape? As on Earth, this series went to a character who says, "People are dying ... we need weapons!" (As this writer even works, he is outside me and badly reflecting Fox's already destroyed) artistic reputation, it's like anybody who's participated in the creation of this film, suffered from mental disabilities or was indeed incapable of all levels of the film process. <br /> <br /> EFFECTS are pretty poor this time. Foreigners look like men in suits and ADI is just lazy with its creature design. Aliens look like modified remnants of the Alien Resurrection Resurrection, with such bulky muscles around their arms as if they didn't learn from the film that it wasn't a good design or good for recycling. Everything is once again shrouded in such a state of darkness that it does not create a mystery or atmosphere, but simply to hide how badly the creatures look. And just like in AVP, Stan Winston is too lacking when a false view of the Predator face is revealed. <br /> <br /> There are too many errors in the list, so I'll say: Don't waste money on this movie. Fox is out of the care of the fans because this cheap and expensive movie is clearly proof. I felt bad when I married my girlfriend to see it (though it was free) and apologized to her. This is one fan that is done with the franchise. Note to Fox: What we really wanted was no mindless filming, it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook comic book. it was better than anything you made for this franchise post in 1993. <br /> <br /> Log out.
