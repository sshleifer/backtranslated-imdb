This movie can't decide what it is - a soft porn or sf movie. There is not enough plot for a real movie, but too much for porn. Far in the galaxy, good princess (we know it's good because it has long blond hair, wears white togu, is polite, and when we meet it for the first time, it wisely collects about her dying mother) he inherits the kingdom over her elder sister who is evil (and we know it because she has dark hair and she wears too much makeup, she abuses her male sex slaves All the while she grins and curls her lip and talks about the horrors she will commit, when the queen is in. The evil princess gets angry and attempts a coup, but a good sister gets on Earth, of course she thinks a beech naked in the bar in a wet T-shirt contest. as if it was written for porn, and the general story is ridiculous.It's not enough skin to be happy to watch it, I like "good" bad movies, and it's not even nice to "bad movie" level .
