There's a lot of "bad" movies. Tune into Channel 5 every night of the week and be treated daily, with the shocking efforts of one filmmaker or another. There are possibly films that have caused me more pain - it was harder to sit - than it is, but in terms of writing, acting, directing, cinematography and the bare foundations of the Inbetweeners cinema is really, really scary effort and must be avoided at all costs. The only laugh he gave me was in a backstage DVD movie in which Darren Fisher explains how it was his script that drew talent to the project. Never underestimate the power of self-deception.
