Skeletons in the closet take the father-teen genre son to new levels low. This is a movie that has no purpose. The story is set in the first few minutes, there is no tension, the characters are clich√©s, and despite the conspiracy plot that is trying to confuse and confuse, everything is just as you think. In the middle of the movie, I couldn't stand the snail's pace anymore and started quickly. The movie ended exactly as I expected. Linda Hamilton is great because always and the other actors are above average with the fact that it seems to be totally inadequate. If you really believe that you need to see this uninitiated bland whodunite, look at it quickly.
