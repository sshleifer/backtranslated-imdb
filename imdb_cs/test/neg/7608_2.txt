I was watching a movie called Dark Talon, dated 1974. The credits of this movie are exactly the same as the Dark Star, so I suppose it's an alternative title. Dark Talon was nowhere as funny as everyone else here. Behavior was poor, cut editing and overall stupid. In the beginning there is an annoying song called "Benson, Arizona" from 1970, which has nothing to do with the film. Basically, the plot revolves around a small crew of an interstellar bomber that goes around bombardment sites that are unstable. Bombs are receptive and responsive to people. Mandatory disaster interferes with communication between bombs and crew. One of the crews comes out and has an absurdly idiotic existential conversation with a bomb that made no sense at all. The movie I saw was done in less than an hour and a half, with the ads I was throwing, so I suspect Dark Talon is an exaggerated version of Dark Star. The alien's inflatable red beach ball spray painted a pair of monsters by hand that walks on. It was stupid and unconvincing as an alien. It's hard to believe that John Carpenter had a hand in it. His other films were much better.
