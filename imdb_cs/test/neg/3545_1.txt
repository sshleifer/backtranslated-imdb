I remember seeing the channels on HBO and seeing it. This, my friends, is one of the worst TV movies I've ever seen. There's no excitement in this movie. The story begins with Drew Summers (Candice Cameron Bure), who goes to a small town while in a trance. She stays with a couple who coincidentally had a daughter named Laura Fairgate who looked exactly like her and is played by the same actress. Even the townspeople agree that they looked similar. The thing is, Laura was killed more than a year ago. Her boyfriend disappeared at the same time she was murdered, so it seemed he killed her. <br /> <br /> When Drew settles down in this city for a while, he begins to have visions and nightmares. These visions and nightmares can prove that Laura's friend is not a murderer. Throughout the film, you'll find that Ray Ordwell Sr. (Denis Arndt) is one who has often raped and killed her for some time. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long and very boring. The film just goes on and on and on and on. Surprisingly, I saw another TV movie after this (cloned) 1997, which was good, but I will explore it later. I give this movie 1 star of 10. Avoid this TV movie. It's not worth your time. This is the worst TV movie of 1997!
