I watched this movie over and over again because it came out for the first time. I was fifteen and then I knew it was cheesy. It had such a great potential and I am constantly rewriting the script into my head. Capoeira destroyed what might have been a good drama. I loved the fact that it was shot in place. Too bad the characters were underdeveloped. It's like writing the first draft of the script and then creating the movie immediately. At fifteen I could write a better script, and some scenes and dialogues seemed to emerge from nothing, leaving you with many unanswered questions. And was it just me, or did Lobo seem to have attracted his cousin? "Elena has grown into a woman!" And the way he always touched her. She would have an interesting plot, Elena worked for her cousin, who is also a perv. Too bad they lacked a mark on this brand.
