This film had the biggest advertising campaign of any film in Russia. "An Epic Film about Russian Culture", "The Great Spirit of the Russian Spirit", endless articles and interviews. For me, this film was the biggest disappointment. The main character, played by Oleg Menshikov, is a stupid immature boy who is ready to put his friends behind a woman who doesn't even look like a lady. What is there to admire? In the first part of the film, the story does not develop at all. Human festival scenes look like Russian impudence. Mr. Mikhalkov respects his previous works, both as an actor and a director, but this film only demonstrates his ambition to be considered a "Tsar" of Russian film. .
