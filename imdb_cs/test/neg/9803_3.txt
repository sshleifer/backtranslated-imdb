I waited for the film to move, inspire me, shock me, somehow annoy me, but I didn't feel any emotions. It just stumbled to the end. None of the characters seemed to be unique or complex, they seemed to be actors who recite their lines. I think it might be a better film if the characters expressed more emotions. The only one who did and was believable was a veteran and he probably committed suicide just to get out of the movie as soon as he could. It was a waste of talent, film, their time and mine. If there is any message or meaning or genius in this story, it is certainly well hidden or very dense, which I doubt.
