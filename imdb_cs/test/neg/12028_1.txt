That was frankly the worst movie I've ever seen. acting was God terrible, the story was also bad. but it was a good idea. If this movie had better kinematics and much better actors, maybe I should have something better to say. Edgar Allen Poe was a great Gothic writer, and this film has ruined it. Why People Must Always Kill Good Stories by Making Bad Movies. the only good part was when the killer put his head under the tape floor, which was pretty good. the dangling ax was just awful, there was no tension. and also when the killer at the end chases everyone around, he went from one place to another in a few seconds, it doesn't make sense.
