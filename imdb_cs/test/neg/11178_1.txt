The most disturbing thing about this movie is not that it's a hogwash load (CPUSA has never been such a threat of espionage as the film produces). A problematic aspect is the way in which it relieves the reluctant tactics of the FBI and the Non-American Activity Committee. Secret whistleblowers, rumors turned into accusations, gratuitous searches - these are the kinds of things that secret police like the KGB did, and probably what good patriotic Americans were fighting. However, the FBI did and did not drown their eyes. This is the only realistic part of this movie and they present it without shame. Add to this the undermining of the Constitution itself by having only communists who invoke the Law on Rights. The film also makes the allegation that the Black Civil Rights Movement was inspired by the Communist, another package of lies, makes it difficult. On this day, it is extremely difficult to excuse such outrageous propaganda, even understanding the paranoia of times when one realizes how harmful it is to real people.
