That he growled ... <br /> <br /> That he frowned ... <br /> <br /> Random Violence Acts ... <br /> <br /> Gutter Voice ... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> That shaved his head ... <br /> <br /> It can only mean one thing ... GRACE JONES IS BACK! Actually my sources tell me that the title role in Blade didn't play diva of the eighties, but Wesley Snipes. <br /> <br /> All in all this is not an improvement. Blade is a comic character adaptation; somehow in the transition from a simplified, two-dimensional world to a printed page it has become even more simplistic and has lost a few dimensions. The storyline is shabby almost beyond faith and nothing adds genre to the vampire, in fact, like Nosferatu, it seems to suck life from the audience. In short, the ascending vampire vampire wants to be stronger, but Blade is against him, half man, half vampire, all unpleasant. It all culminated in Blade being introduced to vampire juice, some bad martial arts and the cruelest CGI since 1968. Blade must be the least empathetic character because Dolph Lundgren's Punisher , maybe there's a trend?). Sure, the audience should be on the same side as the 'hero'? And while a vampire may be a tragic figure, it's not true about Blade, he's tirelessly cruel, scornful, and not much better than evil boys. I suppose Wesley Snipes has a career career purely so that everyone else can be compared favorably. When he growls with his film, you will find yourself in the search for a grave - even a ballpoint pen - anything that could put Blade in the grave. As a piece of narcissism, Blade is largely insurmountable. Similarly, no other participant has any chance to provide reasonable performance; Steven Dorff * CAN *, but must play the second violin to weary Snipes performance. Kris Kristofferson appeared in good movies, here he is limited to the sidekick you just know I won't do until the final. And what happens when Blade finds out? Yes, you guessed it, he rushes to the scene to avenge himself in a giant underground lair of a criminal. Why does world domination not take place in a quiet country house? They always go to the underground cathedrals that Albert Speer would be wondering if they were a little spectacular. Many of these plans could be stopped right now if the local councils paid more attention to plans to expand the underground. The rest of the movie is just as blunt and unimaginable as there is nothing new to this genre. Vampires have been made to avoid being touched, and perhaps they should be rested for a while - at least until someone can think of a way to make them interesting again. <br /> <br /> To complete the IS * and Grace Jones vampire movie, it's called Vamp and it's about ten times better than this.
