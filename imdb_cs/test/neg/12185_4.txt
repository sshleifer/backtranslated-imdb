This was the next last movie performance of Jill Ireland, who died of cancer in 1990 after four decades as a well-known actress and producer. Ireland made a few waves in the press when she dropped her former husband David McCallum in 1967 and began her long relationship with Charles Bronson. It is a great irony that Bronson, who is probably the historic leader in screen deaths, had one of the most enduring marriages in film history. It seems that the film "Assassination" is a film that has been tucked into Cannon's production plan for Bronson and Ireland. Ireland had already suffered from cancer-related illnesses in 1987, and you can almost imagine that two actors who want to do "just one for old times". The "assassination" is carelessly executed as a whole, indicating a lack of Polish and dwindling resources that the Cannon tank would refuel by 1990. the relationship survive in the chaos that is Hollywood. Bronson plays Jay Killian, a high-ranking secret service agent who is designed to protect First Lady, Lara Craig (Ireland). The president's wife has a reputation for being difficult to bossing service agents around and wanting to do things in their own way. That all changes, however, when attempts are made on her life and she must travel with Killian's car, train, motorcycle, and believe it or not, the buggy dune to escape any killers. Here's just a little surprise, because Killian believes the murderers are part of the inner work that the President himself may organize. On the way, Killian and Mrs. Craig develop an unspoken affection for each other in scenes between Bronson and Ireland that are actually very funny. What really gets me is how this movie was promoted to its release and how it is still made to look like a DVD. The original trailer gives you the feeling that 'Assassination' is another cold Bronson shooter. By the way, much of this movie - which by the way was rated PG-13 - is in a comic vein, in the spirit of a romantic thriller like Bronson and Irish western 'From Noon Till Three'. Even the DVD case shows Bronson with a rocket launcher ready to blow things up. What he does, but to a lesser extent than his other '80. potboilers. Overall, "Assassination" is a late Cannon slop job and doesn't really know what movie it wants to be. In addition to drifting from action to romantic thriller and back, there are serious mistakes in continuity, real estate values ​​are cheaper and effects are terrible; Many of the blasts appear to be rather dull than on-site. Robert Ragland, who has shown good composition skills in earlier films, has teamed up with Valentine McCallum for a score that is mostly synthesized and better suited for television. Richard Sale's script has a real sense of dialogue with Bronson and Ireland. There is no explanation as to why the first lady is suddenly called "One Mom", nor why Ireland is left with her British accent when she is a native of Wyoming. Jan Gan Boyd, playing Killian's chief assistant, has a personality similar to a kitten and is wrong as a federal agent. Stephen Elliott (former Tony Award candidate who died in May 2005), Randy Brooks, Erik Stern (as a Bracken killer) and Michael Ansara (Senator Bunsen) are acceptable in their support roles. By the way, this was the last film director's concert for Peter Hunt, who came to the scene in 1969 with the secret service "On Her Majesty," and in 1981 worked with Bronson and Lee Marvin on "Death Hunt" “. Home entertainment; is presented in two widescreen and standard formats with three language subtitles and a theatrical trailer. <br /> <br /> ** of 4
