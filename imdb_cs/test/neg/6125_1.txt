French either pro-Marxist films or anti-Marxist films - with a few in between. "Merci pour le chocolat" is the second of this genre. From the opening titles that tell the viewer what music he will play and who folded it, you know you will be involved in the middle class. It's an old male movie with over 40 people plus people. It is also run by an old man along with an old crew who has nothing to tell the viewer about life. The land is not only banal but absurd. How many movies reveal a plot through a dialogue only to repeat the same message via flashback five minutes later? Maybe director and actors had low retention capacity? In fact, there is no permanent plot at all. It is a puzzle with holes as a good piece of French cheese. Whether it is intentional or not, it's a bourgeoisie movie. At least a third of the film focuses on piano and bold twaddle in every scene. I admit he's got some well framed shots, even though they couldn't use a stable camera in this movie - that would wake them all! In addition to being a pointless story, the film allows the upper middle class to showcase their values ​​and futility in a very comfortable Swiss location. The line of the movie is when Rodolphe Pauly tells Anna Mouglalis she doesn't have to lock her car in the car! Oh, dear. <br /> <br /> On the DVD, Miss Huppert makes a comment about making a false tear for the scene. Smirking said: "As in American Actor's Studio!" I think Miss Huppert and the rest of the cast could learn well from the actor's studio. If there is one statement that stands out in my mind, it is when Huppert remarks: "We have friends for the weekend and all the servants are gone. Undoubtedly, they all fled from the mind of an anesthetic set to not be associated with such an appalling film. <br /> <br /> Safety Medical Note. The film shows hot water scalding is covered with ointment and bandage. This should never be done. Only cold water should be used. <br /> <br /> Minus 10 tags.
