We'll never know the Truth about September 11th. And this awkward film proves it. I recently watched a YouTube report claiming there were no planes to destroy the Twin Towers; that all news programs were allegedly provided with shots of the same angle of towers from a mysterious source (probably a gubmint?), and in that they provided footage of CGI aircraft replacing the real life of MISSILES, which actually hit the towers. It's a compelling video, and although I'm not Wacko Conspiracy Theorist per se, I'm still not sure if the real planes hit something like that (Towers, Shanksville Field, Pentagon) - because no debris is available. (And what about the infamous "black boxes"? No healed.) A million more theories abound, all eager for a drop of Truth that awakens in the ocean of speculation. But you drown in malaria before you find yourself in the report of September 11, 2001, which is a budget that is trying to close the barn door after all the horses and jihadis have fled, something worthwhile or worth speculating. . Writer Leigh Scott is apparently a concerned American citizen who wanted to shed light on what the 560-page report could reveal. That would help if his film had an actor instead of a guy who looks like David Duchovny, a chick who looks like Gina Gershon, a guy who thinks he's Russell Crowe and another guy I'm sure he is trying to to be Sean Bean. It would help him if his cameraman didn't have Parkinson's disease; if the light director does not try to save on electricity; that would help if his editor had no Attention Deficit Disorder, or if the soundtrack wasn't some hopeless esoteric of the new world order; and the loop should probably be inserted when people actually move their mouths. We can't even call this propaganda. It's too funny. And funny, I mean, not observable. You can't squeeze the complex's problem into a two-hour movie, but Leigh Scott's trying, including all the sexy phrases we've got. k: bin Laden's intention to attack, buy weapons from Somalia, non-aggression agreement with Iraq, Mussawi attending flight school, weapons of mass destruction ... <br /> <br /> The problem is that we know it's all backward ; so any discussion that intelligence operators are interested in brings with each other overcrowded false views that have withdrawn into a neat conversation. Just like fictitious reverse engineering, all that is relevant is briefly mentioned so that we can shake our heads in amazement at how uncompromisingly all these government departments have gone wrong. There is a ridiculous interrogation scene with a cunning bimbo beating a guy with a tomato sauce on his face. Now - that would be considered torture if most of the guys didn't consider it turned on. The folder is: "What if the attack was stopped?" According to this film - and according to the Commission report, we assume that the CIA and other underground agencies were ready to capture bin Laden and not. Anyone dealing with reports of "terrorism" (that is, you actually read these reports?) Is so concerned that we just want to hit them for their misconduct. But the whole story goes much deeper than the trivial soundbyes of negligence The Bush Klan encouraged Americans after 9/11. Now we know that even the capture of bin Laden before the September 11 attack would not change or reach - the wheels were moving with or without the Taliban puppet, whose involvement was a possible product of one's feverish imagination to unite America against a common enemy. Contrary to popular belief, "they" did not "attack" us. As Ron Paul tried to clarify, it was a Middle East recoil - "they" were so sick from America that they put their unfaithful legs "there" to bring the war "here." Although George W. Death likes to act absurdly, "we fight them, so we won't have to fight them," in fact "Because we're here, the fight has been brought here." on the complex planning of terrorists because it was the gross negligence of the Bush administration, which we know (without scrutiny of the commission) of all information from the Clinton administration; information on terrorist cells reaching critical mass and their intention to cause chaos. But the Oil Idiot of Texas, who refused to read his daily briefings and would rather enjoy a vacation at his Crawford Ranch to spend one day at work, canceled the duty he swore to play - to protect the American public. And then the dirt called the president used the attacks that caused his negligence as a political hammer against his own dumbed-down countryfolk to score a second term, break the American constitution and take America to a fake war . Lie (WMD), with a country that had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks. Oddly enough, the film never steps close to Ku Bush Clan, offering no opinion or judgment, Leigh Scott wants to stay neutral. Tell it to the rape and looted hundreds of thousands in the False War on Terror in Iraq. From the pure coincidence, I realized that I was watching this DVD while I was wearing "Bush lied. Thousands died." T-shirt.
