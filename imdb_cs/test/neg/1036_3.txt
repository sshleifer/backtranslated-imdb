Try as I could, I just couldn't get into it. Maybe they were washed-out tones; Maybe it was an outstretched approach - I'm not really sure, but although it was by no means a "bad" movie, I didn't really think it was a very effective movie (the words I understand are more arbitrary than their normal movie) use). So basically it is that a series of deaths of adolescent boys start an investigation and anxiety in a small provincial town. witch-hunt. What does the boy's death have to do with the mysterious, sexy woman who appeared in the city? Is it a crazy hermit woman? Is it voodoo? The story is a mixture of criminal drama and horror, as various townspeople are all suspects, and corpses still appear while bloody violence follows. It had a moment ... that boy who went to a beautiful naked seduct was pretty good, and the scene where fathers defeated the hermit was a bitter commentary (though the effects themselves failed, because her skin seemed to look like bark) as if whipped with red hot irons). <br /> <br /> My biggest problem was over. I've already given a brand spoiler to this review, but BE WARNED, HERE LARGE SPOILER: I don't believe it. I do not believe that a priest can convince himself to kill young boys to be aware of sexual consciousness, without any indication that this psychosis has occurred earlier, with other boys, with history or other personal influence. The movie really didn't end. END SPOILERS. However, Fulci is a big name and I am more than sure that there is an audience. I'm sure I have to look at more of what he did because it could be a bad introduction. Most Italian giallo are just as hit-and-miss, so I'm waiting to see what else this guy can do before he writes. <br /> <br /> --PolarisDiB
