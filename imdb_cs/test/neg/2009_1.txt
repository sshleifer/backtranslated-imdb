Hmmm! is the worst movie ever? kind of, for some of the casting his shame to see them in such a movie, but hey, if they pay the bills, why not, just like for the movie well. OK cg effects not so bad for such a cheap movie, music is just OK again for cheap movie, end credits are OK lol <br /> <br /> BAD to many to list but, cast, play, sets, script, end .. what the hell, Drac .......... worst Drac EVER!, much more but can't be bothered to put them all down. The idea was fine, but you need ten times more budget and more ideas and much better lighting and style and change all the bad points, but I say see this movie so you can say "What FU% $ was It's all about "like loans run.Also his kind has to see just how bad it is.
