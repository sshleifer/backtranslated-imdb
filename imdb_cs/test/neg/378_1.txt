I love the first and third Beastmasters, but this was an abomination. For the same reasons, it was almost as terrible as "Never Ending Story 3". They took the fascinating world of fantasy of barbaric tribes, farm villages, witches, supernatural creatures, and the cult of religious fanatics using the pyramid; and he thought it would be fun to mix rock and roll, sushi (I think that's what it was), and flashy sports cars in our materialistic world of pop-culture. These two worlds do not belong together. I don't want to see a lot of old-looking barbarians dancing on some rock song on the car stereo. I have a sense of humor, but that's just stupid. That's what Hollywood does good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas. Don't give up, but the eye of Braxus is much, much better. The one I gave 10. This one, Portal of Time, I give 1. Believe me, I don't always give such an extremely high or low rating. I only tend to comment on such films.
