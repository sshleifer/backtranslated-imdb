"Chairman of the Board" is a ridiculously stupid movie from the popular Carrot Top comic book (also seen on 1-800-COLLECT ads). He plays the inventor of surfing, which comes to a man who has a flat tire. Top helps him out, and a few days later he finds out that the guy died and gave his company to the comedian. Even if someone was Carrot Top, it would still be bad. Jokes (which are constantly twisted) are terrible, and the idea of ​​a romantic "plot" should be discarded. DO NOT LOOK!!!
