This is indeed one of the weakest films based on the work of Agatha Christie, a lifeless, confused secret that clearly lacks the grace (and budget!) Of his predecessors ("Death on the Nile", "Evil Under the Sun") and Donald Sutherland's Pale Shadow of Peter Ustinova when it comes to screen detectors (of course, it plays a character much less interesting than Poirot). The film manages the coast as far as it does on Christie's plot by himself (all her plots have a certain amount of natural interest), but the direction is hopelessly flat. (* 1/2)
