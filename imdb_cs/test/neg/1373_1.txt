While mind mencia could be summarized as nothing more than just a band show clone, it is really worse than that. Carlos Mencia is primarily a jack ** who is just as funny as the original who doesn't say much. the show contains a lame spoofs of American television commercials and political issues, and mencia's "comedy" insight into politics adds to the low quality of this show. At the top of it all, Mencia throws in more lame ethnic jokes and stole Jeff foxworthy lines before I can count on one side. While every once in a while Carlos gets a cheap laugh, spends the rest of the time insulting everyone in sight, including the use of his own audience members. with the exception of the Southern Park, which was withdrawn together and on Friday night, this show is the end of the festive days, which for those of you who haven't heard before were gone to Africa.
