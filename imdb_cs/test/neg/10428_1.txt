Journalist Bob Woodward is a blistering, scattered and sometimes suspicious account of the rise and fall of actor John Belushi, who becomes Larry Peerce's fuzzy "fantasy" film as if he were doing something nervous and vital. Michael Chiklis (years before his breakthrough on "The Shield") is placed in an unenviable position portraying Belushi, who, after his death, experiences a journey after death and restores those "Saturday nights" that are now part of television history. It's like watching someone try to slip - Lucy Lucille Ball - you can't do that. The reason there was such a grief from Belushi's death was that he was of a kind. Chiklis makes a laudable attempt at looking at that part and is funny in the early scene trying to escape the morgue. Yet it is a uphill path and no actor - no matter how talented - could save him. * of ****
