I watched this movie last night at the National Film Theater in London as a birthday present. It was the first time I saw it, and I think it has now overtaken the horrible "Twister" as the worst movie I've ever seen. They do not serve gratuitously, steadfastly and full of images that oscillate from a crack and are obviously unclear and incomprehensible, not particularly beautiful or grim, but I do not understand why it is considered classic, gay or otherwise. I usually like movies that push borders or even movies that are hard to follow because of their length or unusual cinema. But that was really, terribly.
