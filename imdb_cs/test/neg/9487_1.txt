I saw this movie and I didn't care about this movie anyway. I would not think of going to Paris because I do not like this country and its national capital. I don't like learning French because I don't understand their language. Why should I go to France if I go to Germany or the UK? Germany and the United Kingdom are nations that I tolerate. Apparently, Olsen does not understand the French language as much as I do. Therefore, I do not bother France trip no matter what. I could also stick to the UK and meet single women and play video games if the video is a passage. That is all.
