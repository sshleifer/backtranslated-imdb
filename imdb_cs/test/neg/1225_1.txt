Wow ... as a big fan of Larry McMurtry's fairy tales and especially the Lonesome Dove series, I enjoyed the Comanche Moon with a-o-o-o. This is a huge delay. Maybe my expectations were set too high because all around Lonesome Dove's perfection ... story, characters, cinematography, music ... it all worked. The Comanche The Moon is a cross across as a bad Saturday live parody. The characters are completely colorless, the dialogue is crazy and the plot is thoughtlessly stretched throughout the place. Looks like the actors are reading from TelePrompTers. I couldn't touch any character, good guys, bad guys, or random characters. Especially outstanding is David Midthunder's performance. Looks like he was pulled out of eighth grade high school. I'm sorry to find something positive about Comanche Moon, but I just can't do it. There's nothing there.
