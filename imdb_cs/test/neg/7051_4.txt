This is the case when the fairy tale goes too far. Enchanted Cottage supplies Dorothy McGuire as a "terrible ugly" spinster and Robert Young as a disfigured pilot. Short Short Story: Scarface married Spinster, who is their love, miraculously (by light, cosmetics and removing false scars), turns into beautiful people - a magical change attributed to the enchantment of life in a seaside cottage that has been the dwelling of generations of newlyweds at honeymoon. If the story stopped there, all right; it would be a fable with a proverbial message: beauty is in the viewer's eyes. But he leans in front of us and reaches for reality. When Mr and Mrs Scarface greet their public, it comes as a painful shock to them that they are still at home. Do you see that they look beautiful to each other? The situation that viewers are well prepared for, because all the supporting characters preach that bad people really need to lower their expectations and find other ways to be happy. You know. Do your hobbies. For example, Spinster makes woodcuts. Scarface is considering collecting driftwood. The original playwright (Arthur Wing Pinero) and filmmakers have zero faith in human nature. Their message is: You are either ugly or handsome, and no handsome person would ever love ugly. Worse still, ugly people obviously need to present their lover so nicely. He simply does not. You wonder what Elaine Mason saw every day when she looked at her husband Stephen Hawking.
