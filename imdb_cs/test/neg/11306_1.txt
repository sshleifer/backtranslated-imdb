I enjoyed Mr. Magoo's cartoons I saw when I grew up. And I like Leslie Nielson's comic skills. So I thought this marriage had to produce a funny child. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be more bad. This movie was just awful. I don't remember one funny moment. This is one of two or three times (in hundreds of movies over the years). You will leave this film depressed because you will never have the time to use it better. In a comedy, the plot must be drawn by the viewer and served as a framework for gags. This chart does not. Just lies lying there, gasping like fish on the beach.
