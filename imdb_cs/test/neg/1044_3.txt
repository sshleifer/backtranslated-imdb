I saw this movie I saw in front of something I just rented ... and it looked decent. I saw some good stuff from Full Moon video and I thought it was worth it, it was good ... Unfortunately it wasn't good. The couple moves to a new apartment, discovers a bed and things start to happen. Strange things like a woman discovers eccentric sex. And the man discovers eccentric sex. A woman draws pictures of kinky sex. And the man takes pictures of eccentric sex. And they both begin to have dreams of dead people who have eccentric sex. Do you think a movie with so much eccentric sex would be good, right? No ... No. , and it just doesn't. There is little tension, no tension and no fear. Except for some disturbing dreams and visions, there is really nothing to fear this couple. The whole movie is basically two of them who have these visions and play in bed. Sure, you get a monster at the end ... and some bloodshed ... but nothing spectacular ... There's only one murder and one good fear, and that's it. <br /> <br /> Sex? Don't let your hopes (or something else come up for it). Their idea of ​​eccentric sex is a woman on top, fully dressed, trying to strangle her mate with a tie. Not exactly my good time idea.
