Lucio Fulci, a director who is not renowned for his subtlety, reluctantly tries his hand in the black humor of the Touch of Death, which was created for a television film about Lester Parsons (Brett Halsey), a psycho who seduces and kills rich widows to pay his gambling debts. Begin with a wonderfully cruel scene in which a deadly lothario has his last victim through a chainsaw, ground machine and hungry pigs, the Touch of Death starts promising, but Fulci will soon lose control of control, showing a strange sub-conspiracy include a mysterious copycat killer and some heavy handed 'comedy' scenes. There are several other graphic murders that are extremely violent and fearsome in the true Fulci fashion, but even a high level of bloodshed does not prevent it from being one of Fulci's worse efforts. As I have with many of his other films, the clear story is not exactly on the agenda when Lucio is behind the camera. This film has many peculiarities that left me more than a little confused: why did Lester not destroy all his victims using the dilution method he saw at the beginning? Why are all his victims either furry or mutilated? The hell is that everything ends? Fulci is considered by many to be one of the 'greats' of the horror film; I do not understand his popularity when I find that most of his films I have seen so far generally lack good stories and technical knowledge. Touching death will definitely not change anything.
