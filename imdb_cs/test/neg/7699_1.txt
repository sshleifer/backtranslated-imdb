This film was one of the worst I've ever seen, not leaving out one clichÃ© one could imagine about Hollywood's so-called Thriller. The protagonist is a loving father and a private investigator who deals with a special task: to find out if the suspicious film "snuff" is real. Certainly, he's involved in deeper and deeper, blurry pornoshopes (running mexicans) and sex theaters are his field investigations while he is searching for woman murderers in a "snuff" movie. With the help of a "clever" (reads book), the sexshop employees catch up with the murderous producer of slavery and his personal perverts, who are responsible for the film ... ... and what do you expect? They are shown as a simple evil, no need for explanation, background, history: they are evil, and he is a cleaner. Boom. Killer of murderers. End of film. Is it so bad? Yes, I'm afraid so. Ironically, the "machine" (mega-pervert that he killed) even points to his ridiculous character: In the last scene our hero forces the "machine" to put off his leather mask (yep, of course he has wearing it) and recognizes that the "machine" looks like a normal street guy. Then "machine" says: "blablabla I'm not a monster, my parents never abused me, I had a nice childhood, I just do what I do!" I just love to kill people. Yeah, sure, "everyone loves killing people" (Bender). It is not just a complete lack of character that made this film so boring, it is also ugly "I have to kill these people" - a helplessness that makes you sick. In one scene, our hero tied one of the murderers and tried to shoot him ... but he can't. So what does he do? She calls the mother of the slain woman, says her baby is killed and asks her if she loves her baby so much that she wants to see the dead killers. Mother cries yes, loves her baby, returns to the bound killer and kills him. To this point: This film breathes the unpleasant air of supporters of Lynchmobs (certainly the police play no part in it), moralizes it in a ridiculous form against pornography, doesn't take its characters seriously and loses time with a stupid plot. Probably the only good thing about this movie is that it doesn't pseudo-psychoanalysis ... even if it is too much conspiracy. Don't waste your time on this. /> <br />
