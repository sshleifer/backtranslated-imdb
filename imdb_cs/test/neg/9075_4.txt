I chose this movie because I was looking for a friendship between a girl and two boys. As I lived this situation and lost myself in it, I hope a similar story will inspire me. My main problems include: - Why (a) & How (b) form a triangle? - Why (c) & How (d) triangle degenerates? <br /> <br /> (a) The film offers a simple answer: "because it's better!". (b) Here's an open triangle: three things share together. The mine was closed: everyone knows the others, but the three are not together or missing: <br /> <br /> (c) The film does not offer spoken explanations but rather visual and emotional assumptions: the end comes with sensuality, sexuality that it appears in a triangle, or more precisely, when deep feelings are tied to intimacy for one member, and may be divided when it comes to second and first. I agree with that. <br /> <br /> (d) In the movie and in my story, it's silent proof that something is wrong. And in an ironic and painful way, a tool for this sad time, there's always a phone: I lived this horrible planned phone call: "Call me back: Waiting for you" ?? and when the time comes, the phone is silent. A variation is also shown when the line is connected, but one refuses to speak? All these scenes were very hard for me to see. <br /> <br /> If the film was so big, it also got a lot of flaws: <br /> <br /> - I turned on the boy's family problems <br /> <br /> - why is it cut out in the scene shower scene on DVD cover? - How does Mickael finally get to the hotel? Cl√©ment always sees Salome? he states "no" but has her address; and who is the girl with him in the bar: his girlfriend? how can i know about ??? <br /> <br /> - What happens to Vanessa: The ring at the final shooting is proof of commitment ??? with whom ?????
