One of the worst movies I've seen this year. Everything about the movie screams "AMATEUR". For a movie from the 1800s, they all talk like the 1990s. Playing, especially people who play white slaves, is terrible. After about an hour I went out to this movie. This is a waste of time and effort. For a much better film on the subject, see Steven Spielberg's far better "Amistad."
