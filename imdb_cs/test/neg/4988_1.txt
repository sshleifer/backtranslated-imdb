When Underdog made his debut in 1964, I was instantly addicted at the age of 7. It was the Top Dog in my book- (that is, until Batman premiered on ABC for a year or so later). Even though it was clear that Disney would be doing a live-action version of the once-popular Saturday morning cartoon, it was just as clear to me that it would be a piece of crap. Reading the newspaper reviews seemed to confirm that. However, I made it a point: a) never try to write a review if I haven't seen the movie from start to finish; and b) you will never spend one red penny on a film that I am almost sure I will hate. <br /> <br /> With YouTube I: a) I am fully eligible to post this review; and b) it only cost me 84 minutes of my hard earned time. It also proves that this film is not just a piece of crap. It's a smoking pile of dog droppings. It resembles a TV series just in the title, although it almost made it right with Simon and Cad. All in all, Underdog is a huge waste of time and money, which I fortunately did not do. t have to spend. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
