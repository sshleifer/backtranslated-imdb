The only thing that interests you in this film is his subject. Look at Manson's "family" from the perspective of family members themselves is a great idea. However, trying to understand the incomprehensible is something that can only really be done in a masterpiece - and that's not it. Probably because so much information got into the script, this movie was created in a false documentary style, with reenactments thrown in. as character, story, theme and so on. Worse, there is an incredibly weak sub-plot thrown into the one that follows the little band of Mansonit on the last day as they follow a reporter working on a murder story. It's a silly and meaningless and complete waste of time. All in all, this film is one big missed opportunity. One ray of sunshine is the acting of Marc Pitman, who plays Tex, who has done most real killing in real life. While female characters look like nasty airheads in the 60s flashbacks, Pitman manages to convey a real feeling. <br /> <br /> In short, don't bother with this movie.
