My friends and I rented this movie that confuses it with another about skateboarding. Watchin Steve Guttenberg as an action hero is cheerful. The movie is so incredibly predictable and over the top it ended up being a laugh fest. Although I gave it 1/10 this movie should be seen, especially if u can catch it on TV anywhere.
