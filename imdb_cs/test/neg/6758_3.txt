The remnants of an assaulted army unit will join with a group of cowboys who will fight over the Indians on the war. It sounds like it might be an exciting western, but this is boring, boring, boring. It moves like molasses, action scenes are uninspired, acting is a walker, writing is flat, even photography is not very good. Eastwood, in a very early role, plays a former companion who doesn't like the idea of ​​fighting on the same side as the Yankees. This is probably the only interesting situation in the whole movie, but Eastwood has not experienced enough actors to pull it out, and his character appears more grumpy than angry or outraged. Very common west. In fact, it's less than an ordinary West. It's worth seeing if you're a tough Eastwood fan and want to see him at the very beginning of his career. Otherwise, don't bother.
