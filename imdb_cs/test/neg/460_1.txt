The stranger was excellent. Many writers tried to copy it. They all did a bad job (or almost). But Dead Space is the worst copy of Alien. Due to bad actors, bad special effects, BAD and other bad stuff (it would take about 3 pages to make everything wrong in this movie about 3 pages. The movie wasn't too long and it's a very good thing (Can't laughing because it's too serious ... that's a bad thing because in almost every science fiction movie B you can laugh all the time, sometimes it can be awesome but instead watch this stupid, just watch alien or Event Horizon ... these are much better !!!
