I have 10 plus yearly computer games with better special effects! The fence is choppy and very predictable. Most actors seem to be additions without experience! Everyone has Scottish accents. It's like watching a crew of 'Scotties' from Star Trek without a personality or spell. Necessary scenes of people who build tents! Tents with all the supposedly advanced technologies! The actors looked as if they were unsure whether the camera was on them. Nothing that interests you if these people survive or not! It looks like it was made in one's garden and garage using low power equipment! Nothing seems to be original or easy. Don't waste your time!
