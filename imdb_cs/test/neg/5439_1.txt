If I could, I'd give this movie zero. How anyone could evaluate it is behind me. As long as I didn't see the Rollerball, it was my choice for the worst movie ever made in a big studio with a real budget (I claimed Mangler 2 or Leprechaun in the hood because the worst doesn't say much, you should be bad) she needed surgery or something for him to agree with this nonsensical garbage. I'm not really sure what happened here. The novel was great, director Frank Marshall had a solid record with Alive and Arachnophobia (perhaps they should change the title to Africa), the cast was good and the budget was there. Do you think anyone would bother reading the script. <br /> <br /> You should watch Battlefield: Earth before you lose time with. Congo leads you to return MST3K
