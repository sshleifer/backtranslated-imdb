This movie is just scary, as talented talent has done this is beyond human faith. I believe they had to be boozing when they thought of this idea, I feel like my 2 hours of life have been taken from me. Harvey Kietel will try and distance himself from this waste, it was supposed to be a big crime movie, but it evolves into a bloody mess of vampires. to the lowest common dominance, movies can raise us and remind us that life is worth living, this film just depresses you. As DeNiro said in one movie the saddest thing in life is useless talent, this film is a perfect example of this statement.
