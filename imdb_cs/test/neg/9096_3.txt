Gordon goes to the top in a typical Full Moon fashion, but that can be expected. Combs is a surprisingly low key that keeps its performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing. Also away is the usual black humor Stuart Gordon 'tongue-in-cheek'. The film is very effective when it shows how Combs broke up and his last heroic act saved his wife and daughter. In fact, you feel compassion for his character, despite his short arrivals. Personally, I was more surprised by the nudity and the frontier porn sex scene before I was shocked by the graphic violence and gore. Not classic Gordon, but something you might like if you saw his more famous movies.
