Combine good casting, bad writing, good orchestral score, bad dialogue, and a good story idea with lots of potential but never realized then you have Slipstream. Just bought a movie for a buck, it's worth it, but not much more. Good to see Mark Hamill act again. There should be a decent sequel to repair the damage from the original. Or at the very least, pay due attention to receive it in the first place. Berstein's score has taken your attention away from the opening credits, but the long shots of the aircraft and the even longer revelation of interesting plot points will diminish his attention. It's a really easy canine movie like this, after all it's STARWARS maker and TRON director and a huge cast, but that's what it is. And that's not much. <br /> <br /> Favorite line- "We'll do it, ha-ha! ... (BOOM!)"
