Bronson took the money and ran with this film; Must Have Domestic Payments Like Me! This low-budget movie made in Mexico reminds me of a few Italians who come from the seas. I heard, I don't know if it's true, but companies do these movies abroad for tax purposes. I believe it because otherwise they would do this movie, it wouldn't make it. We had a lot of Canadian stinkers because the government gave tax breaks to create the film industry. I wonder if it paid off in other countries like Canada. Anyway, back to topic, this film is badly made in every aspect, I believe they grabbed Charles Bronson to sell it. the dead body at the end looks very fake. 3/10
