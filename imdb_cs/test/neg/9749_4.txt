This is probably the only movie I've seen where IMDb reviews on both sides of the spectrum are 100% accurate. "The Stupids" is a gruesome, dark film with absolutely no artistic merit, and is a dirty director like John Landis. And that's what's great. In order to appreciate The Stupids, you have to remember the little known but very true principle that director Abo Kyrou said: learning to watch bad movies is so noble. "In order for a film to work, the film must create and follow its own logic, and if it does so convincingly and sincerely, then it is possible for the film to work. For example, when you watch" Freddy Got Fingered "as a traditional rough comedy, it's complete and sheer waste, if you're looking at it as a neo-surrealist comedy, it's brilliant. <br /> <br /> It also works with good movies. If "Jaws" didn't accept the reality they created, the end of the air tank explosion would But many people think that "Jaws" are overrated for this kind of reason and are not bad. But it has strengths, isn't it? The important thing is that a film like this makes sense when looking at it with the right Some people, like me, get it now, while others never matter how often it is explained.Jim Jarmusch made a persuasive defense of "Showgirls" once, even after I haven't seen it yet from his It doesn't mean it's bad, if you have the right frame of mind while watching this movie (and I DON'T STONED, I'll put it in the bed now), you can really enjoy the movie for stupid, cheap, senseless grotesque late. 80s / early nineties in the style of farce that it is. Defenders and hatred of this movie are right: it's STUPID, and that's the reason. The film adopts the stupidity of the characters much in the same manner "Jerk" received Navin Johnson's idiots. And because it takes and runs with it, the film focuses solely on passing this graph and defining characters. The "bad" movie would actually do this and fail to use this logic correctly; The bad movie is bad because they do it when they go together, while movies like "Stupids" know where it goes, what it does and why from the beginning. I can't defend a film from an artistic point of view, so I give it such a low rating. Acting is mostly bad, jokes are very superficial and the quality of live events is likely to ruin what would be a cartoon. But I cannot deny that she is entertaining in her own way, so I defend her. I got it now, and I pity those who don't. I admit that I was attracted to this movie because of the brilliant look of Christopher Lee (he hears him say, "Unleash the bee drive!" "it would be worth the rental price, even if I hated this movie), but I was amazed to find out that besides Applause Sign with Jenny McCarthy, I was never bored and never disappointed. " In fact, many jokes, because of their cartoonish context, were hilarious (particularly airbag-cigarette explosion). They were stupid, but they were funny. And the film does not pretend to be anything else: STUPID comedy about STUPID characters and, instead of apologizing for it, enjoys herself. And that's exactly why it works.
