Wow ... I assumed this was wrong ... But now I'm just embarrassed for the words ... Frankly, no words can make this movie fairly ... <br /> <br / I'm trying to say something like this ... <br /> <br /> This is truly one unique gem. One of the worst species. Lash La Rue - Because of his background as an actor - makes the whip-fight with Toltec wizard-zombie during the top of the movie ... ??? A real move genius, no doubt. <br /> <br /> It rarely happens to laugh out loud when watching a movie. It happened many times with this. Accents of actors, man, accents ... And the dialogues I heard talked ... And that alone ... I just couldn't 'Believe what I heard. The fat uncle fleeing so loudly (walking to the house with his little nephew) for no apparent reason ... <br /> <br /> Breast! Yes, there are goats! A female ass! There's even a nude chick in the tub, drinking beer ... <br /> <br /> That "stretch your mouth over your face" - it was a bomb! Skutečný vrchol. The comedy-aspects were just absolutely bonkers. I just couldn't believe what I saw and heard. I even thought for a moment that they were unintentional, shaking their heads in disbelief. But about halfway through the movie, I started getting a bigger picture. I guess it took me half a movie to get into the half of my brain to finally get it. <br /> <br /> I was really hard to believe this movie ... But it's good, I think, I think. She had one black chicken that went up to a very small closet, opened it and then said, "Wooow, look at all the storage areas!". And she said it like she meant it. I think it's a good dialogue and a good meeting, right? Oh, and maybe needless to say: Lash La Rue is a whip-skill to suck the main ass in DARK POWER. It's really sad and pathetic. This is, of course, part of the comedy. Or wait, maybe I'm wrong. No, yes, I'm wrong. Lash La Rue was amazing with a whip! It was the editor's fault. You broke it, cut your lashes and everything. Or wait, maybe it was a camera operator. He turned from wrong angles ... So why didn't Phil Smoot say anything? That's it, it's the director's fault. But it's a good movie. I'm going to stop talking about it. I have nothing meaningful to say, except that I hope my brain will recover from this experience ... some time soon.
