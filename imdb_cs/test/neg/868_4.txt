Lame B-the horror that takes herself damn seriously with regard to her subject matter to the aging old dear who was transformed into the creature that night at the lodge who came to rent her room. When this person is killed, Mum must go out to make a living on her own, causing a certain family burden and also gaining some attention from the authorities. <br /> <br /> My main complaint is that this movie was supposed to bring FUNNY. It failed, though it had some mild gore and schlocky creature makeup effects to make the B-movie crowd happy. I saw worse, but I wouldn't give this rec - 4.5 / 10.
