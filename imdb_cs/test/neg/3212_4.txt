There are certain scenes in this film (as the first hero meeting with the super-merry Shirley Eaton) where it appears to be on the edge of breaking sexual taboos and making his premise (women want to rule the world by making men slaves) justice, \ t but he never dares. The result is a film without sexuality and some tame violence. Despite the disheveled plot, the film is not too bad until its peak, where its amateur run is becoming rampant (severe editing, overuse of stock footage). It is worth seeing as a curiosity. (* 1/2)
