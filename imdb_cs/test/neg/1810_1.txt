Taylor Deemer Ms. Drake English 10 PIB B4 March 31, 2010 <br /> <br /> Shot in the Dark <br /> <br /> It's difficult to go through the Heart of Darkness movie because it is incredibly threatening. The book on which this film is based has little action. So the idea that it would turn into a film seems like a totally involuntary idea, basically guaranteeing failure. Most of the book is about the mental travel of a young sailor named Marlow to work through the many dark Congolese endings and people as a whole? I feel that the screenwriter has failed massively to capture the essence of Marlow's travels. This completely lacked the biggest problem of light against the dark. This is the main point in the book and when it is not translated into film, all that remains is 100 minutes of boredom and monotony. In this case, the question is asked why would anyone do it in a movie? Then there could be a better question, who would want to follow her? It is absolutely a chore to watch. If it didn't contribute to the grade in my English class, I would never consider watching a movie. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The heart of darkness is deprived of all insight and meaning when taken from the pages of the book. Novella is torture to read up to the last twenty pages or so, but in the end it's a pretty decent book. The film is like a shot in the dark without a chance in the world to hit your target. How can a book that is about the mental processes and realizations of darkness be portrayed in a physical, visual sense? I feel that it is impossible to accurately show ideas. I also feel that the time difference between a book and a film creates the main points that do not seem to be census at all. The Novella Heart of Darkness was released in 1902, while the film version of Heart of Darkness dates back to 1993. 91 years between them may be the reason for seemingly different terrains. Novella seems to have much harder conditions and the film does not depict the primordial sense of Congo. Congo, in the movie, just looks like another place, not a dark, inhuman place that the book is defeating this setting. I feel that it removes another major element that really contributes to the novel. With two of the biggest aspects of the story in the movie missing, a little decency that is in the book Heart of Darkness is gone. When the controversy of light versus darkness is the biggest issue, is not included in the film, does the whole movie seem to be incredibly unnecessary? It's a boring, insensitive and big waste of time. There's no reason to look at it. The book is devoid of any meaning it has. If it is necessary for some reason, read the book. Avoid the movie at all costs.
