First I saw better playing and more realistic makeup in porn movies. How bad was "Chris Moltisante" as Stewie Ungar? On The Sopranos, Chris is not taken too seriously and can be considered a comic relief. And then throw "Bobby Baccala" as one of his friends in Vegas. It's too much to take a dramatic film. Neither of the actors can play a serious role and is better suited as a second banana for Tony, Paulie or Uncle Junior. And I want to know who made makeup for this disaster? I want this person to be MYM makeup over the next 25 years, so I won't be one day. So that's all I'm going to write on this movie because it's not worth losing too much time. Yes, I know that Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirippa are their real names.
