Going to the movie with the right expectations, I liked this movie a bit. Like most reviewers who have seen this movie, I fully agree that the plot was thin, clich√©, and I could predict every twist from the beginning of the movie. But the dance sequences were very well done and I really enjoyed the fusion of classical and hip-hop dance (both of which I enjoy watching). The music / movie soundtrack was also very good, which made the "drama" of the scene more bearable. Leadership (Jenna Dewan and Channing Tatum) was fine as actors, but their dance throughout the film was impressive and fascinating. All in all, a film that is worth watching if you want to watch good dance sequences and this movie is much better than "You Got Served" in terms of storyline and drama. Then it doesn't say much again, does it? = P
