In fact, I liked his parts a lot. It had interesting twists. But it just left me, I saw the feeling of all the SAW movies. He admitted that the end was different from the typical Saw, but let's face it ... a group of boys who are unknown to each other (or so believe) that they have thrown themselves into an abandoned chemical factory .... <br /> <br But then it loses something. There is no intensity, there is poor group dynamics, there is no sense of urgency. Some nice twists at the end and it's definitely worth watching if there is nothing else on the plate but it just left me blank. .. the time has passed, but it did not satisfy.
