If this film becomes a holiday tradition, I will have to hide for Christmas for the rest of my life. How do you even think it could be compared to "amazing life"! It was absolutely terrible! The boy's singing twisted. And what on earth was the solution with his hair? Emmy deserves performance?! Please. Is it true that Lucci did OK, but Emmy ????? I think this film is a waste of money. The fact that they were so close to the original story pretending to give it a modern and retro look made it even worse. All accounts lacked enthusiasm and perseverance. Lighting, wardrobe, make-up, everyone seemed to want to go home. It's just a big deal of me.
