Patsy Kensit and some random Australian block star as a duo of bullshit bears in the middle of investigating a series of murders related to art galleries, but they can still find time to shoot juvenile thieves and suspect a brand new wife. of a male cop from adultery. The serial killer is no longer important anymore when a supposed wife lover (who is basically just her co-worker) is found murdered and the male cop becomes the main suspect. "Vision Tunnel" is a really boring, unlikely and thrilling Aussie thriller that seems to mimic popular sex-thrillers like "Fatal Attraction", "Disclosure" and "Basic Instinct". The characters are extremely one-dimensional and each of them is described in detail in the script. Fighting the status of police women in a congregation full of men, shooting-first-ask-questions-later mentality, alcohol problems through stress, etc etc? Even the unhealthy eating habits of cops are a running gag. Yawn! Kensit tries to make this film more bearable, but lacks the credibility and talent of a real heroine. The end-twist is more or less interesting (not original at all, think of it), but by then you have long stopped worrying about the characters. Scenes shot inside sex clubs look ridiculously fake and Clive Fleury's direction is totally untouched. What is a waste of time?
