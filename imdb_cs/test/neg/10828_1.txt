Right ... so you have a dam, tons of water (which seems to flow really really slowly) and a small town that is directly below the dam. Plunge into espionage, a seemingly unstable and dissatisfied architect and his son, and then add a weak conspiracy and bad behavior. All in all, if you look at this movie from a paid customer perspective ... I would feel extremely gutted if it were a paid movie. If you want to laugh ... then you really have to watch this movie.
