Everything about this show is terrible. His assumption even sets to get cheap laughs with bad writing. The "broken family" -theme has already been used too many times, especially the Simpsons, which is an excellent show with great writing and lots of laughter. Meanwhile, Family Guy has about five minutes of story in each episode, with a pile of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in. Now, if it was original or funny, sure, I think it was smart. But no, it's not funny at all. In fact, the only reason episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to easily launch an episode after an episode of this trash. Much of this show is unoriginal, and what is original is lame. It is also incredibly brutal and disrespectful, which in turn may be fine if it is still intelligent. The animation is not everything, but from the artistic point of view this show also fails, which again proves that Family Guy is striving for as many cheap jokes and simple keyboard shortcuts. People enjoy this show and I don't care because people can enjoy whatever they want, no matter how much they focus on the lowest common denominator. But no, I do not recommend it, especially for anyone who ever wants to study film or become a writer. This is inexpensive entertainment that is low and has found success. The fact that it is so successful tells bad things about America.
