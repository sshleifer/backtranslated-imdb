Well, once again I didn't see "Silence of the Lambs" ... but I think I'd be sick if I saw it in front of this piece. Not from the terrible violence, but from the lack of everything else. Anthony Hopkins was very good as Hannibal and I really believed he was as psychotic as himself, but he himself, according to the audience reaction around me, was filled with a clich√© of "Silence" that left me in points where others they laughed at what was on the screen. Now I heard that the movie would be very horrible, and if the director wanted to balance people ... did it ... only in 2 sequences? I mean, if you want it to be creepy and I think it's so horrible that you play a movie out of it ... you'll need more than 2 sequences. The movie jewel that ultimatley takes you to another place and time, or either goes to the top (which is mostly in bad taste). But this movie let me sit in my chair and fall asleep sometimes. Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore are the stars of the movie, right? Well, except for Hopkins, I didn't feel like this. Who cared for a stupid Italian policeman? I certainly didn't. So the movie is actually a big hole that talks about a guy who will die anyway. I mean, come on ... who cares? In short, the film is good if you want to see Lector and Starling again, but if you are going for a really good thriller. You jump once and you may be twice. It depends on your level. Thinking about how much money this movie will bring ... probably the next "Hannibal" will be made and this movie will probably not be on video until autumn. If you have to see it, wait and save $ 3.50 - $ 4.00 and get it on video. Don't spend big money on this movie.
