While the film has one redeeming function, that is, some noticeable shots, such as a shot of sheep hanging from a tree, a scene of a funeral procession on a raft, or a scene of ships leaving a village (which seemed to be affected by a scene where warships approached in the fantastic "Fellini Satyricon" ), were more photographic than cinematographic and would be better appreciated hanging on the art gallery wall than they would be in a painfully slow movie coming at an incredible 162 minutes and suffering from terrible dialogue, extremely poor character development, acting, uninspired symbolism and heavy stylization . This is the first movie I saw at Angelopoulos, and his reputation preceded him, I expected much better, but I honestly say it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I won't go out My way to watch some of the director's future work. Four friends I went to see with approval.
