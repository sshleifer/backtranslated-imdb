This film is worth nothing. I mean, if you want to watch this kind of thing, go to Hollywood movies! This is absolutely a shame in the name of Bollywood. Neal N Nikki really sucked! Never look at this movie. As for the actors, the acting genes seem to have skipped one generation. Tanisha couldn't wear less, and Uday Chopra was apparently chosen because he was the director of a spoiled son. (Everything Halla Re was incredibly stupid) The song is eh, and I hope the director didn't spend a lot of money on it ... Don't let your kids watch it, and if you have it in your home it's a stupid movie, so drop it! Buy a CD if you have to. (As I said, the songs are eh.) At least it's better than a movie.
