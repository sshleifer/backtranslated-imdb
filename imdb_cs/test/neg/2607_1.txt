Wow. After seeing this film, you'll know why American youth still lacks intelligence and all the features that contribute to the well-being of society, except they don't want to work anymore. Jackass Number Two stars of some of the most repremandable people imagine who at that core is missing some kind of talent or brain to do something of themselves (especially Bam Marger and Steve-O), and there is only one option for fame making living fun those as stupid as they do by injuring them there. Whoever drinks horse seeds? Just disgusting. Man giving fish hook over face and acting as "bait" for sharks? This is not humor, it is evidence for its institutionalization. Overall, I came out of the theater without hope for humanity.
