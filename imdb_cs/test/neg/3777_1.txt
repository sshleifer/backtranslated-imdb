The parallels between this film and "Captain Walrus" (an independent film that was screened at the 1994 Team Projection film festival) are so brilliantly clear that every praise for "Sally Marshall is not a stranger" must be seen knowing it's a ride riding on the success of another work. In Captain Walrus, two young boys (Geoff and Roger, playing Dean Turner and Brett Allen) are exploring the bizarre behavior of their new Britney neighbor (played by Louise Farley). ). As the two boys watch the telescope, they watch repeated visits to a uniformed man called Captain Walrus (played by Peter Sargent). However, the emphasis on Captain Walrus is on the absurd and somewhat powerful Britney's hungry actions and less on the friendship between the two boys. Critical Success at the Film Festival, Conspiracy Captain Walrus was apparently appropriated and re-inflated to give the Australian film community another notch in the belt with regard to the baby's product. Although Sally Marshall is not an Alien, it's a fine film and its producers are due to the fact that his inattention leaves something he deserves.
