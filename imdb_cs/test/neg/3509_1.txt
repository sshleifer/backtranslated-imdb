I saw this "movie" partly due to the sheer number of good reviews on Netflix and I leaned on a valuable lesson. It's not a lesson about ethnic diversity, but ... the lesson I learned is "Don't trust reviews". Yes, racism sucks and people are complicated, but people who really need to see this film will be the ones who are least attracted to and least affected if they see it. The only reason I can think of the number of good reviews is that it is being reviewed by people who are not used to thinking, or who have seen their first film that provoked thoughts, and somehow thought that Haggis invented the concept. In fact, he basically made this film, which should be called "Racism for Dummies", as emotionally shocking as possible, seemingly giving people who do not spend a lot of time thinking the impression that they have discovered some basic truth that is they have never been covered with film before. Zen and the art of Maintanence is not ... A pilgrimage special for mindless masses, cut into pieces with exaggerated pieces of ham to facilitate swallowing without excessive introspection. It is as if they portrayed everyone as the worst possible extreme, just to please us that we are such good people because we do not meet characters. Let's face it. NOBODY identifies with these characters because they are all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes (or predictably reverse stereotypes). It's well done (though the dialogue is horrible) and cleverly executed, so much that you don't think you're asking "where is the beef?" until you say the movie is down. The blazing car scene was well done, like much of the movie, but nowhere near the end. The news is very cumbersome, and since the "backstage" blurb, the producers have been clearly watching a different movie because there is very little laughing in this movie, even during the designated funny part. I must emphasize that this is not about entertainment, rather about teaching diversity in high school ... call it "blood on the highway" of racism. They could even show it in high school if it wasn't for the "side naked" shot of Jennifer Esposito. Everyone in this movie is twitching and everyone learns a lesson (except Michael Pena). who gets the best role, but the most predictable storyline. This is a bad movie, with bad writing and good actors .... ugly cartoon created by Paul Haggis for people who can 't handle anything but bold moves in narration .... picture painted crayons. Crash is a depressing little thing that provokes emotions but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things.
