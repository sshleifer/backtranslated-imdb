I watched the first two nights before I came to IMDb and was looking for some information about the actor. I saw a 9+ rating that surprised me because I wasn't so impressed by what I saw. (As a reference, I am convinced that Lonesome Dove was the best television western ever. I grew up next to MGM in Culver City in the 1950s and have a sense of respect for the Western genre.) So I saw glowing first review and decided to read "more". There I found a few reviews with 1 or 2 stars that summarize my feelings well about the lack of character development, poor editing, the feeling that it was shot at the Universal back lot (MGM is long gone), and the overall impression that it was not getting closer to to change my feelings about LD. My impression is that the overwhelming vote of those who decided to write was "less than 4.0". <br /> <br /> This led me to think about the 9+ process. If people who give 10 and 9 years do not take the time to justify their vote, is the ballot box filled with people with monetary motivation? I have been using IMDb for a long time as one of the movie projection tools and I thought it was the best. I'm not so sure now.
