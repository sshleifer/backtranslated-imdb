I didn't want to write this film on review and criticism in the Western world, I think how badly they were about Asian cinema, which has now become a basic diet of Hollywood remake of monsters? Plus Jet L is pretty damn cool and has made some interesting movies in Asia. So with an open mind, I was surprisingly averaged by this film. There are good points. The story is very clever, uses M-theory as a basis to shift the plot that there are several universes, each with its own versions of the worlds, and most likely you. Every time one of you is destroyed, the rest share energy and power between them. The idea that someone might try and intentionally become the only version of themselves in all the Universe to see if they have become God. There's also Jet Li, and he's not a bad actor, and he's pretty agile like a martial artist, plus Jason Statham, a versatile good actor. As for the special effects, some of them are really cool, mixing time and slow motion with normal speed, very cool to watch in places. <br /> <br /> Bad points? But Statham's accent is frightening and some of his effects are not as comparable as others, so it is clear that the money was spent on some of the main shots and not on others that were probably considered too short on the screen or simply plain. out of budget. A big painful point for me is the narrow, shy action of a camera that Hollywood has long favored, which Jackie Chan has often spoken about. Shooting close-up combat scenes serves two purposes. It puts more emphasis on one stroke or movement, so it looks harder and more realistic than it actually does, and also hides what's going on around the camera lens. For example, people with a fake shoulder or a stunt double face, etc. <br /> <br /> What Chan always said was that he tried to open the camera and show the viewer what's going on, let them see people fighting right rather than close up of face and fist cutting on someone falling into frame. The whole picture turned out to be more effective and more impressive. So close cropped pictures were just more annoying than anything else, you couldn't see the impulsiveness of Li's combat skills, and you found it hard to see the part of the action. Slow down cuts and move Hollywood camera directors! The biggest problem, however, was the story, although he had such a strong base to build on, he lost his sense of action and focused on action scenes. There are some serious conspiracy constructions and explanatory moments that are simply completely overlooked and covered in the space of several sentences, but these could form some excellent and complex character development. It's just held together too The story was not created enough. All in all, not a great movie and its potential was badly spoiled.
