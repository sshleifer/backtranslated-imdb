This film was * good * relatively during the first parts of this film. <br /> <br /> We have a story from 3 points of view. So let's find some clues and finish the story. Oh wait ... none of this is important because the FBI guys are bad! Though it was a big deal ... it was almost a terrible twist. I immediately lowered the film from 7 maybe 8 to 3 based on the last 10-15 minutes. Does anyone else see why this twist is so bad? Yes, it's a good shock. But it's bad because it has nothing to do with the previous hour and twenty minutes. There is no connection with the murderers. The killers are in all 5 minutes of this movie (as killers) and two FBI agents are in just 15 minutes of the previous hour and twenty. We get it ... surveillance ... Oh, Killers are voyeurs. THERE ARE NO PICTURES because they were only described in limited terms as mere psychopaths. An hour and twenty minutes of observation we watch out of 3 stories comes out of the window as everyone is dead in 5 minutes. <br /> <br /> All this makes the end even more ridiculous. In the beginning they killed a lot of FBI agents ... what are the FBI agents sleeping together? Everything in the same room. To be found and murdered by amateurs and then personified by people who know nothing about FBI agents? A police officer, 3 meters away, apparently cannot hit one, with a standard police gun that can fire several shots. I hate movies that try to make you feel like it's real when they make absurd jumps they think we're going to believe. of assassins with a girl standing in the field somewhere ...
