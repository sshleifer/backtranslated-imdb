In short, this film is a declaration of artistic bankruptcy. Almodovar is easily the most important European filmmaker of the 1980s and 1990s. No other living director has created the style and content of contemporary European cinema more than he does. It is therefore not easy to say that his last effort is not just another disappointment after two unreal films, but rather a complete and complete disaster that confirms that he has not received ideas, humor and worst of all, empathy for characters. Creates. It's not because of the complexity of the story. It is almost impossible to summarize all of Almodovar's films. This time it's actually quite easy if you're familiar with his earlier work. "Broken embrace" is a remake of "The Law of Desire", this time the director is a straight and jealous lover is a millionaire. <br /> <br /> For those of you who don't know the movie, make a summary. If you don't want to know too much, skip this paragraph. A blind man who used to be a famous film director seduces a sexy woman who reads a newspaper after an accidental meeting on the street (yes, really, it starts). At that moment his agent and best friend's visit comes to him. He mentioned that he had learned from the paper that a millionaire had died, a 14-year-old story. He can still see and is going to drive his next movie. Staring an inexperienced mistress of the millionaire as a leader because he is beaten immediately. A millionaire reveals their affair over the silent videos of his gay son, which he has lips-synchronized by an interpreter (a few cool scenes: Cecilia Roth). After violent quarrels, the lady escapes with the director to the seaside resort, where she learns that the millionaire who made the film had it released in the worst possible cut, destroying the director's reputation. The couple decides to return, but has an accident in which the director blinds and the dying actress dies. He now learns that his agent has kept the film's negatives and begins to reconstruct it. As in "Bad Education," there are various sub-conspiracies that improve this rather thin story and, as in "bad education," the result is more confusing than satisfactory. For example, the son of an agent who works as a DJ has a random drug overdose - which is totally unnecessary for conspiracy, and also interpreted somewhat wrong. Mostly, however, actors are not to blame, but the way their characters are written. Blanca Portilla as an agent has so many skeletons in the skeleton that even brilliant performance cannot save the character from derision. Lluis Homar is an old man's dream of a protagonist living in an artificial world where an English alias and a few sweet words can seduce any super model. Penelope Cruz is the epitome of this old man's sexual fantasy. Her character is completely lifeless. It remains inexplicable why she would go from one old man who at least helped her family to a slightly less old man who is not charming enough to convince himself as a romantic hero or a passionate passion. But all these shortcomings wouldn't make this film so bad. However, Almodovar makes the worst possible thing for a director (or any type of narrator) who gets ideas: he quotes himself, something he does more and more, and very few benefits. The film-in-film, which "Broken Embraces" uses as a plot-driving device, is actually "Women on the verge of a nervous breakdown" (1988), this time called "Chickens and Suitcases". This somewhat unimaginable name can help you get to this beloved classic here: while the dialogue that makes the last ten minutes of "Broken Hugs" is a frantic exchange of worm players in the original movie. , here's a strict, colorless, annoying business meeting. Finally, the DOA is the brain of an exhausted creator of past wonders, almost as awful and unsatisfactory as Indiana Jones's last feature. Maybe so many people would disagree with it, because Almodovar was such a genius. I would rather offer my respect for his achievements by humbly asking the reader to watch "All About My Mother", "Tie Me" or "High Heels" or "Matador", all of which testify to the unique Almodovar and unmatched talent. Several such movies and his legacy can be very well destroyed.
