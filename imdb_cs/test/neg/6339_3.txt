Disappointed comedy-drama with sentimental cover has Michael J. Fox ideally cast as a former child star who now manages a talent agency for thespian tots; His assistants are Nathan Lane and Cyndi Lauper. All this sounds as if it could not be, but too many scenarios are given to Christina Vidal, who believes it will be another big thing. They lock their head locks quickly and bring the glowing dialogue back to an uninteresting finish. Fox and Lane are both attractive, but the energy of the early scenes gives way to destruction. Slickly made, but finally musty. * 1/2 from ****
