It is a shame. Here's an interesting idea, but it's completely lost in the confusion of Commodore 64's computer effects and bad storytelling. The plot, as it is, concerns the bounty hunter of souls. It should be a pretty straightforward hunter / hunted kind of story, but the director and / or writer seem to have forgotten what the film should be when they were about three days of filming. Things don't help the fact that the main baddie seems to be wearing a cheap Darth Maul mask, which they tried to disguise with the flowing CG colors. There is not much to recommend here, even the name seems to propel it into the unknown.
