I found an old version of this movie in my home, so I thought I'd do it. Right from the start I did not expect from this film and I am glad that overall the film was not good. Overall, the performance was very bad, even for Nicolas Cage. One scene with a radio controller stands out as woeful that I found it funny that the scene wasn't shortened. The first 30 minutes of the film had almost no developed storyline and I didn't know what was going on. The story itself had the opportunity to be decent, but the director was just bad or tried too hard to make his style unique. I managed to watch the whole thing, but I will never see the movie again.
