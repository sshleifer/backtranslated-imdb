I generally do not have negative comments. But because it is a festival piece, I do not want you to waste time when you could see something else that might not be played again. <br /> <br /> I thought the actors were pretty bad. For example, they did not fully play from each other, rather, they waited for RECITE their lines that were quite poor to begin with. The dialogue was really forced. Norman or whatever his name was trying to do, or it would appear to be funny and biting in the lines he chose, but he just fell really short. After the words he asked if anyone saw the coming of the end and some people were all "yes", and everyone, but he called them liars. See that there are so many clues, the biggest is a $ 500-hour money-box. I think John gave her at least 20 grams of her ... to tell the story of fairy tales. Now you don't know exactly what will happen, but the moment it actually happened, I wasn't interested in one thing. I was glad I got there. I asked him who shot the design and said 8.1, maybe next time he would wait for him to shoot until 15.3% needed a lot of work. But he seemed to be a pretty handsome guy, he's making his own movies, he's probably going to improve and I hope he does, not in the snotty way one, I think it, wish him good luck. Just remember, it's just my opinion.
