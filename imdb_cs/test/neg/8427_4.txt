I was sitting last night to see this movie, which is played on Greek television due to the upcoming Olympic Games hosted by my city. Knowing this was an American movie, I was expecting to focus more on the American athletic story. ready for it. But what I saw was ... too much! I mean, if a movie has such a title ("The First Olympics: Athens 1896"), even of American origin, you wouldn't expect it to be so propaganda and American athletes seem to have all the gifts of nature (strength, cleverness, generosity, kindness, kindness, courtesy ...) unlike their "sinful athletes" in athletics. Games that seem unable to even ... speak their thoughts or express feelings. The numerous times when an American anthem plays during a film must be a time record in filmography. it ridicules the Greek nation, such as the Greek citizens serving foreign marathon athletes with wine, to help the home winners in the race. So much for the Olympic spirit. <br /> <br /> Think about it. And putting a bad mark on a movie whose name is also Greek is something that doesn't satisfy me at all ut according to what I saw, I can't give more than 4 out of 10 (it's really generous actually).
