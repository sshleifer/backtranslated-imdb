Like anyone else who bought it, I was cheated by "20 pieces of extreme gore" and "banned in 20 countries" or anything that says in the box. I have to admit, I'm a huge gore fan and I'm always impressed when movies can put him on the fat and look convincing. Tom Savini, Rick Baker and Greg Cannom are among the best in the industry. Revolutionary Effects of Makeup in the 80s. You don't need them today, because everything's happening on your computer. But computers cannot compare to the visual magic that these three men could conjure up. But I turn. You watch fantastic bloody movies like Fulci's Gates to Hell or even Savini's coronation success, on Friday, the 13th final chapter, you can appreciate everything that goes into the frighteningly bloody movie. You can't tell the difference between reality and magic. I can't imagine why anyone would see Cannibal Ferox, but gore, who is seemingly all-powerful in this movie. If that's why you're looking for this movie, then you're wasting money. As many other reviewers have noted, most gore is a consequence. You don't see torture or bloodshed as it happens, you see what it looks like insights. <br /> <br /> Gore? Well, it's here, but not as much as one would have hoped or expected. Man is castrated and women hang on her breast, but then on these two scenes and one on scalping; There is not much else on this film. Both gore and these three are still quite tame compared to what you hoped. Maybe it's just me and my sick and twisted horror and gore genre, but I've been expecting a little more. Call me wrong or twisted, but isn't that the only reason people look at this movie first? I honestly found myself bored in many places. Cannibal Ferox is just another movie trying to make a great movie. While the cannibal Holocaust is not exactly a great movie, it is much better than this trio. If you go for $ 20.00, you will feel cheated. <br /> <br /> 3/10
