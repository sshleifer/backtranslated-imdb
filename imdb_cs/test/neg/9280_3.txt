The third and last big screen spin from the very popular ITV sitcom at the beginning of the 1970s, HOLIDAY ON THE BUSES is every bit as durable and rude as the previous two efforts, and the observation from the perspective of three and a half decades later is really not even that one movie was made in this series. What constitutes a conspiracy surrounds the adventures of Stan Butler (Reg Varney), his conductor Jack (Bob Grant) and their crazy autocratic inspector Blake (Stephen Lewis) after their ejection from their regular bus depot. They will all find jobs in similar positions in a holiday camp with the Proud Family (Doris Hare, Anna Karen, Michael Robbins) who follow him. British cinema had a well-deserved reputation for high quality in the 1960s, but much of this was due to US financial support and leadership which sadly drew near to how the 1970s shone. Later, notable home titles (GET CARTER are among those very few eptions) became so rare as Mick Jagger in stable marriage and British cinema went on the way of cheap budgets, slender and thoughtless sex comedies (series CONFESSIONS, COME PLAY WITH ME) and Flabby, elongated cellulose versions of various TV shows, mostly sitcoms (this is one of many nasty examples). Only the DAD'S ARMY and PORRIDGE have come up quite well in this regard, the unpredictable success of the first movie ON THE BUSES (it was the biggest boxing hit of the year 1971, meaningless to think now!) Has led to two more sequels. To be fair, the TV series had a merry, mature, non-PC vulgarity that was reasonably tolerable in half an hour. but stretching up to three times longer makes it more patience beyond faith. It is ironic that HAMMER FILMS produced this effort because it basically resembles a horror film in a literal sense, with ancient puns, shabby, badly timed slapstick and horrible, greedy production. values. The ability to send cheesine ss to a British holiday camp is wasted here for the aforementioned elements and is the most bizarre, if not fearsome, to see an apparently 50 something that Varney and the strange, long-haired Grant manage to instantly charm. young women barely in their early twenties while constantly laughing at their own bravado and lame jokes. \ tThe presence of Wilfrid Brambell (of STEPTOE AND SON) romancing in the age of Miss Hare will not help things even though the film lasts about 1 and Half an hour, it pulls to a continually depressing degree. Fortunately, this was the last film in this most desperate film trilogy, and the TV series itself ended around the same time, with the sequel (DO NOT USE WATER, which was critically deceived by critics and viewers ignored), followed in 1975 Most of the major actors involved were not seen much, but Bob Grant was the worst. Other Mental Problems for Many Years, He Commi The sad coda of the sitcom that was most popular of her era (not age-old enough) was to stay, rather than three financially successful but artistically hopeless large-screen large screens. happy memories and occasional merits of the television counterpart. RATING: 2 and a half out of 10.
