I think if you like watching dudes get "pumped" on outrageous size, that's up to your aisle. Otherwise, it is an ego exercise. Anyhoo, it's historically interesting, I think, to see how these muscle positive and brain negative chumps got like this (before / after / and between steroids) - but otherwise it doesn't affect many guys and, like women, well , I'm not one, so I can't say.
