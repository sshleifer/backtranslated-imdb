As a person who knows a movie ship and some other ships, I also don't see a movie as a movie. As a movie, it has some great, beautiful shots from the ship, most of which are done on an existing ship - except those that are in catastrophic scenes, of course, and certain rooms below deck. But as for the story and the dialogue, I can call it a big shit. Nothing like that could happen on such a sailboat. No wonder the movie had a bad impact on the existing ship - if I didn't know better, I wasn't tempted to make a certain voyage. Certainly, for Europeans, I recommend turning off when the ship is on the ground. After that, excessively emotional, the very American part begins, which I could not bear. Photos are really, really great, no wonder in Ridley Scott's movie, but if you can avoid listening to the text, it will be much better.
