oh well ... its funny. it was supposed to be a sadistic comedy, many horror films lack common sense, but I think a retarded cave man would try to go through this situation. Do not really expect Hitchcock or anything like that. that's good for friends, but I wouldn't recommend it for anything else. This film lacks all the essence of real horror, tension, shock and good characters. the killer could not be the unstoppable force I expected it to be, and it seemed to be the average angry student who could only outwit the stupid people. And the really funny thing is the horrible act and the lack of emotions of the so-called "victims" <br /> <br /> 3/10 expect this in everyday entertainment.
