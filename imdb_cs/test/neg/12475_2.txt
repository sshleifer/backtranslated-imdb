Almodovaru's film - always sends tingling to my spine. Large-format printing, which opens the latest feature of the Spanish author, instantly evokes memories of delicate nuns, subtle necrophiliacs, wisecracking transsexuals? And after a beautiful opening fitting, where the camera went through the cemetery with the wind that was overwhelmed by the pile of fever-filled widows, I thought Pedro got me under his evil spell again. Although I once gave up nostalgia, there was very little to fill the space. For a director looking forward to bringing mankind to murderers and thugs, he does a very bad job of finding any emotional depth or quality of life for women. Penelope Cruz is Raimunda, a stubborn housewife whose life is complicated by the accidental killing of her daughter. Luckily, he lives in Almodovar, Spain, where your friends will be happy to get rid of the corpse for a cocktail offer. Add the spirit of Raimund's mother to the melting pot and a number of other eccentrically warm matriarchs. "Volver" means literally a return and Pedro seems to be recycling old material. A partial plot of incest feels as if it is attached as a mandatory "taboo". Instead of commenting or subverting this issue, as is the case with his pedophilia treatment in Bad Education, he feels compelled and unconvincing amidst film film sentiment. I suggest that Almodovar call his next film, Salir (to continue).
