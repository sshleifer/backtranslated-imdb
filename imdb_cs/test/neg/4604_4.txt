In Los Angeles, the alcoholic and lazy Hank Chinaski (Matt Dillon) performs a wide range of unskilled features just to get enough money to drink and bet at horse racing. His primary and only goal is to write and have sex with dirty women. "Factotum" is an uninteresting, absurd and immensely boring film about an irresponsible drunk rogue who works a few days or weeks just to get enough money to buy spirits and gambling that are instantly released because of his unscrupulous behavior. According to the IMDb, this character would be a fictitious alter-ego by Charles Bukowski, and on the basis of this story I will never read any of his novels. Honestly, if the viewer likes this theme of alcoholic couples, he prefers to watch the moving and heartbreaking "Ironweed" of Hector Babenco or "Storie di Ordinaria Follia" by Marco Ferreri, based on the life of the same writer. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): "Factotum ?? Sem Destino" ("Factotum ?? Without Destiny")
