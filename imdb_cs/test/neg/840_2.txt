I honestly don't know where to start when I watch a movie pathetic when Ernest goes to Africa. In addition to two or three good laughs scattered throughout the film, there is nothing positive about this hourly loss of time and life. It's unbelievable that someone was able to round off a group of people willing to act, film and edit this piece of waste, and even more unbelievably that it was the eighth installment of the Ernest series. <br /> <br /> During the opening titles of the film, we see Ernest appearing next to various African objects, such as wooden masks and heads of African animals, who laugh at the faces and gestures that would probably make most of the sorts. This introductory scene gives the viewer an appetite for Ernest's frequent humor attempts, and shows how his comedy flips to 95% of the time. <br /> <br /> The first thing that really hit me on this movie is how bad it is. acting. Everyone in the film is a typical C-film actor, but Linda Kash stands out as especially horrible. It is the embodiment of overclocking; all her lines come with incredibly inhuman enthusiasm that you can only find in high school. Most high school theater students have probably replaced these actors and delivered more powerful performance. At least once, Jim Varney shows a comedic ability, but for most of the movie he acts like a complete retard, trying to be funny by doing silly faces and talking with different voices. Ernest Goes to Africa begins in Africa, where an archaeologist stole two precious jewels from the African tribe. The gems then go back to the United States, where an unknown man is seen from several followers through the flea market. Hiding them in a bucket of "two for dollar" items, and then running out of the scene. Ernest is looking for Rene, the waitress he likes, a gift so he goes to a flea market and of course buys gems unpaid. Later he takes them back to his house, paints them and joins them together to create yo-yo. He gives yo-yo to Rene and she explains they can never be together because he is just a mediocre shmoe, and she wants an adventure man. Rene and Ernest are followed by followers and then brought to Africa to be bred as prisoners. Most of the film doesn't make any sense. As soon as Ernest is in Africa, he falls out of the truck carrying him and lands in the river. In the next scene we see him as a Hindu servant named "Hey You". His skin is dark and wearing a lumbar fabric. At first, I thought Jim Varney was playing another role in the film alongside Ernest, but I immediately recognized Ernes' idiot when I started talking. The next scene that is absolutely ridiculous in my mind is the scene in an automobile hunt in the African wilderness. Rene and Ernest took the ostrich farm truck and the followers were persecuted. Driving about twenty miles per hour on a fairly flat road, both followers shoot at Ernest, who is in the back of an ostrich farmer's truck. Ernest, on the other hand, throws ostrich eggs at the followers and their driver. In a five-minute pursuit, the followers never met Ernest once, but Ernest was able to repel them by hitting them and their drivers in the face so that their car bounced off the road and exploded in a huge column of smoke. I would also like to add that Ernest is walking an egg, two at once, from a large bra. <br /> <br /> There's also an incredibly poor design in this movie. There is a large part of the film in which Rene and Ernest walk in Africa, trying to find civilization. During their journey, we see them walking through fields and jungles that could probably be shot anywhere in the United States. Fields are simply plain grassy fields, without any information that they are anywhere near Africa (could have at least digitally added some African trees in the background), and jungles look like rural Connecticut forests with paper skulls, vines, and thorns hanging from trees. According to IMDb.com, the film was actually shot in South Africa, but I wouldn't believe it at all. The film goes on and on, Ernest wit after Ernest's joke. The rest of the film has no meaning at all; African tribes all speak English for any reason, and Ernest is later challenged to the "Battle of Truth" by a leading follower, who is suddenly dressed in clothing that resembles that of a ninja, yet also somewhat resembles slavery to the submissive. The riser has a table of axes, swords, knives and drumsticks in front of him, while Ernest has a table with a sandwich, a teddy bear, and a few other worthless items. But Ernest wins the battle and ends up saving the day in some way. Overall, this film is painful to watch. I couldn't handle it in one session; I had to stop halfway and do something productive for several hours to compensate for lost brain cells and try to appreciate Varney's humor. They should really give the surgeon a general warning on the box so that people know they will actually be slightly more retarded when completing this movie. I must say that of all the movies I've ever seen, no one comes close to being as sad as Ernest Goes to Africa.
