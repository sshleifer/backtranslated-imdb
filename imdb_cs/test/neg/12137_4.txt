Boring like hell and kind of chicks flick. It is the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement, the romantic nature of one night standing, and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love. Many of the story's motifs resemble other recent KST films (eg, an English patient), but have much less appeal. <br /> <br /> After the first half of the game I started checking my watch, wondering if I would do it at home in time to catch Leno on TV. <br /> <br /> I passed the "Gladiator" to see it!
