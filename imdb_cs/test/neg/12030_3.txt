This home-made horror movie tells the story of a guy who kills people using the story of Edgar Allan Poe. The local police thwarted the case for several years, so now it has taken over the FBI. They know exactly who the guy is, but apparently nobody thought he was swinging at his house, because that is where he hangs, runs around in his old clothes and tortures random locals. So the FBI-Chick is kidnapped, which includes her father, a former local police investigator. To top it all off, a pack of wacky college kids chose to camp in the house and smoke a lot of weeds. Mostly an FBI agent closes screaming and running around like a little girl, and not one of those noble college students thinks he's just going to stop and take a Poe-boy hairy swing. Mostly overacted and sometimes underacted, Dead End Road smells a low-budget, cast-with-friendly production that has silly points too much to cover.
