Definitely the worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I can't find anything positive to say about this film (if this production is worthy of the word). <br /> <br /> This production is not even the standard of low-budget porn! My question is simply: why did anyone look at the script and think, "Hey, will we make a movie out of it? <br /> <br /> At the end of the movie, I wasn't even hoping "Nicole" would do that? She was really so annoying! So for your own interest, don't watch this movie ... if you don't want to lose 85 minutes of your life ...
