"Shade" is trying to be another "Sting" that replaces poker for racing as a means of destroying the enemy, but it fails. <br /> <br /> I watched the whole thing and still couldn't. quite understand why a young guy wanted to double his partner. Was it because his partner stole the girl? Is there any woman in the world who is worth to worry about? If it's there, it certainly wasn't. She had no redeeming qualities at all, and now she had a special room so the surgeon could remove the kidney from the one who picked her up at the bar? Dina Merrill briefly introduces herself as a wealthy woman who, from all things, is hosting a paid poker party in her palace. And then players say things like, "I'll see your thousands and raise another five thousand." Give me a break. You can't call ("see") and increase, do one or the other. Every boy playing Nickels and dimes at the kitchen table knows that; Do you think that adult men who play these bets would know that too - or at least knuckleheads who wrote the script. One of the other posters mentioned how no high-limit poker game would allow players to really deal with their own cards and I agree. You will not allow two of the most famous scammers in the car to play where the buy-in is $ 250,000 and then let them deal with each other. It's not poker; It is just to see which one can cheat better. And I would like to know what a person in his right mind would buy in a game in which two of the most well-known card frauds play and expect to have a chance to win? And of all that a mafia boss would run such a game? Every time Melanie Griffith came to the screen, I was so fascinated by the huge fluorescent red lips of her that I completely lost the plot, and when I saw her with Stallone, it was more like a public service announcement for a plastic surgery that was bad than love. Stallone mentions that she had been annoying before she bought the restaurant she now runs, but we don't know what her type was and we never see her working with Stallon on their younger days, so we have to wonder if we care too much. Jamie Foxx is the best character in the whole movie, but he immediately fires on the bat and we stay with the cardboard cutouts that all sound like them. read their lines again from the teleprompter just off camera. The end does not make sense even in this case. The boy gets his cut from the game and walks down the street with a suitcase full of money and his partner is nowhere to be seen? Mafia doesn't look at all the moves she does? Everyone else shrugs and quietly accepts the loss of millions of dollars without trying to recover it? I don't think that's the case. Most of all, this film makes a great injustice to professional poker players around the world, suggesting that the only way to win is to fire cards and play with "juicy cards." deck. And why are they always palming kings and aces? Sometimes you need three or nine to fill a flat or full house. <br /> <br /> The best work of the film is tricks that are at the beginning and end of credit. everything in between is ridiculous.
