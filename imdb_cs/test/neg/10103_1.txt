A terrible playing with the worst special f / x I've ever witnessed. It's bad enough that I wasted $ 3 for watching this pile of stupid things, but it's an hour and a half I lost that I could do something else like getting a root channel or volunteering for duty jury. Drunkers couldn't help this video either. To put it bluntly, I sincerely believe I lost a few IQ points while watching this idiotic piece of "numb" work! Maybe I should follow my own advice this time. Never expect a decent movie if it is written, controlled and made by the same person, and never expect anything valuable from Jeff Fahey.
