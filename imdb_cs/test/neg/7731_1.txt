I saw this movie in the theater when it came out for the first time, I'm sorry to say it, and it was one of the few movies I ever wanted to leave. I had no problem with drug content and I saw how this warning story could be strong. The problem was that the filmmaker working with James Woods and Sean Young drew the two least nice figures I had ever seen on the film. I hated this couple and I couldn't care less if they sank directly to the inevitable bottom. It wasn't one surprise in this movie. Every turn of events was so painfully obvious that I felt I had written the script myself; Even though I think I would do a better job. Subsequently, I heard the horrific incident stories on the scene between Sean Young and James Woods in the spirit of some sort of persecution. It made me wonder if the horrible act came from some bad feelings and dysfunction. Anyway, I refer to The Boost as the worst movie I've ever paid to see.
