We rented 3 bad movies to watch with your friends in the dorm. Leprechaun 4, Jack Frost and The Prey. I picked up Jack and Lepo 4 because they're well known bad movies I've never seen. I chose this movie because it matched the "How to find the wrong movie" guide on badmovies.org, no real description, no photos from the movie on back, and I never heard of it, I had to be the winner :) <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS, but this movie is so bad it doesn't matter: P) <br /> <br /> This is a bad movie TRUE, Lep 4 and Jack Frost are deliberately stupid it is stupid despite the best cast and crew efforts. This "movie" starts as Evil Dead, even actors look similar and have the same style of dress. Unlike Evil Dead, he never gets any speed at all. For the "slasher" movie it is quite bland, in 80 minutes 6 people kill, but these are spread so far that it becomes quickly boring. The director threw a lot of boring shots on the animals hunting, of course going along with the whole "prey" theme, but they don't do anything to advance the story and are pretty boring. Gore's terrible. All these other shots were supposed to replace the lack of script and story. <br /> <br /> The last 5 minutes of the movie are mostly shot in slow motion, another way to add length. "Peak" is such a complete joke that it's hard to laugh at it, it's so bad. The back of the box says, "The end will shock you and haunt you." Yes, it will, it will shock you that someone could put such a bad "fence twist" on the movie and "scare" you because you won't believe that you paid to watch this crap. Also slogan "It's not human and has an ax!" One person is killed with an ax in the whole movie and is off screen. True 1 out of 10. I love laughing on bad movies, but this is so bad that it lacks campy quality. No bad night of film competes without a real character: P
