I am a big horror fan and I bought this movie from all the hype that got on the bulletin boards. Well, let me tell you I don't know who all this hype did, but let me talk about a few things. Especially this movie is "no" a lot of things. It's not scary, not exciting, not too bloody, not too ill (except for one MAYBE season) NO scored well .... ALL. The film's premise is that the couple flee to a small island in Greece because they did a little stupidity in London. We don't even know what they did, but they're supposed to have killed someone. <br /> <br /> ** Spoiler Alert ** <br /> <br /> The male lead kills a few of his perverse perversions strangely. Killing is cheap, the characters are cheaper and the effects of suck. There is one part when she rapes a goat because his wife doesn't give him anything in the morning, but it happens without any care for being shot. <br /> <br /> the spoiler end <br /> <br /> The end of the movie is about one thing that's not entirely predictable. I especially enjoyed having a "shepherd" appear on her husband. By the way, if you can rent and have 2 hours to waste go forward. It's nothing better than a cheese sandwich on moldy bread. <br /> <br /> 3/10
