I watched this film with a group of Nazis, a French archaeologist and my ex-girlfriend on a small Mediterranean island. When the tape was running, my girlfriend and I tied up with a wooden peg at the far end of the cave. I told her to close her eyes and no matter what they opened. The Nazis and archaeologists did not close their eyes and started screaming after a few seconds. The faces of the Nazis melted and the head of the archaeologist exploded. After a few seconds the videotape jumped out of the video recorder and landed back in the box and the top closed. Me and my girlfriends remained unharmed. <br /> <br /> Following this experience, the video cassette was placed in a wooden box and stored in a large warehouse of identical wooden boxes that you will never see again.
