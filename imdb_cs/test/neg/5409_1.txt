If you want to get a few glimpses of the cleavage of some attractive women, this movie may be a second or two pleasure. If you like to see badly conceived and executed "action" scenes, there are many. If you are blind or deaf, I still recommend that you do not have this film in your presence. This is certainly the worst or very close to the worst movie I've ever seen. And it seems that there was some money for it. Talk about throwing money away! As an editor, I hope that the "editor" of this "movie" will never be allowed to edit a movie, book, or even post-it note. As a writer, I hope the author (s?) Will never be allowed even in a broken crayon. Do you think I do not recommend that you watch this movie. It is not so. Tape it (so you can stop your pain when you need it) and educate yourself how bad the film can be.
