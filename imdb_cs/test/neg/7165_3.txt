I liked several characters, but our leadership relied too much on a charming smile. I wasn't interested in two crumbs. He's making a bad decision, and I really didn't care, because there wasn't one. It seemed somewhat unintelligent. There were a few moments that gave a chance for some human insight (the whale scene was interesting), but they are lost in the general film malaise. Interest in love was acceptable, and other characters were slightly interesting, but the conspiracy turned too much and let me in many places in the movie. Finally, I wondered why I stayed so long. There are some lukewarmly funny moments, but in the end I didn't care. I can't understand the movie is higher. - 3 out of 10
