You know the movie could have been a lot better when the animal - in this case a small dog - is the best actor on the screen! The action in this film is so bad, so amateur that the dog watched in embarrassment. He ("Rusty," our Golden Retreiver) could do a better job than the people here. Now it's almost a fragile story: a child finds an animal, a pet is not liked or unwilling. One of the parents, but a "pet", rescues one of the children and is now a hero and official member of the family. Sounds familiar? I remember that this movie is a big hit, but I never got to it until the mid-1990s on VHS. I was shocked how bad it was. Why so much fuss about the movie? Was it because there was so much sleaze in the early 1970s that a pleasant family movie stood out in the crowd? Maybe. In the decade of the seventies, there wasn't a lot of healthy fun and a lot of people are babies for cute animal stories. Who could resist this cute dog? I do not. But the movie I can resist: it's a Class B story with terrible action. <br /> <br /> Recommended only for lovers of small dogs and I mean "lovers" because even the average pet owner falls asleep and tries to watch this movie at this age of age.
