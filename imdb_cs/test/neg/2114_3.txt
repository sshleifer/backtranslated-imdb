Right after watching first and it's very stupid. First I watched the Bones episode and then the eleventh hour. The 11th hour should be embarrassed. <br /> <br /> He's so weak. Stewart introduces himself as a government scientist. No mention of what kind of scientists is just a general sciency thing. In a cloning program, they bring a caretaker to the church who was paid for the destruction of failed embryos, and knelt him in front of a statue of Jesus on the cross and asked for forgiveness ... and also told them where the bad man was. how they can move the chart. Now it's science at work: (<br /> <br /> There is a stupid, not a good stupid, a little where Picard rages on a television that advertises skin screams that makes you look younger, shouting "It's a lie" like His Randy Assistant gets groped by local hot bobbie next door. <br /> <br /> The end of the first episode is like a bad cartoon where a bad old lady, named after Pinnochios Dad to move clunky land along, waves to Picard off the street when he gets into a taxi, Picard is one floor up and he looks out the window, getting angry ... she could try to escape ... or maybe the cops might ring or maybe you get a taxi number and you ring it or maybe you have something other than ... I'm waving and getting into a taxi and now you can't do anything about it until next week's ending ... mahhahahahahah It's a pity it's so stupid that Picard is convinced in one place that even though born son of clones re Plik, he would never be his son, because his son had a soul.Hats are right, a general scientist argues against cloning on the basis that each soul is unique and sure why you would otherwise want to clone. Although general scientist Picard discovers that cloning is a bit angry, it's all about stem cell research and goes so far as to say that calamity will hit humanity if it is not allowed. He has quite convincing praise about how important it is. Of course, he does not mention a single example. Such a show match. Buzz words and tawdriness.
