I just watched the Christmas Christmas holiday 2 appear on the DVD, and I hope to see something close to the original, great holiday comedy "Christmas Holiday". I didn't see anything like that. You can say right from the beginning that this movie just won't measure. It's too bad to have a title that links him to the original Christmas holiday. It's really sad. The film cannot stand its own merits. I think too many people will see this film in the power of the title and not come close to this level of comedy. Other than the title, there is very little film connection with the original 'Christmas Holiday' and even less connection to Christmas at all. The comedy is very simplistic and conspiracy poor. Children could find some humor here, but most adults would just laugh here and there. This movie is a flop. Don't waste time with him.
