Roll up! Roll up! It's Big Gay Bruce and his Big Gay Death Cannon! Credible land? Needless! Decent behavior? Needless! Respected by his mighty ancestor? Needless! Yes, it's another offensively stuffed Turkey in the Butch Bruce canon. I mean, where do you start with this movie? Okay, let's start with the pitiful misunderstanding that people might have, that it somehow related either to the book or to the original film Jackal Day. It is not. In fact, it's so different (and so bad) that Fredrick Forsyth asked his name to take him down. Now I'm not necessarily stuffy Brit, who can't hack Hollywood remake of British movies. Well, well, maybe I'm a little bit, but fortunately it's unnecessary in this case. This film is so different from the original that the name and odd references are the only things that will survive. <br /> <br /> Let's move to the premise. Cheesy Russian gangster kills in Moscow police raid (somehow involved in the FBI, although no one bother to explain why). In vengeance, a gangster's brother decides to avenge himself by killing a US president's wife (although no one is bothering to explain why it's a good move? Knowing that it would result in the bombing of an Eastern European air force). Gangster hires "ugly" killer (Willis). Police hire "cunning" killer (Gere), "cunning" killer watches "ugly" killer. Police fanny around and regularly kill. "Cuddly" killer kills "ugly" killer. The First Lady is saved and we all realize that IRAs are just a bunch of real sweet guys who just want to kill innocent people. Pretty. Let's put some disgusting Hollywood habits to play Northern Ireland in trouble, as if it were a sandbox in an amusement park (I'm more concerned with the bulletin board). It is up to them if Hollywood directors want to cast Belfast butchers like hookers with gold hearts. Of course I reserve the right to despise them. It's a free country. But much more is the fact that the film will sponsor and insult the Irish and at the same time support them. It is not politically disgusting, it is much worse: it is incompetent. No wonder, for example, that Gere still looks so damn good, given that he slept for six months before it took for a piece of the crack to grow. The fact that Gere's accent is not just a Southern Irishman, but the scary parody of Southern Irish shows that filmmakers weren't looking for power outside of America to make money out of this movie. Then there's the beautiful scene at the end, where Sidney Poitier (utter waste of space in this movie) says he's out for coffee, offers to make our "cuddly" IRA man one, then recklessly says, "Oh, but guys drink Yeah, that's right Sidney; The Irish live on Guinness and potatoes. <br /> <br /> While on the topic of Poitier: why? In the original film, the tracker is a detective. Well, he just hangs up and it looks like it's * * In the end, he has nothing to do except the calls in the Marine Corps, and he does it just because the nice man IRA says to him. <br /> < While we are on Gere: why? I suppose it's just a matter of time before Hollywood remakes Gandhi and Vin Diesel playing ex-Mujahideen Commando Mahatma Gandhi, who moves in India in the 1940s and 1950s. that Gere's character is a murderer, and hence the eye And if not, why does he know Jackal? If not, why does he know all his movements? And if he is, why is such a crisp cookie and such a "loving" person? All this shows that the creators of this film could not bother to think of a conspiracy (b) have decision makers that were in line with their character (c) avoid cheesy stereotypes like having a big boss bad guy kill his friend ?? I honestly thought it turned into Bond (d) to give "central" characters something to do (e) to attribute modicum to the audience. This film is an insult to the British and Irish to kill in the hands of terrorists, it's an insult to the Irish people, it's an insult that isn't big, but a pretty good movie jerks and insults intelligence. But most of all? and most unforgivable? it's an insult to my * rs for having to sit over a two-hour run that lasted. Frankly, do you think you have no conspiracy, no characters, no dialogue, it will end soon. But they didn't even have the decency to stop soon.
