I watched this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and it was perhaps one of the most boring, unreal movies I've ever seen. Above all, Matthew Modine is a terrible actor and has destroyed most of the movie, and the plot is too stupid. The only reason he entered this film was Alec Baldwin and his character was quickly removed. If you are a fan of Michelle Phiffer, you should probably avoid this movie as a plague. Many people can't praise this movie enough, but I just can't figure out what people think so amazingly. If he were to be the black humor that makes this movie so amazing, then I think that these days may mean something for comedy.
