Sadly, this film had the potential for such a willing cast, but everything was so poorly thought out and misunderstood. I don't think I've ever seen a movie where every scene would go straight and pound loudly as it did here. I also don't think I have ever seen a "stoner" sex comedy that has not provided at least one laugh, but this pain vortex provided nothing but moans and misery. The last time I was so impressed by how extraordinarily fun a comedy could be was the terrible "Big Mom". Scene after scene, these movies turn your brain into jelly. Silly and silly can sometimes be funny, but here, stupid and stupid are used as torture devices against the viewer. Absolute rock bagpipe.
