A group of teenagers with rich bags goes up to the old mining town in the hope of finding gold nuggets. The only snag in the hair scheme is that the ancient supernatural miner, to whom gold belongs, does not want to say goodbye to his treasure so easily, and so he begins to broadcast members. Literally a clich√©, a germinative dialogue, a terrible act, some insanely terrible "southern dialect" and a lame unmistakable killer who resembles Jeepers Creepers (without the young boys naturally wanting to) this stinking man became unnoticeable. Even the legendary legendary actress Karen Black in a small role cannot save this deviation.
