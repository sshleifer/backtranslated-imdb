H.G. Director David Michael Latt's Wells War of the Worlds is slightly less than the average movie, which is not too bad, given the budget he had to work with - only $ 1 million. For this budget, the value of production was not too bad - the best part is visual effects (I was thoroughly impressed by CGI with regard to budget) and healthy design. Less then the stellar parts of this film are a story that is at best extended (but again I think it's because of the budget they had - they had to extend certain scenes to create a 97-minute feature), acting (again because that the actors had no story to do), very few exceptional camera shots and music. Again, however, I can let the negative parts go for the most part because this film was made for a thin budget and still had good production value. You should still see it to see how the low budget version of the War of the Worlds can be made with mistakes. 4 out of 10.
