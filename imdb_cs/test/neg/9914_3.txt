If you thought the day after tomorrow was unlikely, wait until you see this. Well, so the majority of disaster movies are usually 1 in a billion-dollar event that is compounded by other circumstances. In this case, it is a combination of two huge storm systems. Enough enough. Oh, but hold on, no, the "event" is sabotage and the subsequent destruction of the electrical network. Another Throwing of Many Elements of Human Interest - In this case, cheating spouse, a psychotic weapon - a controlling friend, a rebellious daughter, a hacker with a point to prove, a senator trying to push through the agenda, a reporter trying to stand up "men" and pregnant women stranded in the elevator. Finally, add a handful of tastings to add excitement. Jeez, if the director tried to fit into other senseless lines of conspiracy, there would be no time for a real catastrophe that was given. the pathetic state of computer graphics was almost certainly an intention.

It succeeds to make the extremely unlikely 10.0 Apocalypse look not so terrible. Avoid both.
