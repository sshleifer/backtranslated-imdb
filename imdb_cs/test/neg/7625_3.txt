it is a TV movie, but the rating on the box says it is rated as R.there, there is nothing in the movie that can qualify for R rating at a distance. the idea was good but nothing happened with the storyline.it was just not being developed is slightly creepy, and the acting is actually pretty good, better than the movie deserves. that are better than this one.i haven't seen too many Wes Craven movies so i can't really compare it to any of its others.as for this movie myself though i think it's poorly designed and poorly executed.for me, i can't give it Chiller rating higher than 3/10
