Now it's a bad movie when I saw him. In one of the biggest film years, 1999, Detroit Rock City fights with Runaway Bride and Wild Wild West behind the bottom spot in a junk barrel. The story is masterful. Four high school teenagers finally have a chance to see KISS hard rock theatrics for the third year in a row. So when their tickets start running with a mum from ultralight religious chains, friends go to Detroit and I'm sure you can find out the rest. Well, not exactly; the film goes into extreme measures in explaining how four band members (no, not Gene, Paul, Ace and Peter) go about getting these tickets: losing your virginity in the confessional; saves smoked bimbo and mom Volvo (from Soprano's Steve Schirrip, however); preventing a robbery in the midst of the bursting of one debt in 12 years; And of course, undressing on your bare basics for MC Ron Jeremy after closing a full mixer with bourbon-remnants. Sounds funny, right? Maybe Detroit Rock City makes sense with all these horrors, how extremely sometimes these fans can go. And we understand that this film is a comedy; to be filled with slapstick. But Detroit Rock City strives for the right audience? It is rated R, which means that the only way to prepubescent teens - the audience as I see it, many will eventually win this one classic-will voyeur is through illegal conditions. Detroit Rock City also fails in the late 1970s. The camera's texture quality is too bright and too bright, and the necessary atmosphere is missing from movies like Spinal Tap and Sid & Nancy. This would allow viewers to feel “more at home” with the times. Simply costing kids to pre-90's grunge-wear and tossing others into `disco infernos' doesn't do the trick. The environment means something you know; I doubt Detroit looked charming in '78. If this film is positive, it is a soundtrack from the hard end of the 1970s in the early 1980s. Van Halen, AC / DC, you name it, it's all here. Of course, we can't forget KISS, a band that has been exhibited around the world. As far as the film is concerned, there are questions about why the Knights of Satin's Service was so cloudy. moms around the nation. Sure, loud rock and devilish makeup can be part of it; encouraging young people to explore and have a good time could be a fair reason. But what does KISS say in the music we hear during this film for this rebellious group? What separates these anthems `rock [ing] and roll [ing] all night and party every day 'from the rest of the music? Most likely, these questions will remain in the music communication class and not in the films they should answer, simply because it is KISS and rock and we have to do everything in our God's power to be forgiven to see. <br /> 1.5 / 5 stars
