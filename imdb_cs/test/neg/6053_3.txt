I didn't hear anything about this project until I saw it was going on, so I watched it with an open mind. And, gee, the cast is full of strong players. Unfortunately. . . that's horrible. I don't think that's good; I think it's extremely bad - sometimes laughter, but mostly it's just boring. His strongest challenge comes from the fact that attractive people are so naked as US network television allows, but it's all funny and no substances and nymphs as backup characters can justify a few hours of bad television. There are two basic problems that the cast cannot overcome. First, the script is * terrible *. Yes, making changes in Hercules' myth (which is certainly not the only monolithic story) is traditional, but this version is inexorably boring and too often stupid (and sometimes totally indifferent), with terrible stimulation, bits borrow here (and a few parts that probably belongs to different films), and truly terrible dialogues. In fact, dialogue is often unbearably bad to the point where you feel embarrassed for actors. Sean Astin, apparently now occupied as a second-banana, seems to be particularly burdened with one terrible line after another. There is no consistency of tone or atmosphere and little consistency with the graph. Second, most special effects are really bad. Really bad. Sometimes it's a decent piece of CGI, but most of the time you feel embarrassed by the name of the cast. I have no idea what the budget for this project was, but it certainly looks like crap compared to "Clash of the Titans" or even "Hercules: The Legendary Journeys" and doesn't even compare very favorably with old Lou Ferrign and Italy. "Spaghetti" Hercules films. Just painfully miserable. There are many other problems - the story is unnecessarily complicated and unable to keep up with itself and Hercules is not presented as a very interesting character. Almost everyone who does not have a European accent tries to imitate someone of some kind that is not just amateur and dated, but never makes any sense: the drama is not improving just because the actors are using British accents, after Everything. The horrible scenario and the same terrible effects will sink the whole thing right from the bat. In the spirit, "Hercules" was apparently intended as a four-hour miniseries, but shortened (for this broadcast, anyway) for a three-hour television movie. I don't know what they're doing, but it's possible that the adjustments made it worse. I don't think you could make "Hercules" good by adding it, but that doesn't mean continuity, say, did not suffer from network modifications. However, there is no way to track the US version.
