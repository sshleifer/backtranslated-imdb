Okay, so it was in 1993. The leader left it to Robert Iscove and was freely written by John Miglis, he should be based on a true story. It is hard to believe that anyone could be so stupid and blind to the truth. It was obvious from the beginning that this dame was after all she could get. Tim Matheson, looking slightly older than I remembered him, played an empty man who was looking for romance in his somewhat blunt and empty life. Well, it came to him in the likes of Tracy Pollan, a somewhat empty looking girl with kinky sex as her way to conquer her boys. Come on, phone sex, even in the 90's was an old hat. I can't believe anyone would fall to that old line. It seems Mr. Matheson bought it. And it cost him a lot. The hardest scene was when he finally threw his dame out of his apartment, put all his garbage in the hallway (in front of his apartment) and then he was stupid not to change the locks. That's when I had so many movies. I wanted to have the lady try it on me so I could be happy to tell her to go on a trip. I gave this chestnut 1 out of 100. That's how I thought it was. I think you can't blame an actor. But they were terrible. Did they try to play it with a straight face?
