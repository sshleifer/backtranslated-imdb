Stop-Loss is the crime of release over gaming, heavy hands, full of speeches, sermons, nose and stylized way that could only blame MTV. I expected much more with talented young actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Ryan Philippe, but screenwriter / director Kimberly Peirce does an ax to portray the bad effects of war on American youth. I'm sure she did some work exploring the war in Iraq and the young men who fought her, but you would never guess that you're watching Stop-Loss. In many ways, this mess has reminded me of Catherine Hardwicke's Lords of Dogtown, an awkward, overly stylized, television film as a waste of solid objects. <br /> <br /> http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/
