You have to look at this movie! It's so bad it's actually great. You have your crazy but gutsy captain, who of course has an order with his worn-out pilot. And, of course, there will be a collision in the middle air when the captain's enemy and rivalis cross the geyou. You have your former Vietnam veteran Veta, who can't handle the pressure of another crash in the air and landing. Then you have your old crazy friend Army Air corp, who flies the pursuit plane and tries to tell you what he is trying to do. The plane is still rising, up and down, and then you have your greedy and immoral corporate engineer, and then you have your Zebra ice station cold, and then Lucky rescues the evil guy from emerging to land the plane! AND NOT THE END --- ARE AVAILABLE AND ON! You have to watch it. That's great! ARE YOU KIDDING! THIS SHOWS THIS ON THE COMMERCIAL TELEVISION AND HAS BEEN DISPLAYED ON THE CABLE.
