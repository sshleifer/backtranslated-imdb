There's no reason to watch this movie. Why? Many reasons. First, it is a terrible act. There is hardly a line that is not wrong - but it is hardly surprising because of the banality, stupidity and repetition of the dialogue that the actors are invited to mouth. It's terribly written. One of the most unpleasant things on the screenplay is that writers only seem to know one way to keep their characters talking after a certain point and that is to let them repeat the most important words of the previous character line. <br /> <br /> "Repeat?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, they repeat it. For the whole movie." <br /> <br /> "The whole movie?" <br /> <br /> "Yes, the whole movie." Etc. In films like this, you generally know who the bad guys are and what they are after. (All good guys usually have to do is stop the bad guys. Setting up a good "Mwahahaha! With X in my grasp I'll rule the Universe!" The villain is the first stop in some cheap land SF) but in this Turkey? - Tell me. As I understand, our "heroes" are a lot of mass killers sent to the past on a Dirty Dozen mission. The fascist totalitarian state sent them to stop some other mass murderers from changing history. New history would not include the rise of totalitarianism and war that kills 30 billion people and leaves Earth a dead planet (we know all this because this movie has one of those useful long situational reports on the screen just before the event) tells you who's who and what it is, it is a sign of who thinks that their target audience will be that it is told and that it will appear on the screen - just to save the audience from excessive taxation by doing a lot of reading. should they be rooted here? I think we are asked to believe that our hero is doing some way from totalitarianism to love, peace and understanding when shooting people - but it does not work as an arc because we have shown it to be a decent person. be right at the start when trying to save all civilians aboard the rebel station. I think the creators in this movie tried a little deeper than usual, but eventually ended up with unholy clutter with more plot holes and logical discrepancies than a dozen or so of your average crap SF movies. <br /> <br /> The initial credits were nice.
