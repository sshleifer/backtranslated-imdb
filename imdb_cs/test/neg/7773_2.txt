If you're crazy for corny movies and you're looking to see something you don't pay attention to, it might be good to watch. the story itself is very unrealistic. dialogue is also not very believable. it is doubtful that you will find yourself in the context of one of these characters because none of them is very likable. acting could have been much worse. Victoria Pratt is noticeably out of place with the rest of the cast, as she seems to have a lot of potential and talent as an actress. While it doesn't say much, it's one of the best performances I've seen from tori spelling. It seems to be getting better with age. overall, this extremely melodramatic movie is average at best.
