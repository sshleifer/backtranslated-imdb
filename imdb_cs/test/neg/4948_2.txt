That's a horrible movie. Angie Dickenson is a class act and she always does well, but she doesn't have many roles and she needed some money for the movie. By the way, she's on the screen for less than 10 minutes. Oooh, wait, there is one redeeming feature in this movie: Meg Foster has a small role in this movie. Meg is now 35 years old on the screen and not particularly big, but has the most scary eyes of any actress I've ever seen. You don't know her by name, but one look at her eyes and her knowledge. To sum up: acting is terrible, the story is bad, and even filmography is terrible. The screen will be black every time a director wants to change scenes, he's pretty moronic. Look at something other than this, even Mr. Ed reruns!
