11:11 a.k.a. Hell's Gate (2004) is another bad horror movie that is trying to be too heavy to be nothing. Young girl has imaginary friend. One day, when playing with her friends in the fields, a few refugees visit her parents and break them without any obvious reason. A young girl runs away and hides from bad men. A few years later, the girl emerges into a woman with problems. Losers in their school (looking like suppressed homosexuals) boast of their manhood before them when one of them refused. The girls hate her and her life is generally unhappy. The secret of her past returns to her. Who or what is it? Why does everyone hate her? What does the Guardian have to do with her? To find out, you'll need to follow Hell's Gate. <br /> <br /> The new name makes no sense at all. I don't know why people are given money to do such bad movies. This movie isn't even good enough to make fun of it. It's a headache that causes a mess that confuses anyone who's trying to do something about it. It's not worth your time. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
