Leslie Nielsen hits the rock bottom with this absolutely horrible comedy, which is the worst mainstream movie I've ever seen. There is nothing about this movie that is a pleasure, because it is basically one joke movie and the joke isn't so funny. How many times should we laugh at an almost blind man who makes himself a fool? It's not funny, that's just pitiful. Nielsen really needs to start rejecting some of these miserable scenarios, and Stanley Tong must stick to Jackie Chan's movies because it's no worse than that.
