I saw it last night at the Tribeca Film Fest and the Holy God was wrong. From script to editing to acting in cinema - none of it worked. Despite the fact that file design / costumes were so scattered bad for a time period (it lasts years from the late 70s to 2006 or so). Even John Hurt, who is usually an amazing actor, was so exaggerated. It is true that Quinten Crisp is a beginner, but Hurt has nothing to do with it. I don't know much other than telling the audience that I saw it with a totally loved one .. so maybe it's just me. But the audience loves something at film festivals while sitting next to the director and all the actors. It's not a very accurate test of how good a movie is or how well it will play. Personally, I thought this movie was terrible. On the other hand, it was so terrible that it was cheerful. Drunk and give it a chance when it's on HBO in 2 years if it ever does so far.
