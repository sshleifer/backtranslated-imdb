Such a BS film. It's just some stupid anti-Russian propaganda, with a completely BS conspiracy, in no way related to the book. The production team seems to have earned more money from people who ordered the film before they can get out of the movie. The storyline includes references to some real recent events in Russia and other parts of Eastern Europe, but builds them so that it has nothing to do with reality. It looks like the film is a brainwashing tool that helps portray Russia as a place populated by evil people who always dream of something. Of course there are hundreds of stupid mistakes, such as using the USSR map instead of Russia while running news reports, displaying a crowd with Ukrainian flags and commenting that these are Russian elections, etc. There are many bizarre episodes (ie the character runs on Red Square in Moscow and per second is in the center of Sofia, Bulgaria).
