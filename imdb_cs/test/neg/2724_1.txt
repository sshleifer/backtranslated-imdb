I am the only one who has noticed that the "realism" of the 19th century ship is wrong. Actually, it is the 15th century, around 1620, if my memory serves, because the "realistic" ship in the movie is the Mayflower, now, as far as I know, the Mayflower NEVER went to Australia or tried to travel to Australia. I don't know who was involved with the research and development of this movie, but with the help of the Mayflower and hoped no one would notice it was a bad job. <br /> <br /> They even printed it on the cover and DVD. I wonder how other people have noticed this little mistake? Not to mention that the film itself was just terrible, I'd expect better from Sam Neill.
