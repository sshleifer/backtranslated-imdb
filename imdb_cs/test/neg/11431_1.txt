With humor that would appeal to an exclusive, small audience, the average viewer will be considered nonsensical and monotonous. When Cartoon Network advertised this show, it was created to look like it was a big drama or event, complemented by a real rain scene and government officials trying to catch the sheep. When it came out In the air, I was disappointed at how all the characters were so one-dimensional and totally bland. The only thing that brought anything close to humor was the names of characters like "private public" and "general specifics," some vague references to cultural aspects, and how Lady Richington wrapped a sheep's wig. > <br /> Slightly off topic, but I don't see why sheep would fall in love with the ball of dirty cotton balls called "Swanky". It was disgusting!
