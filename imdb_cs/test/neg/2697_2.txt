A female ex-policewoman who was pulled out of power for ruthlessness (and who could defeat Chuck Norris in the fight) herself hires herself as a private body guard; her first client is worthless playboy. It takes half the film to get first. Lots of great martial choreographies, but the storyline is strictly numbered, and acting is as wooden as dialogue. Give this to Miss.
