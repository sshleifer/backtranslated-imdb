I have a question for writers and producers "Prozac Nation": What is the main cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a success story, only one of the self-destruction, when looking at Liz, brings suffering into the life of anyone who comes into contact with it. The film explores divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol and prescription drugs as possible reasons for Liz's disaster. But none of these superficial explanations are satisfactory. At some point in the movie, it would be useful to suggest that Liz has to take responsibility for his life and problems. No light was thrown on what the film supposedly called a "runaway" problem in the "United States depression." In the story, Liz had a caring therapist (Anne Heche), a caring roommate (Michele Williams), a caring friend (Jason Biggs), and a worried but caring parent (Jessica Lange). In the key scene in the movie, Liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the breakdown of the Challenger shuttle. Instead of comparing Challenger to Liz's life, the film was supposed to use the image as a starting point for her recovery and recovery. This film reminded me of the general movie "sacrifice" that was made for the cable. Network Lifetime. The excellent cast was missed, especially in the serious performance of Christina Ricci. True Life Elizabeth Wurtzel has apparently found the resources to help her cope with her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her bold spirit.
