First, I really can't understand how some people "enjoy" this movie. That's the worst I've ever seen. It seems that the actors are bored ... and I think he says it all! Nevertheless, I have to give applause to the creators of the opening credits - this team has a really good future. Therefore, I recommend large studios to watch ONLY the initial credits and one or two special effects sequences (if viewed outside this movie, it looks almost like a good movie). Better happiness (or judgment) next time for this producers, this ... this "thing!".
