This is one of those films with great potential. Brilliant actors, debut from a very interesting director and haunted "Survivor" - plot. But it doesn't work at all. The camera is stunning. The beauty of the Namibian desert manifests itself as a merciless environment even in pictures. And then there's playing. Pretty fine. Jennifer Jason Leigh has never been better. Bruce Davison also seems to have developed his character from Altman's "Short Cuts." Then disappointment: Janet McTeer. Romane Bohringer. And the plot. Why does Levring choose "Lear" for his game on Earth? The whole idea of ​​letting Shakespeare formulate their despair and inner desires does not work. It looks like a facade. And it is clear that tragedies are taking place because of the 'Lear' choice. They just have to fit into the Levringa script and the Anders Academy Award winner Thomas Jensen. And sex. It takes about three days, then more or less of all characters are sexually frustrated. Dahh! Gender is always an easy way when you need a land crisis. Part of Janet McTeer is falling apart, mainly because of that ridiculous idea. Sex causes the plot to fall to the ground. Instead, they could focus on dialogue. All the characters had to be interviewed, but most of all we see them in smaller groups. However, their speaking is as dead as "Lear" and the rest of the film. "The King Is Alive" is not yet the worst Danish '95 movie. But to compare it with the last of the home dogs '95 movies "Italiensk for begyndere" Lone Scherfig, this fails badly. It's not a good movie. It is bad. But it's beautiful.
