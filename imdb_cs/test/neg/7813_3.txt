"There are some things you just don't do," says tag-line of David Zucker's 2003 comedy about a young man who found himself in a terrible situation after another, called My Boss's Daughter, and that's a brand that He should talk to both the people who did this junk and those who follow him. There are really some things that you simply won't do, with the placement of most of all kinds of content that can be found in my Boss Daughters counting as totally items that you shouldn't do on cinema media by including them in the picture. My boss's Daugther is dirty; ghostly; a grotesque experience, a clumsy and heavy handed piece that is infantile beyond words and disgusting beyond expression. If you want to see that it is to endure, to survive and survive, is it in itself a success? if any of the cast; writers; accessories; Hell, even the guys who worked as runners on the scene helped produce anything that was so poor on Earth as it was again, then it would be either because I was sent here by the devil to destroy the movie medium, or it would be because he most likely collected jobs on behalf of the Friedberg / Seltzer crowd. My boss is Daugther, (I'm sure he should be called "My Boss" Daugther ", grammatically speaking), revolving around his unfortunate male leadership, named Tom Stansfield (Kutcher), and the night in his boss's house, while he pursues that seemingly elusive "target" that is his young, blonde daughter Lisa Taylor (Reid) - someone who works within the same department as it does in the erect Chicago office block, while is under the strict supervision of Jack Taylor (Stamp). Tom spy Lisa soon, she is with the subway working with all the rest shmos despite the fact that she owns the car and that her father is the boss of the damn company. After trying to talk to her, but his attempts were thwarted by a murderous child and a dog for the blind, who were more interested in Tom's crotch than anything else, he finally gets his chance in the office when the talked party appears elsewhere and that he should come to his house to visit her - and yes, he still lives with his father. Think about 1960's Hitchcock movie The psycho with gender roles between Norman Bates and his mother turned and then played for laughter. The distinctive nature of the character is painfully evident in the opening scene in which Tom sits on the subway train and travels to work with his yuppie cohorts. They are merciless and smarm partners who are obviously going to go over the unfortunate suitcases to get them in the door in the next morning rush without having to return them. One day it happens with Tom, and his desire is to come back, so bump into us that it is - no-like-other-boys (!) This when she first sees Lisa in the carriage and is somewhat shy to approach her as the other men treat the whole situation as if it were a breeze if they were in position. This somewhat obvious attempt to get to the "side" with Tom is confronted with what seems to be gaining a place in the midst of these associates in this company. however, as close as my boss's daughter comes to some level of filming. From a seemingly harmless premise of a boy who has met a girl and wanted to know that he will come, comedy comes from hell. Tom's arrival at the house will not see him invited to the party, instead he is charged with the house of Jack's owl and generally avoids misfortune while keeping the house spotless. It has been proven by Terrance Stamp character to mean trade in the strictest ways to shoot people for the smallest things like making a bad cup of coffee. It's not that Jack is a clever businessman, he's a pure jester; Obsessed with control and frontier sociopath in his location of bear traps in the garden to keep the kids beside his country. You can imagine that if we get into his big and beautiful house with orders that nothing should go wrong, it will probably be a problem. <br /> <br /> For about ten minutes, the movie is having fun for fun. When someone first uses a countertop to open a beer to mark an untouched peak, you can sneer, but when half of the house is destroyed and Michael Madsen has shown urinating across the carpet, you have a head. your hands. Every joke in the movie is set in an almighty clumsy way than it is played in a way that is closer to slow and unbearable than slippery and flawless, the only thing missing as it follows up to the next gag is the sound effect of someone incorrectly changing gears the car getting cramped and growling at another pratfall. Between the film's rough stupidity, it takes time for the yucky track, a romance with a sugar-powered novel like Lisa and Tom, to talk about a person in the workplace and out of the workplace, and that they may have more in common than the first. thought. By the hour mark, the film decided on gross gags and hate filled jibes more than anything when there is a whole scene that exists purely on the goal of paraplegics and a stupid subplot to do with head-injury sports neighbors on a blind day in which some truly unnoticeable gags are spaced. Stampa likes to place people and asks if the easiest task for them is too difficult, what should be the answer in a common place, while Jack Taylor should read the first too complicated scenario - a concept for you, stamp?
