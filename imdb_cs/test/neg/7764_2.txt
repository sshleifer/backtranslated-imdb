I know this show gave women a lot of liberation in the late 1990s and early 1920s, but come on! You have a whiff, buzz, and transcript of the analyzer. This show really made women look bad. I can't analyze every little thing at this show, and that's what really killed me. Also, Charlotte is whining about her nonexistent difficulty of my ears hurting and Miranda cynicism was a complete buzz to kill. Can't I just be happy? Samantha was the only great at the show and the only one that was worth watching. There was also a good episode when Nathan Lane was on the show, but it was the only one worth watching - the rest of them were almost the same. Humor was drier than a bucket of sand, and not a very interesting plot. All in all, it's not a very good show and I'm glad it's over.
