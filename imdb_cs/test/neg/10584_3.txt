It is not fair. I really expected it to be a fun, fun movie. I think I like Drake Bell from Drake and Josh, and Leslie Neilson is nothing that should be sneezed because of his oldest classic, Airplane and Naked Gun. After seeing the movie Superhero, I'm glad I didn't even have to pay for it. It wouldn't be anywhere near $ 9 per ticket. More like a dollar and a few pennies. Because it would be an hour and a few minutes. And how disappointed this movie was, I was glad that the running time was so short, if not shorter. I just can't believe how incredibly vulgar, useless and especially STUPID, some scenes were! Plus, I saw a better playing of a wooden dummy (without a ventriloquist). It is as if Craig Mazin intentionally wanted to make a movie that deserves its 3.7, if not lower, and even tries to be worse than "Meet the Spartans". Very disappointing.
