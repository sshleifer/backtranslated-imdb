For all the casts and crews who worked on this film apology, another payout in L.A. For all viewers hoping for a fair return for the price of acceptance, a huge loss of time and money. The saddest aspect of this ugly exercise (to me) is that we watch the extremely talented actor Pacina, who seemingly plays a parody of himself. It remained with me as a complete secret. I can fully understand that film industry people need to work and live. What I can't understand is the artist of Al Pacino talent prostitution and worried about this level of mindless waste. Hopefully in the future, it will choose better value projects ... and value, saving your time and hard earned money. Skip it !! We're sending Hollywood and Al news.
