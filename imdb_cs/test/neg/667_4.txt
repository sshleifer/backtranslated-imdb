Eight teenage convicts are brought to an abandoned Blackwell hotel to clean it up as a public service. She soon finds out that she is the residence of a massive psychopath (Kane) who has a thing to pull and collect eyeballs. It does not help that the guard who watched them (Steven Vidler) had a four-year-old raid with the beast four years ago. The guilty pleasures of mine are the slasher movies. Most of them are poorly directed and act, but they still hold some attraction and fun. A good example of this is No Evil. It features scary writing and acting, but death scenes are pretty good and the movie turns out to be fun. Assumption sounds like a blend between Friday 13, Saw 2 and Halloween: Resurrection. I really liked the idea, but it didn't work too well. It was just a bunch of clich√©s and everything was predictable. The script by Dan Madigan focused only on the scenes of death and nothing else. Deadly scenes themselves are good enough and terrible. Director Gregory Dark did a good job with them and came up with some creative killings. Acting is pretty bland and unprecedented. It's because all the characters are one-dimensional and we don't know much about them. It was hard for these people to feel because they were quite unlikable. Kane is surprisingly average. I expected his presence on the screen to be more frightening, but he didn't do it well. Second speed Jason Voorhees if you want. The rest of the actors are quite unknown, and this movie doesn't seem to help or hurt their career. While scenes of death are bloody, they don't need scary. There is really no tension just some bloody scene of death. For this reason, the film does not have much repetition value. Also, if you don't like slasher movies then don't waste your time with this. It will be little to change your mind. In the end, See No Evil is a decent slasher movie, but it is generic and forgotten, so it's not exactly worth watching. Rating 6/10
