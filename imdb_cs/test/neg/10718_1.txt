I'd give it a zero if they had this rating. Entertainment was no fun at all. I was tired of the film for about ten minutes, but in the end I thought it had to be better - no. The others I watched this movie also agreed. The meeting was unpleasant. I'm tired of Jim Carey out of the best ham acting. The support cast was no better. While this film was a statement of corporate greed and the worker's misfortune that entered when the big company got down, the vehicle for this would be better served in a different way. Actually, I didn't like the leading characters (Dick and Jane) so much that their antiquity was never fun but pathetic. I'm trying to remember one scene where I laughed and couldn't. Worthless film and total waste of time.
