The absurd assumption of this film has to do with Argentina to reclaim the Falkland Islands, having failed over power in 1982, by impregnating European women residents with Argentine sperm by diluting ethnic purity until favored by Argentina. Yeah, right. The survey is done by our hero / villan and cad, Fabian, who takes his fisheye camcorder from his pillar to secretly shoot his meeting with the Falklanders, including his courting and eventual conquest of one woman, Camilla. Unhappy indie and fraudulent documentary, this movie enjoys us a lot of boring tourist footage from the side .... yada, yada, yada. The film has no plot potential and is just getting interesting because Fabian and Camilla go through the usual moments of clumsy and uncertainty about getting out of handshake to bed. "F * ckland" is just for those purist cinemas who can appreciate the bleak, no curl, jigglecam austerities of Dogme indies.
