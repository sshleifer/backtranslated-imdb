Or that's what filmmakers would like you to believe as well. This film tries to sag to be cool, it's ridiculous. Everything from the perspective of film, cinematography, editing, dialogue and acting, is in super cool mode out of the way. Just to make sure no one misses this cool film, there's a soundtrack of really great rock tunes and a guitar mexican guitar that plays all over the world. As a last reminder of how frickin cool this film is, all the actors were instructed to talk hoarsely, because, as we all know, it's bad. The storyline (if it really exists) one) seems quite straightforward. But as someone has pointed out, the director and the star of the film seem determined to not tell this story, instead focusing on a plethora of nude girls and a dialogue to be bad, but surprisingly quickly tired (having a competition to find out how many times could they imitate the words "pussy" and "f * ck" and its derivatives in the 80-minute film?). This movie was absolutely awful.
