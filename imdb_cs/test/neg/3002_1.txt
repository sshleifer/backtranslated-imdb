A striking narrative like this always uses the same technique: 1) Throw opaque, unstructured threads around to make the audience confuse. 2) Only deal with “great” topics such as life, death and God. 3) Make it look deep with the scenes of life, death, heaven, etc. 4) It depends on the intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of doubt. 5) Finally, laugh to critical acclaim. This film is a spectacular intellectual intellectual on its bravest. Not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions, they are afraid to start asking questions. The film is held together. Routes rise and fall awkwardly. Popcultural references are appalling and arbitrary. There is so little in place that no critical stab will be missed. Critics who have found the intellectual basis of this film are afraid to admit the truth: they have no idea what the film is about. Good news: not even filmmakers. Satisfying attempts to answer deep questions about human existence require wit, intellect, poetry, and genius. Unfortunately, this film does not have any of these properties.
