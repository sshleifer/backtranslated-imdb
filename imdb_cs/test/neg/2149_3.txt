Hell to Pay was disappointing. She was nowhere near the essence of the B Western movie and should by no means be compared to a fantastic film like Silverado. The dialogue was boring, the conspiracy was torpid, the soundtrack was overly unnecessary, and the acting was terrible. Even the professionals could take a few lessons from the Sunset Carson School of Acting. The only positive thing about this movie is that it showcased some of the best Cowboy shooters in the nation, but you can see in a better light in any SASS video. Packing this feature is very tempting, and the preview is decent, but it's over.
