I am a big fan of H. P. Lovecraft's books and the background of Mythos has produced some other good stories and similar things. And in recent years, some guys who have made films about the work of H. P. have come? for most of the low-budged flicks ?? and showed them to the public in places such as the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival. Now, as I said, most of them are not very interested, but at least they know the heart and "soul" of Lovecraft's works and films like "Cool Air" or "The Call of Cthulhu" - they're what I want. Think - Gifts for the fan base and other loonies that love HP. And then there are people like Ivan Zuccon who just tears the name and creates a movie that would be fun to watch if I aimed it myself and filmed with friends on the beach. This is what Mr. Zuccon has done as it seems ... but while the boys, like Aaron Vank's or Bryan Moore's earlier films, didn't have to have more time, they still had a lot to offer, like a story, real characters and some connection with Lovecraft! Just blabbering out of the name like "Nyarlathotep" or "Necronomicon" makes the movie not Lovecraft-adaption. Anyway, this film not only shakes and hides Mythos fans, but it will not appeal to people who love 1. good movies, 2. laugh about bad movies, 3. like good C - movies Spraying Splashes, or 4. Watching All Horror Has Written on a DVD Cover. I will not go to the "plott" of this waste of time, as it has already been discussed by others here on this page, but as I said, Unknown Beyond is like a movie that I would have with a few geeky friends .. Moreover, it lacks ideas for telling stories and goes into ridiculous "moronic nonsense - but-on-is-art-things". Self-made flicks of this "quality" are fun to watch if you know all the guys in it and ha-ha how XY is coughing out of the fake blood we made of old tomato sauce and so ??? but hey, you won't put it on a DVD-case, will you claim it as a real movie and want money for it? I give it 2/10 for I dunno ?? or something like that
