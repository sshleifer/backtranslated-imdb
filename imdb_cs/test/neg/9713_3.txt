Pete's Meteor. I saw it as "authentic" and "gem". I caught this movie on Saturday afternoon. I wished I didn't. It seems to be Mike Myers' first dramatic role. Unfortunately, it must have been this movie. The first thing you notice that Pete's meteor suffers is a complete lack of conspiracy. Or rather a lot of small subplots that aren't really connected and don't go anywhere. Young orphan Mickey lives with his younger brother and sister with his grandmother. Meteorite lands in their garden and is eventually collected by a scientist named Hugh. Despite the film's title, Mickey is the one who claims to be a meteor, and "plot" actually has little to do with a meteor in any shape or form. From here, several other characters and subplots are presented. But, as I said before, he doesn't really go anywhere. Things go from a cute family movie to a dark thriller quite quickly when Pete (Mike Myers) is introduced and starts to play a role. Micky accuses him of the death of his parents, even though we never said what happened or why. Hugh has romantic problems because his girlfriend can't go through his cosmic fascination. And Pete's drug history is beginning to catch up with him and temporarily attracting his own girlfriend and the rest of the cast into the mix when shady characters try to kill him. This would seem to be the main plot until you realize that it has no role in half the film, so everything else feels like a nonsense filler. Problems with Hugh's girl, Mickey's bad behavior, meteor ... what are they going to do with the COUNTRY? Disease. So the "conspiracy" is incoherent and half is unnecessary. But a good cast of characters can save it, right? Keyword: good. Most characters are terribly unlikable people, most of whom you would like to see terribly die. At least I know I would. Despite the title, Mickey appears to be the main character, which is a really bad move once you see him in action. It is one of the smallest children I have seen in the film, with an extremely bad problem. "He's renting a car, chasing and talking to Hugh (an adult) about taking a meteor, in fact trying to burn a man's house down when he doesn't get on the road, and even trying to stab Pete with a knife. Do you think such a child is on his way to prison. Unfortunately, one of the worst things about this movie is that Mickey never gets what comes to him. I'm not sure at what point you should sympathize with his character because he's always an ugly little brat. He is the leader of his brother and sister, so he predictably ends up putting aside and backseat and follows everything he does. It's amazing they're pushed so far that I don't even remember their names. They could also be there. Their grandmother is largely a borderline alcoholic. It tends to be as ugly as Hick's as Mickey, and she likes to push people out of her house and give them bad looks as she doesn't cough over the alcohol bottles and drinks stupidly. Quite ridiculous when you consider taking care of three children. Her alcohol problems are never really solved, even if she collapses from time to time in the film. Hugh is one of the few sympathetic characters in the movie, but that's just because it's a bag for punching most characters and taking their mess without giving it back. Children treat him badly, but they always come back and try to teach them and do nice things with them. He has a taxi driver girlfriend who seems to take every aspect of his life as a scientist as a personal insult, attempting to leave him in the film several times as he goes to his space jargon or does something that proves to be not exactly the same wavelength as the others characters (fortunately). Then Mike Myers is like Pete. Pete, despite the single purpose and plot in the film, is extremely underutilized and plays no part until the second half. It's unfortunate that Myers got stuck in such a position for a dramatic role. Even though Pete gets time on the screen, half of them are Myers, who runs through dark alleyways and hides in small corners. And while he was the only real point to this film, when his storyline brings the film to a conclusion, it's strange, it doesn't conclude that all the characters are laughing at a good note with a quick and strange explanation behind the title of The Movie That Wonders If they performed in the movie you just watched. The only thing worth seeing in the Pete Meteorite is Mike Myers' role as Pete, and that is when you can go through this incoherent mess long enough not to whip at another human being because of the enormous unwholesome characters and a non-existent plot line. No sir, I didn't like this at all.
