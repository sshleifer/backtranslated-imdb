So many of these types of movies these days. This zombie blow falls into the main category of "cheeses", unlike the more polished dawn of the dead and the day of the dead. In all loyalty, these 2 movies were major studio versions with large budgets behind them. But they were also good movies. A low budget movie may still be good if they stop receiving and using the worst scripts. Whoever wrote this film must have been drunk all the time. <br /> <br /> This film had such special effects and a very confusing chart. The only major difference from other movies of its type is the time people need to turn into zombies. It seems that it only takes a few seconds to die at this point and then turn into a zombie. But with ease, this "infection" spreads can take zombie blood throughout you, and even seem to be at risk of infection, and believe me that people in this one are covered by blood. The main problem I've had is that our two main stars have occasionally gone through dozens of zombies and have not gotten a bit. When everyone else turns into zombies amazingly fast, these two were swarmed by zombies when they were even unarmed and able to get out of it without any problems. The star of our little girl even survived the rocket strike on the building she was in. Unarmed, having as many as 10 zombies on her and rocket hitting the building, she still manages to get out without scratching? OK sure .... <br /> <br /> Also, those who recommended these people how special forces behave, apparently never spent any time in the army. They were supposed to watch a movie like Blackhawk to at least imagine how they behave in combat situations. One soldier was overweight with mass weight. LOL was good. Another still climbed into the zombies because they thought they were survivors, even in one place. These guys are there to fight the zombies and act like soldiers from the Stripes movie. Special Forces, lol ... <br /> <br /> Then they get to the point where they try to explain the zombie girl in the rubber room and the whole thing gets very confusing. The explanation is confused and the first movie does not follow. It didn't make any sense. The only thing I liked was jokes against Bush. The military lady at the beginning told them that the order had descended from the vice president to the president, and in the end it was the vice president of the "undisclosed place" who gave orders. That was the best part of the movie for me.
