This movie was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was a complete waste of money. If I wasn't in the cinema, I would have two young cousins ​​(who also thought it was a disappointment, but not as bad as I thought), I'd leave the cinema. I had two points in the movie that I almost laughed, but the rest was either boring, ridiculous or painful. I thought it would be a spoof on all the superhero movies (which I love), but in fact it was mainly Spiderman, with some sloping references to other superhero movies like Fantastic Four and Batman. I really can't think of one good thing I would say about this movie. Don't waste your money with this movie - there are many other better movies out there!
