The first watched June 24, 2007 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Stefan Rujowitzky): OK thriller, but a bit too predictable. This story is based in Germany, where there is also a movie. It's a young medical student who gets a chance to go to the premier school in Heidelberg and come to see some weird stuff. Someone she met on the train and rescued appeared on the experimental desk of the school and she suspects that she is being driven away. She investigates and disappears her girlfriend leads her into a secret AAA society (and not Alcoholics Anonymous) that has something to do with the anti-Hippocrates oath and is used to conduct experiments on living people that the doctor wouldn't do. t normally. She finds out that her grandfather (who was a dean at school) was a big part of his founding and it is quite easily filled with school members. It's an interesting story, but the problem with this movie is how quickly viewers are told what's going on, and then it's a kind of horror movie with a heroine fighting a bad boy from a group that takes things to the next psychotic level. Although this film was made in Europe, it plays for a young American audience focusing on gore, sex, and horror movie premise (which is really a big fall) and explains why it probably made good money and spawned a sequel, but it doesn't. t necessarily make a good movie.
