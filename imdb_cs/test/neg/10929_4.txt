This is quite a simplistic romance. Girl finds boy, girl loves boy, girl loses boy, girl finds boy. Colleen Moore is an excellent ingredient in this recipe, bringing a wonderfully varied dramatic and romantic performance that deserves Oscar nom. Special special air combat is just as good. Moore plays a French girl whose mother changed her field to a British air squad during her First World War. She is the "daughter of the regiment", loved as a little sister. Into this mixture comes a filler for downed leaflet Gary Cooper. At first they hate each other, then they love each other, then the whole squadron is sent on a suicide mission. Cooper is back, but he comes across the village and the red cross removes him. Moore is looking for him, he is told in the hospital that he is dead, then travels through the streets until he calls from the hospital window and they are united. It's a nice little romance, but hardly more than that. Recommended for fans of Mrs. Moore and Mr. Cooper
