Except for the shiny appearance, this show had little to recommend. Writing was sponsor and intricate. Without exception, the characters were shallow and unsympathetic. The female figures came out of the worst ... scaled down to spoiled, selfish airheads whose soul ambition was to run around in slip dresses and spikes and try to wrap the man. This aspect of the show is all the more curious because the series was made by two women! Acting for most of the part was boring and humorless with the cast playing one dimensional character challenging every scene on the same note. This is not entirely the fault of the actors. If they spent more time developing characters and story, they would add a bit of style and humor injection, MVP could be a hit. What we have left is something flat and vaguely unpleasant.
