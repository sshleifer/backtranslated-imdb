Without giving up my age, I saw it for the first time more than 20 years ago when it first came out on the video (maybe it was a beta tape?) And I was old enough to drink (barely) and maybe I had a couple because I remember how great this movie was! Since then I've seen it sober and I have to admit it's a pretty bad movie. As mentioned in other contributions, the storyline is absolutely ridiculous and bad behavior only aggravates it. It's a foolish attempt to fantasize that even teenagers can be "Mavericks" (although I'm surprised that it was actually supposed to be released at the same time (aprox) as "Top Gun") and it wasn't really a bad imitation. all that is worthwhile - I find that I'm looking at whether she's up and have time. It's one of those movies you watch because it's just so ridiculous and so desperate to take it seriously. Just like this "big" movie - "Moment by Moment" with John Travolta and Lily Tomlin ... don't get me the first one!
