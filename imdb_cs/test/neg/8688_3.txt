VHS Coverage for The Evil Below it looks like cool underwater horror. Unfortunately, it is closer to a boring adventure film and has no real horror elements. It starts with a few divers who are attacked and see a little blood, but that's the only blood in the movie. Evil Below is not the worst, but for horror it's boring boring. Acting is decent and honest, the only thing that keeps you is the developing romance between the two leaders. There are several nightmare sequences where it just seems that the director didn't know what to do. I had to sit down (just about), but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. Horror fans may want a copy for a cool VHS cover, but it's best to do it.
