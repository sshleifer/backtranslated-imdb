How can you be wrong with a film that combines Peter Cushing's sophistication, Donald Pleasence's determination, and Luan Peters bust? You can easily give them a terrible scenario that you can work with. Peter Cushing, in a bad role, leads a satanic cult that captured a few friends of Donald Pleasence. Donald plays a determined priest who wants to find his friends, but he needs the help of Fred from Scooby-Doo to find them. He summons the help of a New York bloodhound who dresses in his role as a cartoon hero. Meanwhile, a friend of one of the missing people joins, Luan Peters. If it all sounds interesting, then, like me, you were wrong. The Trio does not take a long time to pull the criminals, but their methods of bringing the bad guys to justice are foolish. Also women find this crap. Every time they get on the wrong path, our two male heroes tell Luan to stay in the hotel, even if he can do better than the juggler Pleasence plays. STORY: $ (Script No tension is not built, no worthwhile dialogue is given to the stars and you need both hands to calculate how many times Luan Peters is told to stay and let men work men. we don't bother minotaur on film. We have a minotaur statue that spits flames). VIOLENCE: $$ (There are some attacks and several casualties, but those of you who drool for gore will be disappointed). ACTING: $$ (Although there are three of my favorite actors in this movie, there's nothing to redeem. Luan Peters is badly used, which should be much better given the talent, but then again, Ya nkees loses the game there too. Nudity: $ (Luan Peters bathes but sees nothing. She's not as binding here as she was at The Flesh and Blood Show).
