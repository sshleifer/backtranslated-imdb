!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!! The assumption is this: The shop burns and assistant Sergio asks the father of the man who started the fire to pack up with whom Sergio agrees. br /> <br /> So far so good, but there is a good logic in which Sergio is involved in doing it for the sum of $ 25,000, but why? Come on, boys, if you were a good-looking white boy, would you risk having a long spell in hard jail (a very real possibility of arson) for 25,000? I know I wouldn't do that, and if I saw how you had a criminal record, no employer would want to touch you with a boat, so it's $ 25,000 for living and social security checks? There is also something else that seemed to have gone without warning from the assumption, since Mr. Lumpke told Sergio that his son was making a fire that seems to be unaware of the possibility that he may know too much. Aren't they going to ring alarm bells in your mind for someone who wants to keep you when they tell you something? I think we can't think of such details because PYROMANIACS LOVE STORY is not considered an intelligent thriller, it's a light romantic comedy / chick probably the best apprieciated as a girl's night. Looking through this note page, it is clear that the film has its defenders, but as a cynical male I was not overwhelmed and William Baldwin goes over the top
