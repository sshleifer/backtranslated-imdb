I always said there was nothing to beat the original form: comics. Again, I did it right. This, like all the other movies on the Asterix series, has not been impressed. The creators of this film cannot imagine that doing all the other such comic films (x-men, superman et al.) Successful is that they all differ from the original comic versions and adapt them to make it possible. more observable. He agreed, this film deviated, in the sense that this film was a cross of two Asterix books, see. Asterix and the Great Cross and Asterix and the Normans. Also, the uncharacteristic series Asterix (Save Asterix and Secret Weapon), a love interest for one of the main characters was introduced. All this ended in the creation of a childish immature story. The funny parts were very little and far away. All in all, total waste of time and money follows this, let alone in theaters, even at home.
