I just signed up with IMDb.com to comment on this movie. My God, what a smoking pile of horses! It should not be offered as a real movie, it is very deceptive. this is at best a 15 year film project. Acting is terrible. But even good actors couldn't save it. The dialogue is probably the worst part of this film. Who the hell did he write? And the constant joke that comes from a chubby lesbian about Kaye, who is "Miss in Need", has grown old. God I'd rather have a camel in the wet ear than look at the crap again. Don't let this movie be rented. If they gave you the movie for free, don't look at it. smash it with a hammer. Even if breaking this video caused you to lose your Hollywood video or video blockbuster, it would be worth it. this is an abomination. I suppose I said everything I could about it without being useless. any questions .... email me.
