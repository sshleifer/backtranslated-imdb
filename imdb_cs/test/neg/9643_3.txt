The story is not very strong. Don't expect the film to be "Bourne Identity". It started with a strong one, Tara spoke Russian and it even sounded credible. (Not that I am a Russian language expert.) Moscow had the dark depressing look that gave this film potential, I still believed it. To be bad, it only took about half an hour to find out that this place was really missing. Acting was bad, maybe because the story itself wasn't very strong. There is this part in the movie where Gordon Patrick (Nick Moran) has a conversation on the phone with C.I.A. as if you were listening to a Chinese synchronizer. WTF !? Too bad the writer didn't even make a little effort to keep the main characters in depth. Also a little cheap and easy to finish. Plus point is almost every scene with Tara Reid. But this movie really looks great. Overall, it was a little disappointing. Material rental - maybe.
