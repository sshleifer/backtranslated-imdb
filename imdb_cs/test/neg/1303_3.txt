I'll give it to you, this movie is boring. It's about the flood, that's it. Blah was a bit about family, blah blah blah politics, blah blah bored. It's all about the weather, poor sitting. Deputy Prime Minister Campbell is a tough ass that everyone expects to be clairvoyant, most irritating. <br /> <br /> If you are from the UK or wherever it can float, then you like this movie. It's something like earthquake movies are most appreciated where the earthquake happened. It's not really an action movie where the enemy is weather and you have to conquer it or literally overcome it, it's more like a time bomb that has to be turned off. Looking at this film, it is understandable why the United Kingdom thinks that the world is overpopulated, not, but for them. Indeed, the movie is about as exciting as picking scabs and I can't recommend it. It's over 100 minutes, far too long. <br /> <br /> Movie problems; I will not interfere with them because the film does not deserve such an autopsy. Tip for you Londoner - buy more boats. If you bring children to this film, they either fall asleep or become uncontrolled boring demons.
