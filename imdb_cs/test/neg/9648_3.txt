This confident, confusing b + w "movie" watches as a child on a very bad acid road. You have something to do with something that reminds you of a rotting lettuce that accidentally fell out of the back of a garbage truck: no one cares to touch it because it will probably be washed away in the rain. There is no space for conspiracy when you have "visceral ideas" and "subtle" allegories. It seems to me that the director is trying to make another great art movie and beg for intellectual recognition. I didn't even bring my beret. When I watched it, I felt almost offended because the "movie" does such an effective job of dissociating you from you.
