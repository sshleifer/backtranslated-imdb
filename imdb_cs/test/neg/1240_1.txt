Did writers pay people to come here and write positive reviews? Indeed, it's a little shabby and Spike isn't so funny. He looks more like a serious man who is too trying to be funny. There are so many average concerts in this show; As once, the opening sketch was "Talk Show, Paying Right On The Forehead," Again And Again. And another one that featured Spike and another dude, and it wasn't funny. They didn't do anything, just sat down and laughed again and again. Ha Ha! And another that featured Spike talking to a Korean guy who ate a duck and told him he had a pet duck. Ha ha! Indeed, Spike just gets a funny guest at his show, that's why people like this show
