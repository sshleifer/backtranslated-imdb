This film should be called adventure in Cinemascope. She is a screenwriter and director who took the sketch Cliff's Notes page 3 and decided it would be a great tool for the film about the Italian Alps. Rock Hudson is pretty good here, but the dialogue has no resemblance to Hemingway at all. This is a formed version of Hemingway. Hecht, the screenwriter, is a hack. Watch the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes. This is a great cinema and it was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in northern Italy. Gary Cooper is very, very good compared to his performance in For Whom Bell Tolls, where he is stiff as a board and thinks he's in the west. By the way, if you're a Hemingway fan, do a favor and don't watch this movie. The best solution is to get an unabridged audio CD and listen to one of the greatest novels he has ever written.
