When a rocket from a government experiment on the effects of cosmic rays on animals crashes in a small Texas city, people begin to die. The county sheriff is trying to investigate, but is hindered by the efforts of other government officials. It turns out that there is a mutant space gorilla on free killing of teenagers in the forest. <br /> <br /> I like the low budget science fiction and horror movies. I like a monster. So I thought it would be a good chance that I would like this movie. Sadly, I didn't. I don't mind the bad behavior, the crazy dialogue, the nasty musical scores or the giant holes this movie has. There are plenty of movies that have the same problems that I've seen and enjoyed so badly that it's a good way. But where others of this type and Night Fright are different, Night Night Fright has terrible stimulation. And that's because of it. There are scenes that just go on and on without doing anything - finding forests for clues is just people who walk in the forest for a long time; There are several seemingly endless dance teenagers at a party in the woods ... but nothing interesting happens. If these scenes were shorter, the movie might not be so boring (though I don't think these scenes would save this scene). Now I have given this movie three views to make sure I gave it a chance before I slammed it in this review. Sadly, she got worse with every watch. It won't be a quarter.
