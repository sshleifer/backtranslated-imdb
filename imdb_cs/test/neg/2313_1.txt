I do not recommend watching this movie. It is the film in which the film is filmed, without the attraction between the actress and the actor. The sexual scene at the end of the film, which is to explain the actress's reluctance (to play in the film) to work with the actor (starring in the film) in it is a blunt repetition of the same scene in Breillat's film Fat Girl. Everything that was there was played with more delicacy if you could combine such a sex thing. A typical French term for what is happening in sex is the comedy Oh la la! There is also sensitivity in Breillat's Brief Crossing. In sex, comedy I don't see the real sensitivity and also the clear plot of the film is not developed so that there is a rather free story with disenchantment with the end.
