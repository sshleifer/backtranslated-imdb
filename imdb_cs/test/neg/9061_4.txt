I'm a fan of the old SCTV show from the late 70s and early 80s and John Candy was the main reason why. He got very funny characters from the wall and was just cheerful. Unfortunately, he could not play these roles in movies. From time to time I was disappointed with the average movies in which he almost played a "straight" role instead of a funny guy. "Armed and Dangerous" rarely attempts to use John's comedy skills or Harold Ramis's abilities. It's just a very predictable type of cops and robbers. If you're a John Candy or Harold Ramis fan, the movie is observable, just don't expect to laugh.
