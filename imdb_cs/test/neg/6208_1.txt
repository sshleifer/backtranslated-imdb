Talk about how to behave ... !!!! not only Govinda, but also Salman and Lara .... The direction was terrible. You'd like to turn off the movie for the first half hour ... because this movie is a real smelly (mark my words. Govinda liked me in some of his comedy roles like Haseena Maan Jaayegi, Jodi # 1, Akhiyon's Goli Maare and Jis Desh Mein Ganga Reht Hai and it's not compared to any of them, and Salman Khan shouldn't do a comedy role at all! The only good comedy role he did was in Andaz Apna Apna, who was brilliant next to Amir Khan. /> <br /> In this movie, there were so many "exaggeratedly stupidly indecent" scenes that would like to take you out of the DVD and burn it so that no one else in your house will ever follow it again.
