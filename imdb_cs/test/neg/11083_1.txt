Maybe the worst movie I've ever seen. The person who made this film probably never learned to film directly into the shining light. You see nothing in this movie. It's a journey to the dark. Parts where you can see something that the camera directs towards the light source so you get great lighting effects. So you still don't see. This movie was supposed to be a radio game or something. Some parts of the movie are actually edited upside down for some kind of crap effect. Low budget movies can be done much better than this. And the low budget is not an excuse for that. The editor should say something when he started editing and saw that you didn't see anything. Perhaps the creators should spend part of their low budget on the preview monitor to see what they shot. The only good thing about the movie that it's so dark is that you can't see terrible action. It also covers miserable sfx. People at beginner film schools do better movies than this. Movies shot with handy cameras look better than this.
