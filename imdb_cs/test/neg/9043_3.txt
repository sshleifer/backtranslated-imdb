I recently read a copy of this article (entitled "Eaten Alive"). Any movie Ed Wood he has ever interpreted looks like Oscar material compared to this laugh. Being just a few lines out of the script will live long in mind like "These people (cannibals) don't buy frozen meat from the supermarket like us, they get it fresh every day from people like you or me" Classic! The crazy 'Jonesville' type leader in the jungle was the best character in the movie, he really looked like a nutter. I think he was the only actor who wasn't supposed to be dubbed (badly) if these Italians had to have American characters in their movies, why they don't want to dub Americans in dialogue instead of trying to sound like Annie Oakley. I'll give it 3 out of 10, I'll give it three because it is really more fun than most comedies these days.
