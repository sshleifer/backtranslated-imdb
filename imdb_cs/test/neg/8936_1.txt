One of the worst movies ever made ... If you can get through these movies without falling asleep, then you do quite well, no matter how hard you increase the volume, you can't hear what the "actors" are ( ?). say, and if you can acually see what's going on out of a horrible movie (i mean hell if you can't find anything that works better ... use a home movie camara ... LOVE YOU CAN DRIVE, WHAT TO DO!) <br /> It's beyond my imagination how people get a movie like this, slip through the cracks, and escape to the video ... and more ... .. how people who don't know how horrible it is ... good god ... (!) <br /> <br /> After I just told you ... If you're waiting for me to give you a summary of this movie, there's nothing to say. ... a group of motorcycle campers get lost in the woods and a lot of people terrorize them ... or something that's ... what's more than an action movie than horror ... this 'movie' (?) is of no interest ... if someone likes it that i felt it for you .... <br /> <br /> Absolute Basket ... not one of those cheap funny flicks to watch go rent .. 'Plan 9 of Outerspace' and they have the ball
