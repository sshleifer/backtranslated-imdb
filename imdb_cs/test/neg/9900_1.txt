This is for a TV movie about every clich√© you can come up with for a film about a disaster. The only problem is that it's not very well done. <br /> <br /> My brain is still offended by scenes in which Brian Dennehy is reportedly looking at a computer monitor that searches for weather data and points at that monitor. stock footage scenes weather confusion ala Weather channels ads. Why would watching local news from a flooded side street allow a glimpse into global weather? You got me. Also, the first two hours are scattered among the worst known effects of CGI. Look at the semi-finals and the plane that seemed to be portrayed on Commodore 64. <br /> <br /> All the prejudices in this "movie" are made with the fineness of the sledgehammer, the dialogue is forced, and I am. I can't think of the likeable character I want to survive in the second half. The character that I hate most is a stupid woman the husband is cheating on. Perhaps if she raised her finger at any time during the show instead of being a helpless woman standing in the same 10 square feet of kitchen all day long, her husband would not sleep with a PR representative of a rival energy company. In fact, she is so helpless, I want to throw her out of her and the misery. I hope everyone in this "movie" dies in the second half.
