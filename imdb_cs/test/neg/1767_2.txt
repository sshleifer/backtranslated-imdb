At first I am a big fan of Alien and Alien II - in my opinion both of these films have created and defined Si-Fi Horror Genre as we know it today. I noticed that Lifeforce is often compared to aliens' sagas - I would very much disagree after seeing this film. There are some fine special effects with strange vampires, and the story could be acceptable. I can't get through the vampire naked women into the whole movie, that's absolutely absurd (even though it looks good). Add a lot of bad British games and it's almost OVER. Most of the film ends in London or somewhere in England, so after the first 20 minutes you lose the outerspace environment and hope for some real action and Si-Fi Horror tensions. <br /> <br />
