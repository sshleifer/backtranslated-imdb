Scary Movie 1-4, Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet Spartans, Not Another Teen Movie and More Gay Movie. Making the "Superhero Movie" the eleventh in the series that one skillfully destroyed the parody genre. Now I admit that I have a soft spot for classics like the Airplane and The Naked Gun, but you know that you moved the franchise so badly when you see gags in a mile away. In fact the only thing that could really be temp you into seeing this disaster is the incredibly funny but massive sell-out of Leslie Neilson. You can say he needs money, wasting it, or intending to go down with a ship as a good captain would. In no way does it reduce this genre, but the hell doesn't help. But if in this movie I apologize for someone, his respectable actor Drake Bell, who has been extremely embarrassed. People who have gone through the greatest amount of torture is an audience who is forced to sit in 90 minutes of laughter without fun than herpes. <br /> <br /> After spoofing Airplane disaster movies! Naked Gun, and Hollywood horrors in Scary Movie 3 and 4, producer David Zucker sets his satirical views of the superhero genre with this anarchic comedy that returns everything from Spider-Man to X-Men and Superman Returns. Shortly after being bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly, the outcast Rick Riker (Drake Bell) began to experience a surprising transformation. Rick's skin is as strong as steel and has the strength of ten men. Determined to use his newfound forces to fight crime, Rick creates a special costume and assumes the identity of The Dragonfly - a fearless crime fighter to keep the streets safe for law-abiding citizens. But every superhero needs a nemesis, and after Lou Landers (Christopher McDonald) is trapped in the middle of the experiment away terribly scary, he develops the power to drink the life force out of anyone he meets and becomes a villain Hourglass. In order to achieve immortality, the hourglass attempts to gather as many life forces as the Dragonfly nobleman sets off to take down his enemy and realize his fate as a true hero. Craig Mazin writes and manages this low-flying spoof. with Tracy Morgan, Pamella Anderson, Leslie Nielsen, Marion Ross, Jeffrey Tambor and Regina Hall. He can earn some credit in the fact that he's much better than Meet the Spartans and Epic Movie. But with great responsibility comes one of the worst trips to 2008. Laughter, but a little less irritating than Meet the Spartans. And in the same sense, he is much more forgotten than meeting the Spartans. But maybe it's a good reason. Some of us are still trying to scratch the stain that was from our memory of Meet the Spartans. <br /> <br /> My last verdict? Avoid if you are not one of thoses people who like such a car cinema accident. Just as bad as Date Movie and Scary Movie 2, but not as bad as Meet the Spartans or Epic Movie. Super villain.
