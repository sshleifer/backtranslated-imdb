This is one of the movies that killed the "spaghetti" western. Not only does it lose something in translation, it is also a total messy cut. Its parts have been modified and adapted for the English language version. In any case, it gives little or no sense, period. It makes "Trinity" and Eastwood a "man with no name" movies look like John Ford / John Wayne in comparison. Nothing in this film is original. Somewhere there is a beginning, a middle, and (finally) an end. To the end, not everything is exactly in that order. Robert Wood seems to be sufficiently personal. The rest of the cast, especially women, should make a better career choice.
