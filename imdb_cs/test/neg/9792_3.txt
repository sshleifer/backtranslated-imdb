It is impossible to create a film based on such a book as "Brothers Karamzov" by F.M. Dostojevsky. Richard Brooks is a great director, but the movie is very low. The worst part of the movie was the end. Think about the book. Finally we have "guilty" Dimitri Karamazov. Then they sent him to Siberia. Finally, the famous epilogues of Dostoevsky, friends and family plan to save him. But that's it ... and now the film two steps more and shows us the illusion that ends with Dimitry and Gruschenka escaping (I think). just in moral terms I am sure Dostoevsky will finish the open-ended book because he is not guilty on one side (Smerdakov is a real killer) and so he must be a free man. But on the other hand, he goes to his father to kill him, so he decided to commit a crime ... that's a moral dilemma, so the following point is an open end ... well, for real, it just isn't full open. William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov ... I'm sorry! -> NO !!! Other good-performance characters, as we have to expect from such great actors ... Yul Breynner's outstanding performance as Dimitri, of course. I don't think there are many actors who could play this role better. But as I said at the beginning: This book is unacceptable. There should never be a film in two hours, which is impossible. I think there are some longer movies so maybe they can do the right thing ... But I just think this book can't be edited. <br /> <br /> So - 3 points: <br /> <br /> Point for Big Director Richard Brooks <br /> <br /> Yul Brynner's Great Performance Point <br /> <br /> Finally : A point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostoevsky
