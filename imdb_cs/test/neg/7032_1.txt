I'm a huge Shirley Temple fan. When I saw this movie, I appreciated what Shirley was a talented child. Apparently Ashley Rose Orr was the worst on Shirley's screen. Imagine an 11 year old Shirley Temple from 5 years old. That alone is bad. But getting her to "emulate" Shirley's voice? And her singing is pathetic. Dance was good, I'll say it. As the previous users have said, there were few dramatic scenes, nothing that captured the story. Even Amelia Earhart ... I'd like to see a more global phenomenon created by Shirley Temple. Oz Wizard was too focused when Shirley was actually thinking of Dorothy. The film portrays it as if it were the end of the world when it does not get this role. Shirley herself said she was glad Judy Garland had to play her. The star of the show was the lady who played Gertrude Temple. Otherwise stay away! For great Shirley Temple movies, watch Heidi, Poor Little Rich Girl and Little Miss Broadway.
