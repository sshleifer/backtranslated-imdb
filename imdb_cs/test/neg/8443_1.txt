I was seriously detached with this purchase. Other posters cover the shortcomings of this poor poor film quite well. My DVD, which I bought, had a Piranha poster on the front page in 1978 with credits for the film on the frontline "Directed by Joe Dante," etc. I was really disappointed when I found a bad movie on the disc. I'm actually a fan of a lot of bad movies. Most of them are always fun or at least fun. NO this movie! In fact, I'm going to spend three dollars in gas money to return these two dollar DVDs just for the principle. False fake packaging here. Easily the worst movie ever. There are no redemption factors at all. BORING !!! Not even to see how bad it is. Seriously.
