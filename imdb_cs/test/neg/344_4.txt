This movie is proof that you can't just go to Redbox and read movie descriptions and choose one of them and try it. Although I will give my big credit for making a movie with Half a decent special effects on such a low budget, and at least halfway to a decent script and story ... : Halfway Decently. <br /> <br /> If you like movies where things aren't Everything is neatly packed and you don't mind low-budget effects. Honestly, it wasn't my cup of tea. I should just go to sleep rather than spend my time watching. <br /> <br /> For a better science fiction movie produced on an even lower budget (!) Check out "Primer."
