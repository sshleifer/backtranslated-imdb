I'll talk about this movie from two different perspectives. The first is to see if someone sees a movie and has never read (and perhaps not read) a book. The second is from someone who has. <br /> <br /> (Film without a Book) It was a good movie from a film perspective. Nowhere near as good as any of the underworld, but much better than UltraViolet. And I'm not just talking about the plot line. The visual effects were in many parts bad even though the wolf transformation was very nice. The characters have very little development and Vivian didn't even seem to care that her "love" kills what's left of her kind. Some other characters might have more time like The Five. The storyline was a way to resemble Underworld for my tastes. <br /> <br /> (Movie with Book) As many have said, in addition to the title, character names and several smaller parts, the film and the book are nothing like that. In the movie, Gabriel was much older and was Father Rafe (so Astrid was once his friend). Gaba was about 24 years old in the book, never became anyone because the wolves saved their lives (Astrid tries to win her affection) and Astrid was Ulf's mother, not Rafe. Another important thing is location. The book was held in Riverview, Maryland. Also, why they moved from West Virginia is very different. The movie is that Vivian's mistake and her whole family was killed for it. In the book he killed the original leader The Five, Axel, a girl from school. The hunters watched the wolves and killed many of them (including Viv's father), forcing them to move. Also, Viv's mom, Esme was the main character. One thing from a book that would make the film better would be a "dancing bitch". For those who do not know, it is the suffering where all the females (female packs) are fighting to find out who is the one to be the partner of the new leader (because there was a struggle for men before). Vivian won it and tried to save her mother from Astrid (who is a horrible evil woman in the book), so he was to befriend Gabe. There was no prophecy! Anyway, if you read the book and liked the book, I highly recommend NOT seeing this movie.
