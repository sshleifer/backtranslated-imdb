This should be an incredibly witty movie ... but it fits on the face. (In fact, I stopped looking at it in half, which I rarely do ...) - Bill Murray plays Jack Corcoran, a second-rate motivational spokesman whom the elephant has left his father (whom he supposed to be dead before birth); he then has one week to get a cumbersome pachyderm across the country. His adventure on the road is only slightly amusing at best. Janeane Garofalo's considerable comedy talent to go very untapped. Anita Gillette is impressive in her small role as Jack's mother (who has a lot of explanations) and Pat Hingle acts as a former circus associate of Jack's father. - Maybe the other half of the movie was better than the first one, but it's hard to believe ...
