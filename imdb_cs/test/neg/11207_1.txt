What are you smoking? This movie, while festively entertaining, is terrible! The action scenes are so fake that it's a bit sad. Colonel's daughter is painfully irritating. The ninja training camp is so cheerful that it is not worth mentioning. And when Joe puts the bucket over his head and beats the other army guy, I just took care of myself. I could go ... <br /> <br /> Fun, probably. Okay, no. Well, definitely not. As a commentary on America as an empire, it's actually pretty good. Joe as a typical white conqueror is not so surprising, especially in the context of American film in the mid-1980s.
