First of all, as a group of friends, we often find fun in movies that are terrible for comedy, so our Camp Blood rental. Camp Blood was the first movie we rented what was shot on what looks like a video camera and it was so nonsensical that it wasn't even funny. <br /> <br /> The DVD has been returned and a refund is required. some quality control is performed to prevent such total garbage from being stored. Don't do what I did and let curiosity help you, it's so bad it isn't even funny.
