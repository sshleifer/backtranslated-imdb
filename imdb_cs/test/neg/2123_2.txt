Persistent luminaires in IMDb Bottom 100, it's hard to see exactly why it proves to be failing in almost every bloody department! <br /> <br /> Make edits to start; calling this choppy would be too free! Indeed, if the manufacturers were to get drunk this night and slice and cut the film reels with scissors and children's glue, the resulting mess could hardly be worse than what we actually have.

Note: This was released in the UK under the alternative title of Devouring Waves, though without most of its scenes, which ironically seem to be the only reason it could be worth watching.
