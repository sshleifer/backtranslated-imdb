This could be a really good movie if someone just knew how to finish the movie. The story went well and headed for this point in every movie, like this "gray" character with "good" and "bad" guys get their desserts and * boom * ... it's as if they came up with the script and the cast just started doing things. That wouldn't be so bad ... if the cast had just begun to develop a character they had already introduced. But this is not the case, and the film soon becomes a goofy mess. <br /> <br /> My advice is to watch this movie in the last 30 minutes ... and then turn it off. At this point, imagine how you think the next 30 minutes will look based on what you have seen so far. <br /> <br /> Believe me, the end you lose will look much better than this movie actually ends. Trust me.
