This is a really unpleasant show. In fact, this is an example of how low TV has dropped because "reality" has come into style. Tanya is pretty, but also very rough and has a terrible taste. Is the house showing a place for sex appeal? It seems some men like the show because Tanya is attractive. The second boss is not nice, but he is completely rude and has a terrible taste. It is unfortunate that so many houses must be shown while someone is still alive. Most of the people who are supposed to look at these houses before the changes take place should move to completely new homes or completely empty houses so they won't offend anyone. Most of them ... as a "crew" .. have to be taught behavior. I can imagine how horrible a British show is because British reality shows tend to be worse in terms of behavior and taste. <br /> <br /> What happened to the art and entertainment channel? When it started (and a few years later) it was filled with delicacies. Now it's one big machine.
