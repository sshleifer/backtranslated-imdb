It's really a pity that IMDb doesn't give you negative voices. This is the weirdest horror that our usual sympathetic neighbors have ever cast on the American public. Parents are troglodyte and neurotic hag. It is as charming as a well-used fire hydrant with the same hygiene standards. It's a wax museum figurine programmed with more neuroses than the entire THE VIEW cast. Children are non-entities if female and repulsive for faith if male, especially title character. The boy is a serious contender for an insanely smug, self-confident, arrogant and futile male character on Disney who says something. This show was apparently conceived as an anti-BRADY BUNCH, but comes as an anti-Christ. And why is photography so dark?
