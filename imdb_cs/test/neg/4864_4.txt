I rarely saw an action / thrilling movie that was so boring. None of the action scenes is the exciting story of the story is nothing special and besides a few actors acting is bad. Charlie Sheen (platoon, Major League) plays as Chief of Staff of the White House, who gets to the center of the conspiracy he wants him and more dead people. Donald Sutherland (time to kill, fallen) plays a friend who tells everything he can, and Linda Hamilton (Linda Hamilton, Terminator, Dante's Peak) plays a reporter who gets involved. Charlie Sheen is fine as a star, Donald Sutherland is a good actor who gives a good performance. Linda Hamilton gives a bad performance. I can like a bad movie if it has a good ending, but this movie has a very cheesy ending with some almost ridiculous things.
