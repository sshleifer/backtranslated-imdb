I don't like Himesh Reshamiya. I also don't like his singing. But his songs are madness in India, especially among people. When he dared to become an actor? it was a big joke! What he must reap as much as he can in his main time. I never wanted to see this movie. But one thing changed it. The movie became a super-duper hit! After 2 weeks, Aap Ka Saroor has a raked box collection of 14 crores ?? compared to Apne, which collected 7 crores for the same 2 weeks. If I can sit over the absurd Apne and Rajnikant Sivaji? Should I give this movie a try to understand what the movie has that made such a big hit? The story is about the real singer Himesh Reshamiya (HR), who went to Germany for a concert and fell in love with Riya (Hansika Motwani). Ruby German lawyer (Mallika Sherawat) loves Himesh. Now Himesh is arrested for murder. Himesh's mission (in the last 40 minutes) after escaping from prison is to prove he's innocent and find a real killer. He tries hard but unhappily. He's pathetic. I was wondering what could make a movie? Let me find something positive. First, saving the film's grace is a screenplay until Himesh runs out of prison. (But after the nose film immerses in unbearable stupid limits) Second, the movie's songs are good, catchy, crowd tractor numbers. Third, Mallika Sherawat ?? She looks beautiful and good, just like the other lady. I can imagine that Mallik's fans come to the film for her. Fourth, is the film's cinema pleasant? especially the German national environment, they are a good sign for the eye. Fifth, the main story is a love story between Himesh and Riya? with clich√©s dialogues that would probably join the young crowd. Sixth, director Prashant Chadha did a decent job of covering Himesha's pathetic acting skills with the shots that do not need Himesh to act much. small budget movie heroine. Raj Babbar is wasted in a small role. Overall, the film is below average. Did I mean the whole movie? what if the same film script was made with Salmaan as the lead man. I think it would be a much better thing. May be then I put the movie 6 out of 10. But now? (4.5 stars out of 10)
