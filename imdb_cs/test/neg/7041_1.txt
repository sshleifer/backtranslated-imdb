I'm an Indian living in the United States. Why India continues, just like a silent animal to emulate everything that is behind me American! The main problems with the film are not so much the fence and the silly comedy. It's that this movie has a lot of sex, touching, women dressing like strumpets in the streets, and a lot of curse that doesn't belong anywhere on TV <br /> <br /> Producers and directors of this movie, I have this message: You continue to weaken the strong family values ​​of our nation by doing this kind of waste. You keep saying that young women think it's okay to have a feminist attitude and have no morals. You continue to do dance songs that belong to the lowest adult clubs and bars. I'm ashamed to be an Indian after seeing movies like this. In 2003, the US government proposed that "the miniskirt" be the best way to destroy Iran. It is not necessary for India. We will destroy with such waste.
