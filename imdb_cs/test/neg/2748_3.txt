Before I saw this movie, I heard some negative comments about it. But when I looked, I thought it was fine, it was a little slow pace, but it is quite interesting. When it came to an end, it created a complex moral dilemma that, in the context of the film, led to a shocking, wholly believable decision with extremely strong dramatic consequences. If it were watched, it would be a tremendously powerful ending and it would give me a very positive impression of the movie. However, due to the ending not only emotionally balanced, but also the attachment to unnecessary happy-ish ending without real emotional credibility, but also in the context of the film, it makes no sense at all for you to see that one of the the characters will take action that should end her life but inexplicably. By the way, please, please tell me if something is missing and there is a reason to survive because I could not, how logically could have, and that ruined my whole movie. all three achievements in strong performance, though the transformation of Kevin McKidd's characters is a little further than it is completely convincing and creates a very strong ethical triangle. This film is recommended if you are ready to walk by yourself when your mother and sister are lying on the bed. But don't look any further than this if you don't just have a pinch, but a few mountains, salt.
