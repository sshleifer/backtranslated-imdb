If you look at the DVD cover, don't worry, Sandra Bullock will appear in this cult classic for a maximum of 5 minutes. The fun value here is very high. <br /> <br /> To name just a few of the many attractions that should be paid attention to: <br /> <br /> - Doubtful evil voices of major bad guys - Special gun camera - Weird masks and clothes hit Murderers - Flamboyant Ways to Catch a Bullet and Hit the Ground - Abundance of Bottoms Up - Spacious Scene in which Bullock Unconscious on the Street - Over-Clich√© Italian Crowd Guy Moe (LaMotta) - Inexpensive Synthesizer Background Music - Fascinating Exaggerated Fetish Fetishism And last but not least: super corny fist-fight scenes. I wish there were more ... Extra point for a successful attempt to make me laugh out loud.
