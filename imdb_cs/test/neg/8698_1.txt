This movie was a waste of 3 hours of my precious time. In the first 10 minutes I was already angry because I am familiar with the actual version of the torah story (5 Moses books) ... but I decided to look at my money paid off and also see how bad it was. Well, it's licked .. more than I thought it would be. First, and for most, it allows you to start with the script and the characters that make up the skeleton of the film. If you study the torah at all you will see that the story is all wrong here are some of the shameful mistakes: Moses doesn't do slave labor because he was in the levi tribe, moses doesn't kill anyone on sinai mountain. , yet the film captures the mudr whipping and aaron and killing people himself ... no care! When Moses talks to a burning bush, he knows who's talking, but the movie makes Moses look like an idiot, he says he doesn't know who the gd is in the bush ... anything | their distance grew, aaron was known for its serene, serene calm nature but yet he is portrayed as angry and arrogant in this film. Moses looks like Jesus in this movie .. how ridiculous ... Pharoah the real was actually an ugly dwarf who sat on a pyramid of stairs to appear bigger than he was and Moses was over 10 feet and in the pharoah movie is higher than on a hes hot with bright eyes! The woman Am of Israel (the nation of Israel) covered their hair and bodies and did not dance or sing in front of men, did not attend the golden calf, so they definitely did not dance with man in public, the film depicts. Moses' wife, Tzipor, was married to Moses, and therefore she covered herself and was so humble that she did not stick publicly or hold her hand. Batia Pharoahs daughter (the one who accepts him and rescues him from the water) real converted to Judaism, and therefore would be proud of Moses when he said he was going to go free his people.fast fwd on mount sinai moses would come down time 2 with two sets of tablets ... with crazy writing on it .. at least write writing in holy language, hebrew or english and put it on one tablet not two sets .. the bottom line is the movie is terribly written, directed and the characters are all bad. basically everything is bad about the movie ... The old one is also inaccurate, but its more realistic and actors are believable. Am Israel Chai!
