Yeah, there's a sleeper watching the Sleeper Cell and it was me. After reading the comparison with "24" (as on the DVD cover) I expected a quick action. But no ... this series just putts. In my half-awakened state, I would have thought, "Will ..." and poof, that would happen ... "Guess the van will go ..." and go there. <br /> <br /> And so on. And why would Darwyn watch a baby in an extra deep cover? Could it be a little T&A? Hey, it works for me, four stars, rather than three. This show is not "24". I watched "24". Sleeper Cell, not "24".
