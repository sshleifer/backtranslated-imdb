AWFUL WOT MORE I can say I remember seeing it in the cinema (as it holds in pain) as a 16-year-old boy. Mark Hamill was an older generation of skywalker and wasn't big at it, he was worse off. Plus dour soundtrack then Jericho AAAAARRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH. There is one film as bad as I saw at Arthur 2 on the rocks. Funny how the question "What's the worst movie you've ever seen?" is easier than "what is the best movie?" which, by the way, differs between The Italian Job, Untouchables, Casino, What to do in Denver, Goodfellas (get a sense of what I like ??? - it will fool you!) Search Nemo, Pirates of the Caribbean and Moulin Rouge! Please never look into this movie or stick to your memory too!
