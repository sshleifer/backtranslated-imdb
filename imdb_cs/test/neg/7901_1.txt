I gave Seoul Plane the benefit of doubt and thought it would actually be something of a comic value in it. I'm not black, but that doesn't mean I can't appreciate the black comedy. I know I like watching Wayans Bros, Good Times and other series. <br /> <br /> I've seen the crap of movies and Im isn't easily repelled. As for Soul Plane, I didn't even bother to finish it. I don't know if they managed to land the plane and I can't worry less. It would be unfair to say that I didn't find any funny parts when I laughed, but I also laugh on Youtube videos of skateboarders who fall on their nuts, so it doesn't say much. The men in the film were like a bunch of howling horny hyenas at the time of mating who wanted to "get" whenever and wherever possible. And we wonder why these stereotypes probably won't go away. To sum up: Soul Plane makes the Harold and Kumar series as Godfather.
