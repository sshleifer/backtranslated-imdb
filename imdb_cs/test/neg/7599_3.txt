It's a tradition from my first VHS recorder for me to collect a few incarnations of Charles Dickens's old chestnut, and this year I recorded this and Karrolle's Christmas. Fortunately, when this was launched on the Hallmark Channel in the unGodly 3 AM hour, I was spared the need to edit the ads from it. But that was just a saving grace. Writing was excruciatingly boring with almost no clever scenes to save her from anything more than a tiny-bopper soaper like Beverly Hills 90210. In this, a good man who was cast aside for her celebrities seems to be the only logical explanation for her change on the TV talk show hosted by Scrooge. That useless Dinah Manoff who only plays a goddess bitch to another bitch of the goddess Tori spelling (who, by the way, had more paint cloaks on her face than some colonial houses) and Bill Shatner is perhaps one of the few fun things in this different. rough adaptation. <br /> <br /> Some of the best opportunities are wasted as ghost entrances. Aunt Marly's entrance could be magnificently entertaining in the hands of a dignified writer, but apparently this Christmas turkey didn't have one. Tori Spelling can be a beautiful man, but he has all the acting. The skill of a mannequin, and it does for the bad show itself. Yes, it was good to see Gary Coleman working again, but the script doesn't tell him anything, except he turns his eyes and spews a really lame dialogue. And what is most annoying was that converting from Scroogedom to Tori "sweet and light" is as convincing as a passionate conservative. If anyone wants to write Scrooge's final story about George Bush and Charles Rove, we could have a refreshing change from the usual bad Christmas carol clones. <br /> <br /> I assume that if you are a fan of the Spelling Lady and / or 90210, it may be your cup of Christmas mood. I prefer stiff shot and cold beer to wash it. This one, which I could postpone for a long time before it was here with me. God saves us all!
