This was a complete waste of celluloid. The preview was promising, but after watching the movie, it looked like a * full movie. No conspiracy, no clear story, just some wrong tension. The director seems to have tried hard to create an atmosphere of mysticism and fear, but there are still gaps that should be fulfilled. Why drugs? Why number 11.11? (Btw. When Sarah enters the library, the clock says 11.14) What is the connection with the parents' murder? What is the role of this Rayden woman? Is it one of the kids or not? Who are the kids anyway. There's a lot of material to create the perfect cult film like "Omen," but the director lets them lie on the floor without leaping into the story. Even "Blairwitch's project" was more frightening than this one. All the gaps you hope will be filled in as in "The Butterfly Effect" will remain open as credits start scrolling. OK. Next movie ...
