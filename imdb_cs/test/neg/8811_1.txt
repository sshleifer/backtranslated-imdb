There were so many things wrong with this movie I have trouble keeping them all straight. But one thing that really bothered me is that if Jigsaw was the one lying on the floor in the bathroom, what would happen if Zep never appeared? What if Zep killed Danny Gloover before getting into the bathroom? Does Jigsaw just get up and go out? Couldn't the guy in the bathroom sit down, but another part of Jigsaw? What if Zep killed a woman and a child, how does Jigsaw give him a poison antidote when he lies in the middle of the bathroom? Why does the doctor wait until the last minute to cut off his leg? It was too late, after six, and if he knew that his wife and child were already shot, it was not the best time for heroism. These are just a few of the questions I had about the movie, but maybe I miss something or everything I've seen the movie just once. Please help!
