Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a film about an obsessed young girl. Do I have to tell you anything else? Exorcist and Exorcism Emily Rose are two amazing scary movies. Classics (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not so long. Surely it is not as bad as it could be a low budget copy of Exorcist. From start to finish it has a "made for Sci-Fi channel" production. It's one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed at Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or similar show). Make-up and effects were absolutely ridiculous. Behavior was terribly bad. It wasn't the only performance that wouldn't make me turn my eyes or giggle. Oh, except Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as Sheriff. The screenplay wasn't that bad, but it wasn't anything special. Most of the movies seem to be more focused on who sleeps with whom the girl is a demon. in the second room. I learned something from that movie. Obviously, if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon, then all you have to do is lock them in the room. Come on. And if your daughter is obsessed, don't worry too much because it all makes him talk to funny voices, eat rabbits, try to look down at you and place mill machines in bed. Besides, there's nothing to worry about. Apparently she was obsessed with a low budget D-List demon. None of the gruesome deeds done by the A-List daemons, such as cross-stitching, painful bias, or even projectile vomiting, were. > <br /> Totally ridiculous film. Not even a discount. <br /> <br /> 2 of 10.
