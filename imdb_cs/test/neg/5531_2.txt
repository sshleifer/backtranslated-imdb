Corny and terrible, I wasn't surprised that the short show didn't. I remember kindly when Tales From the Crypt tried to reuse these episodes as if they were scary. In conjunction with poor acting and miserable music, I was surprised that this confused speech was sometimes conceived. This has never occurred again and can only be grateful for this circumstance.
