You have to see it. I couldn't stop laughing at the stupidity I saw in this movie and late after the event. There may be a million individual mistakes and stupidity in this movie. Behavior is bad. The story is so predictable and flat. The effects are like 50 years. The supposed thriller is nowhere. You will not like the movie, but you will laugh and enjoy it long afterwards. We had a great time after the movie. Really. Me and my friend spent the entire 40mins long bus trip home chatting about this movie as we saw another Oscar winner. Unfortunately, we talked about all the bad things we just saw.
