After watching this movie on TV, I looked into the IMDB and imagine the user review of my 7.6! That's not a good movie. Editing is especially bad; the wrong way to leap from one point to the next was amateur and huge distraction. It's not very smooth. I agree that the meeting was quite decent, especially Kelly Kapowski, and that the story was quite interesting.
