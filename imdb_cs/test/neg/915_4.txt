It is difficult to evaluate the first effort of a writer / director. After all, it's another film before I wrote or directed. James Hunter wrote an interesting story but suffered an uneven flow. After all, the idea that a person (Ja Rule) has to choose between the life of criminals and go straight is common, and even falling in love with a daughter (Tatyana Ali) of the man you killed was done . Doing it again requires something that is original, and the originality is missing in this movie. I was attracted by the inclusion of so many favorites: Truia Lies (Wayne's World), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), Frank Langella (Dracula, Good Night and Good Luck) and Ving Rhames (Rosewood, Dawn) of the Dead). They did not disappoint in their appearances but had little work to do. <br /> <br /> It's becoming more and more common on video, but that doesn't mean it's a waste of time. Maybe the Hunter sophomore effort will be more fun.
