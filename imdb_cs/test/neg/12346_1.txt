Friends and I looked at this movie. We have opposite views about Fujimori, but after seeing this movie we agree on the following: the easiest way to have an inaccurate document is to make a foreign country where you weren't present when events happened, no matter how talented or how you invest in film. If you really want to learn about the history of other countries, watch something that natives of the country do, otherwise you won't be able to withdraw from your bubble. And those who try to force their opinions and opinions about something they don't really use their power. To make matters worse, the director decided not to talk about the embarrassing involvement of the CIA with the Fujimori regime. She decides to avoid dealing with a single subject for her country's witch has much to explain to the Peruvians. However, this is not surprising because both the director and the CIA violate Peru's sovereignty by trying to influence democratic processes at very different levels. If the director was really interested in helping Peru, he would finance a native to create a documentary. In any case, there are many Peruvian documents, films and books on the subject. These include "Ojos Que No Ven", "Dias de Santiago", "Montesinos-Fujimori: Las Dos Caras de la Misma Moneda", "Montesinos: Poderoso Caballero", etc. The director of "Fall Fujimori" should spend her analyze numerous problems in their own country or at least involve their country in the affairs of other nations.
