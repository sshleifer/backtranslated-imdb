I'm a huge fan of the North Exposition. The men in the trees are a complete knock-off of the northern exposition. There is a city-folk from New York stuck in a distant backwoods town (Marin Frist / Joel Fleishman). He won't be fired immediately with a local (Jack Slattery / Maggie O'Connell). The city has only one pilot that is often unavailable. Ther is just one radio show. The whole show is about strange people with sincere and strange relationships. Too many parallels. Just as the northern exposition except one obvious demographic has been changed in each character. I'm bored. Give me something new to think about. Up, writing is pretty good. If it were a school project, it would certainly deserve a sign of plagiarism. Perhaps the people who love this show have been protected from the dedicated creativity and hard work of Joshua Brand and John Falsey.
