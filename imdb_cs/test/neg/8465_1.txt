Five fingers strongly rely on the barbaric, shocking values ​​of Hollywood tactics to evoke an apparently positive film response. This is where this movie fails all over, especially because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was discouraged and disgusted at the fact that five fingers were even done, and basically I had to force myself to follow. Torture itself is terrible. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is tortured are terrible. But the creators of this smelly film seemed to feel that it wasn't enough. This had to go beyond what was needed, and simply and effectively destroyed all the chances that this film had to make a valid point. For this reason, this film has come across as nothing more than being self-pleasing. Five fingers are also largely shifting to B movie status with their time manipulation. In other words, we showed the presence and then the past is revealed in excerpts. This is a little twisting of normal Hollywood time manipulation. While the viewer is normally displayed on page 95 in a 100-page script as the beginning of the movie, and the rest of the movie essentially explains the end, five fingers are dedicated to the flashing flash that ends the movie. Overall, five fingers felt stupid when I watched the whole movie because torture was obviously obscene and it was definitely not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation. I'm surprised that Dick Cheney didn't make a guest at the end like some kind of superhero torture. This film is a perfect example of what happens when an important subject gets into the hands of greedy, soulless delfos.
