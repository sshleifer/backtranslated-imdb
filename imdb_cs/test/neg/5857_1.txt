I saw this movie last night, satire programs in the style of reality that seem to be currently on wheels. What can I say. I definitely hated it. Perhaps as interesting as observing a dry color, and maybe with just one or two little fun moments. Maybe it had something to do with me, which certainly wasn't a fan of Survivor and Big Brother shows, but if this was a video / DVD, or if I was watching a movie on my own, I would definitely not be more than 5 minutes. <br /> <br />
