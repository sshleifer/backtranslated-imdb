After reading the reviews I am so glad to know that I am not the only one who was very disappointed in this movie! I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan, I have read all his books, most of them more than once. Of course I'm LOVED The Notebook and Walk to Remember ... I haven't seen a message in a bottle or a night at Rodanthe so I can't comment on those ... <br /> <br /> But I did go see Dear John this past weekend and I was terribly upset! The movie wasn't good at all! When you watch the movie itself and don't think about the book at all, it was still a horrible movie. I didn't want to get the rush and range of emotions from this movie that I got from other movies I enjoyed, especially The Notebook. I didn't smile and laughed and cried and worried and worried ... ever! From the very beginning I noticed how they changed everything! The only thing that resembles the book about this movie is that there is a man named John who is in the army and a girl named Savannah who is not .... the part that his father is obsessed with coins is all about another part that went along with the book. Everything else was gone !!!! First, in the book, Allen was Tim's little brother, not his son! Why they had to change it, I don't understand. It made much more sense as it went in the book when Tim was a little older than Savannah and grew up together, and Allen was the inspiration for Savannah who wanted to work with horses and autistic children. in the movie .... ugh ... And they spent a lot more time in the book than just the first 2 weeks and then 1 night ... why did they leave those times ??? I could go farther and farther, but then I would run out of space! So basically, if you're a big Nicholas Sparks fan, don't waste your time or money on this movie ... just read the book again ... because it's horrible and nothing like a book!
