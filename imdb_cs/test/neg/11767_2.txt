If you can camp your stomach, this movie should laugh you out a few times. At least for me. Let me just mention one of my favorite elements: "underwater shots" of "swimming" fish. The sound that accompanies these shots is also great. Last note: William Katt is actually a pretty decent actor. I hope she gets another day in the sun; Watching him as "The Greatest American Hero" was an amusing part of my childhood a few decades ago, and has not been visible ever since. She seemed a little depressed in this movie. Someone will give him a good job on a good show or something.
