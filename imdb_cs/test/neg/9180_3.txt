Unlike most reviewers of this particular movie, I'm not much of a fan of Cynthia Rothrock, at least. But when I saw that the film had Fred Williamson and Robert Forster (both great actors), I had to watch the movie. Williamson is Dakota Smith, an alcoholic cop who is taken to a brush for brushing and even worse when he has to contact Cynthia at the command of Captain (Robert Forster). Forster is always observable, it's just a weeping pity that the film itself is so damn banal and clich√©. It also features one of the least scary villains ever to be married to celluloid. Williamson would return to the character of Dakota in several other movies, another of them is "Down N Dirty" <br /> <br /> Eye Candy: Nina Richardson Shows Some T&A; Mary Kapper Topless <br /> <br /> My Class: D <br /> <br /> Where I Saw: Showtime Extreme
