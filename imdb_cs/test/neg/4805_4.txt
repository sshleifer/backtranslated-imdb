It was only the second year of the Academy, but they were already politically voting - Jeanne Eagels' brilliant performance in this creaking early talkie had to do with Oscar nom and the statuette went for the worst performance ever to win - Mary Pickford is at COQUETTE. The only existing print was working print without music or finishing, but wherever it is displayed, Eagels stun and impress with its charming, powerful performance. She is so persuasive about the testimony that even though we know she lies in her teeth (we've killed a man after all SEE), we in the audience find ourselves as jurors, we believe in her innocence before we suddenly seize ourselves. That's a great deal. The movie must be made available on video so that the world can look forward to this amazing performance. (One Jeanne silence exists in the archive press - MAN, WOMAN AND SIN - and her only talkie, JEALOUSY, is "lost", so it's the only document we have for her. The archives to be featured in New York in the early 70's years, Village Voice has printed a full page review, worshiping Eagels' performance.
