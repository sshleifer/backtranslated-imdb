In the first forty minutes, Luna really likes watching them. Characters and their situations are interesting and the photos and locations are beautiful. Then Jill Clayburgh finds out that her son, Matthew Barry, is using heroin, and the film is beginning to fade, and then becomes completely laughing at his illness. Clayburgh asks him why and when he started using the drug, and sometimes she and the audience get a direct answer that would be a little useful. He mentioned that he didn't care about anything, but that wasn't right, because in the amazing morning scenes we clearly see that he is very interested in his mother's singing, baseball, sex, and apparently cared for him to refuse marijuana. This film is for people who think junior will get into hard drugs because Mom and Dad were workaholics who missed his piano recital. I think such a dangerous and emotionally volatile drug like heroin was chosen as some sort of intellectual catalyst for later incest scenes. There's a lot of talk about mother's love for her son, but it's about Bernard Bertolucci. Luna would be great as a quaint little family drama. How old was Matthew Barry in this movie? I was more concerned about the bizarre things he had to do as an actor for this film than for everything his character went through. ** outside ****
