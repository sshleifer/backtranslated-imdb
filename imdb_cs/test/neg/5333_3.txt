This "documentary" film casts absolutely no light on what it would be like to be behind the scenes during the Hard Knock Life tour. It is true that I was not there, but watching this movie I didn't think I was. And for such a movie, it's not exactly a compliment. All the while I watched, I just thought, "What do they miss?" When it's over, the only rapper you feel is that you have some insight into the DMX, mainly because they only talk about their dogs. Waste of time. <br /> <br /> 3/10
