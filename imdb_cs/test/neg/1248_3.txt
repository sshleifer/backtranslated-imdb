20 people rated this and 10! The ballot box was stuffed better than the Christmas turkey! Speaking of Turkey, here's a traditional story that hopes to return to contemporary poker - no success. I said a completely linear flashback, and when I say "I say", I think A PAINTED DIRECTION, this film never allows the image to be sufficient when words can be used for exposure. Stu Unger's children's card fascination and his hood associations may sound like interesting film material, but the director will suck their life out of them. By no means did I feel the slightest sympathy for Unger, the genius on the cards, who threw him to other forms of gambling where he wasn't as proficient. This, of course, leads, as we wade through three musical assemblies, to the inevitable descending spiral of drugs, the loss of the family, and ultimately to the redemption. Great yawn!
