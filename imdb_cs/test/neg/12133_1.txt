Heh ... I'm surprised that this movie still exists in any form, let alone it is available for rent! This movie is one of the many bad movies that exist only for T&A and cheap laughs. The story line intersects a bit of a "Texas Chain Saw Massacre" with a mysterious story that reminds of "psycho", and some good old women in chains, harsh and naughty ex-cones that have rushed. on a good scale - in other words, full unoriginality wrapped in half a nude woman spiced with a dash of utter idiocy! When the director tries to make the Quebec swamp disappear, as the land of the South American Gulf is sad, I tell you! Funny for me, I was actually in the premiere of this movie because at the time I was friends with Ratchford, the movie star. It was painful to see Jeremy sink into place while the film spread its ground wings. I'm glad that Ratchford, after this first swing fake, grew into hell of an actor. He can be seen regularly on the Canadian cop drama "Blue Murder", appeared on "CSI", not to mention his role in the classic film Clint Eastwood "Unforgiven" - we forgive you, Jeremy! It was a rocky start, but you did well, man! <br /> <br /> T.Paul
