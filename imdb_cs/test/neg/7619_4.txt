I saw this movie for the first time on NBC Friday 11-29-02. It was a pretty good movie, but I don't think it would be the kind of Muppet movie Jim Henson. First I mean Pepe, using the word "sexy" at any time, and Pepe says, "Would it suck?" And I defenitely know that Jim Henson would not allow Kermit to shout: "I AM NOT BORN!" thirteen minutes per minute. This movie just isn't like the classic Muppet movie. Sure, I can understand Nicky Holiday stealing a baseball diamond from "The Great Muppet Caper," but a business lady cheats Muppets in a contract for their theater to make him a smoking nightclub. If Jim Henson were here today, he would hate this movie!
