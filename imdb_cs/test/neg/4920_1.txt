Well, at least this was the last sequel I found on the blockbuster, because this movie was just downright horrible. I understand how hard it would be to get rid of the evil house. We're talking about terrible fire, bulldozers, floods, etc. But a mirror? How hard could it be if we got rid of the mirror? This was the worst movie that could put Amityville in the picture! Well, a group of friends who are almost from the beginning are a bunch of madmen. One of them is a photographer of some sort and buys a haunted mirror from a horrible homeless guy, teaches me a valuable lesson, doesn't buy things from a scary homeless guy. Of course, horrible death and chaos arise from this group, even though I can't imagine anyone missing them. Skip Amityville: The Next Generation, I've already had a few complaints about my generation, so I think it was a premonition. It doesn't sound so crazy. : P But believe me, it's terribly acted, not well thought out and not scary! I feel so bad for the original writer The Amityville Horror, she has to cry every time a person witnesses this film. <br /> <br /> 1/10
