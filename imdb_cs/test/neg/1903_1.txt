Plunkett and MaCleane are two magnates who rob the rich to give them ... the rich; fairly, they are rich. But we know they're good guys, because the one behind the forces of law and order, Mr. Shanghai, is so bad. She rapes women - or tries. He beat his friends. He commits murder. He has a bad breath. It doesn't move properly. He has no sense of fashion. Puppy puppies. The last one is just my conclusion: we don't actually see him tortured puppies. But I'm sure you do. Little of Chance's legacy has much to do with his quest for Plunkett and MaCleane. It's just something he does in his spare time, a hobby he takes to be absolutely sure we don't like him. He doesn't have to try that hard. Nobody in this film is sympathetic. <br /> <br /> Let's take a look. Attractive characters? There are none: I believe we covered it. Swashbuckling? It's not a swing. Instead, we have some dirty heavy breathing. Dash? Spark? Vigor? I'm afraid it all happened as it happened. Realism? Not one of them. I think they were trying for realism because they were all so dirty, but the characters and actions had all the credibility of Errol Flynn - without being excited to support them. Beauty? No way. Working with a Fine Camera? Maybe for the TV crew. Humor? You can laugh once or twice if you are in a benevolent mood. Then again, maybe not. Dialogue? See "humor" above. Music? Don't even get me into music. Music in `Ladyhawk 'was, unlike that, unusually apt; and at least the erroneous aesthetics of this score were consistent. <br /> <br /> Ugh. I apologize for "Ladyhawk" for even thinking about it in this context. To sum up: there are many positive badges and nothing good - unless you count Liv Tyler, which I am doing in two minds. <br /> <br /> I feel like I just wrote a smallpox review. "It's not very good," says the review. It would be much more interesting if I could somehow eliminate smallpox, claiming that pox critics have everything wrong - but I don't know how to do it.
