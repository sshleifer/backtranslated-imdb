"Destroy all the planets" will end in the end of the film settling on "destroying all of Tokyo", because a giant octopus-like space monster falls into a reptile kiln known as Gamera. In fact, Gamera saves Earth just before he sets off, knocking out Varian's No. 1 ship before the first set of film credits. The scene goes to the Japanese Scout Camp, where we meet a couple of young heroes of young heroes, Jim and Masao, who participate in Gamer attacks after being kidnapped by aliens and aired aboard their ship in an electrified bubble shield. It is quite surprising to see that the boys convince the scientists to allow them to operate a newly invented submarine that could be defective. Formerly a genius genius, Masao, joined the unit to run in the opposite direction to its controls, but Dr. Dobie didn't think it would be possible. At the very least, it prepared the boys to interfere with the control of alien spaceships by playing a switcheroo with lots of triangular blocks. <br /> <br /> When a foreigner boss, Viras, says 'Activate Videotron', hang up on the seats to re-entertain the footage of earlier Gamer movies where he fights Barugon and Gyaos. They take up enough time on the screen but fail to fast forward, if you want to cope with it. The longest time Viras approached the invisible crew, and when they finally appeared, they were Oriental who could fly - imagine it! When we see how these films were made for a teenage audience, it's surprising to see how horrible some scenes are. I feel the blood pumping from the Gamer and how a couple of the crew of the universe are falling apart. When octopuses began to emerge from the headless bodies, I made contact with the films 'Alien'; To unify the individual units to form a giant Viras was a neat device. I think the attraction for young children could be to identify two young heroes who meet giant monsters with giant friends. Freely on an alien space ship, and get to what they want with the help of alien telepathic technology. Seeing the movie probably made by adults, it could have been a simple fulfillment of the wishes.
