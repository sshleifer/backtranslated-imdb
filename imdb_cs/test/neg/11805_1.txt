No one can say that I wasn't warned because I read reviews (both users and external), but like most of us attracted horror movies ... curiosity got this cat. (Come on, we all shout at people in the movie not to go into a dark room, but you know horror enthusiasts are always dying to know what's there, even if we know it's going to be bad). The bottom line is that this movie made me angry. Not because he pretends to be real (who cares ... tricks are allowed), or because actors and dialogue are so lame (is this an unusual event in horror movies?) Or even because the film is so bad ( and I'm polite). What really freaked me out is that the movie is not just tearing BWP, but also a half-hearted lazy rip on it. I don't believe in sacred cows and if they think they could surpass BWP then kudos to them, but they didn't even try. The film was made with little effort or care, and it is the most unforgivable sin in horror (or any) movie!
