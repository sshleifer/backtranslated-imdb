Someone told me that Pink Flamingos is "crazy" in one word. Now I doubt if the guy actually saw it because it's not a way to sum it up in a word. Disgusting, absurd, um, more disgusting ... he'll do it. Every time you think he can't be more dirty anymore, he does. One of my favorite "favorites" was when Divine had a birthday party and when the cops came in, they were defeated and eaten by the guests. I admit that this is one of those films where it's so grotesque that you just can't turn away, but that is by no means a work of art. It's a net shock value. Awake, Jackass guys look like a bunch of pussies.
