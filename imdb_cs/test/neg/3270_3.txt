Every time I watch this movie, my blood comes out of my eyes. Yes, you read it right: I've seen this pathetic, hideous thing more than once. Caddyshack 2 went wrong for a number of reasons: Harold Ramis in the script and leaving directional duties, Rodney Dangerfield (wisely) left the project because he didn't allow him to play the script, Bill Murray made a good judgment and he wasn't a part of it, and a puppet that was pushed forward as a cast player who deserved a lot better. I can't help but think of Dyan Cannon and wonder why he's always laughing and smiling. The only conclusion I can draw is that it is actually the face of pure evil. Stay with me for a while. She had to watch the film gather and enjoy the myriad of agony that countlessly wasted movie viewers would have wrought on the film. Maybe she was also very drunk. This is what I need to be right now to wash the nasty taste of this complete and utter failure from my mind. If I'm lucky, it'll be washed out forever. I've seen this movie several times. I blame several of them for my childhood and behave like a very boring boy who obviously had no aesthetic sensitivity. Maybe puppets are just more fun when you're a child. No, the Muppet show is fun now ... I think I was just boring. Caddyshack 2 is a rare kind of movie that is so extremely disappointing on so many levels that you can see for yourself after the credits are over, that it couldn't be as bad as everything. It was. It is. With time it gets worse. My reasons for returning to this film, mercifully, are still decreasing. Randy Quaid is limited in his role as Jackie Mason's lawyer. His opening scene is not bad and it just brought me laughter. We see him a few more times, but he becomes as tired as the rest of the film and descends with unfortunate speed from accidentally entertaining to desolate wasteland. Randy Quaid adopts well and this film owes him a lot of time, because if it were a reason to watch this film as something other than a tactic of torture, it was him. Maybe it's the movie trick. He has enough potentially good qualities that people are watching, they are horrified by what they have done for themselves, but later, because picking was so slim that they only remember what they really enjoy. A few years later, they unknowingly followed it and the cycle repeats itself. Jackie Mason takes a lot of blame for this movie, but honestly, I'm not sure he deserves it. It's really trying out there, but it's impossible not to notice that spending the whole movie doing Rodney Dangerfield impersonation. That's what the movie was written for, but I'm not sure he could save him. Eventually it fails miserably through the horrible direction, bad cuts (we will count the continuity errors?) And rehashing the same story with none of the humor or heart humor that made the first movie cute. Dragging a kick and screaming up to three out of ten instead of two of Randy Quaid's tabloids. It's not that bad to laugh. I certainly saw worse, but I believe in memory - this is a dog. If you have never seen it before, you have made an excellent life decision and I greet your excellent judgment.
