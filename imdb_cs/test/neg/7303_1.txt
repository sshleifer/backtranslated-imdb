Ed Wood's Classic 'Plan 9' has been regarded for many years as the worst film ever made. Forget it Roller Blade Seven is infinitely worse. The cast consists of famous brothers of nations and almost famous or actors and actresses. The story does not exist with the budget and the script. Running time is not made in the classic Ed Wood style, which uses footage. Instead, there is endless slow motion and repeated action. And when it comes to The Roller Blade Seven, there aren't seven! It gives independent filmmakers hope everywhere.
