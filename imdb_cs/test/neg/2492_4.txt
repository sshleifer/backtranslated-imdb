There are many other comments about how bad this movie is. I wanted to point out how this film has captured the greatest scientific project in history and made it so small. The Manhattan project was an incredible success and was huge. Virtually all of the silver in the country went to wire production for electromagnetic separators. If there were any choice between two alternative ways to do things, they did both. The first hardy nuclear reactor was fired under the stands of the University of Chicago football stadium with graduate students who controlled the axes as a trance mechanism. It is a fascinating story involving hundreds of places and thousands of people that this film seems to shrink to a small group of eccentrics in New Mexico. Another thing I really didn't like was a huge moral debate if we were to continue the project after Germany was handed over. Well, we have thousands (mostly) men who have been working for years to make a really big boom. Does anyone think they don't want to see it? There was some controversy at the time about if we should use the device, but it was not so serious, clearly not a huge debate this film makes it to be.
