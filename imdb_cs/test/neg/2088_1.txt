This movie is bad, yes, but if manufacturers used REAL KANGAROO, it would kill the actor with whom the box was. I am an Australian and I have seen two seven feet tall men 'Roos fighting each other, this is not a nice view because the object is for one or the other to kill their opponent (this is the way to secure a female herd) and there are incidents where someone has The Box Kangaroo, and was injured or killed, so when you see a kangaroo on a TV or movie, chances are it's a woman or an animated because it's a good idea not to hurt the actors (they may be upset at losing the ability to breathe). There is a special idea that Australian animals are cute and cuddly, that is false, many of them are dangerous (10 of the 12 deadliest snakes live here) and most of them are just ugly (Koalas are as soft as wool theft). So if you come to Australia, be careful !!!
