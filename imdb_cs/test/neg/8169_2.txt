Watching "Baghban" is a film equivalent that tries to eat one way out of a taffy saltwater vat for nearly three hours. This Indian film is a sticky sweet, sentimental soap opera that starts as "King Lear", passes to "Romeo and Juliet" in the middle, then returns to "King Lear" for his tear final. Br /> <br /> Raj Malhotra is an accountant who has everything one could want out of life: a woman who adores him, a family who loves him, and a job he is about to retire to a life of faithful service. Although Raj and his wife, Pooja, got married for 40 years and have four adult sons, they still behave like a pair of love that the newlyweds struck, cooing and sighing, burning their eyes to each other and whispering into each other's ears. almost to the point of nausea. In fact, the whole bloody crop is so happy, loving and harmonious that it looks like a dysfunctional family compared to others. Parents and children joke, laugh, even perform together with choreography, "spontaneous" song numbers and dances together (like many Bollywood productions, "Baghban" is a drama scattered by a large number - too many musical sequences in this case. Anyone who knows something about narration is aware that such undisturbed bliss cannot be allowed to remain unpunished long and that all joy is merely a prelude to some terrible catastrophe that should go to the head of our unsuspecting revellers When we know this, we spend the first hour of the film in horrible expectations and think about what form this catastrophe will come to when it finally arrives, a thunderstorm about an hour into the movie when Raj tells his children that he and their mother have decided to move with one of their families, leaving them to choose which one will be up to the children and their respective Suddenly, just as King Lear discovered the vipers hidden in his family's chest, Raj found that his children were not so loving, selfless and eager to share their homes and live with their parents as he originally thought. Of course, children are frightened of the prospect of making a plan for their parents to come up with a plan in which Raj will go live with one of their children while Pooja will live with another; then they turn off, finally, each child has a chance to host both parents and then the cycle is repeated ad infinitum. Parents approach the plan, even though they are both deeply in love with each other and have never spent any time. Thus, the second and most third hours are spent with both aging (though married) lovers collecting each other while their ungrateful, insensitive little brothers do their best to make their parents understand how unwelcome they are in their family . One of the main problems with "Baghban" is that he lacks the subtlety in both his narration and direction. The love that Ray and Pooja feel for themselves, as well as the almost dizzying proximity of the family unit, is so strong in the first hour that the film almost collapses under the weight of sentiment. Then, practically without any warning, the script turns on a dime and converts children into ruthless, self-directed monsters and parents into passive, selfless sacrifices of this ruthlessness. Raj and Pooja are too long in the teeth and too dependent on making a dreamy, engaging, unrepeatable love piece that is more suitable for kindergarten children than the parents of four. The violet prose style, in which all emotions are underlined and highlighted, leads to intense overclocking and strong reliance on shots from stinging reactions and melodramatic music to punctuation. Musical figures bring about some liberating joy at the beginning, but they continue so long and so often that they quickly lose their effectiveness and serve only to put the material into unbeatable proportions. At least an hour could be removed from this inflated production without being recognized - and good enough. There is no reason why this film would have to hang out in three hours. Most of all, it is the seemingly endless confusion we face to end, a manifestation in which Raj (who has somehow managed to turn his experience into an award-winning bestseller) gives a lecture on the truth of parent-child relationships. at least ten minutes at least. "Baghban" is a sarcastic saga filled with more sugar and goo than a box of King's chocolates. Pattern at your own risk.
