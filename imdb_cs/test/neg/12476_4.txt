I was surprised by the enthusiastic response to this film. It seemed to me dull, just as I was looking forward to Penelope Cruz and the details of the plot often poorly processed. It also seemed to be a strongly sexist film: if gender roles were reversed, almost anyone with any meaning would complain in weapons that the film was intensely misogynic. It's not just that the two main men are portrayed as complete blasters and sexual predators, but also that women are portrayed as almost flawless, forming a utopian community that lacks conflict of any kind and rests on inexorable generosity and good humor. Utopias are notoriously boring, and this doesn't seem to be the exception. But it is also interesting to notice what is happening (and here it comes to reveal that it is a very early scene) when a teenage daughter kills her father. (1) Her mother rushes to take responsibility for it, and (2) the daughter seems to suffer almost no remorse (and in fact her emotional life disappears from the film). It's not that spectacular killing, though Aldomovars' camera on blood glows in a bloodthirsty way, as if it made an attractive image, and then is soaked and out of sight, without bloody daughters or moms, neither materially nor emotionally. Later, the film reveals another killing, again a man's wife, and again it is a killing that the film implicitly supports. In short, Volver is an ideologically driven film with an unpleasant and, in fact, outrageous ideology, so I write ideological criticism. But besides, it's not very interesting. He has no depth, let's say, Aldomov's talking to her I loved.
