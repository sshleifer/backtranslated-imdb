San Franpyscho: 1 of 10: So you want to make a serial killer movie. However, your budget does not exist, your camera device is older and your stars are Joe Estevez (younger Martin Sheen's brother and the core in really bad movies) and Todd Bridges from different moves. There are probably ways to pull at least an observable film. Quiroz brothers have no idea. Above all, most of the casts seem to have been chosen in a desperate attempt to make Bridges and Estevez look like Oscars. Is it really hard to play a priest or a mother? Certainly the city of San Francisco's size has several professional actors willing to work for a few dollars and screen credit. Clearly, Chris Angelo and Bonnie Steiger, who play these roles, have other talents, such as a landscape painter or a waitress who should be fine-tuned. Joe Rosete as a killer (yes serial killer is simply known as "The Killer") ") is also pretty horrible in a mentally ill method, but I'm almost willing to give him the benefit of doubts because of his character The bored almost laughing serial killer is a problem for a serial killer movie. In addition, the Quiroz brothers apparently originally planned it as an ABC family movie of the week. it was possible to speak, and the R rating is clearly designed for adult-style stimulation, moving meanders like an 85-year-old woman who was driving sunglasses and turning her direction, the only occasional horror coming from the enlightenment of Estevez's face with a dazzling look that looks like his lower jaw was removed. <br /> <br /> I didn't expect a great movie when I rented San Franpyscho, but I didn't expect boredom.
