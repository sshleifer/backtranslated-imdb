This is an interesting way to manipulate the camera, <br /> <br /> espercially for the DTV movie - the version I saw was full screen <br /> <br /> - but it's not lacking in scenario separation. First you get <br /> <br /> about 20mn to talk, talk, talk in by-be-hip, post- "Trainspotting" way, then it's slasher city. And then come <br /> <br /> the most affected cheat finished I saw much worse than <br /> <br /> "April crazy day" - where at least it made sense. So all in <br /> <br /> everyone is an old song and dance: an interesting director is trying hard <br /> <br /> but he deserves a better film. Funny: usually they are actors who desperately need something better? Skip it anyway, for your time
