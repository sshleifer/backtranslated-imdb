This film is about a young girl who goes to live with her wealthy cousins ​​falls in love with one of her cousins, and refuse to advance an amoral suitor who brings problems to the family. After seeing the 1999 version and reading the book, I decided to watch the older version. I found that the book remained faithful to Fanny, but it was also boring. Fanny's character played Sylvester Le Touzel was bland; it often seemed to be weak. I also didn't like Robert Bourbage, who played Henry Crawford. I couldn't imagine being interested in Fanny or her cousin Maria. Jackie Smith Wood, who played Mary Crawford, was fine, but the wig she wore was so ugly. I lost interest in her acting and I was still staring at her wig. I expected her to fall off her head. I could see the slip of her real hair under my wig.
