This is a neat little movie that is worth your time to find and see. It really talks about all the mundane possibilities we do every day and (like HG Welles Story can't remember) can live to want back. <br /> <br /> Keep in mind that this is SHORT (very short). It starts slowly, but once you think it has become boring = bang = it's over. And believe me, the "firing pin" is the one you remember. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure if manufacturers will make it available for purchase - or available on the web, but in any case He would like you to take the time to get a copy - I'm sure .
