OK everyone is so excited about this movie Hardly dare to add a negative review, but I didn't really like this movie. First I have to say that I saw the film in Russian so I missed some dialogue but not much. <br /> <br /> Nice things first. There are some merry moments (for example, Elvis impersonator). The actors look good, too, the Russians. Efremova is great and Goldblum is very good. Which brings us to the weaknesses of this film. First. Hardly any story and end we already know: Yeltsin wins. So no drama or tension. They have tried to solve this problem with the emerging issue among the above-mentioned actors, but the story is evaporating. More importantly, the film is not a reality. The Russians at the politics and society portrayed in this film are not funny, they are serious and dangerous batches. I am willing to believe that flying in some spin-doctors from the states has helped Yeltsin win his campaign, but the real interesting questions to be addressed are: who funded the campaign, what they got in return, how the opposition was dealt with separately from posting some ads ? So here we have a movie, loosely based on reality (but strangely evading anything that could be a film either historically relevant or just a very good political thriller) without a plot or a subplot.
