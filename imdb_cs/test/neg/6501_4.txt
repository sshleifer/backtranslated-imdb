Avida is a word game that combines life and eagerness, but I personally think that this film has been overwhelmed by its ambitions and does not justify its name. It gathers a number of unpleasant characters linked with unbelievable links. In addition, the way everything is connected is, in my opinion, a little pathetic. What was left of it was a set of images ... interesting, but not enough to make it a good movie. I believe this movie is supposed to be a comedy, but I certainly didn't notice it! The nonsense and caricature of the film is actually the only good thing about it, but when it moves remotely, and it no longer becomes bearable. I must say, I fought hard to see it to the end, and I'm still not sure it was worth it ...
