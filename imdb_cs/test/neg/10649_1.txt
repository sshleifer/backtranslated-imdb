Joe Cool Review - Hellraiser: Bloodline <br /> <br /> Starring Bruce Ramsay as Phillip L'Merchant / John Merchant / Dr. Paul Merchant, Valentina Vargas as Angelique and Doug Bradley as Pinhead <br /> <br /> Plot: Follows the Merchant line time line that started with Phillip L'Merchant, who created a box that opens the door to hell. From the 18th Century to the present, when Pinhead first meets Merchant and tries to break the bloodline ... (he's the only one who can stop Pinhead, see) and finally in the future, in the universe where Paul Merchant finally came to how to send pinhead to hell for good. Openers: This is a film hated by so many people who have done it, fictional director Alan Smithee would have been an authorized director. They're just pulling Smithee out of wood when they really think they've done a horrible movie, such as The Birds II: Land's End or Bloodsucking Pharaohs in Pittsburgh. No, I didn't. How do I like it? You read it so I'm sure what you want to know. The Good: This film is not as bad as you were led to believe. I'm not gonna sugar it. This film was filled with so much potential and ended up as a disaster, but it has several positives. Cooler cenobites this time for beginners like twins and demon Angelique. Pinhead is still in the lead role and still has good lines ("Pain has a face, let me show you") and it's somewhat fun. Gorehounds will love the movie because it's an endless offer. There is also some continuity with the rest of the series, though you will have to look hard to see it. Chatter dog is amazing. Bad: But for the story of hell in the cursed bloodline Merchant that could forever close the gate, it was really complicated and stuck with the adhesive tape. Nothing was really explored to be full of potential, and there were some really stupid things included. Pinhead kidnaps and holds him for ransom! Accidental deaths just to give more blood (not always a bad thing, but not a story). Pinhead is in the worst place, boasts and brags, even if he is going to die! For the very clever demon he used to be, at best, he was limited to nothing but Bond. If Hellraiser fans ever needed a reason to be moved to a similar portrait role, that's it. Bloodline has destroyed us all. Ugly: Gore is always mentioned here. This one has skin ripping, drilling, hooking, chasing and other goodies. Chatterer Dog, while amazing, smells bad special effects during chase scenes. The Final Verdict: This movie had the potential for something big, even Hellbound. But all this was unnecessary. Who knows exactly what went on to produce this crap, but we can only blame Alan Smithee. <br /> <br /> Compared to others: This film is the worst of the Hellraiser series. For professionals only. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/2 * of *****
