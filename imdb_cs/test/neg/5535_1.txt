Gun is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction of the comics is very poor, dialogues sound like a 13-year-old teenager, a conspiracy? Finally, nothing in this movie is good. Big Thumb Down to all those involved and especially the Montreal Film Festival, which presented this film in the COMPETITION!
