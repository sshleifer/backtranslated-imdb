A little too much Mediterranean machismo for me. The cast was beautiful, beautiful to watch all the romantic scenes. The place was beautiful with cyan sky and azure water. It wasn't just convincing for me that such an egomanic aileron, which was not enough for anything but its building, could attract so many beautiful, vulnerable women. I think only in the Mediterranean. Certainly in any world I met. The Macho men were really uncomfortable, and I found it hard to believe that female characters could have been with them for so long. Screenplay, cinematography, directing, etc. It was set up to provide a class B film, whose main goal was to introduce the scenes of beautiful exposed female breasts. It was aesthetically nice for a while, but he couldn't keep a very average movie.
