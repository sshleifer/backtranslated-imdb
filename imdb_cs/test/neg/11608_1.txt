This movie is about poor, spoiled, ego-driven winners who think they have something interesting to say, played poor, corrupt, ego-driven winners who think they are interesting. Directly from the coke troughs of New York's polite, rough dramatic scene. As many viewers have come to think that it is carrying a substance, it remains a mystery to me. Maybe they have been secretly long for this overpaid and overrated "guild" or maybe they've never seen a decent movie? Get out, put your hands in the dirty ground and get a real job. Otherwise, kill yourself with a real weapon.
