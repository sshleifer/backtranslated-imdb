Anyone who knows something about evolution wouldn't even have to see the film to say "false." "It has never been disproved" is also a weak argument. To say that the universe was created by a huge hippo cannot be refuted. Though, to be fair, it seems that the only people who believe are the same people who open email attachments to people who don't know or give their bank details to a dude in Zambia. No primate bones were found in the United States or Canada. There is also a good reason why legitimate scientists don't bother to study this. The same is true for the monster Loch Ness, spirits and god.
