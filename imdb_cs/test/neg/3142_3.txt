I rented this movie from a local library without having a prior knowledge of the book based on the movie or the movie itself, purely based on the chance that it is one of those rare, overlooked gems that one can occasionally discover and really enjoy . Unfortunately, it's not one of those movies. I'm not sure if this is a movie driven by sentiment or a worse, deliberate agenda, but some of its elements made it impossible to immerse it. It is expected to portray a struggling immigrant community trying to cope with the difficult reality of their lives. This is a great assumption, and it could have done it to grasp the story, but in fact, it was just alternating how angry and amused me with ridiculousness. Here we have a community of simple farm workers who have migrated to the US to find a job and who are repeatedly used and abused by evil white men. And when I say evil, I mean EVIL. All the white people in this film are sinful, racist, sadistic, offensive devils whose sole purpose in life is sexual corruption intertwined with the exploitation of poor immigrants. It would be a sad story if it wasn't so unintentionally grotesque and therefore cheerful. Immigrant depiction is also an example of the poster's exaggeration, except that it goes in the opposite direction. Immigrants are holy, clean and can serve as an ointment for boo-boos and ouies around the world. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw these "field workers" who probably dug all day in their ditches with their notoriously clean clothes and cut hair from a top hairdresser. A little restraint and a more unbiased hand at the helm would make it a much better film that would produce more intended emotions than sarcastic snickers.
