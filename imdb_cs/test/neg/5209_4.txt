The Island of Death is not a good movie in any standard, but it's strange. Imagine that Natural Born Killers was made 20 years earlier than the Greek movie Eurotrash. This is what you get here - the picturesque story of a young, sociopathic British couple who cuts through the deadly Greek island. <br /> <br /> I'll save you a detailed plot of land; It is not really important, besides setting up an increasingly perverted or violent sex scene followed by disturbingly brutal murders, often lovingly photographed for the offspring of our charming young couple. It could have been brilliant, my own sick and ugly way, but instead ... <br /> <br /> Instead, I was impatiently checking the running time and the chapter index to see how long the show was last. Sudden stimulation and helpless, insignificant performances transform even the weakest perverts into the pablum and unite the scenes into eternity of blunt misery. Ok then. You can't win everyone.
