I've spent the last half hour reading other reviews and I don't know if I want to laugh or cry. There is no way ADJL is like Harry Potter, Danny Phantom, Fair OddParents, other than the secret magic world that was near overdose. Also, no way is ADJL anime. Anime is a lot of drawing style (and some say more like conspiracy and Japanese origin), in any case ADJL is not anime, so it stops saying it is and if you're looking for something like anime, look elsewhere like Teen Titans and Avatar. <br /> <br /> ADJL is typical. It's like all the other Disney shows. An arrogant main character who thinks he knows everything and doesn't even bother listening to people who are older than him and still making the same mistakes. Best friend sidekicks. Repeated graph with a twist touch. And sibling rivalry. Can't they once make a character who has a brain and isn't full of himself? Don't children respect their elders? Can't they think of anything else with the storyline? Can't they have siblings together and hate each other? ADJL is simply too generic because you also have bad guys who have defeated and come back again, and are also complete idiots who don't have the background for their hate. C'mon, you think someone who has at least 30 will be able to go to the world for 13 years. <br /> <br /> Watching ADJL is like watching almost anything else on TV today, like u and again. Nothing special, just new character designs and one little thought that is used over and over again.
