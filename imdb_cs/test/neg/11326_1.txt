Years ago, I was deliberately watching bad movies. I lost something. No gesture is true. No facial expression matches the scene or action. I've never heard such inappropriate music for a movie. In the final scene I took root in the car running over the ridiculous child - one of the worst child actors ever. The only name I ever heard in it - Wilford Brimley. He had to be very hungry to take over this part. <br /> <br /> DO NOT REPORT ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, WATCH THIS FILM !!! YOU WILL RECOGNIZE !!!
