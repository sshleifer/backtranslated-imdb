I thought this movie was a bad endeavor for the British film council - it fell like a hey, come on, Tim Robbins is an old man, and this is a beautiful young woman who also fits him. Just as lost in translation, it is really hard to suspend distrust in this context. It's a good-looking movie, but it doesn't hit. When Tim Robbins pretends to be psychic, he seems to have little migraine. It looks uncomfortable and less. The part in which he checks suspicious employees in the Sphinx is ridiculous. If an investigator came to my factory, the last thing I would do is tell him about my pirate fetish. It is clearly overly intellectual. Clumsy. The city is as it is, a comfortable background. Apparently they chose the most futuristic city they could (Shanghai) as the background, but the city never emerged and did not affect characters such as runners, where the city's characters often intersect with the story. slow as a wet week. No chemistry, real dramatic points, so conspiracy.
