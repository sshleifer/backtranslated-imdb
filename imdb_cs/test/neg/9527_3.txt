The story I understand is "based on real events." This can be either good or bad, depending on what type of license is with these actual events and how they are provided. <br /> <br /> In this case, the results are sufficient to gag magic. I didn't expect to go a lot - I was expecting a story of rich high school students who sailed under the ocean under a strict captain. This is what I thought was a film about the coming of age, which is in line with something about a training camp or basic training, about which helicopter sergeant he says: "My job is to rip you out of your amazing civilian ways Well, that's right. Children begin as children and end up as an organic group. But this is far hockey than any movie I've ever seen, except for a deliberate comedy. Who did this thing? The air is filled with slogans that do not belong to high school, but to the third class. Dialogue offends the ear. Jeff Bridges usually does better than average work, but in this case his performance is average. It doesn't add anything, even if it's hard, it's hard to know how much it can do with them. The rest of the cast is indistinguishable and several children are painfully inadequate. There's a lot of tearing and a lot of crying. The best scene includes a dolphin. Immature clich√©s continue to the very end. The Coast Guard is occupied as a stubborn court at a hearing that follows a catastrophe. The researcher does nothing but hits Bridges over his head with his misinterpretation and misinterpretation of events. "You let the crew drink alcohol, right?" (A few harmless drinks.) "And you didn't punish them, even if you punished them for killing the fish." (The Dolphin Shop.) The technical details surrounding the sinking remain murky. What is a "white swing"? And if it's as dangerous as Bridges claims, why wasn't the entire crew alerted and wearing jackets? But why next? If "Albatross" was Dreadnaught, it would still be torpedoed and sunk by the ridiculous comic-book script.
