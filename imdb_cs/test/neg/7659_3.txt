With the cast of mostly less graduated stars (Alain Delon, Robert Wagner, Eddie Albert), crappy special effects (sure, that was 70, but "Alien" and "Star Wars" come from the same decade), and the story of being so ridiculous that one might want to cry, that's a "flight" that should have been INCLUDED. Even Oscar winners Cicely Tyson and George Kennedy can't keep this "bird" in the air. The third film's improbability - the plane is submerged in the Bermuda Triangle - is much more believable than this turkey. <br /> <br /> Avoid "Concorde" at all costs!
