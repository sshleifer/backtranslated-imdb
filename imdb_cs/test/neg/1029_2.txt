It's hard to believe that oprah winfrey produced this piece of waste, the show couldn't even hold a candle for cooking shows from the past, including emeril lagasse, rachael ray's most annoying talk show and cooking show host in TV history, not because ainsley harriott had a horrible host of cooking I have watched, at least ainsley harriott has some good moments and some style, this one has no style at all, is terrible as a host, the kitchen looks terrible, writing is terrible, teleplay is up and the initial credits are so bad, it makes me sick. Now I enjoy cooking that has a cool sense of style, but it has nothing to do with this. This is one of the worst televisions of the year.
