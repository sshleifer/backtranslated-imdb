It looked great from the film sleeve, but after five minutes we weren't sure whether it was a homosexual documentary about a Western side story without any female interest. The quality of the film was poor and barely enough gang action to keep the drunk's interest long enough to watch the film. God has mercy on the soul of actors and filmmakers responsible for what I can describe as my new only reason I never want to see (or trust) Australian film again. I have to write more so I say again that the actors were so bad that I was positive that I could make a better film with fifteen dollars and a box of Trojan horses. Please do not show this movie to you.
