I'm sorry, but I can't agree that it was a good movie. Yes, it looked good visually, but it's the story that drives the movie and I have to say that the story sucked in a great time. How in the world they slipped some of the critics' conspiracies. A better story and I would give him a higher voice, but I couldn't do it and still be able to live with myself. I've always been a fan of scary movies, and previews tricked me. All thumbnails were displayed in thumbnails. And why did the family that killed stay in the house? Why did Father return? Why did he decide to kill in the first place? Why were the children the only ones who saw ghosts first? There are not enough answers to many questions. If I could give it zero, I'd do it.
