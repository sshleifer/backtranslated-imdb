(DVD) "The Tempest", directed by Jack Bender, was released in 2001. He did not get into German cinematography and the director and actor could not win a significant award for this film. The film refers to Shakespeare's play "The Tempest", which was released in the late 16th century. The director tried to create a modern version of the game but failed. At the beginning of the film, the Prosper plant owner gets into conflict with his brother Antonio on the treatment of his slaves. Antonio sets his brother on the road and tries to kill him, but with the help of a witch, Prosper is able to escape and escape with his daughter and a slave named Ariel on a small island near the Mississippi River. For more than twelve years, he had lived on this island in isolation until a happy chance would allow him to avenge his brother. If Prosper is lucky, you have to find out for yourself. In my opinion, this movie is really bad and tries to create a modern version of William Shakespeare's original game. The story of the film is confusing, just like the characters. Prosper does not have the same powers as in a storm ..... END OF PART I
