This is strictly for Pryor fans. Just because he was great, a funny man doesn't mean it's more than a B-movie. The scenario is terrible, revolving around the constant ridicule of crime and prisoners of war. He balances between comedy and melodrama and still falls on his face to not justice. Is it 30 minutes of a rather unrealistic, uninspired Vietnamese prisoner of war? The boy plays basketball in one place ... How much more can you follow the audience? ... Prison time is boring, unconvincing and can easily sleep. <br /> <br /> In the US, this guy is not considered a "war hero" for any real reason. Of course, of course, the public quickly forgets it and seems to stumble into all kinds of insane misfortunes. Or are they really? We'll find out soon. Yawn. There are annoying clich√©s: his sick mother, his little daughter will never meet, a high-end slut falling in love with a hero etc. It is very strange how this film constantly shifts from a tragedy to a slapstick at one time. It doesn't work at all. Overall, it is actually just a bad comedy and abusing prisoners of war. Just because this guy was a great comedian, he played in some good movies and died at MS, there's no reason why this stupid, unconvincing, unfair comedy shouldn't be upset. But if you like Richard Pryor, you'll probably be thrilled to read 3 hours of Dada poetry.
