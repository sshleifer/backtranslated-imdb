"Jaded" offers a prerequisite with the potential as it looks at female rape by two other women and ask the question "when is rape not rape?". Unfortunately, the film seems to be in the wrong direction because it slogans with a legal minutia while trying to weave a story with a handful of spoiled and ill-displayed characters to just quit. "Jaded" is a lame material only for an angry potato couch in the mood for some dark drama.
