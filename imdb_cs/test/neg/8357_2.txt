I'm writing this review simply because I'm a huge fan of Prozac Nation, and I was horrified by the film. I guess if you didn't read the book, you'd lose the movie because it didn't give Wurtzel any real story. There was no real mention of her childhood (her relationship with her father, her summer camp experience, her first therapists (in fact, the film gives the impression that she was never in therapy until Dr. Sterling) ...). This means that if you read the book, you would be confused by the amount of edits that took place. I found a book as a vivid image of depression, emphasizing the low places of Wurtzell, and the experiences she had on her way. However, the film began at Harvard and literally threw the audience into the game without really explaining what was going on. Events that were important in the book (eg Wurtzel's abortion, her summer) work in Dallas, her suicide attempt, while Prozac was dropped from the movie. Also, it's pedantic, but Wurtzel didn't lose her virginity to Noah. The suicide attempt shown in Sterling's office was completely different from the book. For starters, she actually overdosed on Mellaril, as opposed to the para-suicide gesture shown in the film. <br /> <br /> All in all, I'd say if you read the book and enjoyed it / identified it. with that, then you don't have to watch the movie. Instead, read 'More, Now,' (same author). Or look at the girl, broken. The only redeeming feature was Anne Heche, who, in my opinion, portrayed Dr. Sterlinga. Christina Ricci was also good, though her performance seemed a little ... calm. Jessica Lange did for enjoyable watching, but she looked the opposite of how Wurtzel's mother described it. Conclusion? Don't bother.
