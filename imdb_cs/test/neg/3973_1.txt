Parts: Clonus Horror is a horror movie. There are of course bad fashion from the late 70s. It's really a bad deal from Dick Sarenta Peter Graves. And then there are the clones themselves. Their days usually consist of running, jumping, cycling and matches with each other. If they don't, they learn about America. Not America band, or Neil Diamond song, but America, where they become part of a bigger society. But they get some weird medicine, then they have all their body fluids depleted (General Ripper was right!) And they're placed in the freezer and waiting for Thanksgiving or Christmas when they are thawed and baked at about 450 degrees. Oops, that's not what happens, but it would be more interesting than what is shown. Mario, the fame of the Super Mario Brothers, makes a wonderful portrait as a doctor arguing with Dick Sargent.
