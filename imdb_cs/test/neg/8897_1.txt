My only reason to sign up for this site was that I could write a comment on this movie. I felt I had to get rid of some anger by writing it. The movie "Babas bilar" must be just about the worst movie I've ever seen. I truly believe that the screenplay might have become a pretty good movie, or at least fine, but something happened on the line. What is even more strange is the fact that the cast seems to be fine on paper. Doing both the scenario and the cast cannot deliver. There are to many actions, it happens to many things and you can't wonder why it happens. And then the actors, the actors make such a bad effort that you almost start to cry. <br /> <br /> If you have a lot of time, I'd say you see it. If not - no.
