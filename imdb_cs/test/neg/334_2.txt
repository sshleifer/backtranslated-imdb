I really didn't want to write a rough rating for this movie because I really appreciate how hard it is to make any kind of movie on an incredibly low budget, let alone try something as ambitious as science fiction. However, this movie is really terrible. The negotiations are among the worst I've ever had to endure, and as a fan of low budget movies, which is quite a serious accusation. There are plenty of ambitious actors working on a deferred payment regime if they believe in the film and what the director was trying to achieve. I'm sure the actors did the best everyone else did in this production, but it just wasn't good enough to do that. Then there is dialogue. Very bad. There's no excuse for that. I got the impression that the script was hastily written on the back of the mattress after some epic boozing. I hesitate to use the word 'laugh', but that's exactly what the script is. I had no empathy for any character. Indeed, they stiffened with me with the result that I wanted to seize a few more than once, Mr Stirton, by taking over too many roles. Clint Eastwood is not. Again, there are talented people there willing to work on postponement if they believe in the project. <br /> <br /> Much has been made of special effects in this movie. They are exceptional for money if they are somewhat exaggerated. It is as if someone said "I have after the effects and I use it". The one who did the CG work was one of the most talented of this crew. Quite simply, money was not available to make this attempt ambitious. Kudos for attempting it, but unfortunately he failed to achieve his intoxicating goals in too many ways. Greetings to everyone who has been involved in its production, indeed, but either they need to get a better producer or reduce their views to something more manageable for their continued efforts. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this effort to anyone other than the most interesting film students or the usual insomniacs. If you want to take a look at the true low-budget sci-fi movie masterpiece, try John Carpenter's "Dark Star" student.
