I tried. I really tried to come up with something that deserves a higher rating than two. It's not that I didn't "get" it - I'm a big fan of Asian cinema. The truth is that the film is infantile under construction, long-wound, and painfully incoherent. I suppose if you're from Alfred Hitchcock's thought school, "Don't tell them to show them," then you might try to appreciate this movie, but you'd still be hard pressed. First, Terrorizers are trying to stream consciousness, in the style of Jean-Luc Godard and failing in this. Edward Yang seems to have understood the basics of technology, but he is very unskilled. (Maybe she gets better with age, I don't know how I have not yet tried other Yang movies.) The point is, she uses the lack of "show, don't say" that really only serves to break the story process. Sure, he gets into some visually concealing images, but they don't take the story together and don't help make it a little better. The main concept behind the flow of consciousness and "show, not say" is that with the right images, the right drama, repetition, and solid correlation, the viewer will be able to make his own conclusions; not to say that this will be the right conclusion, but that may be altered as the story progresses, and each director should strive to make this type of interaction with the audience. Edward Yang is very disappointed in this regard. The viewer is constantly on the periphery. There is no reason to be drawn, no reason to think about characters or their motives, no reason to be emotionally involved, and indeed no reason to remain alert. Finally, Yang gets lost in the story he wants to say, not the story himself. His art is moving in one direction, but just like a big dog who can't control himself, he constantly pushes lead, trying to get him back to the playground he wants, not the one that follows. The most striking example of this is the end. The end should actually occur when the man appeared. The end of the book on which the film focuses (and thus the end of the film) has already been told. If Yang had decided to quit at this point, he would have a much stronger piece, leaving the guards tense - playing the story, as the book says, or did Yang's "real world" play differently? Asking the viewer to think about it is a kind of interaction the viewer Yang needs painfully. Instead, he continues to tell the story he wants to say, straining the natural conclusion in the interest of what? Because of the pure interest in the main character - we didn't have to know more about her, and Yang wouldn't feel the need to tell us if he did it in veneer instead of bothering. to become a more engaging and deep figure. Why else does Yang extend and torture his film? Get into those "visually arrested images". The film really suffers. He wants to end it, he has a conclusion that feels natural and leaves the viewer restless, but instead pushes Yang. Instead, Yang constructs a complex ending that leads the viewer to constantly ask him "so what?" The first end, the one Yang ignored, was good. The other end, well, my idea was "so what, who cares?", Because it's not as if it was something that wasn't already in the story ... but the last end? That was really a waste of time. Not only did the "real" end leave me, but I also felt it was an insult to what the story might have been. Yang sacrificed a potentially good story for gum-melancholic-noir-tinged that he insisted on all the time. My last film problem has nothing to do with the film itself but rather its post production. Subbing (if you see it subbed) is terrible. Long sentences stay for a second or two, while short ones stay too long. Also, as Yang quickly changes images, subtitles are removed from the screen. This is one of those rare instances where subtitles should be able to remain on the screen even if the image has changed, because there is no dialogue.
