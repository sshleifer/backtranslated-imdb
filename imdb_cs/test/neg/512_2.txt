I think vampire movies (usually) are bad. Although the film is not that good, I still like it because it has vampires. But it stinks. It's really giving a vampire movies a bad name. <br /> <br /> For starters, cheapness really shows. I'm not usually worried about low budget movies - one of my favorite feature films is El Mariachi, which costs just $ 7,000 - but I hate it. The event also crap crap, resorting to a "stylish" trembling camera that gives you headaches. <br /> <br /> There is not much more to say than otherwise. I bought it for Â£ 1.50 because it was an ex-hire and I feel cheated on my money, even at a low price.
