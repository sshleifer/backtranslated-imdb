As I mentioned in other comments, since I saw him in "American Ninja 3", I have become a big fan of David Bradley. The guy is great doing martial arts, he has some kind of charisma and is a cool looking dude on the screen. Sadly, he went to the DTV department sometime since his debut and remained as one of the king of television films until 2001 where he apparently stopped making movies. One thing is to watch a cyber cop or harsh justice that are miserable cliches movies, but really fun to watch (coz are fun bad if it has any meaning) but another thing is to watch the tasteless piece of boredom like Total Reality. I think this and the crisis are the two biggest pieces of horse dung he ever did. I wouldn't recommend it to Bradly's hardcore fans. If I knew it and the crisis should be so f ***** g crap, I would have spent 3 or 4 euros that cost me. The overall reality is as boring as the crisis, though cheerfully, starts promising. In the future, a group of military prisoners will be given a chance to stop a catastrophe in the past (I'm sorry, I didn't pay much attention to this attention) and they only have 24 hours to return or something like that. If not, they are trapped there forever. The poorly supervising director "tries" some funny (?) Clich√©s like convicts who come to Earth and don't know what a truck is (wow, cheerful ...). The film follows David Bradley, who has joined a girl from Earth for the rest of the film. That bored me so much that I had to force myself to watch it in 3 or 4 installments to at least use the 4 or 5 euros that cost me. That's every time I tried, I fell asleep. And if you get a movie with David Bradley, who has only one lousy 10-second battle scene in it, then it's the ultimate touch to help you throw him off a hundred-foot cliff to never see him again. I wish I could meet the "director" of this pile of poo on the street and swear to God I will ask him back for 5 euros. I would also like to meet David Bradley to ask him why he decided to play in this poor apology in God's name. Don't even bother with this movie, I mean it from the bottom of my heart, not rent it and don't buy it separately.
