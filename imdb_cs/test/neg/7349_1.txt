I watched this show for a while, just because of my cousins ​​and I hate it! First, girls dress up in the same style of clothing and have the same first letter in their names. (Come on, I could do it better!) Then the villains (saved me), first we have a monkey with part of their (small) brain, then we have a (gay) version of the devil, a pink village, a gang of green gang (whit is ironic it is their name) a corrupt princess (again, irony, that is 'her' name) among others. I also found that there was no male hero in the series. (Not that I'm a sexist or anything ...) I'd rather watch Sailor Moon, it's much better than this. If someone else wants to watch a show in the room you're in, find a way to break the TV. Believe me, he'll save you half an hour of torture. Rating: I'm giving it exactly what it deserves, 1 out of 10.
