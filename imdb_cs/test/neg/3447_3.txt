Coen Brothers-wannabe by writer-director Paul Charter relies heavily on ideas that have been removed from other (better) movies, yet they manage to create a spooky atmosphere that keeps one track. Robert Forster relaxed as never before before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist (ha ha) who kills in the desert. The film is unusual, but in an effort to keep up with the audience, it alienates and postpones (with Amanda Plummer's role, which is totally humiliating). It is true that the bravura finals, many bizarre bits of business - and Forster look great in nude - make it a curiosity item, nothing more. Produced by veteran film director Irvin Kershner and possibly a director (could the Paul Chart be a pseudonym?). * 1/2 from ****
