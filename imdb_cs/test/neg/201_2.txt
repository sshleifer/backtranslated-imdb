This film, through its list of B, C, and D celebs, is a complete waste of 90 minutes. The storyline, with a few peaks, was very predictable. It was so stupid I couldn't believe I took the time to even write it. Flex, to his credit, has grown into the ability to act since Michael Jackson played a television movie a few years ago. Tangi, on the other hand, came back because she was more talented in her role as Felicity's flunkie a few years ago. As I sat and watched this train wreck, with its woeful production and terrible sound quality, another four letter words attacked me to qualify what I thought of this movie. However, in an effort to keep my G rated, I simply say that this movie is another four letter word starting with LAME !!!
