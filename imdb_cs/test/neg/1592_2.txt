The only reason I didn't give this movie a terrible assessment is that I feel it was such a horrible movie in every aspect that deserves at least 2/10; for not trying. The plot is the smallest of your worries when you're in a cloak with a quick language and scenes like "ass singing" in a bad shock and disgust. The main goal of this film is to shock and its main part of it, the final scene is disgustingly able to erase the memory of this shocking nonsensical film and fulfill its goal of being the dirtiest film ever. Br /> <br /> A really low budget movie, terribly acted and dialogue is shockingly bad. <br /> <br /> I give it 0/10 really !!!
