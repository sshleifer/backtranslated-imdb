I haven't seen and heard the original version. I'm not Russian, but now I'm learning. <br /> <br /> I don't have any preferences for Russia, Bulgaia, USA, etc. <br /> <br /> But what I have to mention is: <br /> <br /> All Russians speaks with a Russian accent. Americans speak "Hochdeutsch" (no accent)! I've never heard such stupidity! Besides, it's boring. <br /> <br /> I hope the original is better. The rest is a simple thriller, not really good ideas. Like a cheap version of James Bond's movie.
