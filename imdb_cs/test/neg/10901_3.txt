A young couple on the road guarding their own business and having casual sex in the car in broad daylight. But suddenly they are threatened and terrorized by a psychopath in an old and rusty pickup truck. Hmm, where did I see this assumption before? Oh yeah, now I remember that we've seen Tojus before, and about nine hundred and ninety-nine of the other cases were much better than "Rest Stop"! This weak and sad new movie is offensive even to the intellect of the most demanding horror fans because it doesn't have a single original twist or an unforgettable trick. It's very sadistic and ugly, but every teenkill-slasher movie is sadistic and ugly nowadays, so there's no real surprise anymore. The absolute main problem with this production is the incredibly large number of holes and minor graphs. The writer / director John Shiban damn well realized that the ultra-thin basic story is almost not enough to fill the film, and so does his film as a Thanksgiving turkey with imbecile and senseless padding of the material. Nicole's boyfriend disappears at an abandoned and dirty stop in California. Immediately killing her character would not lead to a very long film, so she would then meet a family of motor family fools who suffer from visions (?) In which she talks about the previous victims of a killed killer and has deep emotions (and boring) conversations with a police officer that just won't die, even if a truck has run over it ... twice! Silly sub-lands are never going anywhere and they are certainly the most miserable and desperate attempts to stretch the length of the film I've ever seen. Instead of any unnecessary padding, Shiban should pay more attention to building tensions and making his lead characters more sympathetic. Jaimie Alexander's character Nicole is an annoying and helpless girl and you don't care if she survives the suffering or not. Her friend Jesse, as well as the cop, are both whimpering losers, and their brutal deaths are still not painful if you ask me. I counted exactly three sequences, including torture and gratuitous mutilation that were pretty bloody and exciting to bring a sadistic smile on my face. It's too little for today's horror. Basically, "Rest Stop" is simply a lousy attempt to cash on the success of such films as "Wolf Creek" and "Hostel", but rather watch originals. It was the first film of a new production company called "Raw Feed". They support themselves as a new name in great horror, but they will have to come up with something better than "Rest Stop" if they want us to believe it.
