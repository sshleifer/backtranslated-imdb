Oh my god, it's just not worse than this !!! I always like stupid little science fiction B-movies that are so stupid they're funny and I thought it would be one of those, but this was so stupid that I was absolutely regretful that it was allowed to be released . What did these people think? Apparently they're not real filmmakers, and I really hope they came back to their jobs after they realized it was the best they could do! Acting and not-so special effects were nowhere near the standard of even the lowest B-movies. And with men dressed as women, they couldn't find any women who wanted to appear in this miserable thing. No, probably not. <br /> <br /> I'd give this "0" if possible, don't even deserve "1" for the horrible one. Don't waste your time (and especially not your money) on this terrible loser!
