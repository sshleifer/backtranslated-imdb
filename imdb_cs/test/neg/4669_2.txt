Like many people in my general age range, I remember seeing this film as a child in 98 and coming out of the theater in tears. At that time, it seemed to be one of the most important, amazing film experiences of our generation. Armegeddeon instantly riveting, action-packed, witty, heartbreaking and truly inspiring, really all that is going on, up to the catchy song Aerosmith and sappy tear-jerker endings. Sweet Jebus. What did we smoke? For the first time I watched him in one of the movie channels and ... I can't even describe it. That's really one of the worst movies ever made. Where to start? Leaving aside a lot of LAUGHABLE scientific errors ('personal trackers' on astronauts? Yeah, of course, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I would have to say that the worst thing was remarkable - I dare even say it's unrivaled - A tour in which it combined lousy writing with lousy acting. There are too many examples to start showing here, but one of them stems in mind - a scene in which Bruce Willis tells the Fed exactly where to go to track down each of those charming family members. oil drilling team ("check every bar in New Orleans", "craps tables in vegas", "the only black on a motorcycle in Sturgis" ... ... all on "Come Together" ... that reminded me a bit of a scene "NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE! "By Anchorman, except serious. Ben Affleck proves once again that he is by far the most overpaying actor in Hollywood who has less depth, scope and talent than anyone in the industry. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, or any other GARFAGE GODFORSAKEN CLOTHING was much better. (I must say, though, that I got a kick from seeing Eve Owen Wilson kill off halfway ... is this the only movie where his character dies?) <br /> < Peter Stormare is perfect as the most stable Russian Russian player COSMONAUT, who always has a scene. (Then again, Storm Stormare seems to have a talent for playing top-quality Eurotypes.) It was really fun, as Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly almost immediately after the Americans landed with a Russian space station (which is actually called in the film). causing the whole joint to explode in a spectacular Hollywood fashion. I also love the fact that in the end, Paris is the only place on Earth that is destroyed and that no one seems to care for it. What's more, it is literally turning into a contemporary spot for Lockheed Martin and Kerr McGee. Oh, how proud I am to be an American. There's a lot of other things we're dealing with, but I won't ... just say it's really a really horrible movie That I'm ashamed of ever really enjoying it. I only give him two stars for a fake factor.
