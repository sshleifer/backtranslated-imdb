I was looking at this movie based on good reviews here, and I won't do that mistake again. The first few minutes show that a group of people has been linked to some tragedy, but you don't see what it is. Flashback 12 hours and we see the boring lives of each of these people who are ultimately totally insignificant to what is to happen. Finally, when you are finally pleased, you realize that you have spent an unnecessary hour of your life unnecessarily and waited for a great reward that will not happen, and nothing for what you have watched. The only connection these people have is that they all had a "bad day" - but this continuity is lost in boredom. <br /> <br /> If it's a "Crash" clone, it's a complete failure.
