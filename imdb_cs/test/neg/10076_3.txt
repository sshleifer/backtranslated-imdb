To summarize, my group of friends and I spent about 45 minutes outside the theater, sharing our favorite gaffs, conspiracy inconsistencies, unbound loose ends, and other ridiculous aspects of the movie. I found that the story trite to point insignificant and plot lines as underdeveloped as dino embryos still locked in canister shaving cream from Jurassic Park 1. Adjustments were bad and none of the characters caused any kind of sympathy or feeling. In short, this film lacked the tension and excitement that the first film provided in terms of the story <br /> <br /> Even the new dinosaurs were little and far away (even though I really enjoyed pterodactyls). Short footage of the new species and only 2 have joined the event. As a scientist and former child paleontologist, the lack of real scientific content (not that it must be realistic, but logically formed ie how they built the dinos in # 1 and malcom's chaos ramblings) was disappointed as well. In short, the film seemed to be nothing more than an excuse to trot dinos back to the scene to make some money. I hope that movie visitors will not fall into this trap again (although I may have done it)
