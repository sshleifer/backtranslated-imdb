I am a huge Zack Allan fan and I was disappointed that he only got one scene in the movie. It was also my favorite scene where he confiscates the weapons of the character and directs it down. Unfortunately, unlike the Thirdspace & River of Souls, most of the action took place outside the station. After the first three seasons, I didn't care about Garibaldi and I think Sheridan is fine, but not Sinclair. I like Lochley, but she only had limited time on the screen. If you like crusade or space battles, you should enjoy it. Personally, I can only give 1/10.
