Yeah, that's right, people, this is undoubtedly the worst show in television history. If you want to watch a sad, lonely and unjust hack comedian trying to entertain the masses with half an hour of pale and tired social ramblings that your slightly retarded cousin commented at a dinner table in Thanksgiving, then this may be a show for you. It is billed as a nervous comedy by my friends, but to be honest, makes Tim Allen look like Richard Pryor. Avoid at any cost. Unless you are a masochist.
