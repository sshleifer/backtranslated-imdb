From the epicenter of the cultural globe, four working-class teenagers have tried to change the world through music and fashion. It was the last attempt to do so last century and they failed. Before the dust was wiped out, the band manager and store owner SEX Malcolm McLaren spent the money The Sex Pistols earned themselves to make "mockumentary" about their own role in their success. The film is called The Great Rock 'n Roll Swindle and consists of very small footage of The Sex Pistols that actually play music and quite a lot of McLaren shots that effectively call audience idiots. Cod-surrealistic nonsense, in which guitarist Steve Jones is a McLaren tail detective, will soon dissolve, so he and drummer Paul Cook can go to Rio and spend time with "great train thief" Ronnie Biggs. Get ready for a spectacle of three very unconventional men dancing nude to the nasty ironic version of "Belsen was Gas" (a song about killing Jews for gold in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp) and another song sung in Ronnie's deaf whine that includes the words "God save Myra Hindley, God to rescue Ian Brady "(texts that Johnny Rotten would consider repulsive). Sid Vicious's scenes are little and stupid. Jumping from bed in tango with swastika through testicles sing some bad song to biker boy from 50s. Play to the topic of "Punk's Joke" movie, in an effort to turn Sid into James Dean. I'm surprised that McLaren also doesn't take Siddy's death. The redeeming scenes are those of Sid in Paris and the infamous performance of My Way. That punk rock zeitgeist. Mocking adoring audiences before shooting them all. No need for a full movie, just watch the clip on YouTube. Julien Temple is a far better (and more fun) documentary tracking of 2001, The Filth and Fury, we've got a more balanced / honest look at what happened in '78. But there were also a number of scenes I would like to see in Swindle (because Fury was basically reediting the same material). One was Sid animated with Sid's voice; "You're angry when you look around, fine, or cut you off" - from what appeared on the cover Something else, 7 inches - a snippet was shown in Fury, but I don't know what originally appeared. Was it in original prints, but removed after Sid's death? Was there more? Fury also shed light on the movie Who Killed Bambi, which was the fake Hard Day's Night McLaren he originally intended to do. He played Sting (!) As a member of the New Romantics gay group and looked damn better than Swindle. Sod Swindle is a scam. If you need to rent The Filth and The Fury and enjoy the music failure as a world of changing polemics.
