Of course I disappeared in the movies. Neil Young Concert Movie The Heart of Gold. Over the years, many great concert films have taken place. The best is Martin Scorsese 'The Last Waltz' who made the last concert of the band on Filmore West. A phenomenal concert and a phenomenal movie, that is, when you love rock and roll and feel like you were born into it and were part of the music, and you could be in a band if you had a better guitar and someone would show you Chords with it With a few chords and a lyric or two you can change the world ... as you might think I felt all five down to the bottom of my twenty-four year old soul. Neil Young was in 'The Last Waltz'. They had to digitally, before digitally actually, they had to manually scratch the big dangling rock of cocaine that had printed from his nose so in the movie there is a bright light that is not the star of Bethlehem dangling over his lip and under his nostrils ... famous piece of rock and roll history. But "The Last Waltz" was made when the band and Neil and everyone else were in the 1930s and "Heart of Gold" was shot last year when Neil was in his sixties and his band looks like they are in their late 1990s, and the entire film could visually be used by the Christian Right and DEA in the same way that those Ohio state patrol movies of drunk driving danger were used when I was in high school showing dead teenagers hanging over the front windows or hanging out trees or bloody in a ditch. Close your eyes and it's a great concert, open it and look at Dorian Gray's hidden portrait. The case at the point, once ethereally beautiful Emmylou Harris literally came out of the darkness to sing with Neil and from the darkness to the light that seemed to be a circular wraith that emerged from the river before Rivendale. Gastly, a ghostlike, nose that does not appear in nature and is not an advertisement for plastic surgery, eyes that make buttons in dolls look alive, and the ability to express any emotions, human or not, limited by unlimited enthusiasm for botox. My mind moved ... porcupine ... Peru ... Jack Daniels ... has been living hard for decades ... my god ... sweet Emmylou Harris I saw singing free at Fred in Boulder, face for 2000 years dead Pharoah wouldn't accept it. But a voice as pure as a fat lipstick made of boulder beer that was brewed from the waters of Boulder Creek and closed my eyes and felt ammmmmbbbererrrrrrrrgerrrrrrrssss (tribute ... one must use homage at least once in every movie review ... on Fred's Boulder burgers Mall and Steve Martin's Pink Panther movie). It would be an amazing concert in the dark at Ryman Auditorium, maybe twenty lines back. But close up, in close proximity, it was a medieval moral game depicting the horrors of benevolence and the consequences of sinful life. Concert Theme, Decorated on Scenery, Prairie Wind ... last song, mass guitars (I counted eight) and wondering if there was irony in the game. I do not think so. Native American bass player, chief guitarist who looked and dressed like Buffalo Bill, a piano player whose face looked like a screaming face in Munch's The Scream, baby singers (actually matronically singers, mostly reminiscent of one of the lost young seniors United) flight attendants still sailing in a friendly sky) dressed in matching lengths of desperate denim dresses ... no it was played directly. None of them have seen, I would bet, the mighty wind. It will be a great CD and it would be a pleasure to tell the stories of hippy dippy Boulder when Neil was a long-haired Canadian crooner whose incomprehensible lyrics seemed to reflect grief and loss, feelings as versatile as they are now. . But only in the dark lane.
