I was looking at the 219 minute version and I have to say that the dollar for a dollar is about one of the worst movies ever. Now WILL NOT say it's the worst movie ever - but if you look at the cost ratio, how much the average person will have, it's a very, very bad movie. I would like to say that the only biggest factor that makes it a bad film is the writer / director Michael Cimino. Rarely can there be so much guilt on one person. If he wasn't lenient enough, the movie could be so bad that it could be easily done in about 90 minutes - save the studio millions! <br /> <br /> The film begins with a totally useless prologue to be set at Harvard. The scene is huge, but completely without context. You have no idea what exactly is happening, nor do you know why students (especially John Hurt) behave so Boorish. I find it very difficult to imagine that it would start in 1870 - and it looks much more like in 1970. That's half an hour when you don't know what's going on, who's the characters or their motivations. The next scene is 20 years later. Inexplicably, two Harvard grades (Hurt and Kris Kristofferson) are in Wyoming. So, they went to the best school in America and now one is just the law man in the middle of no place and the other is .... well, what is John Hurt in the movie?!?! It seems to be here and there and it seems to be either a jerk (prologue) or a pathetic and absurd drunk who hangs with the murderers - even if he is clearly against them!? His entire character made no sense. They never explained why the British was living in the middle of nothing (it was impossible to hide his accent), why he bothered to come with a rented army if he was against their malevolent plan, or why he risked his life for not believing at all. As for Kristofferson, his outstanding performance and better defined character believed his character, even though he moved with him to Wyoming and risked that his life for a prostitute makes no sense at all. This brings the worst aspect of GATE SKY. While the scenes are WAY TOO LONG and the necessary cropping, the worst part of the movie is that the characters were like cardboard. John Hurt (a wonderful actor who has nothing to do in the movie), Jeff Bridges and many other big names, but you don't know why. In fact, except for Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert (like a hooker with a heart of gold - quite a clich√©) and maybe even Christopher Walken, EVERYONE is one-dimensional. It's hard to imagine the movie being long unless you know or understand the characters. Most of the film also appears to be anachronistic. Who would have thought a giant ice rink should be built in 1890? I am sure that it would be very, very difficult to obtain basic supplies in this region in the West - and yet we expect to believe that instead of FOOD, trains full of roller skates and lumber have come. Maybe if they weren't spending the basilis building and visiting the ice rink, the farmers could afford to BUY the food and avoid this war over the settled cattle !!! And what about the kid on roller skates? What does this have to do with ground war? <br /> <br /> The most obvious problem you've encountered is that it's a movie that is very, very little, late in the movie until the big battle. There's plenty of dirt and flatness scenes. So much nothingness that many viewers would leave at the time of the battle, or it is now so hostile to the film that it is inevitable that nothing can save the film. <br /> <br /> As for the last battle, it was done reasonably well, but it had problems. First, this little prairie skirmish took longer than the D-Day invasion !! Secondly, while the details of the real events of the so-called "Johnson County War" are a bit superficial, we know that the characters Huppert and Kristofferson have never played were actually there, both hanged before the battle. Thirdly, I can't believe Cimino actually killed the animals throughout the film - especially during the final battle. Although I am far from bleeding heart about animal rights, its need to use animal casings and actually kill some horses is a low point of film history. Watching and knowing that some of the horses will die to achieve Cimin's "vision" for the film is very sad. Finally, after the big battle we have an epilogue. Although it is a short blessing, it also seemed totally unnecessary and vague. We see Kristofferson on a luxury yacht, so we can assume he will finally bring some of that Harvard education to work for himself. We also see a woman who seems to have looked at Kris several times during the prologue. Most importantly, nothing is said and you don't know what the end result is. I read about it myself and found that the film often got the facts wrong. Overall, the film is long and the tons of more adjustments needed were like saying WWII was a "smaller tiff". Well, I certainly saw it a lot worse, but if you count production costs, I think it may be one of the worst movies ever. Finally, when my movie is a very explicit nudity that I warn my parents. Since no child could sit in this movie (even with a promise of sex), a warning is not necessary.
