Cuore Sacro combines shiny movie effects with a story that remains very desirable. With a scenario that the screenwriters "Touching the Angel" could hand over as too grumpy, Ozpetek is still interested in us sometimes. In fact, I wanted to focus on the positives, but I found the last act that is so crazy bizarre and terrible that I think a couple who jumped to the very beginning could be the best. This film is the heart (pun) story built on the big end. This kind of subtle foundation can result in a huge success, such as Una Pura Formalità or Divine Terrible Waste, like M. Night Shyamalana's films. Cuore Sacro falls somewhat closer to the other. Overall, I found that cinematography is above average. Tracking footage of Irene obediently doing in the pool was very impressive, as was the atmosphere conjured up by her mother's house. For me, the grotesque parody of Michelangelo's Pieta, when Giancarlo comes from the rain and Irene with him, is a little elongated. One of the great problems I made of this film was Ozpetek's way of simply turning the camera directly into the face of his protagonist and recording the ongoing emotions. This worked with a fantastic effect in Facing Windows, but when it worked here, Bubolova seems not to be a Mezzogiorno. In fact, in addition to the ridiculous story, the main problem with this film is the milquetoast performance of its main character. This made the last decay scene still unbearably bad. In this film Ozpetek continues his crusade against our societies driven by societies by inviting us to be more spiritual (not necessarily religious) and more altruistic. And although I am certainly the one who is very sympathetic to this view, I felt as if the audience had a blunt object in the head. Could the characters already be two-dimensional? I was inclined to make this film very exciting and mindless. Was "bad" Aunt Eleonora something more than a cartoon? This also applies to people on the "right" side, as well as "good" aunt Maria Clara and the older porter Aurelio. And just in case we could omit Ozpetek's decision, he decided to wear his enemy forces in his own liver. This brings me to an interesting point about using color by the director. He dressed the opening pair, who flew briefly in all the blacks, as well as Irene (when we first met her and after her transformation to life), the evil Aunt Eleonora, and of course the good but confused Padre Carras. Black is the color that indicates a course, the wearer's mind is set and without emotion. It is the color of choice for this indispensable object of modern armor, suit. It is also the color of mourning, such as funeral finers sported by a suicide duo. Finally, black is the color of piety, such as the simple dress of priests and nuns, which Irene imitates in the second half of the film. The second main color and a very suitable choice for the Sacred Heart movie is red. It is a color that has an extreme self-emotional component. The character who wears red is bold, emotional, receptive to new thoughts and forgiving. Red is a risky color in modern times; it challenges our perception of the wearer while making the wearer vulnerable. Yet red bears the enormous weight of history and mysticism, because the earliest members of Cro-Magnon's man buried their dead in red ocher, and indeed the first man named in Torah, Adam, is named after the Hebrew word for red. Red also has an anachronistic flavor, looking back at the past when it was more red accepted (and the association of a less self-confident attitude to life). So when we meet a red-filled room (mysterious friezes covered with walls with a red highlighted menorah and a red image of a whirling Dervish!) Of Mother Irene, the "good" characters of Maria Clara and Aurelio wearing a brilliant red dress and finally a picture of Irena's mother in formal red dress we see where Ozpetek's sympathy lies. <br /> <br /> I found the original word or two of the soundtrack with original musical motifs that match the story. Irene's quasi-baroque theme was great for its monotony and the sense of restructural malaise (the absolute best use of the ever-recurring Baroque theme that would have to be in Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, with his masterful repetition of the 8 bar sarabande attributed to Handel) . One totally inspired choice was a few seconds of the opera aria we hear as it flashes while Irene chases Benny through the house. It's the famous "Ebben? ... No andrò lontano" aria from the Catalan opera "La Wally". Aria sings the main soprano, who forever leaves home. Because Irena's mother was a dramatic soprano, we can guess that this is a record of her singing, and that she and her daughter say that she and her daughter will say goodbye, as soon as she is determined to never see Benny alive. I have only one minor question about the soundtrack, why is the famous tango Yo Soy Maria? I love the song and I personally heard it, but it really didn't fit.
