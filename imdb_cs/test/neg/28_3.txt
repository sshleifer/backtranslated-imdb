Rita Hayworth plays the dancer of the Brooklyn dance club, Rusty, who specializes in choral cheese cake revue; she gets on the cover of a national fashion magazine, but her upcoming success as a solo (with romantic offers all around) hit Gene Kelly's boss on the piece. A terribly tired piece of Technicolor sugar stick, with unmistakable musical sketches (the two worst of them being irrelevant footage from 1890, with Hayworth showing his own grandmother). Kelly, as always, dances well, but acts with false honesty; when he is serious, he is unbearable and he spends adrenaline for the rest of his time. The scenario is the main weight, nor does it give support to players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines. * 1/2 from ****
