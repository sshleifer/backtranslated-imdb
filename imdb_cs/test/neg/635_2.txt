Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of respect, shock, compassion and, yes, total terror. Thinking that actors who have done a good job in the past should figure out something like that. Horror, horror. <br /> <br /> Tell me if any of these sounds sounds good. A train specifically designed for a political campaign is on its way to Las Vegas for a big rally for candidate, Senator from Texas (Barry Corbin, the only actor with ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade). At a railroad crossing in Utah, a meteor burns a car waiting for a train. <br /> <br /> The train stops. Local law enforcement arises. It can be? Senator has a beautiful young lady (Amy Locane of CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE) who has just been married to one of the 911 respondents. Lou Diamond Phillips (LA BAMBA) is a former husband. Meanwhile, Eeeeevil managed to steal the train. <br /> <br /> The train is leaving. Lou gets her friend to fly a helicopter so Lou can fall on a moving train (about 70 miles per hour) to save the day. As a friend's reward, a helicopter crashes on a mountain. <br /> <br /> What's another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is. The head of the police hero must die, we all know that. But he has to die near the end of the third act, usually to save several lives. Once on the train, Lou manages to lose his shirt so Bruce Willis can bring himself to the DIE HARD. woman whisk shirt. Yeah, Lou is 46, but he's hit the gym. The part he plays is not worth the harassment, but he is in good shape. The Senator will enjoy the afternoon pleasure with Miss Utah, but the strangers intercede, both he and the woman who is young enough to be his granddaughter to pay the final price. Soon we have bomb threats, extraterrestrial multiplication, and of course the train goes out of control and speed toward its date with fate, while Lou and Todd Bridges (DIFF'RENT STROKES) try to save as many lives. There is one surprise in the whole movie. Soon in the story of the couple pick up the glasses on their thirtieth anniversary, hoping for thirty-five years together. The guy's going to break, but he and the lady are alive. Maybe the writers just lost track of them. This is the kind of movie you'd like to fly on the wall. Those actors who have done a better job (and really deserve much better than that) are probably just happy to work. Did they really think they were working on something worthwhile, or wept at night (and / or drank) to sleep? At the end of the story (quite a lot, all things considered) the survivors gather in the last train car that is unhooked. The other cars go over the cliff, but the one that contains the protagonists stops just inches from the cliff. Lou and his ex are reconciled. Happiness rules. I thought the first thing they would do would be to get off the train to have solid ground under their feet, but I would turn. Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star. Look, make a wish. Then another. Then more and more. Earth is bombarded by meteors that will tear open and fearsome puppets with fierce fingers with large teeth everywhere. The "original" movie tells us that we will be happy to have a Ti-Vo so we can move forward in the next two hours. Or, even better, just go on and erase two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely.
