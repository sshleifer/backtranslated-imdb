I no longer have any respect for IMDb ratings. I think the website has flooded a lot of Mormons and voted for it. It's not an art movie, it's Mormon propaganda. There is nothing wrong with it, but the outline of the plot and the way it is described is completely misleading. If you are a Christian bible or Mormon, watch this movie, you will love it and I think it's really amazing. For no one else, don't bother, the story is so fanciful, a random thing happens that doesn't really follow in a coherent way. This guy's trying to commit suicide because he's sleeping with his neighbor. Are you kidding me? What cat! Anyway, it's a horrible movie.
