Ten steps basically have a reasonably good assumption for a scary short, but the execution is just scary. Dialogue is terrible, and it is such a regular witness in Irish short films. Really really embarrassingly bad. The girl has to go down 10 steps to the cellar to replace the blown fuse. She phoning her dad who is the amusing his boss for dinner. A mother, an "actress" with very controversial acting skills, answers the phone and tells her loudly shouting that she won't ring because dad "tries to impress his boss". The actress playing the boss's wife very successfully mimics her mother's bad business when she tells them that their house is haunted. The rest of the film consists of a father who telephoned his daughter over the stairs. Ten steps use storage technology to move the camera, lighting and music that one might expect in a below average horror movie. Poor.
