Wow, quite amazing that something so bad could actually be done. I give this movie 2 because it's so bad that it has a certain "car wreck" kind of appeal. It's so bad his comic and it has some fun value. Moreover, there is a bit of gratuitous nudity, and it is always appreciated. <br /> <br /> So where do I start? Acting is terrible, it's like watching a high school game. Theresa Russell had to do something really bad to be forced to do this movie and her acting reflects how happy she was in the middle of this mess. The rest of the cast is just stupid with casting Dan Cortese as an FBI agent cherry on top of this piece of crap. Actually, his acting performance made me laugh out loud. As for the script and direction by C. Courtney Joyner and Mark L. Lester, they should just be taken back and shot.
