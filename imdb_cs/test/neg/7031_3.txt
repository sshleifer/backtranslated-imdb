Did we all see the same movie ??? I can't believe that some of the others are doing this horrible bio that, whether they believe or not, has been authorized by Shirley Temple herself under her CHILD STAR book. It gives me the feeling that some are so easy to please. First of all, ASHLEY ROSE ORR, regardless of her modest talent, in no way has a form or form that would resemble the Shirley Temple enough to be cast as in this kind of straightforward biography of the most famous baby stars in the world. It does not state why and how this child was so revered than to try hardest to make Shirley personification, which will never click on any level. None at all. And that's the main handicap of the whole piece. But as if it wasn't bad enough, any drama that is inherent in Shirley's story of her ascent to almost nightly night was completely faded when writing with occasional song and dance moments that didn't match what Shirley did ( such as "The Codfish Ball" with Buddy Ebsen, who was probably the highest point of Shirley's choreographic dance routines. Simply putting a girl in a polka dot dress doesn't make her Shirley Temple. None of Shirley's own brand of magic, heat, and attraction is even suggested remotely. All we see on the display is the pale imitation of the original evidence, once and for all that there was only one Shirley temple. It is useless to write something about this mess. None of the others is more than ordinary in life roles. My advice to Shirley fans is to read her book - or even better - to watch her movies. These are pits.
