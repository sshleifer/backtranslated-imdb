I can't knock this movie too much because it's in the middle of watching it try to make it bad or 'campy' if you prefer. By the way, many parts that have tried to joke are actually, but often only for cheese factor. Watch the game of "space attackers", which is actually played as real life! Scratch your head on the rattling robots ... oh, madness! And watch the whole thing go over the top near the 'warp' end! And sexual allusions just keep flying ... I'm actually surprised that I got with PG. Oh, good. A fun way to lose a few hours, but Star Wars / Trek is not, people. 3 out of 10.
