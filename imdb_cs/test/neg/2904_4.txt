I remember capturing this movie in one of the Showtime channels. What intrigued me is that this film takes place entirely in Phoenix, Arizona. I'm from there so I noticed locales easily. Regardless, the ninja kills scientists because they wear yellow sweaters and golf that is being chased by the police. It takes about half of the police force to take it down and there are no recognizable wounds when they eventually kill it. His spirit lives on when a woman finds her and touches his katana. Since then, he has been regularly seizing and killing police officers who have killed the original ninja. Then another ninja from Japan comes to kill the evil ninja. It can be a plot device from the previous two movies, or maybe a plot hole. All I know is that this movie is very campy, bad and fun. This is something to watch with a popcorn tub, and a few friends and give it a MST3K treatment.
