James Marsh's The King is a movie that mystifies me. I can't think what it is about. It's a story about a young man named Elvis playing Gael Garcia Bernal, who after a fourteen-year service of the Navy gets an honorable discharge and then goes to find his biological Father and treats him and his family dishonestly. It's really sick. Elvis worms the way to the family by seducing his 16-year-old sister Malerie (Pell James). It's quite impossible to identify with anyone in this movie here in Central England. Ecclesiastes of the Father and humble joyful Christian congregation; I couldn't find out if the film was meant to scoff at them for their mindless beliefs. Or the goal is a happy family and we think it is viable. Or it is just to say that some people are lost and just hell for destruction. It's shallow. We all know that bad things are happening; It is interesting to learn why this film unreasonably depicts violence without the thought that led to it. "King" is such a lost opportunity. There are some really interesting questions about honor; fighter code; the changing concept of valor; honor killing in Indian families and so on. Honor is a very varied concept. But this film adds nothing to the concept. However, Paul Projectionist has done more than his weak role suggests. The DVD projector showed all the films in shades of green and the only way to fix it was to get them to Belgium. He did it over Christmas. I think those postmen and repairers and Paul went far beyond calling the duty and our reward was that pathetic movie. But can you see it differently?
