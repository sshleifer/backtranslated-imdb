Does anyone care about some characters in this movie? - Or what happens to them? - I doubt it. This is a key issue - for tragedy to work we have to care for at least one of the characters and none of them inspires any sympathy or seems to have some redeemable qualities at all. What may have worked in the 16th century, certainly does not work in one can only assume that "post apocalyptic Liverpool" if it was really what it was supposed to be. The problem is in the post apocalyptic Liverpool, while still driving cars, using cell phones, and watching television, returning to speaking in the Shakespeare language - with the Liverpudlian dialect. Oh dear! Bad enough you can think of - but it often disappeared into a clean scouse - with comments like 'eh lah are you cockney? And was it Merseyrail's announcement during one of the underground scenes? The good news is that in the Post apocalyptic Liverpool - trains are still running. Characters without exception are poorly drawn, wooden and more like charicatures on Joker / Penguin tracks in Batman and Robin except that there is no real story to talk about - or if it exists - it's the one that does not work in a modern setting where half of the sets are grim and 'Blade runnerish' and the other half is fluorescent crystal or normally 21st century. Costumes are also mixed with half wearing everyday clothes (Parkers are great in post apocalyptic Liverpool - apparently) and the other half wearing costumes from the remains of a masquerade party? The film explores the ideas of lust, incest and revenge by the most striking fashion imaginable - the tragedy is that this film was made at all. <br /> <br />
