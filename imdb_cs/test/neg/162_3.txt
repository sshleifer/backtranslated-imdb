I just looked at The Edge of Love (by the way, this is one of the worst titles this year) and felt like a chore. As I watched the crab figure hiding in the skeleton, the character scattered even more over the rough film. It took me four nights to watch it so boring. The only good thing about it was Cillian Murphy. He is always good / believable and in many films under strong eyes. But that wasn't good enough for him. Apart from unlikable characters, a boring story, the storyline was also emotionally unsatisfactory. I felt I spent my time watching nothing for nothing (which I did). I should have done it cleverly and shut it down, but I left it at the expense of Cillian Murphy and great cinematography.
