Dooley and his dog partner, Jerry Lee are back together in this second sequel (? !!?) Honestly, I had no idea that they did one sequel let alone two. And for a movie that was only slightly better than "Turner & Hooch"? This time, after Dooley retires, he has to sit with his dog (with other dogs, people) and wait for Jerry Lee at the poo. Real elegant things. Come on now. The original had at least some good laughs. This one has one. Jim Belushi just looks old and worn. Both Belushi brothers were great in the 1980s. If John hadn't died, would he be as bad as his brother today? This thought makes me sad for some reason. <br /> <br /> My Class: D- <br /> <br /> Where I Saw: The US Network
