I think that after Leonard Nimoy succeeded in directing "Finding Spock" and "Voyage Home", William Shatner thought he could drive as well. Although a competent actor, he shows that he is not just a good director. In fact, this film is hard evidence that supports Trekkies' arguments that William Shatner is an arrogant egomaniac. For though his character, Captain James Kirk, was always probably the most important role in the original "Star Trek," it looks in this movie that he is the heart of the film, two other most important characters, Captain Spock and Doctor Leonard. McCoy, they're just there to support him, and the other characters are there just to add comic relief. from this traumatic event soon in life that has changed it forever. Grateful, joining him in his quest for the whole world to get rid of pain and thus peace. Sybok and his followers control the building that hosts a peace conference between a human, Klingon, and Romulan diplomat. That attracts the ever-built Enterprise, because none of the other Starfleet ships have "experienced commanders" (frankly, as Starfleet is being led, the Klingons and Romulans should conquer them years ago). Sybok adds to the Enterprise crew, except for Spock (who is revealed as a secret brother to Sybok), McCoy and Kirk. Sybok orders the Enterprise to run into the "center of the universe" to meet the "God" who obviously has every race. But it turns out to be just a small entity asking for the use of Enterprise, and Kirk asks, "What does God need with a starship." The subject is destroyed, but not before Sybok, realized he had been lying for years, sacrificing his life and earning Spock's respect in death after photon torpedoes destroy the entity and inexplicably Sybok. OK, science fiction films are not known for realism, but at some point, rationality must be enforced. Why do people follow Sybok just because they release their pain? Why are all humanoids defined by one traumatic event? I certainly led a life without trauma. Why does Kirk not test his crew for rebellion and betrayal after joining Sybok? What was the point of Syboka's sacrifice when torpedoes kill an entity anyway? So the storyline is weak. Another problem is that Sybok, even though Lawrence Luckinbill plays well, is poorly displayed. Just because he's an emotional Vulcan doesn't mean he should act exactly like a human religious fanatic. Shatner (co-author and director) could have at least developed a dialogue appropriate for the emotional Vulcan. I think he feels that any emotional action is like us. Gee, I think that means the Klingons should say "not" and "no" more often than "not" and "no." And the Cardassians should not prolong their punishment because they like to talk (yeah, I know it's sad that I know). Please ... every ST plant uses a unique dialogue. Why is Sybok's exception an exception. <br /> <br /> The only thing you can't complain about is playing. I always knew Star Star has great actors and this movie is no exception. Cudos also goes to Leonard Nimoy because it must have been difficult to play the disgruntled Spock in his old age. Some other things I didn't like: Shatner and the late DeForrest Kelly twice show what bad singers they are by singing "Row, Row, Your Boat Line" in this movie. Shatner wished to silence his criticism of his singing skills. What he did was to prove. Uhura makes a fan dance while wearing nothing but a tree bark to draw a man into a trap. After all, the dreams of all our men are filled with pictures of middle-aged chubby women dancing naked. The comedy is all right if it doesn't affect the nature of "Star Trek" too much, but when Scotty hits an object on the Enterprise and KO itself, it's a little overboard. Kirk is the only crew member who can refuse Sybok's offer to free his inner pain and go through the fraud of God. Can Spock do it? Perhaps these scenes were valantines from Shatner to his character as many suspects. The concept of entity featuring how God was used in "Star Trek" before this film more than once. Be creative, Shatner. Speaking of non-creativity, I didn't care about star Trek: The Next Generation. All in all, pretty bad "Trek" movie. If you're Trekkie, watch it once because it's "Star Trek". Otherwise, watch "Star Trek II: Khan's Wrath." It's better.
