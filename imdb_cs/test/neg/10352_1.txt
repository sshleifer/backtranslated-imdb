The best thing I can say about the American version is that Jane Turner and Gina Reilly have to dig money for this crap. Yes, the American rip-off has been shown in two episodes in Australia, but has not been evaluated; Probably curious viewers who wondered how bad it would be. Answer: INVALID, complete waste of time. Actors are quite unknown and do not readily accept the nuances of the Australian-written script. Bad luck for them because they are doomed to fall with this turkey. My advice to viewers from the US is not. Americans should be best informed about finding a DVD with an original version on eBay, but be aware that some DVDs are in a different "zone" format than those released in the US. Otherwise, some DVD players will control discs from both / all zones.
