I'm so sorry! Where Lubitsch-pic was charming, amazing, full of spirit and elegance, it's just colored! Lana looks like 51 (in fact she was 31 years old but apparently depressed) and tries to play a shy and boring girl. Think about Jeanette McDonald, who gave the double widow the role of "playing" with Count Danil. That Lana had to play an operetta, though she couldn't sing - a fool! She just sings one song - the title role of Lehar-operetta, that's really funny! The only really good thing is the big rolling scene at the end: charming! And after watching this scene, check out the introductory rolling scene in "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes"! Any similarities?
