Los Angeles physician Tom Reed (Vincent Ventresca) survives a tragic car accident, but ends up in prison in the high desert of California. When his time expires, he lands in a small windmill town called Purgatory Flats. His first stop is a bar where he bangs his beer quickly and gets like a bartender. So much for ex-cons with a hard time finding a job. This is the first in a long line of absurdities that make up the plot writer / director Harris Done's stupid attempt at a modern, desert set, film noir. His first night at work Tom meets sexy femme fatal named Sunny (Alexandra Holden), who hangs with a family of bad boys: Mecklins, consisting of Uncle Dean (Gregg Henry) and his two nephews, drug addicted Owen (Kevin Alejandro), who is Sunny's husband, and AWOL Soldier Randy ("90210" is Brian Austin Greer). Shooting ends after his shift and Dr. Tom happens to be nearby. He agrees to deal with one of the wounded, and most importantly, doesn't tell the cops. I'm not sure this is a good move for a guy fresh from the pen, but this script (co-written by Diane Fine) has very little to do with logic. Tom makes the Bad Decisions series, which gets him on and entangled in the criminally inclined Mecklin Boys, including the theft of medical supplies and jumping into a Sunny bag. Everyone in the theater yells, "Don't do it! Go away, but Tom does the same. In the classic noir movie like "Body Heat" or "Double Indemnity" and empathy with William Hurt and Fred McMurray getting into a network of bright, sexy, sinister femme fatals like Kathleen Turner and Barbara Stanwyck. It's not their fault. We would probably be tempted by all the money or that particular lady. Dr. Tom's weakness seems to stem from stupidity more than circumstances. Sunny is a sexy but not very convincing character, and no money is trying to make it. You stay wondering if he attended the same medical school as Dr. Nick Riveria of "The Simpsons". The stupid scenario would have believed that a Redneck country house has almost everything you need to treat Stomach Shooting, and the one that is so injured could easily throw attention and participate effectively in the fist fight. It gives us an incredible chase for a car with one of the "The Club" stuff. Oh, the oil tanker that just exploded - no one noticed. I wonder how such an absurd scenario got green? Maybe Brian Austin Greer has more juice than I gave him. Obviously, he took the relatively small role of Randy - the murderous killer - to show producers that he has more game ranges than shown on "90210". It's kind of sad to see Nicholas Turturro playing a stereotypical Hispanic drug dealer. He deserves better than this. <br /> <br /> If you have an IQ of over 50, "cleansing apartments" will shake your head in disbelief. I'll give her 3 stars for unintentional laughter and scenes with sexy Miss Holden, who runs around in red panties.
