This film was extremely disappointed, I thought it would be another marijuana comedy, but don't be misleading, it's not at all. There are hardly any weed-related jokes that come to mind, I don't even think they smoke any weeds in this movie. Marijuana field is just a plot device. My impression after watching this movie was that four friends were bored in the summer and decided to write a full screenplay (their thoughts) of funny dialogue and make a movie. The product is a flawless dialogue supported by average acting, to say that this film has no hook, it's a huge understatement. Don't waste your time or money.
