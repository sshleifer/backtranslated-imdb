How bad is this movie? Well, I have it less than two months ago and I hardly remember what it was about ... <br /> <br /> I also paid 1 pound for DVD, the old story of put-a-new on-the-box-and-some-fool-will-buy-it syndrome. Everything I really remember that the cast was running a lot, the use of cars had to be over budget and the vampire was involved. Then again, guess that you might know that from the title of the movie. <br /> <br /> Directly to video garbage or directly to cheap jack-DVDs as it is now. This thing will be in rents shops in stores, supermarkets and charity shops until the sun goes down. Countries will only control cockroaches, but this waste will still be around. God bless the dawn of the DVD age.
