For some unknown reason, 7 years ago I watched this movie with my mother and sister. I don't think I used to laugh with them before. This movie was bad. As I went on, he's behind me. It was a while since I last saw this "movie", but the impression that stuck with me over the years was: "They had to find a scenario in a garbage can in the back of a cheap film studio. I'm not sure they spent all of the camera work and the so-called "special effects", and then had 13 cents left toward scenario A to pay "actors".
