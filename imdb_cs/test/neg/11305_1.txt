I know it's pretty unfair to comment on a movie without seeing the whole piece - but I'm going anyway! I waited for laughter, I tried to give time. I think 20 minutes is long enough to wait for a laugh comedy. My laugh never came, so I gave up. It's stupid humor, not so stupid you have to laugh. It's not anywhere near this high grade. Fix it, it's just stupid - not stupid humor. They may want some scenes to be funny but not. I believe that if you were really bored, you could somehow blend the film with hallucination and end up with a slightly fun experience. Very poor effort.
