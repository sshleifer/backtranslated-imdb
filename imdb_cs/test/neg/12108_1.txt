If you want to have a truly traumatic experience, then it's a terrible movie for you (if you can consider it). The film is worse than the postman, sizzle Beach USA, Batman and Robin, Kazaam, a fair game ... but you get my opinion. was made. I hope that Troma or someone in America will spread it so they can experience the French smell.
