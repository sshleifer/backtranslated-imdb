Sir, this was sucked. There is a special kind of sexual revolution of the 1960s that can confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation. This film is an example. I lost track of how many times women are filmed, struck, whipped or plundered in a movie. And then there are times when women in the film fantasize about being struck, struck, whipped or exploded (you know they want it, don't they?). Sometimes he is part of safe fetish play. At other times it is not, but you will wait in vain to see the news of the heroes that the authorities have just been raped. Instead, we heard her rapist talk about her inability to let go. Each scene of this movie plunges on misogyny (talking like a straight, white, married man in his 30s, not a teenage lesbian woman studying the main with a chip on his shoulder to make you a bad idea). Perhaps one good thing about this movie is that it provides a sharp reminder of how bad things have really been for women for just a few decades.
