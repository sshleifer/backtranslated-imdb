I want to believe that all the new horror movies coming from Japan these days are nervous and bring pleasant viewing. Spider Forest is not. I rarely finish watching Something and ended up losing time, but spider forest was an exception in this respect. I was very determined. The filmmakers succeeded on one level; I couldn't stop in the whole movie because I wanted to see the answer to the mystery that was happening. I couldn't stop watching. That's why I was so upset when the movie ended ... dragged me over 2 hours tedia for this POC? WARNING: Spider Forest is another of those Japanese "ghost stories", even if you don't realize that going inside. I never want to see the Japanese ghost story again. They are false and invented. "It's a ghost story" has become like a big rug under which you can sweep all and all the unsolvable holes you have in your story.
