I've been waiting for a long time to see this movie. IFC's finally one night. I thought it would be something like "Barfly" by Barbet Schroeder. Poorly. This film does not represent the chintz underworld, the dirty, smoke-filled, characters filled with bars you associate with its stories. It also fails to capture that Bukowski stance that Mickey Rourke did so well in the above-mentioned film. The natural smart guy. Charles Bukowski's fans will be able to see the scenes from their books on the screen, but those who are unfamiliar with his books might have a bad impression of his works. This film looks like the next movie "The Week of The Week" about drunk and his relationships if you want to get a better idea of ​​Charles Bukowski's "Barfly" watch.
