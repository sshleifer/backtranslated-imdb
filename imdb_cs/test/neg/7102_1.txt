Why Lori was cast as a tank girl, I never know. Her performance is a lack of shine. Her voice is agile. It's almost impossible to put into words how bad this movie is. There are a few "modern" links in the film that I thought was very strange given that the film was to be in the future. Nor would it be difficult to make this assumption interesting. Any better writing would help costs. Naomi Watts appears in him as a slightly trained techno-geek. I think they should probably switch roles. I'll never know why anyone would want this movie if it wasn't a Petty fan. <br /> <br /> Try not to see this movie. Full waste of time.
