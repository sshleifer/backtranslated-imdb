The BBC and the Arts & Entertainment Network should be ashamed of influencing this unfortunate production in the world. Acting is, with the exception of Robert Hardy as General Tilney, at best amateur and, at worst, extremely painful. Costumes are over-the-top and have some really ghoulish excesses - was he a costume designer obsessed with feathers for women's hats? Certainly every woman in Bath had no feathers in her head at the beginning of the 19th century. Production values ​​are poor and film stimulation causes them to adjust quickly and clumsily at the last minute. A totally torturous movie that I had to force to watch to the end. It's a shame, because manufacturers probably spent a lot of money on costumes and filming. Compared to the sublime Emma Thompson's "Sense and Sensibility" or the extraordinary production of "Pride and Prejudice" from 1995 or the subtle intensity of "Persuasion" in 1995, this production of "Northanger Abbey" will certainly spark Jane Austen in the grave.
