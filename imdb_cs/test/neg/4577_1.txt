I was unlucky to have caught it recently. I had a bigger disaster that I played RETURN on my flight. Obviously, Demi's attempt to get some "bohemian" credit is a wreck because of her miserable acting ability. A better actress could do this job, but a simple look at Moore's face shows the void inside. At least she doesn't break American literature this time.
