If you don't like bad gameplay, bad editing, ridiculous dialogues and incredible characters, you hate this movie. If you like all of the above, that means if you are a Lynch fan then you will love Mulholland Drive. This is probably the worst movie to be rated at 7.0 on IMDB. Outside the work of Naomi Watts, you'll find it hard to find any competent acting in Mulholland Dr. "Hide your face with your hands when you don't have an acting school." Given the scenario they had to work with, it is a miracle that all the actors did not hold their heads in their hands. You have a hitman, a mysterious cowboy, an adulterous wife, and her clich√© lover, a mafia character sitting in a dark room that speaks through an external voicemail and lots of other people who are too numerous and boring. All you have to do is say that they can do more than fill the screen. It's not so bad that it reflects the viewer from the fact that the movie has no recognizable chart. You will wait and wait for all the loose threads to come together and finally you will be helplessly disappointed. The hardest thing for a writer to do is to put everything together in a credible fashion at the end of the movie in a way that leaves all a sense of fulfillment. The easiest thing for a writer to do is to create a lot of odd characters and put them into scenes that aren't linked to the film as a whole, and then make a few few coherent threads out there and jumble them to the end for surprise. Guess how Lynch goes. SURPRISE !! You know you have a bad scenario when you have to resort to dream sequences to make sense of it. After all, the sequence of dreams covers all sins. Dreams may not make sense. Anything can happen in a dream. <br /> <br /> Editing is similarly disjointed. Let's say that good editing doesn't attract attention. Much of the way this film is edited appears to be done only to alert you to editing. "Look at me ... Can you see my cuts ... I'm not a genius?" Well, well ... NO! This film has all the intentions of the worst and most interesting French films. So why is this movie so popular? My theory is that it is just another sign of the collapse of our culture. Melodies are difficult to compose, so let's listen to rap. Land is hard to follow, so get rid of them. Painting is difficult to paint, so let's pee in the cup and glue the crucifix in it. These are the signs of our time and Mulholland Drive is just another part of suffering.
