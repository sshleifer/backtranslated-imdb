I wouldn't recommend it at all. It was like getting stuck in the middle row of the theater so I couldn't leave and watch a part of the porn movie (except that they didn't wear clothes - that was body language and certainly language). I must say I was embarrassed. Shooting was very low, no good dialogue. Ugh. The actors stunli except the two best characters who were killed (?) And were David Carradine and Dennis Hopper. He did kill Bill and that old movie with two boys riding dessert on their crushers. You know what I mean. blah blah blah. Filming was grainy and only of very low quality. No one in the theater liked this movie and the people around me were younger and tattoos.
