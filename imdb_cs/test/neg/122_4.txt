I had great hopes for this until they changed their name to "The Shepherd: Border Patrol, the smallest movie name ever, which was just wrong with" The Shepherd. "This is by the action number that flick that hat on many classic Van movies. There is a nice piece of action in a bar that reminds me of a tough target and a universal soldier, but directed without intensity or taste that is a pity. There is one big line that "p * ss drunk and carrying a rabbit" and some A lot of time dialogue does not match the characters of the mouth and stunt men fall dead for a split second before even being shot, the end of the fight is one of Van Damme's better fights, with the exception of the director trying to go a little too on John Woo and also fails to introduce flashbacks that nobody really cares about getting in the way of an event that is the whole point of the van damme movie. <br /> <br /> Not good , not bad, just the average general behavior.
