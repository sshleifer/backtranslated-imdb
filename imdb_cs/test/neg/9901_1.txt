What a mess - and I don't mean "destruction" in the title. I could go on a broken conspiracy, lousy effects, (actually remarkable) casting grimaces because they bring the worst lines of their career, etc. I will say that in Chicago the last time palms were when I last checked and let it go. Hmmm ... need ten lines to get it posted on IMDb .. OK, well, I think the DVD release with outtakes might be interesting. Perhaps Dennehy would tell him what favor he had in this matter. Maybe Dianne Weist will show us the money bag she had to take to get her involved. Maybe CBS execs apologize ...
