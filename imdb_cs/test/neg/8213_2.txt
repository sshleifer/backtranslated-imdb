Buyer Beware. The Alpha Video release uses a print that resists the description. The film was taken in color, but you don't know it will be the first 25 minutes. The print that is used is so faded and dilapidated that it seems almost sepia toned. After 30 minutes, some color leaks back into the press, but from there the color comes and goes. Keep in mind that even at best, the color is pale and washed out. Looks like the print was loaded from a TV that didn't get the best reception. Adding to this travesty is the most elaborate delivery of lines that I can remember. Even the voice over the narration is steeper. Each line is delivered in this irritating behavior. I found myself wishing they would hurry and get the words out. For this reason, I could not wait for this film to end. It's one of those bad movies, but I'd like someone to find half a decent print.
