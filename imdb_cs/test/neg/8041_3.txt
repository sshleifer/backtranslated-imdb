I would think it was one of those films whose director didn't read the book, what it was about, not because it's just a little similar. It is certainly possible that a great movie will be "based" very loosely on the book and it was certainly the second, but not the former. There were several shortcomings. One of them was that she tried to be too similar to railway children, probably because the adults would expect it from the same author. Next is that she also tried to be too similar to Harry Potter, to music, and to over-emphasize the settings. I have nothing against J K Rowling or movies, but the book is just like Harry Potter. I thought Psammead, though very well expressed by Eddie Izzard and character, was almost unreasonably in a totally unsuitable environment. Maybe I missed something here, because comments about one of my own character books can be a reference to the inaccuracy of adaptation. There was no need for additional characters, and today's special effects could easily be used to tell the story as it was written, but it wasn't. This movie I saw with my two children one of them knows the book and the other doesn't. The one who knows it was okay, but he wasn't as excited as the one who didn't do it. I'm not sure what that means.
