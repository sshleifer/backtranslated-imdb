I laughed twice when I watched this movie and if you were wondering, I wasn't a bad day, nor was I exposed to anything else that would distort me when watching this movie. This movie is bad. I wanted to enjoy it and I just couldn't. With this talent you think it would be at least observable, right? Incorrectly. <br /> <br /> Let's play Sucked and not Suck! John Travolta - Very sympathetic. Even though I'm obviously buried under too much makeup, I found it nice to watch. Don't suck. Uma Thurman - After Kill Bill 1 and 2, the girl deserves more than this cruelly written character. The big moment of this character showed someone how to control the T-Mobile Sidekick. Vince Vaughn- The task a white boy thinks is black goes to Vince "Money" Vaughn. Is this character template still considered funny? I love this guy, but I want to see him in something better than this. It felt like he was swinging. Sucked. Cedric the Entertainer- The guy is good. It adds a great monologue after what is called a racial slur (you might imagine what it is) that was probably the best part of the movie. He was funny and really raised the material that was given to him only with his presence. He didn't feel. Harvey Keitel- Sucked for performance calls. James Woods-Sucked, but not his fault. Actually yes. He reminded me of his role in the casino for some reason. I don't like the manic James Woods, I like the slow burning of James Woods. Maybe a victim of bad writing? Andre 3000- Sucked but went down. I think he has the potential if his hack does not record his next photo. Christina Milian - She is absolutely beautiful and probably talented, but this movie won't make her a star. He wasn't sucking, but he needed a better vehicle for her talent that wasn't driven by a hack. Rock-It should be the role that catapulted him to the movie star, but according to the instructions of F. Gary Gray, he sadly shakes. In this movie, Rock is designing this charisma that makes him so sympathetic that I gave it up. He is trying really hard, and if he fails, he gets A + for my efforts. This guy is not afraid to be ashamed and to go completely against the type, playing a gay-eyed star. I really want to see how big it is. He has what lasts until hacked. <br /> <br /> Which brings me to what I consider a weak link in this production. I could just go out and say that, right? F. Gary Gray's direction was as solid as the really bad diarrhea. Wow, that was bad. Who had a clear idea of ​​letting this guy go? The negotiator was good, but what else did he convince people of his biography that he was a man for the job? Between his leadership and the scary writing, I am willing to throw both offenders on a nice lead salad on my knees. Want to see John and Uma dance? Maybe I could think of another movie with the two that I would recommend watching instead. It's not worth ten dollars and it cost me fifty cents to get to the theater. <br /> <br /> This movie could be fine and it wasn't even "okay". RATING: * out of *****. PS Also worth mentioning is Fergie of Black Eyed Peas. Hissing!
