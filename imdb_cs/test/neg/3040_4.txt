The Simon West Remake of 1979 Horror Classics is a pathetic attempt to bring old school excitement to the current audience. Camilla Belle, a talented teen, plays when the Stanger can't even make a shocked or even surprised face. Poor attempts to scare the audience range from blurry coats that look like people to build tense music for a cat running in the shade. The story follows Jill Johnson (Belle), a teenage girl who has to pay off her father's account through babysitting. She is invited to work for a night in a river house, and she thinks it is an easy way to make money. Little does he know, however, that a stranger lurks in the house, constantly chasing Johnson over the phone. Pathetic excuse for film.
