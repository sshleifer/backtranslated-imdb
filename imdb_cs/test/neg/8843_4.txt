Although it is promising, a woman in a car stretches around the dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost encounters a man holding a lizard! It gave me the impression that we would see something special, something almost David Lynchian (if it is such a term), but unfortunately, the film begins to go everywhere without the core, just a meandering story about a woman trying to solve the mystery of a small town. The study of character goes everywhere, and I couldn't really worry about any of the characters it seems, especially when some of the story suddenly goes into flashback mode. I had some hope for this movie, but in all, it was a little late.
