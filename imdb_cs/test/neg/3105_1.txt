I'm actually too exhausted to write this review - bad movies always do it to me - but I feel obliged as if it were my civil duty to warn anyone who might be considering buying or viewing this terrible mess. -picture. Please, please take my word: this is the one you want to keep away from. It's so boring and boring, so vague and uninspired, such a bad excuse to gather every known talent. Burt Reynolds? Wasted (despite his best efforts). Ice-T is hardly in the film, and when he appears on screen his performance is so restrained and dimmed that it becomes crystal clear that the director, perhaps intimidated by the icy intense gaze, didn't know what to do with it. Rob Lowe, as the title character, has never shown so little charisma on screen. Mario Van Peebles should be ashamed of himself; his performance is a joke in the saddest sense. Certainly Satan signed Mario's check for this movie. The storyline is as weak, half-baked and annoying as any music (a totally boring club song seems to continue, literally, for the first third of the film). The film's appearance invites man to seriously consider whether the director of the photo was also forced, as well as one of the forgotten female figures, to smoke cracks from a pipe that is connected to his mouth. And if you look at the "shoot-up" style violence at least, you won't get here. This movie, I assure you, I promise you that it has absolutely no redeeming features! Please, please, avoid this movie! Don't put it and let it get to believe that its pace will rise, it will be better and it will develop into a decent denouement. It will not be. No. It can't! It's shit! Now you have been warned, and now I can go to bed (It is 3 am - please forgive all the resulting mistakes that this admonition might contain) - know that my conscience is clear because I have done my civil duty to my neighbor!
