As much as I really like Catherine Zeta-Jones, I wondered again why to make a good movie? This version lacked the tension and passion of Mostly Martha. It was a clear rip off. Maxime Foerste was more convincing than a painful child who was healed by love. I couldn't believe Abigail Breslin. Martina Gedeck owned this role. Unfortunately, Zeta-Jones was supposed to find another she could own (she has other roles she owns). Sergio Castellitto was good as a vulnerable but joyful Italian. Aaron Eckhart seemed passionate in comparison. This version was nice but unprecedented. The love between Mario and Martha may have been predictable but satisfactory. The therapist added an interesting piece of color that didn't seem to be important. I liked it when at the end he said he was coming back, but the movie ended before he came back. I have mostly Martha at home. I came back every now and then.
