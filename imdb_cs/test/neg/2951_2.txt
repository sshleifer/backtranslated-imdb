We were waiting in line to see a great girl, an excellent movie in which Jennifer Aniston plays when a lady came up with this cheap fake $ 20 dollar MANNA FROM HEAVEN. "Come and see this movie!" she said. "You'll love it!" Then she introduced us to the film's director. It should have been our first guide. At how many film situations do you have a director of a movie standing in the lobby asking people to see it? "Is it a Christian movie?" I asked, I don't really care about one or the other way. I love Jesus. No shame in it. "No!" she said defensively. What a bullshit. This movie is BAD. So bad. And it's not just because of the obvious Christian agenda, but because of the terrible dialogue that alternates between the wooden and the exaggerated and obvious lack of an editor. The movie is too long. If it were an hour and a half, then maybe (maybe maybe) I wouldn't have to go to a suicide prevention center after a movie tour. Actually, I'm lying. We'll see, after an hour of this waste, we slipped into SWIMFAN. At least with SWIMFAN we know it's a waste before we look at the movie. We know we should support ourselves. And SWIMFAN has hot, half-naked people. The only thing that is half naked in this movie is the despair of the stars involved, whose apparent lack of scenarios is nothing but hidden. And the actress who sail the nuns? It's called personality. Get it. <br /> <br /> People blatantly pleading for a ticket in the lobby told me that if I liked MY BIG FAT GREEK WEDDING, then I would like to * * (their emphasis, not mine) MANNA FROM HEAVEN . Right. More like, "If you like GLITTER, you'll love MANNA from HEAVEN." And Mariah could actually overcome all the clowns from this movie. If it's not an insult, then I don't know what it is. <br /> <br /> I've got enough railing. Look at indie movies, but you don't see the bad ones. This is definitely one of the bad ones. MANNA FROM HEAVEN needs some divine intervention.
