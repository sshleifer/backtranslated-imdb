***** Spoiler or two, not a thing ****** <br /> <br /> Two things stand out about this movie. First it is a title called "Bruno" and "The Dress Code", and if you saw this movie, you catch the irony in it. Second, it is solving problems completely off the wall. The adventures of classroom laundry are not something of a crying film, nor a topic I think most people would care about. to wear a religion dress that probably opens up a more thorough can of worms - what did she think? Yes, there is some humor and it is not offensive, but the type of disturbing feeling is growing. It does not do much, except for the repetition of a liberal mantra, that "different" people should be accepted (or perhaps excluded) no matter what. <br /> <br /> What is OK - but to be able to live in society, everyone has to give a little bit to meet them. Bruno doesn't just want to dress up, he wants to show himself as a miniature Gladys Knight at the award night and his last costume reminds him of Cabbage Patch Cowgirl Doll. But all the other children dress and behave well, just like ordinary children. So what does it give? If that happened, we could all claim to be strange or different and behave as we would feel, resulting in total chaos. This reception of people who are "others" is also very narrowly defined, I doubt that we will ever see a movie about a boy who finds his true self and wants to wear overalls, goose hunting and go to tractor pull and demand that everyone else accept it as it is. "Bruno" is one stupid movie and a complete waste of time.
