This movie contains some well-known actors that I usually like, so I had at least a modest expectation when I rented it on DVD. I was very disappointed. In fact, in the last half-hour I went to some refreshment and somehow I ended up in the kitchen rather than going back to TV. Acting performances where the poor almost all overboard and none of the atmosphere in the film felt very convincing. Virtually all the scenes had that "just a movie" feeling to them, I just sat there waiting to hear the director calling "CUT!" followed by a crew talking about the scene before moving on to the next. Since the film is about gangsters, most characters are hard and crowd. -Boy attitude is playing so badly that it just feels like a joke. The constant guitar soundtrack also tries to emphasize this atmosphere, but when the same song is played for the 18th time, it just adds to the already strong feeling that the whole thing is just a fake. <br /> <br /> was just a really bad scenario, maybe it was just badly done. I am no film critic, in fact, I find it rare to see something that is really good, but it was just bad, no matter how I try to be objective and forgiving. NOT RECOMMENDED OR AS HIRED!
