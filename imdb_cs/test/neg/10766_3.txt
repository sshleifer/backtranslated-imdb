As someone who has read all the books of Baroness Orczy and saw most of the movies based on them, I must say that the 1980 version, with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymour, was better than this. It was better written and stuck to the spirit of the story than this one that seemed to go out of the way to engage people who were shot. This new adaptation is less cheerful, but it does not have so much depth. Although there is some good action, the actors didn't have much to do with him. Nice costumes.
