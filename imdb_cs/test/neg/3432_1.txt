I have to say that Krasinski is the only reason I watched this movie. It's good. However, everything else about this film is so far below average that it is not worth the time and effort spent watching this movie. This film has a lot of technical / aesthetic questions: namely, selection of shots, framing, camera movements within monologue sequences, extremely poor editing (probably due to a complete lack of fluidity between shots) and overall horrible gameplay (except Krasinski) . It was too theatrical (in playing and presenting) to develop any exciting moment in this movie ... which is surprising because it's all about bank robbery that should be at least somewhat exciting. <br /> <br /> How come the movie is wrong, then released, and then distributed? Some reminds me of a C-film student job project, probably not even good though.
