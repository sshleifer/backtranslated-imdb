I wanted to see the American werewolf in Paris for a long time because I loved his predecessor, but this movie didn't do me as much as the American werewolf in London. Actually, to be honest, it didn't impress me at all. Tom Everett-Scott and his dude friends roam around Paris and save a wolf in a senseless bungee stunt from the Eifel Tower. Julie Delpy's kitten from death. Before you have time to work, if continual ambush and pampered dialogue are to be intended as comedies, the whole month hit, and brats are being haunted by terrible CGI werewolves across the Parisian canals. The script is disgustingly poor, the actors were made to make this movie, they are terrible performances corresponding to the state of the film. From start to finish, this movie is never fun, engaging or even easy to follow. I had trouble watching the whole movie without winning my dinner to be honest. Action scenes aren't exciting, jokes aren't funny, and werewolves aren't scary. In short: Miss or fear forever. American Werewolf in Paris rated 2 out of 10.
