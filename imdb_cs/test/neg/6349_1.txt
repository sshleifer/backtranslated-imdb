I was bored last night and decided to watch a movie called "out kold" that I once bought with a range of other cheap videostore movies. It looked like a good old action movie, so I took out the chips and coke and was ready for a relaxing evening. Well, the pain started right from the start. The main character is a boxer who is the most beautiful guy I've ever seen. Of course, as a good person, he must be nice, but he's just a pussy! It doesn't fit with a boxer who has 28 KOs and starts working on a pimp to make some extra money. Even nice guys can still be fine. Well, then came his first fight while he worked for the pimp. Every strike was apparently missed and it became even more annoying because the sound effect was not synchronized with the firing pin. Then there's a totally worthless play of the entire cast, and you have enough reasons to leave this movie for what it is. I gave him 1 because I never saw such a bad movie.
