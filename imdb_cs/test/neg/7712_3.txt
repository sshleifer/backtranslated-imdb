It's not strange how crap-movies always tend to be a little better when you start watching them with an attitude like: "boy, will it suck harder than a few things that have never sucked before"? Is it almost impossible for anyone to rent this movie with high? or even remotely positive - expectations, as "House of the Dead 2" is a sequel to something that is generally considered one of the absolute worst genre disasters ever to be released. The gigantic reputation of the original has proven to be a great advantage for director Michael Hurst, because it was really easy to overcome the quality of his predecessor. That's exactly what Uwe Boll must be embarrassing about, huh? Do I have to admit that video streaming without stellar or promotional campaigns is much better than its own video game interpretation? If someone still doubts: NO, "House of the Dead 2: Dead Aim" is not a good horror movie at all, but YES: it's definitely better than the first and even worth renting in case you are looking for an undemanding splatter movie with lots of bloody butchers , sleaze and stupid humor. There is no real connection with the events in the first film (another advantage) and this second part opens up as a typical hot sex comedy in the university campus. The male fraternity club plans to attack the sorority house, inhabited exclusively by blond hospitals with huge breasts, but the party breaks when the mad professor (Sid Haig!), Who drives the car through the girl and takes her back to his lab, to turn. to zombies. This is the beginning of a rapidly spreading and deadly epidemic, but without fear, because the government is ready and sends its best scientists and soldiers to campus to seek survivors and bring blood samples to the antidote. Hunting this zombie seems to be the most common thing in the world for this squadron, even named it Hyper Sapiens, but their ever-increasing amount ultimately threatens the lives of the toughest soldiers. Fortunately, director Hurst found his inspiration in the more prominent classics of this genre, such as James Cameron's "Aliens" and? of course - George A. Romero is a dead trilogy, particularly "Day of the Dead". Luckily, he did not make the same mistakes as Uwe Boll, who put footage of a real video game (why?!?) Into his film and * slightly exaggerated using CGI techniques. HotD 2 contains heavy images of violence, such as Chopped Female Corps and detailed amputation, but it never really gets sick or vomiting. Of course, there is not even the slightest tension you can enjoy, as well as all the horrible clich√©s of horror. The film is very pleasant if Mark Altman does not try to explain the beginnings of zombie epidemics. They walk corpses with brains hanging from their skulls, so we don't really need to know what caused their deaths. Especially not when an explanation is given by a blonde girl whore who obviously has no idea what all medical terms mean. Avoid bites, sweetheart.
