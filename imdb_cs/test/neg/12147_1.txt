Its must certainly be one of the worst gay-themed movies of all time. Who told one of the so-called actors that they can act. Bad sound - bad script - gestures overboard that resist reality. Night club scene with only one actor and dubbed crowd scenes. After seeing other low budget films, I was ready for something innovative - but not free of pathetic. Parents and friends shouldn't encourage anyone to do such a trick. <br /> <br /> A DVD - No menu access; worse than VHS tape. Once you start, you have to watch the whole thing - fortunately the button works forward - nothing else with this movie and DVD.
