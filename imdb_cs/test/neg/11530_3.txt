Poorly shot, poorly groomed, clumsy dialogue, flat characters, failed novel adaptation. It really is not much worse. Decent behavior and good popcorn saved me this hour and a half - I felt like three hours of boredom. Occasional good single individuals. David is a young man who is dull who never recovered from losing his brother at an early age. He puts his faith in the Chinese philosophy of the mumbo jumbo video, although it does not help much in real life. David is a member of a debtor gang where each member of the IQ has sea level. The missing scenario, along with uncritical shooting and even worse editing, do what might be quite funny cases of debt recovery fail to look like an amateur home reality show. David leases an elementary school teacher, Haraldur, who, by dropping a few sentences about his own meaning, convinces David that he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland. Seriously missing the script does not offer anything to David to base his opinion on. Several scenes that showed Haraldur that he was doing something that David might have misinterpreted would do it. The media's potential as a medium, unlike the text of the book on which this film is based, is not exploited. Initially, David's association with Haraldur increases his position in the debtor-collector gang, but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies. <br /> <br /> The storyline is fine, but then it's based on a book. This could be a much better film. A good screenwriter could do something about this material. Unfortunately it is not so. Negotiations are generally good. Pétur Jóhann is excellent and trustworthy as David. Eggert leorleifsson doesn't have much to do, but he does the best he has little material. Ingvar Sigurðsson and Michael Imperioli (in a small role) will do fine. Overall Opinion: What could have been a fun and entertaining movie about how a deaf anti-hero appeared in a conspiracy debtor gang becomes a boring, badly made film made after a bad handwriting. He stared at his fingers for an hour and a half, which would be more pleasant.
