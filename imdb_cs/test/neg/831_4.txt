First of all, let me say that I wasted a Halloween movie night by watching this waste. Secondly, let me inform you that the current DVD offered by Shriek Show is not uncut. Third, one scene is the highlight of the film, and because it's shortened, well, you see where I'm going. I know many horror fans are digging this movie. It is atmospheric, shot into the forest with very nice scenery, waterfalls and the like. But after the initial killing, which has a very brutal shot of a machete that is stuck over the crotch of a hunter, no real brutal killing takes place. And with the slasher movie you want it. At least yes. Director a spol. they did nothing with the killer in the forest concept, some of this type of film was made at exactly the same time in the early 1980s. The only thing he's behind is that you hate actors just as you would in other movies. They are kind of nice. Children have a reason to be there: one of them owns a list of some real estate on the mountain. But what is not explained is why his family has property. There's no cabin or house, so why buy a property in East Jesus, especially if you're not a hunter or what? I'm sure some people are buying land for camping, but that seems unusual. Anyway, there are two whistling butts that begin to chase the caravans and pick them up gradually. And, as I said before, you get almost nothing that causes decent death after killing the machete at the beginning. The end has some kind of replayed play from Connie, but it's not enough to make it almost the same as the totally forgotten film The Forest, which is numb. If Shriek Show could get a real, uncut print, then this review could be a little forgiving, but it's the day and age of uncut / unrated DVD releases of old dark movies for movie dogs like me. When we are gentle, you get a rough review. Sadly, the presence of the great paternal George Kennedy is the only highlight of this film that distinguishes him from other garden varieties that have broken apart throughout the day.
