Did anyone find a story somewhere in the movie? Maybe it's a thing missing in this challenging movie theater. It is quite surprising that Gordon says "a film without a plot is nothing" ... It is possible that characters have something to say that they own Wim Wenders. Was this phrase in the original plot or the actor decided to send a hint to the director?
