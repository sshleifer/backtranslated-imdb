Even before this film, it is clear that Ali G has become the exact sign that went into parody. I'm not a fan of Sacha Baron Cohen anyway, but he was curious to see how a man of such little talent was able to convince universal studios to fund almost 1 and a half hours of a feature film from 3 minutes of a joke. The paper plot is just a stream of penis and marijuana jokes, and I must admit that, as I have seen such respected thespians, both Charles Dance and Michael Gambon have pulled so low to head for employment, crouched. Saying that I have to admit (even when I am ashamed) that I have done more than one opportunity, and how bad it is, has never been boring, and I never thought about turning it off (mainly because of the beautiful Rhona Mitra ). You say you only watch this movie when you're a teenage boy from 14 to 17 years old and find that funny jokes are fun.
