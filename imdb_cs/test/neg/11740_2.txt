* SPOILERS INCLUDING * <br /> <br /> The brilliant and innovative adaptation of Robert Bloch's Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing film, unlike anything else. Every shot, every camera angle, every nuance was PERFECT. Not only did he break the rules, he created a whole series of new ones. Here's a spoiler: There's nothing new, different, or original on this movie. Gus Van Sant doesn't just pay tribute to Hitch, he'll tear every thought and do it in a less original, conventional way. I had nothing against Gus Van Sant before I saw this movie. I liked Drugstore Cowboy and I thought my own private Idaho was a very interesting movie. The question of burning in my mind when it comes to the psycho remake is: "Why did you do that, Gus?" There are only two reasons to make a remake in my mind: 1) The original was a good story, but the film was sucked. 2) The original was a good movie, but someone remembered a new, new approach to material. Neither of these factors is at all in Gus Van Sant's version of Psycho. Apart from being in color and there is one scene in which the editing of the disturbing images related to the possible inner dialogue of the character's name (which I thought was unnecessary), there is nothing new. Next, I found out that the casting left something that would be desirable. Anne Heche was fine as Marion, but she lacked the vulnerability that Janet Leigh portrayed in the original. I did not feel sympathetic to her nature, because the choices she faced seemed much less limited as a woman in today's society, unlike the decision she would face as a single woman living in the early 1960s. Vince Vaughn got a few laughs with his incredibly naive Norman Bates, but I feel that the timing and nervous, ghostly look of Anthony Perkins was much more effective. The only performance I enjoyed better than the original was the character of Lily Crane played by Jullianne Moore. She was excellent as usual and brought a new strength and intelligence to the character. To be fair, there is a beautiful camera, especially during the famous "bathroom scene" in which Van Sant takes advantage of. His use of color to show murder in vibrant shades of crimson. And yet, throughout the film, I had this irritating feeling of deju vu. I haven't seen it yet? Wait, I've seen it somewhere before! Almost every scene appears to be copied to the original. Almost the feeling that the director made this film as a school project. "You see, I can do a Hitchcock movie too!" <br /> <br /> If you haven't already done this, check out the original. Over the years it has risen and beats a bit of mediocrity, hands down. You won't be disappointed.
