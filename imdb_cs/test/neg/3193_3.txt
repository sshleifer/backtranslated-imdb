Intertwined points of view can be a good idea in some movies. Here's a total mess. But the total mess begins with the story: a video-clip of bummy wants to make a light comedy with a pernicious noir-like female character. She's gorgeous and no man could resist being immersed and crawling on his fingers. She is more of a materialist, it seems as if the butter is not melting in her mouth. <br /> <br /> The film dissolves in its own arrogance: it is smart / fun / good looking. Phalocretinism at its best. Just white waste, please.
