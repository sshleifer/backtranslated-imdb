A short marital infidelity returns to the terribly loving Grace Needham (pictured always by Nastassja Kinski). She left town and her depressed husband to embark on a trip to sunny Miami, where she was watched and eventually seduced by Julian Grant, a stupid evil and manipulative sales manager who is well portrayed by William Baldwin ( why all the Baldwin brothers play so bad people so damn well?) Seduction Grace happened as two drink champagne on a deserted beach where they got privately sailing. Grace admitted that she was drinking too much on her own and revealed many problems in marriage. Julian gained her confidence by claiming that she would never allow these types of problems to arise if she had a relationship with Grace. Julian's manipulation continued as he described the "lost at sea" imagination, which now includes the uncovered Grace, who was sitting nearby, listening to his every word, and increasingly engaged in his romantic dream. His manipulation paid as a few gentle jerks led to Grace's soft kisses, paused for a moment, as if suddenly thinking about what I was doing? I'm a woman. I'm a mother. I have a real life. Real responsibility. Of course, the two of us talked about being together, lost at sea, but that's just a fantasy. See what we're doing here. The consequences are real. We are really alone on a secluded beach. I'm going to make this fantasy really happen? She succumbed to her dream when her kisses became more passionate. The once guarded Grace, who had previously responded to the men's sayings by saying, "I'm married," was looking forward to seeing Julian unbutton his shirt, leading to more kisses, body caresses and her climbing on Julian's bike! She smiles, kisses, moans, laughs and often looks at the sun all the time, unfortunately, a short love scene in which everyone seemed to be wearing most of the clothes. While I enjoyed a glimpse of the illicit passion on Grace's face as a once-married wife was thoroughly satisfied with sex with a man who seems to like manipulating others, I will say that overall the scene was undeserved for film rating "R". Julian returned home to find his husband, who was rejuvenated by having a high-paid job, and is thrilled to return to normal life, where he can once again be a loving wife and a caring mother . Br /> <br /> But the bad Julian Grant returns to the picture and is not willing to give up so easily on Grace. Grace has a plan to get rid of Julian's life, but will it work? Apparently I don't want to destroy the remaining story for you. I will say, however, that I always like movies involving the sexual pretense of my wife (especially when she shows unlimited attraction and behavior that is usually reserved for her husband), but in fact she tries to revenge against the antagonist. This film would be much, much better if the film included more of the story. My feelings are if the movie brings it, then the movie should finish. And this movie certainly did. Unfortunately, some limitations in the storyline prevented it from being monitored. There are many other movies available that will succeed with the same point, and I will list their titles in the "recommendations" section of this section. I am also open to receiving other films' e-mail designs that include a good story involving sexual pretense by a seemingly devoted woman. Overall, Nastassja Kinski and William Baldwin are very good. The film is not.
