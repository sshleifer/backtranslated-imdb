This movie has perhaps the worst title for a short stooge. Slightly fit, given the current 15-minute content. <br /> <br /> I can do this without any of the "Shemp A.D." things, but I admit that I have a few LOL moments from the two men comedy Moe and Larry in some of the new shots (and the way for those guys trying to give it all, considering the position they were forced to enter ) in that even these dogs). Another clear point of this and the last AD debacle, "Commotion on the Ocean" is determined by the lack of screen time for Joe Palm and his head. No attempts to let him talk or wave his hands like a chicken (see "Hot Stuff") may be worth the extra point of evaluation. <br /> <br /> 2/10
