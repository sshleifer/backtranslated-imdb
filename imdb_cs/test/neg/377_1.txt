A really flatulent scenario and I was very disappointed with Marc Singer for agreeing with him. Actually, I came out of the theater for about 15-20 minutes and asked for my money. In fact, I just left the film 3 times in my life (I'm 43 years old) and that's the only thing that made me so angry that I demanded a ticket price. If I could, I'd also get a replacement for popcorn. That was a really bad movie and there's no excuse. First, how did someone who was raised as a pre-tech barbarian learn DRIVE AND CAR? In California !!! (Driving a car is a rather complex skill, and in California, even a cheater ... I should know I live there.)
