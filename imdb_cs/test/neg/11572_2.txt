Imagination must slip Jim Wynorski's mind when he wrote the script to this one. I don't mind if animal scenes are almost identical, but when the actors repeat the lines from other movies, it's too far. I saw Jay Richardson and Glori Ann Gilbert. Gloria brings nothing to the movie, but her breasts (my husband's feelings). Jerri Manthey should stay on the island for survival, her actions are tough, unbelievable and she just plain boor. she liked the scene where the cobra comes out of the ocean, the guy then destroys the dirty for added taste. At least we know that another conspiracy of a giant snake man kills a commodo before it becomes a dad in an egg nest. Jerri would be great as a cobra mother. sit with 6 pact or pair of joints. relieves pain.
