Altioklar: Master of Thieves. Watch a movie, steal some of it, write a script ... It must be very easy to be a director in Turkey. I think Altioklar followed "Identity (2003)", "Saw (2004)", several series that concern crimes, murders, and so on. <br /> <br /> You can guess the killer at the beginning of the movie. It only took 10 minutes. He shouted, "I'm a murderer, I'm a murderer." There is no secret. Tamer Karadagli is the same (sux). Exaggerated facial expressions, funny macho man. There's only one good thing in the movie. Demet Evgar's performance is very good. You can see the movie just for it.
