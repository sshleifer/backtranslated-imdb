This is an excellent example of a crazy b-movie. There are worse movies than this (Titanic for example), but it certainly shares a pile of smoking movies crap. OK it was probably shot in Kansas City, which explains why everyone is so lame. The main guy looks like Steve Guttenberg, and he's even more lame than he is! I didn't even think it was possible! In fact, he and the main girl in the film are responsible for WORST DRAMA EVER! It's not just that acting was waaaaaaaaay over-dramatic, but actually it was, of course, the script was horrible, which combines for a deadly one-two punch in a bad horrible totally unobservable drama. Scarecrow, talks about him. The whistle you hear every time it's around is stupid and obviously dubbed. Now his costume, I can't get through it - his guy wearing burlap sacks and a silly mask! I'm just overwhelmed, maybe if his 3 years of brain damage were scared of him. One of the characters, a token, a black man, used this line: be a chance to earn my red wings "when referring to an attempt to score with one of the girls for her period. Wow, um yea, this is the kind of dialogue you can look forward to. <br /> <br /> Oh, at the beginning, when a frighteningly dressed girl goes through corn, why is she involved? I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be obvious, just one of many of the obvious errors that have occurred throughout this "movie" Another is a bad dubbing for the music number (yup to right), all on the beach and one dorkaziodo gets the courage to sing a song and play guitar for everyone, and his so obviously called his funny Fortunately, the scarecrow answers all of our prayers and throws a javelin directly across the chest when he does the singing.It is quite good overall, it is one of those films where these people are trying to kill the killer. <br /> <br /> OK , there is a scene where two guys buried one of the your friends in the sand, then get up, whisk your foam and urine all around the guy in the sand. Do you really imagine that "Hey, let Joe bury in the sand, then get up and take our genitals like his no big problem and pee on him" In fact, it brings homo-eroticism in this movie, what the hell? The good part of the beginning of this film is the athletes standing there in their underwear in the dressing room and the cornfield while they are overloading there. What the hell? Traditionally, in film and in real life, athletes get girls and nerds not. It really doesn't make sense, because all the nerds think it's girls and sex, and all athletes seem to think it's a sport and they're around in their underwear, I don't have it. Let's get sex. As someone who followed this film with me, he said, "I've never been so disgusted with heterosexual sex in my life" and its truth. If you like hot cup action, or nasty old woman breasts, then this movie is for you. I swear they found the girl with the smallest breasts at all, and that's who gets to the naked scene? Then the ugly old nurse shows her jumping people and man several times, I just didn't want to see it. Now I have to talk about the continuity of this movie with a timeline, that's what's really just bizarre. It starts in the daytime, then everyone heads to the cornfield, and within two minutes his instantly dark center of the night when they leave the place they say they go to the beach - and the day immediately, and apparently stay in place. on the beach until night and until the next day. So basically these events in the film cover 4 days, without any characters that need to sleep or anything, its really strange. After the main murders took place, the flash ahead for "3 weeks later" and apparently none of these people really cares that their friends are brutally murdered! Surviving people literally pop some championship! And that's when I realized that the budget didn't go into script, direction, or play, it all went into that amazing bottle of the championship. <br /> <br /> The end. Stop reading now, if you do not want the end to spoil for you, it is really enjoyable. OK, so the end takes place in the church, and the scarecrow put your soul into the child's diabetes body, then fights with the guy who looks at Steve guttenberg and fights him with a b-movie version of the strength that the emperor had in Star Wars! I'm not kidding, it's so stupid! So somehow, in the middle of a fight, a scarecrow jumps into the soul. guy, and then with the last amount of will he owns, he crashes on the cross in the church! It's amazing! Some blood, but what's even better is that the cross is probably cardboard! You see the bottom shifting from the ground! Wow, have fun watching.
