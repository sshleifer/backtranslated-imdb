The first two films of this series excelled for their footage of the natural world and ordinary people stranded in the middle of the company. This movie has none of those natural shots that I understand is part of this point, but it really makes the entire video component of the movie seem like random pictures stuck together - those and zeros flying around, computer models of human skeletons and so on. Occasionally, stock footage will have a good effect (a segment of nationalism / finance around 35:00), but it usually seems that the video has no meaningful content, and requires you to accept the photographers' context rather than the photo context. director. It's not better than the video shown on karaoke. Three stars have been added to the Philip Glass soundtrack.
