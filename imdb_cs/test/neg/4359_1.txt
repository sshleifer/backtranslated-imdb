Suburban children meet the forest. Killjoy is better in this section. It is also more evil and stronger. Most games, however, are as bad as the first. Sometimes characters call each other things that don't make sense and aren't convincing. I made a mistake to watch the sober one. You will probably like it more if you are not ;-). If you haven't stopped loving clowns after the first movie, then after a second ..... ;-) <br /> <br /> The troubled children and their guards are on their way to the camp in the forest. And what a coincidence, their car broke right in the middle of the forest and ..... at night? That's just their luck. They will find a house and one shot, one of the observers will be left behind (why not know) and the rest will find another house. The voodoo priestess lives in the house ..... but is not responsible for the resurrection of Killjoy. Who is it then? You better watch the movie and find out for yourself.
