By far the most racist and ghettoish cartoon for kids 7+. Children who follow this cartoon will most likely try to dress, talk, and act as portrayed. I'm disappointed in Nickelodeon and Nick Jr. Wayan brothers can be good at movies for young adult viewers. They should stick to the movies and not make any more episodes for this cartoon. Young celebrities usually start working in movies and making voice recordings for cartoons, and then, as they grow older, switch to programs for young adults. A good example is Nick Cannon. He first started appearing in the All-To, Later he starred in MIB II, then Drumline, and now his television show, Nick Cannon presents: Wild 'N Out, where comics compete by saying inappropriate jokes. This comment was originally for Thugaboo, but I wanted to show examples of how celebrity kids watching on TV have recently become those who have been involved in non-child-friendly programs. It is very sad that this is happening, but all celebrities are changing and growing up. It's just the opposite of a new Wayan brothers caricature. It is bad enough that we have to deal with all the bad people of the ghettos, with the young generation being able to follow this program, it will only be transferring the children to those who have no chance of a good life. Just my feelings on this cartoon and my conviction about what happens to our children if they look at it.
