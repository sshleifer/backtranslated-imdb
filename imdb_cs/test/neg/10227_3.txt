This is one of the most original movies I've ever seen. Although you don't like the predecessors of this movie, "The Bad News Bears" and "The Mighty Ducks", they're bound to do a better job than this. From the moment the new teacher greets his class and tells her, "Don't bother with us, we're all defeated," you can see everything that's twenty miles away for the rest of the movie. <br /> <br /> All the usual suspects are here. In addition to a brave teacher, we have a group of what should be cute kids (they are brats, yes, but not so persistently), a slow, witty city sheriff whom they love torture, arrogant coach winning rival team, etc., ad nauseum. Only Olivia d'Abo as a new teacher displays likabilty. I never really cared about Steve Guttenberg and his performance as a sheriff doesn't change anything. Jay O. Sanders is a capable actor, but his character, the rival coach, has nothing to do with him. Hopefully writer / director Holly Goldberg Sloan will come up with something better.
