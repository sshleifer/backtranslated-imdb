I read almost all the books and I saw music production in two different languages. I absolutely loved everything I knew before. But lately, I was running out of resources to keep my imagination. I still have a few books left, but they're either in transit or they're a sequel that I'm not in a hurry to read. So I thought - Give me! There are movies that I haven't seen! That's why I have to watch them immediately. <br /> <br /> The first five minutes of this series were ... acceptable. In fact, I quite enjoyed the variant of the reason for expulsion, although it seemed different. From there everything went downhill. Chauvelin was also ... foppish? And I think he's too old for this role. Not an almost dark and lively character with his terrible - or. (And what was it with the random side scene that represented him? It was too scary - it wasn't his only love Madame Guillotine and his only interest - his work and his only obsession - Sir Percy?) Marguerite ... The foremost woman in France ? The Wisest Woman in Europe? I think not. Although she has forced her to penetrate Sir Percy's studio, I'm not the weakest idea. And what did my Lord Tony do to deserve this death? Yes, every League member has promised his life to Sir Percy, but none of them would ever threaten or escape like a coward when his dear friend faces a deadly danger. And if he had to mourn his companion, he would have done grieving, not just as if nothing had happened. Which brings me to the next point, Mr. Percy. His display was the most terrifying. He was neither lazy nor brave hero who is the master of transformations. He didn't even worry too much about the neckties (his pronunciation just made the word blew my ears) and never killed anyone with his own hands. So what was it that he walked with him accidentally and defeated people? Costumes were also too flashy at the time. This is the post-revolutionary France we are talking about! Not pre-revolutionary. People in the dress like this stand out in the crowd quite easily. It was just ... gah! Although I have to admit that when I followed the other parts, my opinion changed slightly. Watching it as a separate work, independent of the Scarlet Pimpernel series, it was tolerable. Just your next average hero in the mask. But he's still unhappy about what they were trying to pass on.
