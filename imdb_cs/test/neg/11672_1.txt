Every time I see this movie, I get the same impression: some of his parts are so incredibly stupid / bad that they break me, they're not intentional and there are a lot of them; the rest is just bad, stupid and / or irrelevant. A movie like Evil Dead gets credit for being bad at his own expense because it's the intended result - it's stupid and raw because Sam Raimi succeeded in what he was trying to do. This film does not have such an apology, it is silly and raw because the filmmakers have failed. The crap result gets upstairs on crap writing and crap performances to make it a shame that the lowest movie rating can be given one for 'terrible.' Watching this movie has the same effect as listening to Billy Madison's essay - "Everyone in this room is now fools because they were listening." I should be able to give this movie something about -5.
