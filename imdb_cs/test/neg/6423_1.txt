Newly released on US DVD; Stay away from him. I usually give enough room for stupidity in horror movies; I will settle on almost anything distantly exciting, supernatural, haunted, or even vaguely interesting. This one just joked. I knew there was a problem when Sara was the "best friend" in college who had a considerable time on the screen, wasn't even shown in credits on IMDb! I wasn't surprised when I didn't know any actors, but this character ("Daysha" or "Day-Glo" or what was her name) probably didn't exist! I'm so embarrassed to have actually paid a rental fee for this waste; deeply, deeply ashamed ...
