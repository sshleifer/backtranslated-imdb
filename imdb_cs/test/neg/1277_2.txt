I stopped this movie for 48 minutes and changed ... I don't know ... Maybe it's because I'm not a Swedish ... or a French (cannes commentator) ... or any of those OTHER sleepy places, of which previous reviewers are they were ... born and raised in New York. lived near San Francisco for a quarter century. and now the Netherlands. I love a good independent movie, just like another movie enthusiast ... but this word isn't funny. see? Now it's funny ... that you think I made a mistake. I said, "in a word," but then he said, "It's not funny" ... no. No error. If this is your type of humor, I would say that you didn't really have a lot of life ... consider your appreciation of this movie a symptom ... and NEVER use another review ... I tend to believe them when they are unanimous. Although there were only about 3 reviews in front of my ... I thought I could ACtually be able to save someone else's boredom ... anticipating laughter that never materializes ... even DID smile once or twice, though ... when I started the movie ... and when I stopped it. it should be 10 lines.
