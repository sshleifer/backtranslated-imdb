At the beginning of the film, Ramgopal Verma says that "Sarkar" is his tribute to the Godfather. He feels more like an insult. Compared to Coppola's classic, it fades. Although no one expected Ramgopal Verma to fill Coppola's shoes, the film created a lot of expectations and humming. Amitabh Bachchan plays "Sarkar", a character who automatically draws an instant comparison with the Indian political party Supremo Bal Thackeray Shiv Sena. Abhishek Bachchan plays his son Shankar, who returns from abroad and is imprisoned in Sarkar's politics at home. Just like Al Pacino in the original godfather. As most Bollywood rides, incidents and characters are obviously simplistic and without any solid foundation. Quick phone calls and sudden notifications turn the film from one direction to another. Abishek takes into the Bombay dark underworld politics-crime nexus as a duck takes into the water. Amithab Bachchan as Sarkar should look stunning and powerful, just looks old and clueless. Most of his acting is centered around a constant look at the various things around the movie file - an actor in front of him, on the floor or in some other random direction. However, Kay Kay performs exceptionally well as poor Vishnu's poor son. Likewise Zakir Hussain as Rashid, the Dubai Base smuggler who wants to get to Mumbai. This actor has an amazing presence on the screen and can send chills along the spine just as he looks. When he enters the screen, you want to escape and hide under the bed. All his obvious flaws could not resist, the film thrives at the box office. Buzzing and big star seem to help. Verma also manages your interest, though slightly towards the later half of the film. He is actually making a sequel to this, which I am sure will be more of the same fare.
