This movie is ... horrible and amazing at the same time. For the first time I saw it when I was about 13 or 14, so it means nostalgic value to me. In this film, Cesar Romero actually plays the character Octavio, the man who "discovered" Santana. There are also two other actors, Monte Markham (playing Sam, who is trying to save his daughter) and Peter Mark Richman (playing priest) who have great filmography, and these are the only performances that are fine. The rest of the acting and the film itself have all the features of B-movie that some of us love. Recently, I spent two years trying to get a copy of this film and it almost doesn't exist. . I suppose it was interrupted very shortly after its release. But in the end I found a copy and I paid enough money for it. If you come across a doomsday in a video store (unmistakable with kitsch green "satan" on the cover), count among the blessed who live near one of the few video stores that still have a working copy. They must see for those of you who like to laugh at the cheesy attempts at a scary movie.
