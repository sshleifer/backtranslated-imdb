this show is just awful. I liked watching Drake and Josh, which was great, and before Amanda showed it, also funny, but that's just AWFUL. in my opinion it was like watching those - Seltzberg movies, painful and uncleaver. This is about 3 dumb @ $$ kids who make a lousy web-show (when Ithing theft) while their retarded brother does statues (has no life). Cast is crap, Megan from Drake and Josh is Carly (AHHHHHH!) Ugly B! tch is sam and some guys who have downloaded from the street are playing fred. All I saw from this (UGG) are random "jokes" that include a brother who makes a movie of clay, also played an arcade game called PAC-Genious, Sam and Carly abstain from their web show and Fred to be dork. the only episode seen (cant remember the title) where Fred gets bad luck by not anticipating an email.i find videos on youtube funnier than this junk. and why the hell get youtube jack @ $$ fred, get AVGN to cancel the show with his potty mouth. skip this show.
