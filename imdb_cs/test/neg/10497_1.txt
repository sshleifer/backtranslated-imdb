Incredibly, "Vampire Assassin" is significantly worse than such atrocities as "Tequila Body Shots" and "Zombie Nation" - and those movies are TERRIBLE. The writer / director / star Ron Hall lacks both charisma and acting skills, and is also clearly incapable of the most basic directorial concepts. Maybe the worst camera, cut, lighting, sound, visual effects, music and choreography I've ever seen in the movie. There are rarely two shots, even in low light. The terrible dialogues are pronounced very slowly by the extraordinarily unannotated cast, stretching the film into almost deadly 87 minutes. It is really ridiculous embarrassment for everyone involved. It is obvious that lovers of horrible movies will want to see it, but it is very hard to sit no matter how experienced you are from the movie. The fact that Ron Hall thought it was actually releasable is overwhelming. If you are a film director and in fact think it's okay for the opening credits of your movie to include a few SLUG images before the title appears, there's a rough adjustment - and you probably can't collect energy to edit these frames - then they're your standards obviously so low that they could be offensive. I am amazed that Lions Gate / Maple has agreed to release this movie on DVD. Despite Rudy Ray Moore's very short portrait, this film is part of Ron's highest self-confidence - he clearly thinks he is an impressive actor, and he must also believe he has excellent writing and directing skills - but the film is so incredibly clumsy that it's hard to believe that he really wants people to see it for fear of being cruelly expelled like me. Crazy, madly horrible movie. I am not joking.
