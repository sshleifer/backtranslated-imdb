This film attempted to make Stu Ungar's life interesting by being creative. They forgot that his life was amusing enough on his own without having to do things. Short list of inaccuracies: <br /> <br /> 1) Stuey was not sent straight to Las Vegas for a Gin tournament to pay off his old debts, spent a lot of time in Florida and went to Las Vegas when he escaped from the gin games on the east coast. 2) Stuey never joined (or did not play Gin) with a powerful casino (like the one who plays Pat Morita in the movie) <br /> <br /> 3) There was no magic turnover. In fact, Stuey hardly got into the tournament as it was. A week ago he snorted cocaine. Either tell the truth or don't say it at all. 4 out of 10 stars for Michael Imperolli's trusted performance (the only quality of this movie.)
