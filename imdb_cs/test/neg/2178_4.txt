* MILD SPOILERS * <br /> <br /> In this bureaucratic satire, Chaplin focuses on the evil of German fascism, playing the double role of the Toman dictator Adenoid Hynkel and one of his subjects, an unintentional World War I hero and a Jewish barber. Through events inspired by Adolf Hitler and Marx Brothers, Hynkel negotiates treaties and declares war on neighboring Osterlich for finding time for many, strangely flat pieces. A very famous dictator waltz with an inflatable globe is actually quite heavily manipulated, fearless and unreal. Speech is actually a bold, unforgettable highlight of the work - but the film is simply not sharp or witty to deserve the praise often accumulated on it, nor to require repeated searches. The best gags are away from Hynkel's tedious position and include Barber trying to avoid a large spinning bomb (a sequence that steals from a tussle gun in The Gold Rush) and later, with a pot on his head, mistakenly walking on a board. the roof of his business. Compared to the director's silent classics, the Great Dictator is slow, wildly inconsistent, and somewhat unsatisfactory, while infertile charms are often long and hard to sustain. There is no doubt that Chaplin was a genius, but the geniuses are also disappointed, and the great dictator certainly belongs as such.
