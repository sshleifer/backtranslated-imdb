Dictated by a thin experience (both life and industry) and no cash short period of Sofia Coppola is almost a necessity observer piece located on a college campus. Casts are rather weak and do not benefit from being shot in b & w (it is difficult to distinguish characters from each other). Sound editing does little to help the simple story of a false teenage devotion. Yet one or two things should be noted. Among the inconsistent adjustments, the high school campus is filmed with a balance of aspirant broad and intimate footage. Editing to music also creates interest and momentum (without descending into the Underworld Music Video). Coppola clearly tried to change the pace of the film. Dramatic cornering is fast and point-to-point and there is almost no other action; We are aware that it is actually played in tandem with the first, which is the narrator-to-crutch trope (which is otherwise curiously attached to the character in this first act). Despite these remarks, it's awkward short. 2/10
