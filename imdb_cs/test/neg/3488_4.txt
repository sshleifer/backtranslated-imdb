One thing I have noticed about the 70's British horror movies is that they do not keep repeating the THEATER OF BLOOD, which is the case in which all of the Amicus antological films are. Add BEAST IN CELLAR to the list <br /> <br /> Much of the film's drama revolves around building a conspiracy revelation at the end. Once you know what a revelation is, it becomes a flat film. This opens up with a fairly good hook, but after that we are treated for a long boring sequence of two old ladies making little talk. Correct me if I'm wrong, but how many people watch a horror movie waiting for a couple of old ladies to talk to? The only kind of interest found in BEAST IN THE CELLAR is the anti-smoking stance. Some people have mentioned that it is an anti-war or anti-war movie, but you watch closely and see that the fly squaddies that it kills each time. Somewhat strange thinking about smoking attitudes was not nearly as hysterical as they are today
