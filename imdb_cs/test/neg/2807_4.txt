As mentioned in other notes, the main problem with NVA is that it cannot decide what it wants to be, the cheapest kind of grotesque or the parody of the East German army. There are a few moments that move quite a bit, for example when one of the recruits returns from a military prison in Schwedt with a totally broken personality. In the end, however, Leander Hau√ümann goes for childhood humor. No wonder the film fell on the German box office because it is historically untrue to the real situation in these training camps, led by an actor who is unfortunately unable to give zero performance. However, there is a camera by Frank Griebe who - as always - does a great job. If it wasn't for his beautiful paintings, I would have rated the film much worse.
