My girlfriend and I are really in horrible horrors. Especially those with lots of useless nudity. When we saw the box wrap of this movie on the blockbuster, we thought it would be the perfect movie for the night. We started to watch it, we didn't expect it to be BIG but we thought it would interest our interest. 20 minutes into the movie we realized that the pace would not rise and that it was an incredibly boring movie. We tried to get into it, but the conspiracy made little sense even after reading the back of the DVD box again and again. The film was shot very dark and it was quite annoying to try to figure out what was happening in each shot. Every violent scene is hard to discern and you will never really see how much violence you expect. It is definitely a film without a motif that was filmed badly and very stretched. Each scene was about 20 minutes the same thing and I felt I got a point after the first 5. Skip this movie and re-watch the next Freddy or Jason swing and you'll be much more content.
