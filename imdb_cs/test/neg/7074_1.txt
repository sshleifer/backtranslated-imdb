"Tamara" felt like another teen oriented knock-off trend "I Know What You Last Summer" and is painfully boring. The outcast college, which is heavily into witchcraft and black magic, is accidentally killed during a cruel joke made by a group of thugs who secretly buried it in the forest, promising not to tell anyone. The next day, supposedly "dead" Tamara, comes to school with a whole new picture and seduces his potential killers and has little revenge ... This is basically a combination of "Carrie", "The Craft", and every other straightforward tourist who in these days shelves hit. The actors are utterly appalling and look too old for ten years to give up college. There is some gore, which is nothing so interesting, because the film is so boring and I couldn't wait to end it. If you like modern garbage than I insist on looking for this, don't bother ...
