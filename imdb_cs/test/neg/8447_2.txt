The film is great for Venezuelan tourism, birds, birds and other birds. Only 1 piranha. Nice scenery. The only highlight was the alligator, which was seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race. The end when Caribe drowns is definitely Hollywood prop. There is no clear story. It goes from Venezuelan scenery to rip off easy rider into diamond mining and ruthless hunter crazy for some reason that gets it at the end. A very low budget movie that could be shot anywhere with Venezuela. William Smith is a very talented actor who has made some very good movies. Like all actors, everyone must have at least one bad movie Don't waste $ 5.00 on DVD.
