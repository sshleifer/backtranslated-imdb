The only reason I bought a DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene where Liz (Kim Basinger) was postponed to Joe Cocker's music: You can leave your hat on! That was the best part of the movie. Not because the scene was good; just a song. I'm not saying it was a bad movie just not so good. Disappointed! Especially when it is possible to examine male and female sexuality. Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust, obsession and infatuation, and where it can lead to pulling heels from one thought to another. For example, when John (played by Rourke) is able to abandon her at the top of the Big Wheel, Liz (Kim Basinger) is unconvincingly rattling over a bizarre experience courtesy of John's sense of humor, but less rattled over his sexual exploitation, including sometimes willing Liz; and as one reader he mentioned that for a woman who likes sex, she must experience a dangerous side that is not convincing. This "dangerous" side is not sufficiently exploited in the film, and one has the impression that it could all go terribly wrong. The theme of slavery makes the look often but only takes one on the verge of danger and then everything goes well. Is the movie sending the message that this kind of "Overture" is FINE! If the film made a point about the pitfalls of slavery and spread the nasty consequences of sad masochism, then it could be a good moral point. Instead, the film clumsily jumps from one of the "hissing" scenes of Rourke, who feeds Basinger and sticks it to the other. In a film that could be good, it falls on the face because it does not expand and widen the topics the film attempts to cover; so for me it has no conspiracy or theme just a mixture of ideas.
