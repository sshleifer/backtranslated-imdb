I recently rented this movie on a DVD and thought it would be an interesting choice as I find myself in both the North of England (Bradford) and filmmaking. However, it soon became clear that this film seemed to lack a decent level of script development-wise. The characters were weak and often stereotyped and the story lacked substance. The subject could be an interesting basis for the film. But delivery seemed naive and unfocused. The end felt like it was a decision about characters - punishment and reward where filmmakers felt necessary. That was a bit embarrassing and stupid, and it seemed to contradict the "realism" used in the filming style. In my opinion, the film dealt with characters and the subject matter in a rather cumbersome and clumsy manner. It was as if the writer had already decided how he wanted to end the story and fit in with everything in his power. Loach felt the film had. I am quite upset that British film financiers do not see that there are more British films than "brave realism". It has become an almost safe choice. The film is an infinitely beautiful playground for imaginative ideas and is not used by British feature films producers. There are many talents in the UK. It is unfortunate that most of these people will either end up making music videos and ads 100% of the time, or go to America. Love + Hate would work better if it was shortened to 30 or 60 minutes and appeared as a one-time TV drama.
