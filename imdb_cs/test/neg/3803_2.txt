Not accidentally I caught it in the middle flipping channels. Immediately I recognized almost everyone in cast, "groovy" hairstyles aside, and wondering what movie could attract such a cast of past and future stars? When I didn't see the original, I think it could be Poseidon Adventure because it was probably on a ship in need. I was wrong! I cannot imagine for my life why each of these great (or promising) actors and actresses would allow their name to be associated with such waste. There is no story, all the performances forced, the characters of the parody of the usual roles of the catastrophe, which are suddenly linked by the event and begin to pontify the true meaning of life at the level of stickers philosophy. It is worth seeing the unusually terrible performance of such greats as Sally Field, Michael Caine, et al. They needed money badly. Can we blame the director?
