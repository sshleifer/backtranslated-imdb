I didn't like this movie for so many reasons I can't even say then all. \ TI thought it was wrong done just because the whole story. I mean, who believes they caught the chupacabra and relaxed on a cruise ship. LAME!!! It was fine for the lame directly to the video movie, but it's not worth spending money on it. I can't believe anyone gave this movie ten. But I think there are people who like this movie. I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because it was about chupacabra and had a guy from master of the rings. If you want to see this movie, I'd stay home and wait for it to come to the science fiction channel. Don't waste money on seeing this movie. Believe me.
