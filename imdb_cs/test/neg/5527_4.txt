The problem with making a movie like this, however, is that the final, the cr√®me-de-la-creme film, the battle between the two imitated ships, must be done well. Disappointed, this scene in Ironclads is of course done completely with small model ships in overgrown bathtubs. There is no tension, little explanation of what is happening exactly, and what timeframe is in stand-off. The film has quite a few freedoms with the surrounding story, because all true stories convert to film, such as Union Traitor and most notably Betty Stuart (Madsen), Virginia belle. It resorts to making a possibly-respectable film involving an interesting story on ironclads to preach about the evil of slavery. In this historic drama it was in place and it was a cheap trick that brought the audience. It only succeeded in reducing the film's positive.
