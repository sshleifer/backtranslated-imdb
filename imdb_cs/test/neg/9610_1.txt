Based on what I saw at this show, I don't think I'm going to follow it again. It's not even remotely believable, and frankly, Derek just makes me angry. I'm sorry, but can you see such a wicked brat again and again? Why would I want to watch it?!? No thanks, there are a lot of other shows that include unpredictable characters (such as Phil Future Pim), where the bad doesn't win, or if they don't. Not to mention that I think it is a terrible painting that he painted about life with his half-siblings. Yes, life is not pink, but one could try to portray a character who is not completely evil and wins. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is to watch it only when you want to see a villain.
