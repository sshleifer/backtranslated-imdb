Do yourself a favor and stay away from this movie. Minus 50 Billion from 10. If you want hard action, don't rent it! If you want a good independent movie look elsewhere! I never thought I'd see Burt Reynolds in such a crappy movie. It has the thinnest storyline. Van Damm flicks should win the Academy compared to this. Rob Lowe proves once again why he's not the hottest actor in the world. Even Hasselhoff would do a better addict than he did. I don't want to bore you with other facts about this crappy movie, except that you should rent something from Hulk Hogan or Dolph Lundgreen. This should prove my opinion if you get my drift. <br /> <br />
