When I read these events that took place a few years ago (it's hard to believe it really happened), I thought there was a basis for an interesting story. Many secrets have never been uncovered, the horse has never found, the main conspirators have never been caught, etc. This film seems to be distracted by the study of character and very little attention to conspiracy. Some other questions are raised though, as why on earth would Mickey Rourke be in this movie? Its good to see a rourkes career taking off again, but he must cringe at the mention of this garbage. <br /> <br /> If the subject interests you, do an internet search on the subject, you'll be more educated and dare to say it's more fun. Avoid it.
