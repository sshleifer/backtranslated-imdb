After watching this movie, I decided it was so horrible that I had to join the IMDb and write a review to warn other people of rent falling / buying this movie. To be fair to the movie is just one good section to this movie, and that's the end of the credit cause then you know that this crap is good and really over. I watched it to the end, hoping to get some pleasure from the movie. Just tunnels more tunnels and the old man talks to himself (If you are looking at this movie too much time, so you). As for Val, if he chooses films like this, he can also say goodbye to his acting career. It makes no sense to write about what's in the film, as it has been done. Keep your money and common sense and keep it clear.
