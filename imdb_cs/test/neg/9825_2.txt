Although the trailer and poster of this movie suggest that Sally Hemmings was an important character, I may not have been so shocked when I found out that it was just a small (and I mean Minor) character, if this movie assumes that Sally tells him . family! I mean, if you are going to tell the story of a member of your family who has been ignored by history, will you tell him really with the man who pushed her into the unknown of the main character? His second lover (who becomes white) as a real interest in love? I know not! I'm as pale as they come and usually is a big fan of Merchent ~ Ivory flicks, but I couldn't take this film healing the poor Sally Hemmings.
