I saw this movie on video with a couple of friends as part of a teen comedy triple header, alongside Dorm Daze and Going Greek. Apparently, we didn't go for quality, but for air-driven entertainment and coarse gags. In general, we got what we came up with, but Wild Roomies really got off the ground: For being horrible. First impression, cover: The Norwegian version showed that the breasts are covered and a bunch of seemingly "mad" rooms in the background; It brings photos of drunk half-naked teenagers who do a lot of funny things, right? - "Crazy" rooms on the cover were not even in the picture. And the funny things you expect to do? - Absent too. This movie has been described as a comedy, which is a bit weird because it's not even funny at a distance. The relationship drama would be more accurate. In short, the film is about a young couple to inherit an elegant house in LA, and they are forced to get some roomies to meet. These roommates eventually gave the patience and relationship of the young couple to the test because they were so "wild". The problem is they aren't. And here's the problem of this movie: The protagonist of the couple is so anal-retentive and neurotic that they can generate zero sympathy. You will find yourself rooting for an opponent in the middle of the movie. Add mediocre acting, lame dialogue, and a boring direction, and you've made a movie that's most invisible. <br /> <br /> Look at something else.
