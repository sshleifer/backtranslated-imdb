Still another production of Lo Wei to completely wipe out the talents of young Jackie Chan, Kill With Intrigue is a strange blend of wuxia, melodrama, supernatural action and simple ancient kung fu fighting, which is quite boring despite a few surreal WTF moments and a lot of ridiculously bad dialogue. In an effort to protect his pregnant friend Chin Chin from Killer Bees, a gang of ruthless killers about to attack his home, Cao Lei (Jackie Chan) pretends to be a heartless cad, drive her away, and so save from danger. During the attack, Cao's relatives are all killed, but he is left relatively unharmed by a gang whose leader scar seems to have a hot woman for him. Cao then goes looking for Chin Chin, whom he entrusted to his close friend Chu Chuk. During his quest to find his true love, Cao befriended the head of a courier company whose precious cargo has been stolen by the leader of the evil clan "Bloody Rain". Finally, after being wounded in the fight against ugly clan members (a fun scene with lots of silly armor), and then back to health from the scarred Killer Bee (who shows his love by burning his face!), Cao finally learns that he is lousy judge of character: his friend, Chu Chuk, is no more than a mighty hungry head of homage to the clan 'Bloody Rain', who plans to marry Chin Chin. Cue drew a pulled climactic battle, with Cao getting kicked in the face repeatedly before finally choking his traitor ex-pal to death with a scarf. <br /> <br /> I die hard Chan fans will find it one chore to sit, with only the last fight that has been able to show off some of the amazing acrobatic abilities of the star. Fans of general Asian weirdness can kick a haunted look of murderous bees at the start of the movie (with one character inexplicably demanding his breakaway hand!), Or the moment three men swim through the window to attack our hero, but for most, this film will have a very limited appeal .
