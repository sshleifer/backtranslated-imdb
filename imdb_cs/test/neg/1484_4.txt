Maybe it's time to announce 2007 as the "International Year of the Crocodile"! First came the first ridiculous "prehistoric" crocodile named Gustave (!), Who rules the swamps in Burundi. Then there was "Lake Placid 2", a low-profiled and made-for-TV sequel to the forgotten original. Thirdly, there is this incredibly derived and hurried piece of Aussie's horror and I have not yet seen the promising "Rogue". The last one will probably be best if we consider the upcoming promising talent of Aussie Horr Greg McLean ("Wolf Creek"). "Black Water" is definitely not a complete waste of time and film, but it's another nonsensical survival show that confuses real life with horror. Excuse me for my numbness, especially since I sincerely regret the people who have gone through this suffering, but displaying three characters sitting in a tree and whining for more than an hour is not my idea of ​​total tension! Three young people travel around northern Australia and decide to spend a day fishing in distant swamp areas. It doesn't take too long for a giant and wild crocodile to flip over his little boat and engulf the guide. Grace, Lee and Adam can barely escape the hungry reptile teeth by climbing the tree. While most of the time he remains invisible, the dwarf patiently lies in wait and prevents them from leaving the swamp alive. Yes, it sounds a lot like the "Open Water" plot really. Replace the numerous invisible sharks with one huge invisible crocodile and open sea with the equally inevitable Aussie swamp and there you go. Well, "Black Water" at least contains some precious moments of excitement and one impressively designed water monster. That must be said, croc looks fabulously groovy and you are eagerly counting down to every next time that it emerges wildly from the water. The three-headed cast does everything in their power to keep their characters interesting, but how do you do that by sitting in the tree all the time? Apparently, the concept of real events causes a number of limitations, such as limited images of fantastic filming locations, dialogues, and friendly character drawings.
