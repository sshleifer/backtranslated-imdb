The fast, humorous advent of the matin√©e romp age appeals to the underdog aldolescent in all of us. It works, in fact, as a vehicle for Justin Long, who subsequently broke out on our screens in the fourth Die Hard via PC vs. Mac ads, Dodgeball and The Break Up. It's funny, serious and young - a great career ahead. <br /> <br /> The city's worth to be at college wannabes to find the fake website Bartelby (Long) created to deceive its decisive parents and descend to 'college' like it's been a short notice to a Facebook party. Lewis Black summarizes anarchic philosophy as a stand-in Dean - Long's delinquent friends provide support for the subterfuge and the subsequent attraction to higher traditions of education and friendship (Adam Herschman deserves special mention for his never-labeled slapstick post). Well done, engaging and instantly forgotten. 4/10
