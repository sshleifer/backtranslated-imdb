The films of everyday films are often the most interesting of all films for me, in the hands of a keen artist who explores all the twisted details of the mundane world. French cinema seems to be often very good about this and I like French cinematography. This movie was about secular. He didn't have much conspiracy. They were just characters who lived in the city, very normal people, and it just happened. But that wasn't very interesting, and it wasn't much researched. The film caught a bit of mood, but it was not a particularly captivating mood. And while I can't think that the movie did something wrong, it didn't work at almost every level to do something right. There were a lot of characters in this movie. Many of them looked similar, so it was hard to see who was who and what their relationships were. I don't mind putting some effort into understanding the film, or even watching a particularly complicated film more than once to iron out the details, but this was a puzzle that wasn't worth solving. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that cinematography was pleasant - functional, not brilliant but pleasant. The camera often captured some nice postcard-like postcards. But he rarely found really interesting details. So far, I've seen a handful of not so good movies at the Seattle International Film Festival, but that was the only one we couldn't get. applause when credits were rolling. When I finally finished the film, I sensed a great collective sigh. But I think there are probably some people who want it. <br/> <br/> 4/10
