I don't remember the last time I was so disappointed with a movie. I probably expected too much to happen (of course you can expect action in dogma-style movies). But there's nothing going on here. Fortunately, I watched him at home and could switch channels whenever silence and silly faces started killing me. And that was very often! It's not really much pleasure to watch ugly people who don't talk and move slowly, stroke pigs and French kisses, not to mention ugly bodies that have explicit sex. If it made sense ... the whole murder situation is ridiculous; it seems it was just created to show one more vagina because zero characters are able to truly solve the crime. With only four pseudo-developed characters and a film that is nowhere to be seen, it is soon clear who the director has chosen as the killer. And that's not a reason. Despite all the boredom and suffering, I have to admit that she touched me in some way in an inexplicable way. Maybe you should check it yourself, though I don't recommend it.
