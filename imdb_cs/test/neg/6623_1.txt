This movie shook my will to live, why this abomination isn't the bottom list 100 I don't know. My life was saved by the healing power of danny trejo. Worst movie ever, I dare to watch. It's like 90 minutes to collect commercial calls, just a lot worse. I'd rather watch the blue screen, it's really bad
