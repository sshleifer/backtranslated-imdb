There are films that are not published in theaters but on video. This should be allowed to age and disintegrate the manner in which the nitrate film is old. No story, inept violence, committed, poorly written, and excused thing is that the star was not the only bad part of the movie. And I liked and enjoyed some other Siegel movies.
