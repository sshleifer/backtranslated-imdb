I honestly wonder why this film was made. The Bulgarian-Italian coproduction set in Berlin, where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words among, is hardly credible. Basically, English vocabulary is limited to "fucking, bastard" and acting is worse than anyone can imagine. In addition, racial tension in Germany can be an interesting topic, but in Germany I know there are no gangs in the middle of the street in bright daylight. And if all that is not enough is also a serial killer who kills Turkish children and paints them white. To create some tension, we see a serial killer and we hear him as Schubert's lullaby hits, but we can't see his face. I don't think they really would have shot it in Germany. There are some street shots that are clearly in Berlin, but the actors are not seen in those shot. It is probably Bulgaria with some German characters that are added here and there.
