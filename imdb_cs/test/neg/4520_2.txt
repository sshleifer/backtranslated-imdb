Wow, even American Idol and So You Think You Can Dance Now Have More Adult Things Than WWE (At least auditions have many people abusing judges) and here is WWE, which moves with one of the worst movements in TV history, a change to PG. Now that I sometimes switch to see what's happening is what I get: 1) Hornswogle, an ugly dwarf sharing his space with major eventers apparently no reason except exciting young fans and of course beat them Chavo Guerrero, a capable wrestler, in every game <br /> <br /> 2) Guest guest (arghh ....!) Every week spoil the spoon of fun that was otherwise present. All these hosts are cheap B-grade celebrities trying to catapult again fame, by bursting terrible, 5 year old jokes and making silly links. 3) Cryme Time and a female wrestler (forgetting her name, probably Eve) give lessons on various "street" words (sobs) that are neither street nor cold. They were fun before, they stole things and they were loud mouths. 4) The Divas are dressed in inimitable clothes, tie their best to look "sexy, clever and powerful (by the way, I hate this catchphrase Remember that there were Torrie, Trish and Sable, these are those times, plus these wonders are bad wrestlers, which contributes to the suffering, I saw a couple of old WWE games in the Vintage collection and wonders there were "professional" no 5) PG movement limits so many things: almost no blood during matches, DX is terribly irritating, John Cena makes even more his patriotism law, the crowd contain many children (who are so uncomfortable), almost no "heels" etc. <br /> <br /> 6) And yeah, why keep PPV so often. One in each month, they lost it? No real controversy or rivalry is ever created and those that are done look at the fake and just-to-PPV-gets-over ones. <br /> <br /> 7) Vintage Michael Cole and several of his quotes: <br /> <br /> "Ladies and gentlemen, you are wat ching the longest running TV show in history "(every week" <br /> <br /> "BRUTAL and VICIOUS attack (he doesn't use it for anyone else) Randy Orton / Legacy" <br /> <br "Malicious Attack on Stephanie McMohan, Triple-H Husband !!!" WWE is now almost at its end. Vince's hope will rise from sleep and do something (bring back TV-14 or an era of attitude) 2 out of 10 for the current WWE status.
