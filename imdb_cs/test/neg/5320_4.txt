I watched it on Italian TV as a child and I remember it - considering his lively action mix with animation; however, it was universally eventually at that time ... and, to catch up again after all those years, I must admit that critics were right! What children must have been wondrous about is actually very poorly done, not to mention boredom for a fantasy adventure; fatally, both stars (ex-'Young Young Man' Richard Harris) and director (action expert Hunt) are inappropriate for this material! At the very least, Michel Legrand's score (with lyrics written by Don Black) is usable - if not exactly inspired. By the way, a number of prominent personalities perform among the voice artists in this British-Belgian co-production (Julian Glover, Bessie Love, Murray Melvin, Robert Rietty, Vladek Sheybal, Graham Stark and this is his latest film, Michael Bates). While the basic conspiracy of Jonathan Swift's classic novel (Gulliver Gulliver becomes a pawn in the war between the small people of two neighboring countries and ends on the run, ends in the land of real giants appear here, it is done strictly) children's level (with stereotypical characters though, fortunately, a little comic / romantic diversion) - which makes the business somewhat absurd, beyond its naturally experimental nature, since Max and Dave Fleischer had already played a beautiful cartoon version in 1939.
