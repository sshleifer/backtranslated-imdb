I can't believe this show was fine-ed. First J.P. Manoux is doing a terrible job for David Spade, and Pach's voice is too deep compared to John Goodman. The theme song is so annoying and the episode plot is so stupid !!! The only good thing about this show is that Eartha Kitt and Patrick Warburton remain like the voices of Yzma and Chronicle. This show is a waste of money and a waste of time. Half of the episodes are copied by the film. In my opinion, the Emperor's new Groove was one of the best children's films in the years, but completely destroyed by Kronk New Groove and this show. You should watch such shows as Spongebob, Fair Oddparents, Danny Phantom or Kim Possible but not this show.
