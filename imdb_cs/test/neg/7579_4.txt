I should explain that as for this trend for copying Asian horror movies, this shutter is head over The Grudge and Dark Water, while still not reaching the same amount of atmospheric ghost that The Ring creates. Despite the fact that movies like life don't exist in a vacuum, they are for comparison with other thrilling / thriller / horror movies. Frankly, I am not writing a lengthy review here and I will say that this film is trying to rely on music caused by "frightened" fear, rather than atmosphere, and "spirit" itself is not so remarkable. The story is very basic and predictable and there is nothing to write about at home. While there are several exciting scenes that border on creative fright, most of the movie is pretty vanilla. If you enjoyed The Grudge and it's ilk, then you can enjoy it. <br /> <br /> Level: C-
