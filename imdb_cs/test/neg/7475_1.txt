When the US Marines are seriously disregarded by the American flag, the film has a hard way ahead, but unfortunately it was downhill. There is a military advisor credited, who is also apparently retired by the US Marine, making it even more confused that this incredible violation of protocol and law, went unnoticed. Even clearer is the way they simply read the sailor's announcement to KIA, then buried, in very short order, without any explanation of how they identified the body or even the body. The United States government still finds missing from World War II and the identification of remains lasts for months. Military downing remains MIA months or years and only KIA is declared when the remains have been positively identified or after years of bureaucracy. It is expected that we believe that this will happen within a few days or weeks. Maybe this is happening in Denmark, but not in the US. None of the people who attended have ever had the slightest commitment or respect for the US military. In addition, there are a number of other absolutely ridiculous moments when the characters come with zingers out of nowhere. There must have been some really widespread meetings between the authors and the actors, trying to find motivation for such pigs. With the help of the script that worked, it helped, but this one seems to have been created where Cliffs Notes worked. There is no way to find out if the script was originally so horrible, or if it was the author, or the middle management kids in the studio that are responsible. Either way, it's a horrible movie that should never be done.
