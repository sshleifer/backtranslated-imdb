The only good thing about this movie is that I now have a movie on the worst list. Rest Stop at the end of the spectrum where I can compare all the horrible movies. Indeed, this film is the worst storyline, the worst overhead, throughout the movie everything I wanted to do is pull out my hair and kick the writer and anyone who made this movie a possible ass. I'm a deployed soldier, and when I spend my precious downtime watching movies like this. These people should feel awful, they had to look at it before it came out, and they had to be so madly lazy that they could come back after they noticed it was crazy. I'm so impressed that this great country of ours is letting them do more. Frankly, it's the first time I've ever commented on a movie, I had to let the world know not to waste time. Remove this movie from the face of this planet. That makes us delayed.
