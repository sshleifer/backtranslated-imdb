Sigh. I am confused when I see a short similar attention and tasks and what not. I saw this film at the festival before the filmmaker immediately took care of it and forgot it. It was slightly uncomfortable when I saw the throwing of the Grinch Who Stole Christmas Gag along with the narration, the set design seen many times before, the whole weak Tim Burton-ish style, and a story that goes nowhere. And we got a "joke" about shooting crows with 45 first time, all right? But I think that what is really unacceptable is that it even beats its basic concept from the comic book circa 1999 called LENORE, CUTE LITTLE DEAD GIRL by Roman Dirge! How every fast internet search reveals. What is it? Is that what they founded a Hollywood contract and opens a door to Canada for filmmakers? "Put your head on," Don Cherry said.
