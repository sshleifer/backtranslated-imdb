I saw this movie this morning at TCM. Very bad behavior, low budget and bad conspiracy are the impressions I felt while watching the movie. The only highlight of the film was to watch young young Rita Moreno (23 years old) playing a teenage Indian squaw in love with an older man in her 50s. She reminded me of an earlier version of Sue Lyon as Lolita (1962), just the innocent Lolita. He jumps up and down like a lousy 1950 helicopter, almost as if you were expecting to be a chewing gum falling down on this old man who would want to give him anything when he played it as if it was hampering him. Any man in his fifties who had a beautiful, virgin, teenage girl who wanted to do ANY to him and be his bride would be insane to not use it. It's too bad that censorship started when this movie was released, which did not allow for a more expanding character like Rita Moreno. The only reason I gave this movie 3 instead of 1 is Rita Moreno's appearance in the movie.
