God! Where should I start? From start to finish, I couldn't help hating this movie. Vineyard? Vineyards that make cell phone sounds? Yeah, I'm so scared - I'll get rid of the weeds of the earth! Come on people! The conspiracy went nowhere, When the group discovered the ruins, and the village inhabitants (no pun) came to warn them of weapons and look with them, don't worry, Amy (Jena Malone) was there to take pictures! The whole scene was really interested in why she didn't take a picture of her beau, Jeff (Johnathon Tucker), who cut off Mathias's legs (Joe Anderson). When the idiots threw a rope for the first time, as the rope was at least ten feet from the ground, but how it could only be two to four meters from the ground. I can't start covering everything that was wrong in this movie, there are too many of them. I'll tell the graphics when it comes to gore, but it wasn't because the acting and the script were so bad.
