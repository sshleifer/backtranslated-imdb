This film is absolutely scary and terrible. It's not a low budget, it's no budget movie that makes Ed Wood movies look like art. Acting is pointless, but the sets and props are worse than anything I've ever seen. A regular subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of mutant killers, Woddy Strode has one bullet and combat scenes are shot in disused gravel pit. There is sadism, as you would expect from the 80s of the Italian video ugly. There was no talent for this movie. The interest of female lovers may have a huge Italian taste. Even for the Italian standards of the 1980s, this film is pretty damn horrible, but I think it came out when there were not so many movies available on the video, or the viewers were not really recognizable. This piece of crap has no fun value and it's not even funny, just boring and very cheap. It's actually an insult to the dumbest audience. I was just wondering how an actor like Woody Strode ended up on the Earth with such a turkey?
