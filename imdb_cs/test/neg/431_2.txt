This is the title in movie search. It's a pitch that sounded lucrative to some studio manager and the rest was damned. When this film was made, there were two things that CGI didn't do well at all: humans and fur. Thus, hairy people were not destined to look good when they were rendered by computer. This is the only example I can think of, where the effects for a well funded sequel took a huge leap back landing beyond those of the original film. To record, the design of the werewolves won't help a bit. The filmmakers seemed unable to decide between the four-legged and the bipods, trying to do both and ending the creature that looked equally uncomfortable. The transformations are anatomically absurd and the final result with a relatively high forehead and a short muzzle looks like a cross between Ron Perlman and hyena. But back to that part. This is a movie that exists PURELY for cash on its forebear. I'm not a fan of Landis's original film, but a boy, it looks good. If you thought any of Landis's humor was forced to try some of those unbearable attempts. Chewing gum scene, corpse humor, dog that ... you know, you just have to watch that bite yourself. Thomas Everett Scott is on vacation in Europe with friends and has decided to take a break from playing "ugly American" and bungee to jump off the Eifel Tower in the middle of the night, leading to his rescue of a young woman (Delpy - Julie not just to become Star in America. Ask Rutger Hauer) for jumping to her death.It seems to be part of a werewolf cult who plan ... I'm not sure anything wrong. Stereotypes, Yawning Conspiracy Holes, Confused Ending, No matter what, the studio just cared that the title would probably mislead millions of fans of the "American werewolf in London" to give them their money. poorly.
