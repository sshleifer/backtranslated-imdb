It's easier to watch this movie if you look at it as a script created by Starfleet Commander Reginald Barclay during his Holodeck addiction. (Barclay is a repetitive Star Trek character played by Dwight Schultz.) Dwight Schultz is poorly portrayed as Oppenheimer. Oppenheimer's character is poorly written, so we never see the depth and breadth of his knowledge. Instead, we see a shallow two-dimensional figure of soap opera. Paul Newman is also miscast like General Leslie Groves, but this movie is a trouble going beyond bad actors in bad roles. Factual Mistakes and Great Freedom Taken (with a chronology of events) to be forward screenwriter Bruce Robinson's political program to make this film embarrassing to watch. This is probably why this film has found a home in the History Channel. "Fat Man and Little Boy" combine bad science, bad history, bad script, and average gameplay to create a movie that shouldn't be perceived by printable high school or college students who know nothing about Manhattan. .
