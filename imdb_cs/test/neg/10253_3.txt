Perhaps I admit that I'm watching a lot of really bad movies. But there are very few that I think are as bad as women's tails. It's stinking epic proportions. What was supposed to be a sexy comedy about a group of cavemen who first discovered a woman is instead boring, lifeless, with no laughter. The comedy is extremely weak. I suppose if you think someone in the head is funny, you can laugh or two. Boys in this film make three Stooges look like high art. And there's just not enough plots to hold this thing together. You seem to be dragging on and on and on and on. Well, maybe you're asking yourself, "If it's as bad as you say, why didn't you rate it lower than 3/10?" Good question! And I have two answers. First, the film is not worth its curiosity. I have a little interest in Italian spoof films like One Million Years B.C. with Raquel Welch. I give when women have a Tails point for its historical "value". The other two points concern the mere presence of Senta Berger. I know this is not much explanation or justification for the evaluation, but what will you do? It's the best I can lose.
