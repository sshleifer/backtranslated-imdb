Although it wasn't a complete waste of time, "eighteen" wasn't really sweet as he pretended to be. Neither the age of the actors they display? 18, my ass. In fact, McKellen could show up in a movie that tells us he is 30 years old and asks us to believe it. Even Michael J. Fox was more believable as a teenager in Parts II and III "Back to the Future" (probably not the same). Either the total emptiness of acting or simply overclocking (the so-called Paul Anthony's Anxiety, Clarence Sponagle's lifetime moments, and even though I like Brendan Fletcher, it's best to look at him, and even more so in 'Freddy Vs. Jason'). scenes (faster than Britney Spears' marriage, incest prove a point and a man who needs help to urinate, but still has one hand free? I guess it was a fantasy writer,) the whole film of contemptuous characters (Anthony can play someone who is 18 years old But she behaves as if it was 12 years old and some special "John" thrown into Anthony's character Pip can save the day? There was really a sex scene in front of the child? and virtually every character questioning their own sexuality by strange actions / scenes. I enjoyed Ian McKellen's voice positively when I saw (rarely portrayed) straight / homosexual friendship, the love of puppies (from someone who collects stuffed puppies, that is, good score, some decent dialogue more homosexuals and pedophiles wish to have more people realized it) and acting from female leaders (as well as Cumming.) Can't I really recommend it because it really tries to be too many things? homosexual tolerance, homosexuals, homelessness, WWII, priesthood, first love, wrong judges, etc. etc. etc? budget.
