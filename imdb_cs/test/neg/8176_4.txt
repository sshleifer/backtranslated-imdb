This may not be the worst movie ever to win the best picture, but its up. On the other hand, it is probably the worst movie ever to get the best picture. Yet you would expect it to be a value during the movie. But this is in fact even though it is questionable. The film contains almost no depth and is just "fun" after "fun" if you want to call it. It is very interesting at first, but everything seems to be exaggerated on so many levels. Acting was not spectacular to watch, but it was quite interesting to see Charlton Heston in his first lead role. After a while I found many characters like the tone of the movie. As a philosophical clown I really liked James Stewart. He saved the film in giving him the extra layer he needed. Sadly, there was nothing else behind Stewart. The director of a highly respected Cecil DeMille didn't exist for me. Sometimes I found out that the film was corrupt and its use of Betty Hutton was a mistake. The appearance of the film was sometimes very good, but it did not create the magical feeling a classic should have. In fact, writing was good enough to think about how much the film had. There is no depth, no valid attempt to draw emotion from the audience and simply no artistic value of the film. Then, of course, many holes on the property. This film was constantly uncomfortable and frustrating. I even felt that what I was watching was not only an imprecise display of circus life, but rather the opposite of how it really is. Why is it the best picture behind me, but it's not like the first or last time when Oscars make a mistake and make a mistake.
