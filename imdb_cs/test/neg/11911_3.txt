Jack Lemmon was one of the most beautiful actors to ever shine on the screen. He easily switched from dramatic roles to comedic, so most of his colleagues will be envious. While his performance in "Save The Tiger" is Oscar-worthy, I feel that it was given to him when he missed his other opportunities to win a prize due to other, better roles that preceded this current one. This is also one of those spectacular movies that basically showcase talent talent, or in this case one particular member. It's too bad that the script output doesn't match Lemmon's output. Don't waste your time with this.
