Ugh. Yes, it's just like McMartin's mess, or terrible arrests in Wenatchee, Washington. In the film, the mother still aggressively challenges her little boy over and over until she finally tells her what she wants to hear. Judges investigators and "therapists" repeat the formula. The questioning itself is a sexually fearsome, tireless repetitive attack in its own way. Filmmakers cast a doctor who talks about physical evidence of abuse, perhaps to justify the film's opinion: Four-year-olds never "look". Well, if all the adults they know ask for them. The way this piece supports such discredited interrogation techniques is for anyone who knows what's needed to successfully prosecute in real life to watch his performance in frustration. <br /> <br /> (They also add a special arrest warrant to "prove" their case - no parallelism with this fictional incident has ever occurred in real life. A spoiler, but you'll know when you see it.) <br / Yes, children are being abused, sometimes paid by care providers. But watching a film that confirms the ridiculous, hysterical accusations against so many innocent people, watching the re-creations of the trials that destroyed the lives of countless children, as well as the lives of the defendants - I didn't think I was Last until the end. It's just too sad, and it seems as if the writing team seemed to seem to agree with the derogatory, paranoid, obsessive questioning techniques that had begun - what could we call it? Ambulance Campfire? Nobody I know has ever been accused of child abuse, thanks to heaven, but my twelve-year-old grandmother was accused of witchcraft and was killed for that. Crowds full of what they think is holy anger are as dangerous as three hundred years ago. Such a sensational drivel - "These accusations of satanic abuse appear across the country, there must be something!" "Then tell the jury!" - Just eggs is on. And who thought it was a good idea to have children under ten, some of them up to five, play these roles? It is traumatic to watch them deliver their lines; How much more traumatic was it to act these parts? The filmmakers' commitment to fighting child abuse is probably not for themselves. And what were the parents of children's actors THINK? "Melinda" (uncredited, at least in the A&E network version in 2005, but I think it was Cassy Friel) and "Teddy" (Brian Bonsall) were great. The professionals, or not, were too young to be exposed to this material, much less than to pay it. Despite the ruthless exploitation of these children in real life, "You know, Muffin Man" received an Emmy nomination for directing - which just shows how crazy things were in 1989.
