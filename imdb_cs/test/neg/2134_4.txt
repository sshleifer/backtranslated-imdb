The giant mutant octopus "40 feet long" with five tentacles, razor fangs and the ability to reproduce its own cells terrorize a small town in Florida. Various marine biologists, doctors and cops are killed. Meanwhile, a human monster named Miller offs people who discover "Devilfish" is an artificial creature used for the greedy benefit of some evil doctors! Miller is attacking the researcher, strangling her, drowning her in the bathtub, throwing herself into the hair dryer, and then pulling her dead body panties out! Janet and Bob set out on a high-tech (high-tech for 1984, as well) "Seaquarium" ship to catch a creature that is often seen in a close up or brightly obvious, accelerated-up movie seeming more menacing. And only fire can destroy it, leading to flamethrower-armed posse vs.. beast finals. It benefits from Antony Barrymore's excellent score and a decent (again for 1984) monster. The original story was written by Luigi Cozzi and Sergio Martino. <br /> <br /> Score: 4 out of 10
