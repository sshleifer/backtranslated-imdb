I think the best way to review this title is to divide it into its pros and cons. PROS: ~ converting to wolves rather than plastic / cartographic monsters. ~ persecution of wolves through the forest ~ "Checkout" by playing Hard-Fi played <br /> <br /> CONS: some parts of the script will make you cringe (for example, the terrible part where a woman escapes the "boys" "Fortunate Five" about half an hour "Dear cousins" and a round robin "Yes, see, we know Gabriel's law") ~ diving transformation is ridiculous ~ obvious and ridiculous end ~ Aiden has said thousands of times to leave and then goes "if you cared about me you would leave me "~ obvious signs ~ unnecessary parcour ~ absolutely unnecessary chopping arm Aiden ~ cringey speeches Gabriel <br /> <br /> You see what I mean. I love werewolf movies and I watched it several times to see if I liked it better, but it was worse. I think I'll just read the book and see how I can get on. Do not bother if you do not have a 12-year-old brother or sister in scary things. Anyone at this age can suffer and want their hour and a half back.
