Last night I ran over this movie on a local TV channel. Frankly, I've never heard of this movie before. I just lost track of the latest Seagual movies, because each one is the worst than the previous one. Here we have a dull Seagal again, as if his girlfriend had insisted that he do this movie and he accepted it emphatically. The storyline is ridiculous, acting is below zero, and there is no single aspect of a film that does not fall apart. I just have no idea why Seagal did it. Man, that's even worse than "Out for killing"! If you watch this movie, you'll start apologizing. He seems to lack ideas, enthusiasm and money. Avoid this movie and do something useful.
