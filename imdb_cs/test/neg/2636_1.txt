This movie was stupid. The script is so full of holes; I don't see how the producers agreed to fund it. We've never received an explanation ANYTIME. Negotiations are terrible. The plot sucks. This movie was probably written for those 8 and less. <br /> <br /> I have to say this: why are high schools just 2 minutes away? The teacher walks in, finds the frog on the table, or draws on the board and in 30 seconds the bell rings, the class ends. Children haven't opened their books yet. Can we have at least little continuity? <br /> <br /> Dialog. Milo Jeter is a reborn fetus, a zombie. We really need a line, "This is Dr. Jet's office. Dr. Jeter, Father Milos." Thanks for tipping; I could never put it together. It is never better. Why does Milo speak the way he does, even at the beginning? Milo was always real. Or has it never been real, always what is currently? And if it was always so, why inexplicable "accident" Milo had? Except "What is Milo?", What are all the unresolved things for? We see all these contraptions in his father's office, and never get an explanation of what they are for or what they have to do with the story. What are the injections? What about the aquarium? Apparently not needed. (Watch the movie, it will make sense). And what does this medicine do to anyone? Apparently nothing because it has no effect on the main actress. This movie is a very, very bad rip off of all other slasher movies. It's really terrible Friday, the 13th / halloween along with a 10-year-old writer. It's not bad enough to laugh, it's just an incredibly frustrating hole.
