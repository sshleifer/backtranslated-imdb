That was one of the most dishonest, nonsensical, and nonviolent movies I've ever seen. The representation of the other Israelis was racist, backward and unfair. First, the song playing on the E.S 'car radio when it rose alongside a very right Israeli driver, was "On You Spell" by Natacha Atlas. The song's style is quite Arabic, but it was released on an Israeli compilation CD and I even heard it on radio in Israel. Many Israeli songs (as well as architecture, food and slang) are influenced by Arab culture and there is no reason why an Israeli Jew would be offended or angry with a nearby car playing this song. Method E.S. He seems to be so calm and collect with his sunglasses and cool gaze, for a long time, still shooting, wanting the viewer to see a Jew as a haggard and racist, and E.S. as noble and gentle. <br /> <br /> I traveled all over Israel and never saw an IDF recruitment poster because the service is mandatory. But there is not only a recruitment poster in the film, but it captures the stereotypical image of an Arab terrorist and the words "want to shoot?" This is an extremely inaccurate representation of the mentality of most Israeli and Israeli soldiers, and such "advertising" would not even exist on a random Israeli highway. Its aim is to convince viewers that Israel is a society of anti-Arab racists who are tremendously seeking murder. The Ninja scene was gratuitous and unnecessarily violent. A Hollywood-style action scene involving Israeli soldiers shooting Palestinians would be as unwelcome in Israeli film as the ninja scene should be. But for some reason, the images of an unrealistic, non-comic and violent scenario will cause the audience's applause because the director has torn the Israeli side so much that any shot of killed Israeli soldiers will be welcome. The director does not absolutely try to build bridges, display "others" as human beings, or work for peace; The only solution is violence. This is supported by scenes of exploding tanks, falling guard towers, and other random acts of destruction. One of my best friends is serving in the Israeli army, and targets in fire zones are never Arab women dressed in black or other quasi civilians on canvas. The checkpoints are not instructed to shoot at the head of an approaching Palestinian unless it is clear that their own life is in danger; The method, according to my friend, is to provide a warning shout, fire into the air or around the area, and then when everything else fails, shoot in the foot and then interrogate and hospitalize. The random focus of a woman in the head, as shown in the film, is not the right way. <br /> <br /> In addition to these inaccuracies, the style of direction was also bad. The repetition was repeated, and no longer charming. Symbols such as the Arafat balloon are enforced outside any conspiracy structure or effective environment integration; the balloon is Palestine penetrating and reclaiming Jerusalem and E.S. The ambulance, which was checked for permission by Israeli soldiers, followed by Israeli ambulances flying around the checkpoint, is too obvious an Israeli double standard claim by the director. The director's attempt to show life in Nazareth as clumsy and absurd is done with exaggeration; Show routines of random people over and over, even with a slight change every time, and emphasize that not a single cast member will ever smile and be minimalist in the dialogue almost shouting the purpose of these scenes, the roughness of life without allowing a great deal of personal interpretation. By contrasting one "section" of film, everyday life in Nazareth, with the second part, a checkpoint between Ramallah and Israel, the director gently accuses this roughness of Israel, but never provides any direct evidence of why such a guilt can be properly argued. I spent hours trying to figure out why the music suddenly ended and suddenly, and why many modern fashion and metallic events were included in the score. I still can't come up with an answer. I felt that music was inappropriate in this movie. the contrast between more silent scenes and intense scenes was actually unpleasant and did not influence or provoke. I can understand whether the director intended the music to provide some kind of comic aspect to certain scenes, but I found that there was nothing in the Israeli soldiers who were shooting at targets or fighting the ninja to find. checkpoint, though defiantly. In fact, I was tempted to close my ears during intense scenes, and annoyed by the lack of score during quiet scenes. Whatever the intent of the director, he has only dissatisfied throughout the film. This film has no legitimate political message because it provides inaccurate and extreme representation of the other, and neglects to actually deal with any problems. It is a propaganda film because the director intends to use various symbols, styles and scenes to sympathize with the Palestinian side, while the Israeli side is, without exception, exposed as cruel and inhuman; The lively atmosphere of the action-packed Hollywood scene or intense music is manifested in every violent act of Palestinians against the Israelis, so almost inevitably positive and excited feelings that music and cinema acquire from the audience go to one side. The audience has no thoughts, thoughts or deepening understanding of the conflict; emotions are simply pulled to one side and kept in a cliché of "good vs bad" cliché. I believe that this film lacked the depth, quality and strength of other Palestinian films, such as "Raj Now" and "Wedding in Galilee".
