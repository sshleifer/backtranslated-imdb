The direction of Wong is perhaps the worst ever in film history I've ever seen. This movie is my worst movie of 2000, Dungeons and Dragons by Courtney Soloman looked like an Oscar winner. Errors in this movie are beyond explanation. The biggest is the lack of depth. Every scene does not evolve completely as if the editorial team did not know how to work properly. It's a pity that with such a star cast of talent and the famous popular traditional story, it can be destroyed by this lack of vision. I'm so disgusted and hopefully a great director like John Woo or Ang Lee has decided to make this movie and do some justice. I'm not even sure if I can rate 0/10 ??
