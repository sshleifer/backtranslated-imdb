I thought this movie was too absurd for me to finish. The assumption was too stupid and predictable. I didn't do it far in the movie. <br /> <br /> Let me see. Obviously she's older than a taxi driver (unless she's much younger than she looks). It's black and it's white. He earns more money than he (he's just a taxi driver). These are the three most reliable company unions that have turned in one of them and pretend to have a chance in hell. She should better marry a guy she doesn't love. I only partially watched him because I like MJW as an actor. His actions were excellent. Oh, meh! It was OK, but the assumption was too stupid. I didn't see the end. I couldn't do it there, so I don't know if it ended differently than I expected the end. I can't imagine any black woman who likes this movie. There is something disgusting about looking at a black man who cares for a white woman. And the old one. PLEASE! Not in the real world!
