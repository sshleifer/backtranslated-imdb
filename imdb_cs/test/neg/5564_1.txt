I hate this movie !!!!!! I've never seen such a sheer, complete waste in my life !!! I live in France, so it turned out that I was at the front to watch this horrible movie. At first, it seemed cool, something like a cursed forest that chomp people. Unfortunately, it turned out that it was something QUITE was something else: a good start with a girl who meets a guy and all she is not, then a girl gets menacing news in the form of ravens close in her bathroom wardrobe (ridiculous) of that bit And on, the movie begins to slide down the hill very quickly with plenty of desperate thrashing in the process. The film ends with the Druid sacrifice and ancient ugly creatures returning from the past to kill several people. There were many questions about my head: why the hell did they bring the dirty monster back? Do the druid maniacs look dressed in sheets? Why did they even bother to do this movie? The "top" of the movie was so goofy that I laughed all the way: a "horrible" stinking monster fights with two young women (who seem to be expert in kung fu) and the professor cuts into two or something. . I was surprised that the monster was so slow and clumsy in battle that it wasn't supposed to be a god of war or anything? Anyway, the film in his mortal throw was a pitiful glance. Brief condensation of the content of this film: Kung fu mayhem + druid stones + mysterious murders "Ã  la thriller" + ancient prophecy + shabby ravens + old clumsy boneless war god + nut professor = complete and sheer, sick, boneless, worm eaten, GODFORSAKEN, GODDAM , RECYCLED, FAKE, WANNABE, LUDICROUS SH * T !!!!!!!!! Things I learned from this movie: -Old war gods are miserable in kung fu. -All young women who study archeology at a university in France are experts in kung fu. -Professors are so durable that they survive when they are stacked in two saws that are free of any damage.
