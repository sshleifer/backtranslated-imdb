The story looked fine, the actors looked good, the movie should be fine. But it certainly wasn't - it didn't take us anywhere, scenes <br /> <br /> are weird. Maybe it was about wanting to create something new to think it was <br /> <br />. And at least: Where is the rest of this movie? For me, it was <br /> <br /> a waste of money, time and talent. Someone would like to see this <br /> <br /> for curiosity to see if they can figure it out. Other I personally don't recommend it to anyone.
