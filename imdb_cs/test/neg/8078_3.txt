A bunch of teen bikers is out in the woods and rides in circles. Having fun; little know that nature is to be released by an emo refugee from Deliverance or Hills Have Eyes. He is armed with matches and fire. And she has an eye that bleeds or something. Why ignite the park? I don't know. Maybe he doesn't like Smokey the Bear or something. But he wears an army / navy store fatigue if it helps. Rangers send one single helicopter to fight the resulting bliss; This is all you have ever seen, except for a lot of people in the base who talk a lot about fire but do nothing. Some cop or ranger or militiaman or anything that falls from a helicopter to a faulty mooring. They forever pop wheelies, make Evel Knievel jumps, spin around etc. They argue continuously. Fire shots are as fake as 3 dollar bills; it's the same shots of a dozen different angles and the flames never grow or move. And you never see any fire equipment. SyFy channel movie that has about 0% science fiction connected to it. What you can expect from this: bad acting, cheap effects and a story that goes nowhere (just like bikes and fire do not go anywhere). Mixable treatment of insomnia.
