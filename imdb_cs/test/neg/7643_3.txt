Sayles had a very interesting movie with Silver City, but somehow he went from start to finish. Chris Cooper did an extraordinary job that embodied the nature of his character, Dubya, but he didn't have nearly enough time on the screen. Instead, we find ourselves on a ramp with a character that is less personal, less developed, and generally too confusing. The way Danny Huston leads us inevitably becomes the fall of the film. Too many characters are introduced to us in such a short time. These characters were accidentally involved with the plot, which became too complex with every minute. Sayles knew what he was creating, but I felt as if he was not well-translated on the silver screen. Sayles is the master of his business. His films still inspire and evoke thoughts, though they are not commercial successes. The problem with Silver City is that I think he was too deep when he didn't have enough money or time to explain it all. At the beginning of the film, I had an idea of ​​what was happening, but as more and more characters appeared, as more and more plots of experiments appeared, I lost the end of the film. While the end was very clever and very dark, I needed more explanation. I think one of the reasons I lost my idea with this movie was because Danny Huston came as a guide. He was pathetic. It didn't seem to me that it was such an exciting person to lead us to this adventure. He seemed to go through the movements, but he didn't really do much. This was the first fall of an important film by Sayles. Although I admit that the characters played by Richard Dreyfuss, Miguel Ferrer, James Gammon and Daryl Hannah were interesting, I needed a better guide to help me understand their roles in this political scandal. Danny Huston just didn't cut it for me. Outside the characters, Sayles needed a stronger script. Sometimes I felt that if I was not deeply rooted in the political world, some references were overhead. The whole reasoning for the Silver City to be built and the corruption behind it has escaped me. I'm a simpleton who loves advanced movies, but this didn't make much sense to me. Several times I found myself asking, "Why" instead of seeing the whole picture. I felt as if the stories were as clear as glass, but the whole picture was dusty and murky. Sayles needed to focus more on the larger image instead of the smaller problems that eventually blurred the movie. Maybe I got into this movie with a bad idea. I expected to see another version of Primary Colors, but instead I witnessed something less cordial and technical. I thought the last scene was one of the most beautiful moments in the history of political film. Brilliant symbolism remained in my mind for the last two days after watching this movie, while the rest of the movie quickly broke away from my mind. Maybe a second tracking would be better for me, but for some strange reason Silver City just didn't click me. There were too many gaps that had never been explained or explained. The chorus piece is always good with me, but when the characters are presented without explanation, they simply lose their pair. That was one of those rare occasions. Overall, I was very upset with this movie. To be very democratic, I wanted to see the political side I didn't know about and the other side that would make you laugh. I wanted to be buried by the world of corporate money and the dufus that are elected. I wanted an intelligent humor framed by George W., but instead I found a very confusing story aimed at a certain audience that I would never be part of. Sad, this image had a much-wasted promise. <br /> <br /> Level: ** outside *****
