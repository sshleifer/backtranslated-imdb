To start this movie was sick. Here your wife is dying and you are walking around the city with this blonde chic. Then your wife dies and within two months you are along with this chic. Hank (James Brolin) is definitely moving fast in this movie. I called him Fast Hank. Fast Hank married this beautiful lady and has sex with his best friends before you know it. The part that gets me is when he "does" it in the barn with Kevin and catches another of Hanks' friends. Kevin gets up and leaves, throws a bathrobe and BAM !! Right in the arms of this other guy and then "they do". I think he's finishing what Kevin started. JAK GROSS !!!! I'm like this is a lifetime movie ??? It's a typical OLD MAN YOUNG WOMAN movie that says you can have my body when I get your money ...
