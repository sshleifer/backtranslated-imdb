Julie Andrews has satirically had her own image of good two shoes in this over-produced musical comedy-drama, but if she approaches her role with praise, she is herself. Blake Edwards's film about a woman who is both a music-entertainer and a German spy during World War I does not know what to focus on, and Rock Hudson has the ungrateful task of playing a romantic second violin. Musicals grew out of favor in 1970, and elephant production as "Star!" and this film really defiled Andrews' reputation, leaving a catalog of dead space in it until "Tamarind Seed" came. I always thought Julie Andrews would make a great villain or shady lady; Her strong voice could indeed attract attention and hit some low notes that may be either impressive or seductive. Edwards realizes this, but neither he nor Julie can handle much energy in this scenario. The screenplay by William Peter Blatty is not a good partner for Edwards, and neither person has a heart in this material. Beatty's script offers Andrews just one wonderful sequence - striptease. * 1/2 from ****
