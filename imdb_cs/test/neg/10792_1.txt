The story has something about white hunters captured by a white women tribe in the African jungle / plains. What it is is wildly dissenting shots of early sounds and silent movies mixed with badly filmed safari shots. There are scenes of a man in a gorilla suit, South Sea natives at sea (used to represent people in the middle of Africa), women in bikinis, a terrible narrative, and a guy in a loincloth with makeup all over the body (racially think insensitive). It's a movie that sits and makes fun, but with lots of alcoholic drinks and funny friends. Anyway, it'll be a chore to get through. It's a bad bad bad movie. Besides, I'm without a word
