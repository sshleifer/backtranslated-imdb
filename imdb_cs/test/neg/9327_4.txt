I hate to admit it, but they were right when they had to throw Schrader out. There is an opportunity to build an atmosphere, draw the audience into the film. It wasn't done. The characters are weak. The story was weak. Direction was very bad. Schrader was out of depth and showing. I have watched it several times in the hope that there will be at least one redeeming function. But no, nothing. The next stage will probably be a remake of the original or hopefully it will be fine. Anyone who wants to know what is the best sequel to The Exorcist should read the 'Legion', written by Blatty, must be the best continuation of the original work that commits to print. Sadly, we were unable to translate the screen very well and I doubt it could ever be. As for the Dominion, Start. Avoid at any cost.
