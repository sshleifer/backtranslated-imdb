I mean, I liked the movie, really, but when it got down, it was too boring. It starts to look promising and even when they get down, the terrible atmosphere and mood is great. The problem is the monster or his lack. As people said it was a stop-motion monster, but that's not a problem (stop-motion can look great if done right). The problem is that we don't see him enough and we don't see any deaths. It's supposed to be a horror movie, so the lack of monsters and the lack of death is like boredom. There were some scenes I liked like one girl using the camera in the dark and the creature coming closer to her. There are also several other scary scenes, but they are too little to keep your interest and definitely not worth watching a movie for. It's a shame, because I see that if it was properly processed, it would be a really creepy fearsome move. The saddest thing is that films like this will never be created again, because filmmakers are re-tuning their films today and relying on the crappy effects of CGI.
