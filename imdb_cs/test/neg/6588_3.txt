The main problem of 9th Company (9 Rota) is that it is not certain whether it wants to be Saving Private Ryan or Full Metal Jacket. Attempts at Spielberg sentimentalism are embarrassing, such as Burley Sergeant, who cries in the field of red flowers !!! The training sequences have no intensity or realism that Kubrick gave them in his masterpiece. Another point is that Afghan warriors are called Ghosts because they strike and are hardly ever seen. Here they attack Russian strong holdings almost in formation without attempting to use the cover. I'm sure the tactic has moved from Waterloo. <br /> <br /> Every scene in this movie has been seen earlier in other war movies and has done much better. I have to ask: Why do all talented players need to chew on a match? Finally, I am always suspicious of a movie that starts without narration. qualify the end. <br /> <br /> "We won!" ... errrr ....... no, no.
