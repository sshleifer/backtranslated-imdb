The fact that this film was distributed free of charge with certain national newspapers I don't care about has, to a certain extent, discouraged me from following it, but as I stumbled upon a copy that the local charity shop was giving for nothing observe with a clear conscience. The film has its moments, Thameside's evocation is pretty done, but I feel that it suffers from a few mistakes. . First, Vinnie Jones is simply not convincing as a journalist. While Vinnie is intriguing in nature, the truth is that he simply does not have the ability to act to withdraw such a role. Secondly, who would carry a lost manuscript that was "invaluable"? Mr. Jones seemed to go with this manuscript everywhere! Third, the whole of Dickens' aspect of the story, although important, is getting into the way that could be an interesting film of high-level corruption. Maybe I'm just a little fat, but I really couldn't see the meaning of the story in the style of Dickens's style. It didn't add anything to the film, and just the fact that things became interesting in a modern story just confused things. The only piece of praise I give to filmmakers is that at least something else has tried. I'm for British independent films trying to be "from the left field" but it's not a "red road" or "this is England". What it is is a bit of a mess and it's over-long on it. Yes, they enjoy it, but in the end it seemed like two movies that joined together to form a whole, and they both failed. (I also can't help thinking that I saw something similar to what I recently did on Ian Banks, set in Edinburgh with a story about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, creator of Sherlock Holmes).
