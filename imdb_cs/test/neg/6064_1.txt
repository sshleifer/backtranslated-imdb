The original body and soul (1947) is a masterpiece. John Garfield, Ann worship, Lilli Plmer, William Conrad, Canada Lee ... and filmed one of the greatest cameramen to ever admire the screen. James Wong Howe. This remake is nasty. Despite the presence of Rod Steiger, Joe Mantegny and Jennifer Beals, there is nothing worthwhile and it is a pity that this product bears the same name as a brilliant original. Only the main character's name, Charlie Davis, is the same in both movies. I don't think there are any redeemable features in this remake. I'm impressed by Rod Steiger's participation. This may be the only bad movie he ever made. Maybe he needed a paycheck.
