I have to admit, I'm disappointed after seeing this movie. I expected much more of the trailers. The film was terrible. He lacked a real story, and acting wasn't the best. Don't waste your time. The movie is not what trailers lead you to think you are. I have to say that I usually don't write anything about IMDb movies (it's actually my first one), but this movie was so disappointing that I registered to let people know they wouldn't waste any time or money. The story of the story is a robbery to happen, and it looks like it has the potential to be good, but the things that are happening in the film are a little far more appealing to be credible. Watch another movie instead, maybe inner man ???
