I did, and I lost two and a half hours of my life, so that I could not regain myself. I honestly have no idea what critics and fans see in this movie. And that's not because I can't appreciate "art." I like a good movie with deep news, great cinematography and great direction. This movie just isn't one of them. My main complaint about this movie is that it's so awfully slow pace until it's bored by its audience to death. On the other hand, the sequence of dialogue goes too fast and there is not enough exposure to let people who did not read the book know what's going on (My mother has pityed me and explained everything before I watched it). Would it kill them if they hire a storyteller? At least for the beginning and the end? <br /> <br /> Let me split it up for you: (Spoilers throughout) <br /> <br /> In the first two minutes you'll be processed into a black screen without the music waiting for a real movie to start. <br /> <br /> For the next minute and a half you'll see a few photos of sunsets and savannah landscapes. Like the audience, they couldn't figure out how to build the scene if they didn't see the shot being three or four times. The next eleven minutes are occupied by monkey monkeys. They fight, see the monolith, fight some other dice. They are probably prehistoric men whose development is influenced by the singing of monoliths. Not that you could tell if you read the book. Finally, we get into space. Only for twelve minutes of vessels that slowly turn into the Blue Danube Waltz (quite fast-tempo-ed waltz as I understand it, but here it feels absolutely agonizing). Finally, we will get some harmless dialogue and somewhat mysterious exposition that the government has not allowed people to land on the moon. We're left with fourteen more minutes of the Blue Danube and spinning ships and neat anti-gravity camera tricks. Next comes four minutes of observation as the ship flies across the surface of the moon and the dock in the space station. We get a little more exposure in the meeting room scene that follows. Then we're out again and we're traveling at a worm pace for over a month. A second monolith is revealed, filling our ears with this terrible ringing again (I had no idea it was real music!). Monolith makes his little light show and then the action jumps forward. Seven Minutes Watching a Boat on Jupiter. At this point, my brains turned into porridge. Could it move slower? Maybe it's "realistic" to portray him as such, but we still don't need to see five or six different shots of the same thing to understand the concept of his "realism". Let me tell you about this "realism" thing; I was encouraged when the figure of a secondary astronaut died. Not because I'm a sadist and I like to watch people die, but because after five minutes I was so angry at the sound of his bloody breath! I want to take care of this character, feel it when she dies! Instead, I found myself in the expectation of a blissful silence no matter how it came. Anyway, now we get to the most interesting part of the movie - the HAL part. Forget David, who is the protagonist of wood. The real star of the show is the coldly impersonal, cool villain, the ruthlessly ruthless guy on the computer. He's great. And the sequence "Open the door under the bay" is amazing. But it's too short. And it's not long before the director falls back into too long. Four Minutes to HAL Death. And he dies, yes. Slowly, painfully, losing intelligence every minute, the voice decreases and slows down, sings "Daisy, Daisy", all with a low and constant hiss that becomes as unpleasant as heavy breathing. Seven minutes Dave enters the monolith. Seven. I could feel my brains melt and drip from my ears! Absolutely nothing seven minutes before a guy killed a psychedelic version of space travel, again with a three-time cursed corps! We have an idea at the beginning of the sequence! Why are you dragging it so long? If he doesn't want LSD users to go psychotically and have flashbacks. I won't even try to explain the end, mostly because I don't have enough. He is probably in an alien research lab and teaches him deep and deep things while he looks at himself as he gets older and older, and then sends him back to earth like a space cosmic baby. None of this in the movie. For everything you know, it's just a sequence of images without any purpose or plot. A lot of the film felt. When I first tried to watch this movie, I gave up in the middle of the road. For the second time, I suffered from this painful apology for the film, it was to help my sister watch how long they had lasted. It's so boring. <br /> <br /> If you wish, call this "film" art. No. In the local museum I saw more interesting "art". And I never subordinate myself to this kind of suffering.
