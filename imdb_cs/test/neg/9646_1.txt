Generally LIKE Sion Sono works, but this film was completely retarded. But unfortunately, it's not retarded enough to be retarded. I just sat, mouth agape, wondering when it would end. The story is just a whisper of meaning. I think it was supposed to be a campsite. Scary Hair Extensions - How Can It Be? But humor like it was. It's not funny. It's not scary. No gory. I'd say maybe Sono was hired on this project, but he seems to have written this boring waste. I have to fill in a few more lines, what else should I say? I suppose I could end up saying better luck next time, Sono-san.
