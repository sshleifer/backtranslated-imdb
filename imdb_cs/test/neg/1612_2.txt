The space disorder sends astronaut Neil Stryker (Glenn Corbett) off the pitch and headed for something parallel to the world called Terra, circling the sun just against Earth. Since a being from the universe would pose a threat to this world order, Stryker is held until a decision can be made about what to do with him. However, Stryker gets suspicions about his surroundings and escapes. With the help of a sympathetic sister and an old scientist who opposes the government, Stryker tries to board the spaceship and return to Earth. Checked in space (or The Stranger, if you prefer) is another of those 70s made for television, which should turn into regular weekly shows. In this case, it is easy to understand why it did not. First there is nothing new about setting up a show. It was undoubtedly suggested to follow the same formula used by Fugitive or The Incredible Hulk or the Planet of Apes. You know, a stranger keeps moving from one city to another with any strange work that a government agency or journalist can watch all the time. It's a formula that was killed. The second shot against Stranded in Space is his lead, Glenn Corbett. Could the guy come across less sympathetic? I took root to catch him. Without sympathy for the main character, this kind of show would never work. Finally, this is supposed to be science fiction. Just because everyone is left-handed and someone has hung three false glances on the horizon, should I come to the conclusion that it is some distant planet? So it's just a coincidence that everybody speaks English, dresses like people on Earth and drives Plymouth Furies? Yeah, right. A single highlight was the inclusion of Cameron Mitchell in the cast. Sure, it's hard to see him in something so horrible, but you know the old saying - every Cameron is better than no Cameron (yeah, I've never heard of it). As with many of these seventies she made films for television, I watched Stranded in Space courtesy of Mystery Science Theater 3000. jokes. So at the end, while I evaluate the 2/10 movie, 3/5 will get a rating scale on my MST3K.
