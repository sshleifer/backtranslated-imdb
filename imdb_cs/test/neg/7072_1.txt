OK, fans, it's on DVD. But the only reason to watch is 1) to say you're (because of your notoriety) or 2) if you're a tough fan of Bill Paxton. I'm not a hardcore BP fan, but it was fun to watch and that was the only thing that kept me from turning it off from total boredom. It's a shame, because it could be a good movie with some script and if someone with some intelligence (and with a cast led by someone except absolutely bad and talented Judd Nelson). Certainly it's rude, but it's BAD, not in a good way. If after reading all the comments about how bizarrely rebellious and dystopically dirty this movie is still interested, do yourself a favor and see some GOOD bizarre revolting dystopian dirt. Films by John Waters, David Lynch, Peter Jackson's "Braindead", Henenlotter's "Trash Case", etc., Everyone comes to mind. There is much better.
