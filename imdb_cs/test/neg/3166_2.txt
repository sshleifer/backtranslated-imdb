It's Valentines Day and we decided to stay in, have a nice dinner, and watch this movie on TCM instead of going out. We're in our forties, fifties, love novels, and we're both softies, but this movie bombed us (it's hard to imagine being nominated for Oscars, etc., but I think it was then). The film was beautiful, but for the most part the film as a whole is terribly dated. Jennifer Jones's character has made so many references to her Eurasion being that we started counting and after a while we giggled every time she said it. Add to the fact that "theme song" has been playing continuously throughout the movie and we couldn't wait to finish it, so we could watch the evening news.
