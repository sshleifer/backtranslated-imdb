Ho humm - - - Nothing more. If you are a longtime fan of Rush, you know what this video contains: the nasty songs of the past, the "BIG 3" hits of the 1980s and their efforts to "last ditch" stay today. They succeed in making fun of themselves by defeating critics to strike themselves as "dinosaurs." * A Unfortunately, they let themselves be protected from embarrassment. The close-ups of their faces complement the fact that these guys were. <br /> <br /> If you were (just like you stomach), the band for a few decades since the 70s, then you know there is no new material. Same old, same OLD: 1) Neil avoids printing, 2) no real backstage (Geddy loses his shoes? Give me a break! Even HE thinks it's ridiculous!) 3) No new insights. Better video would be to show the CREW setting for 3 or 4 hours? let the camera run. And stop changing camera angles every 2 seconds! I understand the director wants to try to do something artificial. But then offer a full version of the 2 or 3 VIEWER shots can choose. Do we know what the band looks like? Let's see what we really want to see. Make BIG a favor: first this movie.
