Well Wright may have done a bold depiction of life around the 1800s - both repeatedly and annually, because when it was written unlike the published one - but it's HIS is not Austen and shouldn't claim to be adaptation. Br /> <br /> Mrs. Bennett looks like a country washing machine. Is it a pampered woman - do they have servants (do you remember the scene with a servant dressed in hair, etc.)? But Wright portrays her with a thick reddish skin across her chest, rough hands, and work in the kitchen. And pigs wander! If he wants a bug, he should try Tess. Mr. Bennett - The script is too plush and modern, ignoring weakness in it. The scene where Mary stops playing should make you cringe - not in seconds. If not - do not include it. MacFadyen is very weak in this section and seems to be doing some kind of Pride by numbers. The first suggestion that looks like a nervous schoolboy rather than a person who overcomes his pride to submit a proposal under his station. Most of his lines, he could also read the shopping list. Lydia is terrible. Totally over the top with too much screaming and skipping. Indeed, Knightley plays Elizabeth more like giggling inane Lydia actually is in the book, occasionally. And Elizabeth. Half of Knightley's time is, clearly, emulating Ehle's voice and intonation - close your eyes to see what a copy is. And in your role, you see Wright's main mistake - BEFORE THE PREJUDICE. From the first meeting with Darcy, he'll be clearly distracted. When she thinks of the attractiveness of women in the hall, Bingley looks initially wounded - not shocked and dishonest. He should set the prejudice side of things. And when she and the "caroline" hover around the room, they come across them as a joke, apparently all around him. And by virtue of cutting out Wickham, you don't understand that Elizabeth has invested enough to create prejudices that look like this relationship. And apparently it's not Caroline Miss Bingley. And Mr. Bingley happily roams into Jane's bedroom. And a - Wright boasts how big he is with what he wants. However, several panoramic shots of rural life (which prefer Hardy) do not excuse him in glaring doubts everywhere. During the film, did he run between Bronte and Hardy - and wasn't the last shot / lighting design from Tess? The need to see Darcy walk through the scape with his unkempt shirt was just stupid. But most importantly, when they go between the two very different countries, they forget the most important thing - Austen. (Laughing loudly at Elizabeth = sad, = rain, running into the picturesque foolish, wet Darcy garbage). <br /> <br /> I confess that I have not seen that it is possible to watch a movie without using it as a context. I was ready to give him some freedom because it had to provide the story in a short time. But to forget one half of the core of the book in prejudice and Darcy, to keep looking like constipation more than proud, has made her almost unnoticeable. I could only see it as a mess with generally bad performances (when Knightley did not deny Ehle that she quarreled or jumped or both, and only calmed down several times to indicate she had a promise - but faffing about swings being passed) emotion is not a substitute for bad scenario and bad direction) - although for some it was just a case of bad scenario. Tom Holland himself would have escaped the conviction. While he mitigated the comic aspects of Collins, he turned in a very interesting approach. Dench has a great schtick he can do in his sleep, whether it's here or in Oscar Wilde - but this was supposed to be Lady Catherine De Bourgh NOT Lady Bracknell. She was just a little healthy. <br /> <br /> A competent script writer would surely manage the shortened length? Not characters filling gaps in the story and helping the audience everywhere. Elizabeth couldn't come up with a Â£ 10k character. And while they wanted to shorten the time when her teaching about Darcy's involvement in Wickhams 'wives' marriage did not coincide with Lydia. It was the worst case of a disparate exposure. It's really scary. Anyone who reviews it and says it works well in the context of a book is someone I honestly don't believe to have read or understood the characteristics of the thing. Wright seems to think his characters are not their behavior in the 1990s. I'm not convinced he read the book - he certainly doesn't understand it. He doesn't understand Austen's acerbic joke or the lightness of touch - he certainly made him a dull movie. Worse, there was a sad pathetic need for chicks who need it. I love you, I love yous everywhere so they can sigh and get off. The fact that he has no place in Austen's work seems to be irrelevant. <br /> <br /> Anyone who rated it as a movie alone? Well, it's harder for me, besides noticing the bad behavior, the weak Darcy and the gurning, who skipped the utter irritation of the whole thing. If you are going to adapt, you can change a lot - but if you lose your spirit and key motivations, then don't challenge the book by taking its name.
