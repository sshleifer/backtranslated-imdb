My Take: A routine political thriller with average action scenes and predictable twists. A rarely seen political thriller who made a very bad response at the box office, I managed to catch SHADOW CONSPIRACY on TV right now, and when I was happy to be content with my curiosity to see it rarely. film, I didn't feel that this film was exceptional. Considering the answer to the box office, SHADOW CONSPIRACY is not as bad as the critics and the public have responded to, but it is still not very good to start and everything from scenario to direction is quite predictable. Charlie Sheen plays a presidential assistant who finds herself captured by murderers and chases (lots of them) when she finds a deadly conspiracy lurking among the White House staff. After being murdered, Sheen assists Amanda Givens, an ex-flame reporter (Linda Hamilton), to help reveal the traitor and unlock the title plot. But this scenario, written by Adi Hasak & Ric Gibbs, is pedestrians coming, not different from other White House plot thrillers like in ABSOLUTE POWER and MURDER in 1600. Some major talents (Donald Sutherland) , Ben Gazzara and Stephen Lang) are trying their best to run the routine, but they rarely save it from the predictability of the script. Not to mention the absurd scene of a toy helicopter that seems too stupid and out of place in this "serious" political thriller. SHADOW CONSPIRACY has its moments I'm sure some of them are much underestimated (director George Pan Cosmatos serves some decent chases of scenes), but none of them pick up this routine thriller, of which there is not much reward or surprise. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of 5.
