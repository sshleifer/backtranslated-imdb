It's not the best movie in the world ???? That was an understatement. Personally, I didn't like this movie at all. Not because of the story, not because of graphic violence and nudity. Nudity really didn't have to be there, nothing for the story, except that the girls were going through rough time, and being naked would probably mess them up. But one of the things in the movie I hated ... was that it was sooooo dark. You couldn't really find out what was going on. I think if it weren't so dark and you saw where they were, then it wouldn't be that bad. All you know is his cellar. You see no house, no way, a killer, all you saw was about half a second. I want to see some things in the movie. Bored after 20 minutes of darkness, everything you see occasionally is a flashlight or a wall. Then you hear the girl sobbing. There was nothing that really wouldn't stick to me, which was good about the movie, maybe about the tension in the first 10 minutes of the movie ... but not about how the movie ends, but the tension ... I see something in this movie, but a couple naked bodies and various flashing lights. But honestly people, it was Saw meets Blair Witch Project wannabes. Both top notch movies, both with proper lighting to find out what's going on. Forget this movie if you can see it .. if your blind person .. you might want to rent it out to hear the screams if your into such things. But then again, if you're blind, your probably didn't read it either .. so anyway ... BAD MOVIE !!!!
