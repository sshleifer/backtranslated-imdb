* Some spoilers * <br /> <br /> This movie is sometimes subtitled "Life forever". This is often seen as a reference to the last scene, but more precisely describes how dead and buried this once estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical distribution. There's "hey, kids, let's go air show" about this telemovie that can be cute in places, some fans will feel like insiders enjoying the picking of all the different looks. Fontana and his friends wrap up with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as with real Baltimore personalities. <br /> <br /> This is at the top of the return of virtually all members of the TV series various casts, your old favorites, as well as later non- There has always been a tow-of-war quality scoring-aware executive producer Barry Levinson, Fontana, James Yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget-conscious NBC managers who simply wanted another Moroccan police procedure like is "Nash Bridges", which regularly beats "murders" in the ratings. The pressure that emerged when the show was reflected in the ravishing realism that the es√°hl his appearance, slim and sensational manner that made it worse. I threw the towel. They took the most ridiculous story of the series, also covering it unlikely and artistically barren innovation and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess at one of the weaker members. In short, some time has passed since the last episode of the show. The former heart of the Baltimore killing unit, Yaphet Kotto as Lieutenant Al Giardello, is now Mayor of Kurt Schmoke and Schmoke himself makes an appearance. But this promising start will immediately and unlikely take a tragic turn. The spotlight moves to Giancarlo Esposito as Giardello's son Mike. A handsome man who did a good job elsewhere, Esposito was one of the pretty faces that appeared late to allegedly revive the TV series. But the question for the audience has always been: is Mike uncomfortable as Gee's son, or is Esposito uncomfortable in this role? To be fair, Esposito has no chance to play the main story without interruption. This is because writers choose this moment to revive another story that flooded the intelligence of the loyal voters of the show. <br /> <br /> The seemingly visible snuff video has been promoted on the Internet and has been featured on the Internet. After some red herring, detectives arrested a repellent suspect. Zaljko Ivanek is an annoyed and overworked prosecutor's representative forgot to file timely and the suspect was released only to be later murdered. To summarize: he forgot to submit paperwork because it was not the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the Attorney General, the Governor, the entire Maryland Legislature, the US Attorney General, NBC, the Judicial Television, New York Times, LA Times, Time magazine, London's The Times, The Economist, Johannesburg Post and Guard, L'Osservatore Romano, Le Figaro, Paris Match, L'Equipe and Computer World they did not say every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case. However, an old gang of detectives and associates returns to Baltimore to help him. There's enough talent on the display. Unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogue to be distributed, some of them are only on display. Two of the most powerful actors, Clark Johnson and Melissa Leo, are criminally underutilized, while the time spent on Jon Seda and Michael Michelle could be better spent on advertising. The writers seem to satirize it, presenting Jason Priestley as the last big store detective. On the other hand, they give an easy-to-come, easy-to-go Michelle Forbes highly influencing scene. There is some other crafty casting, with the current Lt. Gary D'Addario, the center of the book raised the show and played another detective. Guests leave other shows, such as Whitney Allen, who is doing her corpse and clueless "Miss Sally" from the "Oz" beloved inmates show. Dina Napoli from WBAL TV appears alone. <br /> <br /> Although fun, they can be distracting. Ed Begley Jr. actually progressing the story in his short appearance, playing Dr. Victor Ehrlich from Fontana's "St. He is still alive and fits into the hospital environment. Then you remember that St. Elegius was an autistic fantasy of a boy? <br /> <br /> The most useful show reflects corporate synergy. This movie was made when Court TV bought a re-run right for the show. This network contributed legal waif Helen Lucaitis, who had an interview with the murder team and later appeared on "Oz". The TV correspondent has an effective work that summarizes the news, that is, the plot points for late arrivals. Although so thin that he disappears when he turns to the side, Lucaitis also adeptically manages a bit of physical comedy with Esposito. In scenes with Lucaitis she shows more juice than with one of his usual colleagues. Maybe these two should do a spin-off. <br /> <br /> As the film turns down, the cream cast rises to the top. Even though they are saddled with a defeated scenario, Andre Braugher and Kyle Secor will overcome this. Their performances remind the audience of what made killing, the great stretches, the best show in the air and one of the best TV productions ever. It's fun to watch top professionals doing their stuff; it's just a pity that this movie doesn't give them a better chance. Die-hard fans may want to see this movie as well, but you can live without it.
