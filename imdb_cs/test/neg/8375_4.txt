I realize that the line on my summary is not very polite. This film, written and directed by Scott Caan with Giovanni Ribisi, Don Cheadle, runs for 88 minutes. In this puppy movie is a dog. It's cute. The film opened in two American theaters at the end of April 2007, one week & grossed all $ 914. on DVD at the beginning of August 2007. <br /> <br /> Before turning off the DVD, we were only able to take about 40 minutes. <br /> <br /> This type of movie was played in the lower half of the double account.
