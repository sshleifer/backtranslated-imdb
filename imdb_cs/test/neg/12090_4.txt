I wanted this one - the situation was rich and setting unusual and interesting. But the story is flooded with childish female gothic romantic elements that are hard to swallow. The director is unfairly biased towards "goy" characters - content that allows them to be grotesque cartoons - and inexplicably benevolent to the hero's domestic behavior. The potentially interesting power struggle between the inventor and the governess is not really solved. Feminist filmmakers will gain more credibility when they stop manipulating situations so that all heroin sympathies start and act honestly. with problems. This film is more like "The 7 Pieces of Gold", another serious failure, more than "The Piano" - a true passion story.
