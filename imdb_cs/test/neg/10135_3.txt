Ik know that you can't keep all the details of the book in the movie. But this movie has changed almost everything without any reason. In addition, many changes have made the story illogical. Some examples: 1) in the movie "Paul Renauld" he really encounters Poriot before he dies (he gets only a letter in Poirot), tells him he's afraid to kill himself. This is absolutely stupid, because if the Renauldy plan succeeded, Poirot would know that the dead man would not be Renauld (Poirot was in the morgue when Mrs. Renauld identified the victim). 2) The film "unites" two people into one! "Cinderella" was removed by film. Girl Hastings falls in love and ex-girlfriend Jack Renauld is one person in the movie! Why for God? 3) Hastings discovers that victims are such a bad golf player. Totally indecent and stupid. 4) The film tells the secret too early (for example at the very beginning). So you know what you shouldn't know. 5) The murderer is shot at the end by a person who does not exist in the book. Perhaps because the person ("Cinderella") who stops the killer does not exist in the film. 6) The book is very complicated. The film takes only about 90 minutes. It is clear that it is difficult to include all the necessary details, but it is impossible for you to include stupid things that were not in the book and have no meaning (eg Cycling Race).
