Solomon and Sheba descended into the Hollywood tradition, not because of the quality of the film, but because Tyrone Power died in production. I was in grade 5 and I remember the huge news all the days of the tragedy. I didn't know who Tyrone Power was, but I learned and learned to evaluate the body of his work. I often wonder if you had the movie about this movie and what it did. He was also an unnamed producer. Maybe he didn't want to face critics. Good thing Power actually came out with a witness for prosecution, even if you can see it in long shots when you look closely. Here we have a biblical stew that would probably shock the great Solomon himself. Several of the incidents described in the Bible that the Bible treats separately are woven together into one conspiracy with several additions that Hollywood threw. The real story of Sheba's queen is that she went on a business mission to the Israeli kingdom, talked to Solomon a little, came back with lots of business and that was it. The story of romance between her and Solomon is a legend. The ancient kingdom of Sheba is about where Yemen is now and its people have moved to the African continent, the way Ethiopia was founded. child, nor did he deal with the construction of the first temple. Nor was it for destruction. For it was not Solomon. And she was not involved in the succession dispute when Solomon's brother Adonijah counterclaimed. This is the core of this film. Adonijah, when he heard the news that King David was dying, declares himself king. Of course, David temporarily meets and says that God has come to him and told him that Solomon should succeed. When David hears about what Adonijah did, he says that what God bent out of form is Adonijah greedy. After Adonijah gets to conspiracy. Things seem to have come true in that Ty Power collapsed on a duel while dueling George Sanders like Adonijah. Sanders and Power have been rivals in many films, especially at London's Lloyds, a breakthrough role in Power. If Sanders is not the exhausted sophistication he had in Samson and Delilah, it is still Sanders' biblical cad. When Power died, Yul Brynner was brought into Solomon's play and got a wig so that the existing Power of the Long Shot could be rescued. Brynner is investing a dialogue with dignity, but I think he probably regretted barking. . She seems to have no real conviction and my guess is that she was shocked by the sudden disappearance of power and had to do it again. Marisa Pavan as Abishag can give the best performance in the film. The real story with Adonijah is not as complicated as this movie. He and Solomon have disputed the inheritance and gathered around a group of some King David judges as supporters. Solomon forgave them once and Adonijah asked for Abishag in marriage. Abishag in the Bible and here was the adopted daughter of King David in his old age. When Solomon hears this, he decides that Adonijah is again greedy and killed him. The Bible mentions someone called Berniah, who basically went on contractual hits on Adonijah followers. What we have in the movie is a magnificent peak that includes the miracle I've been looking for and I couldn't find. It comes from the fertile imagination of King Vidor, who ended a long and prominent career on sour note. It was a question of Vidor, who tried to make Cecil B. DeMille a biblical spectacle. He didn't do it.
