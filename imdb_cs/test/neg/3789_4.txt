This opens up corporate credits that inform us about the World International Network. I knew I had seen how I had seen this company before, but I couldn't remember where, but I knew it was the beginning of a really bad movie I saw so I was seriously thinking about changing channels. on other channels, which is one of the problems of being an IMDB reviewer. What the hell I thought it wouldn't really matter if WANTED is good or bad because I am still unable to review for this site. <br /> <br /> As I expected WANTED it wasn't all good. It's a conspiracy I've seen so many times (too many times) before I put a refugee on the run, a bit like the INCREDIBLE HULK TV series without the shirt being torn. Jimmy crosses the crowd in a fancy way and goes on the run and works in a fancy way at a Catholic reform school. Did you notice the description you used in the last sentence? The answer is "completely invented". Let me reiterate that it is a completely fictional film where everything relies on coincidence. Another problem I had was a church-led reform school - it is too compassionate and kind, I was convinced that these types of devices cause Alcatraz to look like a country club, I say it's a fact, but when a head priest looks like as a spitting picture of Donald Rumsfeld, you feel a great deal of sugar coating is happening. <br /> <br /> To be honest despite the ridiculous conspiracy twists, etc. WANTED is not a really bad thriller, though it is also very good. I never had the urge to turn it off no matter how it happened, which is under the compliment of the film
