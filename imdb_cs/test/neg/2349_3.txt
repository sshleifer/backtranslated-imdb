No matter what someone says, his b-movie, and the effects are badly done .. if you're a vampire fanatic, I think it would be okay, no 10 out of 10, you others here can't honestly mean that. We have to see it as a movie, not read like a book, so the effects and characters are important as well as the story. The story is good, but it doesn't carry a movie, it's no wonder it has a low rating over everyone. I write it because I decided to see this movie when I saw some good reviews here on IMDb but got seriously disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I thought the blade movies were amazing and loved the underworld movies, but these characters aren't close. Make up for vampires is wrong and the effects are worse. This is shit. Maybe I wasn't so disappointed when I didn't read reviews that told me how great it was. Reviewers must have something to do with a production company or something, seriously, if you think it's amazing, you don't care about playing or adding. that's better than a book. 3 out of 10 for the story OK.
