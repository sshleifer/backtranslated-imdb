When I finished reading a book "One of a kind" a week ago, I thought, "That would make a great movie, especially now that there is little to learn about poker and poker players." I was totally shocked to find her last night while browsing the video store. I had no idea someone actually turned it into a movie. I immediately caught him and watched with great anticipation. What a significant drop! All interesting things about Stu Ungar were quickly crawled and instead I stayed with biopic, which could be about everyone. Ungar may have been a burned-out jerk, but he was also a brilliant thinker who could instinctively read people. That made him so fascinating. Why not focus on it? And talk about watering the real truth. This guy was all over absolutely everything: drugs, women, gambling, starvation, sleep-deprivation. He was playing sports events from dusk to dawn, losing himself for days, while hung in cracked flocks, his body constantly out of balance, and yet, if he ever needed money, he could only beat anyone who would play cards. Now it's a story! Too much time spent on his childhood and personal relationships (although his ties to "Vincent" and his daughter were hardly touching) and hardly anything about his drug use (which was exorbitant), his insane gambling and its incredible ability to play cards. It's probably too late, but I hope somebody remakes this movie properly. I had no problem with Imperioli. It's excellent. The script left him nothing interesting to say.
