Senseless browsing done in a confused amateur and awkward way - or maybe a few, because of the incredible lack of continuity, tone, realism, credibility, tension, and much more associated with Walter Pidgeon's attempts at enchanting Scottish curiosity with some of Fritz Lang's great failures. (I thought the German ambassador actually played Lang, but apparently not - they could have been twins.) If you can't predict the end of several time zones, you're not really alive. I was eagerly awaiting this DVD and was totally surprised and disappointed with such a terrible stupidity (even with George Sanders and John Carradine - maybe I can wash my mind by watching Viaggio instead in Italy and more than twelfth time). Who wants to use DVD once? (There may be a movie to be made about making this horrible movie and how many talented people could be wasted so completely.)
