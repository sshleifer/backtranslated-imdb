OK, so this movie is fine. He has a good direction, but the simple fact is that he undermines what all gay and lesbian people have been fighting for all these years. Straight man "choose to be gay" and gay man "Decide to be straight" I get it up to the last 20 minutes, after I really offended. What usually happens in these films is played by the main cast actors and out-of-the-box gay actors out. Leadership is played by pretty men, but don't let the fact of being a movie leave you unfulfilled. All the romances and relationships you hope will not happen. Unless you are a priest who is in that case, God blesses a woman who heals our hummus.
