During the fifties and sixties, seventies and seventies, war films were made in former Yugoslavia to celebrate the "guerrillas" heroism? civilians who fought the guerrilla war against the invading German forces. Hajrudin Krvavac, who is generally known only in Eastern Europe, has directed several of these "guerrilla" stories; Unfortunately, only a few have ever been exported to the rest of Europe and the United States. The "Battle of the Eagles" is a rare, low-budget view of the formation and exploitation of guerrilla air force. Heaven over Yugoslavia. A group of former pilots are joining forces with two small biplanes and starting to attack enemy bases and convoys; In the course of several months, more pilots and aircraft joined the ranks, which eventually created an impressive air force. Maybe it's history, or maybe it's a fable ?? No matter what it is, it's certainly not convincing, but casting great actors is definitely trying to make it work. The film opens with a well-shot German raid on defenseless guerrillas. The nuts and bolts of the conspiracy come together almost instantly, and the audience is treated for a short while with a patriotic series of scenes. Then the action begins and this title quickly becomes another low budget adventure. All characters are familiar clich√©s: Major Dragan (played by well-meaning Bekim Fehmiu) is our typical patriot, the hero leading man. He departs on aircraft with a machine gun and even has an air combat with the bad guys Klauberg (Radko Police), which is a totally predictable and oblique peak with the same predictable result. The rest of the guerrillas are known: Ljubisa Samardzic ("The Battle of Neretva") is Zare, playshot playshot; Bata Zivojinovic ("Hell's River") is Voss, a veteran leaflet that comes out of wood when his country needs it; and Rados Bajic ("The Day That Shattered the World") is Dalibor, a young messenger who moves between the ranks and eventually becomes an experienced combat pilot. Characters and their stories are known to all war fans and Krvavac is not trying to build on these stereotypes. The cast has a fair job, despite a two-dimensional scenario, each player is engaging and entertaining to watch. Especially Bajic has some great moments? when he takes his first flight as a shooter, and later when he is forced to land the plane after the pilot is killed. The plot consists only of a series of raids against the Germans and subsequent reprisals. <br /> <br /> Krvavac handles action sequences competently with a mix of real shots and miniature effects. Unfortunately, thumbnails are so cheap and untrue that the transitions between real aerial photography and toy aircraft are unpleasant and laughing. Some scenic and bombardment scenes look shocking, while fights involving scale models, complemented by action figures, are simply pathetic. Sometimes there are so many clouds of "machine guns" that the smoke is absorbed by the entire model aircraft. Worse, editors often overlap images of fighters over actual shots. Although the aircraft is usually in the right perspective, it is surrounded by disturbing radiation that prevents any attempt at realism. All these actions are set to incredibly familiar and annoying Bojan Adamic scores. The "Battle of the Eagles" also suffers from a very poorly edited English version. To start, 28 minutes shots are missing ?? cutting the film from 130 minutes to just 102. Missing segments were carelessly cut and the cutting looked very careless. The musical cues are suddenly cut off and the scenes are abandoned before they are resolved. In the last third of the film, the story is falling apart and only a few badly needed action scenes can try to save it from utter incomprehensibility. Then there is dubbing? all scenes revolving around Partisans are dubbed in English (somewhat miserable, however), yet several lengthy scenes remain in German, without the benefit of headlines. The film could make much more sense if the German language sequences were removed instead of the key scenes that revolve around the guerrillas. On the plus side Krvavac handles outdoor shots pretty well. There is never a moment when viewers feel like on the sound stage. In particular, the German Luftwaffe bases are extensive, complemented by dozens of Messerschmitt fighter planes and accessories in leather aircraft costumes. The scenery is crisp and the green and bloodworthy are not afraid to shoot scenes with an extremely wide angle or from a distance to simply express the extent of a battle or a long trek. The German advance of the guerrilla unit soon stands out as well as the sequences where Zare and Dalibor escape from the enemy base. As in the home video, "The Battle of the Eagles" is just another of the many stories about the Yugoslav partisan movement. There is nothing to distinguish it from the rest of the crop, and terrible special effects and drastic editing have pushed it below the allowable value. Try to avoid this if you don't find a full-length copy.
