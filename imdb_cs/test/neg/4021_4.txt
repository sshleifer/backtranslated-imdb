I saw about half a dozen of a number of low-budget poor ranks of B westerns that Ken Maynard made in the 1930s, and I'm constantly impressed by how poor the actor was. How did he ever become a leading cowboy actor? It is said that he could do quite well in those quiet rides, but he won't do anything in these later sound movies. Still, maybe he got into the lead because he was big and could ride. Phantom Rancher isn't as bad as some of the other Ken Maynard movies I've seen, but it's still not much. Some other characters refer to him as "a young fella" several times, where he seems to be as old as other older actors. And if it's not stupid enough, the script problem is quite significant in this movie. At one point, one of the characters makes a note of how the phantom has prevented the well from being poisoned, something that hasn't happened yet. A few minutes later we'll see the scene. No, it wasn't a flashback. At first I might have thought that when Treeline Films was making a DVD transmission, they could turn two of the cylinders. But in those days the film reels contained about 11 minutes of film and the entire turnover was only about 3 or 4 minutes. Everything else was in logical order. Looks like it was a real problem of continuity in the original film. Maybe that's one of the reasons Colony Pictures didn't last long.
