I have always looked at the efforts of the Italian horror Maestro Daria Argento as a producer with some suspicion and these were only confirmed after my rather recent observation of the terrible DEMONS Lambert Bava (1985); the fact that it was supposed to be his third installment does not sound promising at all, but I decided to give the film a lease no matter that we are in full Halloween swing. Did I show a theater trailer on Anchor Bay DVD anchor before showing the main feature? undeniably remarkable visuals interested me to be sure, but then the film (which doesn't make more sense than what is presented in that fearsome two-minute cut, and in retrospect it can be seen that it wisely built most of its peaks) is definitely released! With a hopeful opening with a medieval prologue from Alexander NEVSKY (1938), it goes downhill quickly because it relies too much on surrealistic images at the expense of narrative. As a result, a few characters randomly in the center? with the unbearable male leadership that succumbed to the dark forces soon, a sinister-looking bishop (Feodor Chaliapin), who resulted in a mere red herring, a mysterious black priest who gradually assumed heroic qualities, is for any reason sacrificed by a goat. a shaped demon (culminating in a sexual ceremony conducted in front of other bodybuilders raised too obviously from ROSEMARY'S BABY [1968]) and a reasonably impressive 13-year-old Asia Argento as a rebellious but sympathetic daughter (who appears to end). Incidentally, Elder Argento, along with director Soavi, wrote a film story and screenplay (under a pseudonym after apparently falling with Darius in the early stages of production), the original Lamberto Bava helmer and the prolific genre scribe Dardano Sacchetti (whom I met at the 61st Venice Film Festival) in the year 2004). The extremely confused second half of the film then sees a group of people? including the inevitable teenagers, but also the courageous English couple (whose constant bickering is given to the fun ugly punchline)? similarly close inside the building in the handle of evil spirits (the church is the burial place of Satanic cult) ??? not that this horror trip is likely to scatter the memories of the surrealist subgenus Luis Bunuel EXTERMINATING ANGEL (1962) you see! Eventually, the film is all the more disappointed (though Sergio Stivaletti's terrible effects, at least, are notable) given that I have thoroughly enjoyed a single other Soavi title I watched ??? CEMETERS MAN (1994), owned by DVD DVD SE. That means I still like to catch his debut? FRIGHT PHASE (1987) ?? and the sequel directed by THE THE CURCH, entitled THE SECT (1991) ...
