The title exactly describes it. This dribbling movie was nothing more than a typical group of teenagers who accidentally killed someone when they were haunted / killed 20 years later. The only twist is the site of an angry former classmate or a nice psycho / loser, it was a nun. Nun wants to remove sin from girls, blah blah, girls accidentally / deliberately drown nun, blah blah, nun haunted girls, people die, film ends. All that made this watch was scenes of death that were pretty cool (especially the one that had the elevator doors that tore off the ladies' thick arm), but they couldn't have made it a great movie. Brian Yuzna should hang his head to join this refusal. I'm sure I rented it and didn't buy it, or I'd be frantic for faith. If you want nunsploitation to please the senses, go watch Demonia or something. Stay away from this waste.
