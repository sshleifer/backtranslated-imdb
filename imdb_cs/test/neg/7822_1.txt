I've never seen a movie that upset me so much. It's a movie about stupid people doing stupid and terrible things. It's not a funny movie. I have to say that the storyline is terrible. I didn't have the patience to watch that I saw only half, but that was enough. The characters are not very inspired. Just awful. This film is about a goofy guy trying to connect with his tyrannical daughter. When she finally talks to her, she asks him to go to his home that night to watch his father's owl, and he thinks she invited him to go to her party with her at 6pm . He gets a very disappointed finding that he has to take care of the owl and that he has a friend. After her father leaves home leaving the exact orders to care for the house and his beloved bird, a secretary, a fallen son and everything that is not funny will appear in the house. But at last he will join his boss's daughter. TRUST ME THIS FILM IS TERRIBLE !!!!!!!!!!!!
