I watched this movie so you don't have to! I appreciate Kris Kristofferson very much, but what did he think? Did he do it for scale? <br /> <br /> At least the title of the movie tells the truth in advertising because people and objects usually disappear throughout the film, which contributes to confusion. Kristofferson mentioned it in his comment that he wasn't even sure Genevieve Bujold's character really existed. This does not mean anything good for the viewer who is able to follow the story! The "creation" function was much more interesting than the film itself. It examines the cobbling difficulties together funding for India even when the movie is shot. <br /> <br /> To his credit, this film is visually pleasing and is by no means looking like a movie with just slightly over 1M. Too bad money wasn't spent on a better project.
