There have been times in the United States when everything was possible on film, so rough movies, horror movies and explicit scenes came. The best known are Forced Entry and Waterpower, but of course they were made with a little budget. Everything was shown in 42nd place in New York, but hey, there were other grindhouses that didn't show any budget. An example of this is Wet Wilderness. After a while, the underground scene, so the copies were available, but as seen in other reviews, some copies were suddenly cut at the end. But the version I watched was complete. Well, I would call it porn again, and then rough, he's a serial killer, but he likes to look at others who have sex instead of killing them when he kills, he does it off screen. Acting is the worst I've ever seen. And I guessed that the so-called actors didn't like what they were doing, for example, at the beginning when we have a lesbian scene, we watch one girl stop playing and pull his pubic hair off and then go on what's going on or when the mother goes on black man, daughter sitting in grass upset ants! But this is the story that made this one famous, incest and racism is what it made famous. When they look at blood, two girls sitting there waiting for a cue to make it work, God is worse, but it doesn't matter if you're in sleaze and grindhouse. Make sure you have the full version.
