First of all, I have to say that I have read everything about this topic and I know it is from the inside, and I was also excited to finally see it. But you only have to read the book that this mini-series assumes is not the real story of what happened almost 90 years ago. It's freely based on facts, the rest is taken from the scriptural imagination. Unfortunately, these changes are only successful and mostly unnecessary. <br /> <br /> Where to start? Vita and Violet did not use the names of Mitya and Lushka until their affair had begun, and during it, the violet called Vita Dmitri and Julian. It was Violet that Vita chased with a dagger when they were teenagers. The "Seduction" scene when their affair began with Violet was much more passive than featured here, and certainly not kissed Vita first. I could go on and on, these examples were all included when the series was just started. In addition to all these changes in facts, characterization is also bad. Vita sometimes behaves like a mad woman. Especially the scene where she saw Violet from the newspaper announcement is just ridiculous. Vita kept the excitement of emotion inside. It was purple that was lively and left her feelings (good or bad) to show. Everything Vita did when she read it was that she almost fainted, that's all. Being subtle, Harold avoided real-life confrontations, but here he is sometimes strict and accusatory. Harold and Vita always discussed their intimate stuff with letters, not verbally. And Violet ... I know this series has deliberately focused on Vita and Harold, but that doesn't mean that all the other characters must be mere puppets on the sidelines. Here is a totally one-dimensional character and the lines given to it are mostly shallowly embarrassed. In fact, she was an intelligent, gifted, quite extraordinary woman who rarely gave the credit she deserved. I've always considered her a more interesting person than Vita. In this series, her misfortune, loneliness, and her mother's problems are completely ignored. The Viewer also has a clue about his background and family, what relationship (and marriage) with Denys Trefusis she had or how hard she fought for Vita. Vita was the only love of her life, her raison d'etre, and if Harold suffered during the affair, so did Violet. After her, her life was in ruins and it took some time to pull back. The statue could act as Denys, that much of the depth of his character. Lady Sackville-West is just a badly drawn cartoon; annoying shack with an exaggerated French accent. The series ends in a totally badly written scene in Amiens, and according to the writer, it was the end of the matter. No, this year continued all year and its end was much longer lasting and sadder than what was presented here. But what cares about the stupid end if the whole series was stupid from the beginning. I have to give some appreciation to the actors, trying to make the most of the roles they've been given, though Janet McTeer as Vita is the only one who really shows through. Nor can we complain about the settings. All complaints are directed to the director and, above all, to the screenwriter. There are too many sexual scenes and conversations instead of sharp studies of characters. Many scenes are too long, some are meaningless, and nothing in the story. On the other hand, many details are shortened or omitted altogether. In particular, there should be more information about Vita and Violet's youth and how their friendship has evolved. This is one fascinating story that deserves a much better adaptation. Maybe someone will do it once. At this point it is possible to make this story much more by reading the real book or the purple letters Vita, which are brilliant.
