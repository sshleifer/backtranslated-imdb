Jon Goe's wife (just one of the worst movie titles ever), or Red Right Hand (another absolutely horrible sounding title that doesn't mean anything and has no meaning for the film) under which I saw it is set in 'Salem, Massachusettes 1978 '(by the way, the year I was born, which was probably the best thing that could have happened during those 365 days) when five old college friends gathered for a school reunion, gay-boy bassoon Roger Mather (John Kuntz, it's a surname for Say It Loud ...), Martha Alden (Kim Brockington), Rebecca Lawson (Jenna Stern) and her boyfriend Jake Stabler (John Doe), Alan Hobbes (Michael Kevin Walker) and his wife Sandy (Megan Rawa) plus John Good (Marc Ardito, why is the spelling "John" different in the title?) And his wife Sara (Abigail Morgan). From the word go there is a nervous tension in the air and when someone mentions their 'missing' friend Calef (Jason Winther) a lot of unpleasant memories comes flooding back. Then comes telephone calls, mysterious nose bleeding, hallucinations and guilt as a real horror of events that all these years finally came to light ... <br /> <br /> Produced, executive producer and director Kurt Gioscia who also wrote the case and Kurt St. Thomas who gets the art direction credit also if if it wasn't enough they both act in the movie as well! Personally, I thought that John Good's wife was terrible, I think she couldn't cook anything! Ha ha ha, just a joke! Seriously, even though I didn't think much of a movie at all, it's a rather slow progress to start with, and the entire first 30 minutes is a solid snooze of reunification material that consists of many catch-ups about every other and boring nature of building exposure. The film never explains what is wrong with those strange bleeding noses for God's cause, mysterious calls, the almost insignificant death of one of the groups that might or may not be natural and what the hell was Sara? Coming like some curious, sex-crazy, dirty story, a shameless, bitter blackmailing know-it-all slut who seems to be sleeping with every man she meets! Some of the dialogues that spew out would not be in place in porn & it just seems to conflict with the rest of the movie that plays more like a drama than a horror / thriller it should have been. Then there's the end, if there is a worse way to end the movie, then just leave virtually everything that hangs in the air without any closure I've never seen before. The whole thing was also very predictable, I think anyone who follows it will not know that when everyone mentioned their friend, Calef went "missing", wouldn't it be more? Directors of Gioscia & Thomas make an angry movie, in addition to predictability and unpleasant climax, there is a retrospective narrative of Alan, which I simply do not understand, because it is no more or less important than anyone and at what point in the story? The reasons for this narrative are never clear or elaborated. There is no tension because of the whole thing, so would-the-numbers. Technically, the movie is fine, but nothing special and some of the places and clothes didn't look particularly authentic to me, it never convinced me to take place in the late 70s. Acting was fine and what actor John Kuntz surname? I think if his wife were standing next to him, we could describe them as a Kuntz pair, right? I really didn't think much about Jon Goo's wife (the doll with the blow up would be Ha ha ha) & I'm not sure who to appeal to. Forget all the gore, the horror, the violence, the fear, the atmosphere or the excitement, in fact, forget everything that this movie would be watching because it isn't here. Not recommended.
