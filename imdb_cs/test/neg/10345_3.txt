The idea of ​​Dead Silence is great: a zombie focus takes place during a paranoid radio show. There was so much about this movie. Unfortunately, once the zombies have made their appearance, everything has been lost. The film is ridiculous and only those who have a passion for kitschy, b-flick horror will enjoy it. Zombies were soooo stupid! They ran past their hands. They looked like a bunch of people attending a haunted house at elementary school. <br /> <br /> I know this is a brief overview, but I don't see the need to invest a lot in it. It's a silly movie. You were warned.
