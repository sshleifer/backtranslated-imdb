This film has a lot of freedom with familiar historical facts. Even small things like Flynn lick one stamp after another when he almost certainly uses a damp sponge is one of the unpleasant things. Flynn never tried to kill or murder. It is not known that he would catch his mother to make love to another man, and he is not known to have a gay relationship with anyone and did not end up in a Sydney loop. Inpo Wake of the Bounty did not play his double role as an imitation, and this role did not turn him into a well-dressed movie star. <br /> <br /> It's just the average movie that Errol Flynn was deployed to sell more tickets and more videos.
