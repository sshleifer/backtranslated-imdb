I had great hopes for this after reading earlier reviews, but it was so slow and storyline so basic that I wondered if I read bad reviews. Please, the boy meets the girl next to each other at 11 and both try to love and be a basketball legend. Part of yourself, but watch others evolve. Guess what! Both get scholarships at the same university and become lovers again until his father is caught playing around with a younger woman. Our young hero, who was unable to cope, disappeared in court concentration, but how he decided to go for the studio and fail, and guess what the Lakers had raised. He interprets the heroine because she wasn't in this emotional period. So for 5 years they go their own way. She is returning from Spain when she lost her appetite and our hero got married in two weeks. Mum tells her she should fight for her love to challenge her ongoing love and invite him to a basketball shootout. He wins by marrying her that he loves her. Well he won, but he decided to throw another girl out for our girl. The end plays basketball and has children's duties. I'm sorry 2 is my high score. My partner who scored 0 for a soap story for those who read Mills and Boon
