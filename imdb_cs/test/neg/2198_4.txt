Computational. Can something be boring? He sits in the front of the computer all day and writes down some keys every day. This is a big deal with this movie, the heroine sits in front of the VDU by tapping the keys and no matter how many upset appearances he gives, or how many exciting notes the strike composer or how many extreme close ups the director uses, not much excitement about the fact There are few things less exciting than watching someone on the computer <br /> <br /> There are a few other problems too many of them have material errors when it comes to working computers. Is it possible to break into a computer that is off and not connected to the Internet? I think that when NET was created ten years ago, very few people would understand how computers work, so screenwriters would be able to BS in length, but because we now live in a global village where almost every household in the Western world has its own computer the audience is certainly very angry about the material mistakes of this movie. And, of course, there are too many cases where someone behaves stupidly or out of character in decisive times to advance in history that makes NETU a very average movie
