I remember seeing the first Underdog trailer last March. Sure it was a cheesy idea, but I really thought at a time when the concept could work, damn it couldn't be any worse than disappointing Cats and Dogs wouldn't it? Then in December, and suddenly, I remembered the movie that I realized was likely to make the film suck. to make the film good. I still swallowed my feelings and I went to watch a movie with a friend today as I entered the screen I was dead, it was the first time I ever saw a movie with a friend and were just two on the screen! I didn't know a bit about what I wanted to endure. The underdog, to be blunt, is terrible, it really is. Imagine how badly you might think this movie is and then get ready for the film even worse, that's just a pathetic movie. Although it aims to entertain children, it seems to be an embarrassing mess that seems to be an insult to children rather than enjoying the movie. Things can't help the fact that the story is out of focus, acting is generally poor, and the movie just feels like too long, tired and downright boring Saturday cartoon! After a short five minutes, when I thought the movie could be clear, the movie suddenly seems to die and then limp towards the already signed final. I'm just amazed that the movie was actually ever released, it's embarrassing for Disney, the hell half of their straight video is better than this! What's even more scary is the fact that the end leaves room for continuation! So you can get into acting (joint cracks). Well, let me be honest Jason Lee is decent, his voice suits the dog, and if he got a decent script, he could do an executive job. However, with such a modest scenario, it seems to disappear. In many ways, it reminded me of Bill Murray in Garfield, Murray did what he could with what he had, but what wasn't enough to make it clear. Then we get to the human actors, but also to the most cruel ones. Alex Neuberger plays friend Underdog, Jack. My biggest concern is that someone would take him seriously in bankruptcy. The scene where he gets to fly with Underdog is perhaps the most beautiful scene in recent years, just because his acting is so poor. I never once thought he was a real man, in fact a part of me is still convinced that the robot was specially made for this movie! James Belushi seems to be half dead in the movie, has nothing to do with him, no decent lines, seems to roam around the set and waits to become relevant to the storyline that writers are trying to do, but the wrong way to laugh about it. Fortunately, Peter Dinklage is one of the film's redeeming factors, as brilliant as dr. Barsinister, and he seems to be laughing. He steals every scene he is in, though it is hardly difficult to share the screen with extremely annoying Patrick Warburton. The rest of the cast is even worse, especially Taylor Momsen, she just needs to end her acting career right now! Underdog also fails dramatically when it comes to providing something like a funny scene. When the funniest scene involves Underdog biting a can and causing the dog food to explode wherever you know there's something seriously wrong. This could be easily ignored if the film had a decent event or a good story, unfortunately the film is worse in both of these terms. The effects are so cheap that every scene where Underdog flies seem absurd, and the dog uses its power so little that you often forget that it has superpowers. What is the point of making a super dog movie if a damn dog never seems super? The final struggle also derives from embarrassment purely because its ten minutes of nothingness, dog flies, other things happening, some things are denying something, all that is irrelevant because it is happening for the sake of things that are happening. The scenario is also at best uncertain and the worst is downright painful. When someone says, "Look at his plane, not his dick, his frog ...", yes, you read it right, I wanted to crack there. Actually, I wanted to go out stayed forced to find out if it could get lower than this point, it happens near the end, so fortunately it isn't. Total Underdog is becoming the worst movie of 2008 for this early period, and is actually just as bad as the last years of Epic Movie. Fortunately for Underdog, Meet the Spartans will come soon and expect it to get worse. So if you didn't get my point review, avoid the movie at all costs, if you want to see a movie with a dog then watch cats and dogs, buy a real dog if needed, just don't see it!
