*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** HERE ON THE COUNTRY / (2000) 1/2 * (OF 4) <br /> <br /> Mark Piznarski is "here on Earth" holding a record for a movie containing the most recycled material in 96 minutes. There is something everywhere that is happening, a cliché and a well-known element of conspiracy; it is simply nothing unique, original or fresh. God, what we can go through; I wish I could see the film during his theatrical release last year to earn on my worst list. This is the kind of film where the story itself immediately manifests itself, and goes downhill from the opening credits and the worst of all is taken seriously. "Here on Earth" is clearly one of the most horrible, painful films that will be withdrawn from pike at some point. "Here on Earth" is a movie for teenagers, so it must include some Hollywood movies. The most prized young men who are so attractive and inexperienced to take a role in a film as bad as this one. Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett are well suited to differing in description and take on leading roles. Klein plays Kelley, an arrogant and cheeky student with a rich father (cliché number one). He is a graduate as a valedictorian and attending Ivy League College following in his father's footsteps (Stuart Wilson). This creates a cliché "I do not want my life" in which the father tries to control the life of his son, while the son resists resistance. Throw Kelley's dead mother who committed suicide. When his father brings another woman home, he brutally challenges his intentions ("no one can replace mum" cliché counts as number two). Josh Hartnett plays Jasper, a character on the opposite side of Kelley. His family owns a local restaurant. Enter your long-time love interest, Samantha Cavanaugh (Leelee Sobieski), a waitress in the dining room that covers her sister (who has no purpose, rather than control the next scene) when Jasper and Kelley act as child morons by racing cars and ( oh no) hit the canteen, causing it to explode in flames. (Conflicts between the rich and the poor will count as cliché number three.) <br /> <br /> The disheveled chase car haunts both Kelley and Jasper to get into conflict. They get into trouble with the law, but because this film feels a need to exist, a local judge orders them an alternative to business time: they must collaborate to help rebuild the guest. Two boys work hard in the summer growing strongly and getting a nice tan. Samantha catches Kelley and the romantic sparks fly. Jasper is jealous, but he wants what's best for his true love (cliché number four). Her parents (Annette O'Toole and Bruce Greenwood) disagree with her little romantic triangle (cliché number five), but she continues two timed Jasper without a second thought. Her father is also a local sheriff, as surprising (allows you to count the melodramatic nugget cliche number six). The impressive romantic feelings between Kelley and Samantha count as cliché number seven. But Samantha's relationship with Jasper is never defined, so how can romantic tension be? If the film provokes participation in Samantha's choice between two young men, then we must see both characters on both sides. The film depicts Jasper as a distraction to her "justified love", Kelley. Jasper really loves her, but it's also clear she doesn't love him back. This totally kills the romantic tensions early in the story. Leelee Sobieski will not hurt here; however, her charm and kind performance do not fall into a two-time character like Samantha. John Hartnett is also right for Jasper's role, but the movie doesn't give him anything but the Kelley bicker. Chris Klein makes a piece name for himself; Spends most of the film without a shirt, sweaty and overworked. Unfortunately, he does not show his acting skills, perhaps because he has very little. The support cast is much more talented. Bruce Greenwood delivers the best performance in the movie but doesn't have enough time on the screen to save anything, just a few short moments. I also enjoyed the performance of Stuart Wilson, who fits perfectly into the role of a rich, controlling father of high social status. Then we leaned on Samantha's knee problem exactly one hour and ten minutes into the movie (another spoiler forward). What it is has a serious incurable disease (yet another impression, about eight). Her terminal illness combines both competing young men together as friends, at least I think that's what the film wanted to show that the loss of one who loves two nemeses can bring both together (cliché number nine). Klein rehearses his Valedictorian speech to show that his character is more than a shallow stereotype, but we have seen it so many times before I would prefer a rich character than a deeply sentimental one that hides real feelings (cliché, um, it was ten). The conflicts between Kelley and Jasper are desperate and spoiled; "Your Mom" ​​comment starts a fist fight while they rebuild the device. There is a retread from "Armageddon," as Samantha and Kelley spread out in an open field, horny as hell, as he slowly moves his fingers around her body, naming areas after American cities (why not call it eleven). The film uses alcohol as a means of enhancing romantic tension: Drunk Kelley makes a fool himself after getting into battle with the date of Samantha, Jasper, but the following day he recites desires just to dance (cliché number, oh no, I'm losing).
