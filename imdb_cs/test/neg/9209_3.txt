The film opens with Charlie (Jeff Daniels), a business man just finished his lunch in the deli neighborhood. He doesn't seem to have enough money to cover the check. Instead of reaching for the sculpture, he looked around to see if the coast was clean and the ducks were free of payment. Unknown to Charlie, "Lulu" (Melanie Griffith) was watching him from the other side of the delicacies. "Lulu" is interpreted in what was declared cold in the 1980s. - Cut. He watches him know that he sees what he did. He tries to deny it, but he can't escape the charge. He thinks he's in, Charlie is surprised when "Lulu" says he's not working for delicatessen and then offers him a ride back to work. When heading in the opposite direction, they start their cavorting across the Mediterranean Sea board. We should titrate as a thoroughly modern "Lulu" giving straight-laced Charlie into humiliating situations. It's okay when two adults who agree to get a little miserable in a motel, but out of order when they get out of paying a check in a family-style restaurant. Theft of work from hard-working people is not my "wild" idea. Charlie's a jerk. "Lulu" is an idiot. She starts firing Charlie for her husband. First of all, to her mom (who carelessly tolerates charade) and then to her suitably timed 10-year high school meeting (an event later used by another overly good film for "Grosse Pointe Blank"). Br /> <br /> "Marriage" comes as a surprise to the real husband Lulu (Ray Liotta), who was recently released from prison for armed robbery. Ray gives two welcome arrivals and shows them how really ugly the crime is. I can't add any irony by writing it for the first time I watched it in the theater. No, I'm not doing anything like that. I made it out of cable TV and I assure you I see it strictly in the privacy of my home. So I thought why I was recording it when I didn't like it very much and concluding that 20 years ago I was kicking reggae and the soundtrack "Something Wild" has a prominent feature of reggae. Closing credits begin with a tribute to Sister Carol, who performs her version of "Wild Thing".
