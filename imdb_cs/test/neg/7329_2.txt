This movie is available as a special "bonus" feature on the double-disc Horror 101 & Horror 102: Endgame. It has nothing to do with the movies, except that it shows that the producers / directors Dudelson and Clavell are in heat. As with the other films, there are young people who go to the building where they are trapped and walk in the corridors a lot. At the end of one or more characters, they are found to have a different identity. This is by far the worst of the three. Here are people invited to Halloween-night opening only the Museum of the Dead. The museum does not have many exhibits and it is all kinds of ancient Central American relatives. There are also meat-eating, infection-spreading zombies in the museum, as well as an ancient cannibal warrior and two female warriors. The film is very repetitive. Killing people quite quickly, to the point of wondering who they will have to kill - at that point, more people will appear without explanation to be killed. Surprisingly, one of the characters has a cell phone and is actually able to call the police who are taking it seriously and appearing in a museum. When someone tries to choose a lock to get in, the other tells him it would be a "forced entry". If you have people trapped in a building that is hurt, I think it's irrelevant. Cops are also stupid in that when they shoot a zombie in his head, he goes down, but then shoots other zombies on his chest and doesn't fall down. They happen to shoot other zombies in the head and it goes down. They continue to shoot the rest of the zombies in the chest. Stupid. Opening credits and nightmare sequences are done in a kind of animation effect over the video, something like a miserable person, but not so cartoonish. It's something interesting, but parts of some attacks are done in the same way, so there's no logic for that. Awful.
