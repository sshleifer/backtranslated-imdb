The first 4 episodes of Season 6 are just a degenerate, predictable and worst-case scenario I've seen. It won't be, and hopefully, I won't buy it. Also see the seasons back that episodes about the space they did, suck even more. I want to tell the people who do it: don't do the whole episode about the universe because they suck. The point is that season 6 sucks even more than the season. He gets worse from season to season. I'm so disappointed and frustrated by watching the first 4 episodes of Season 6 I just had to write. Only people who are brainwashed can watch this crap. It seems that people who write the script get out of ideas for a long time. Do you think my two-year-old nephew had a better episode than these people.
