I'm so angry to the point, even though I usually do reviews with spoilers, but I'm going to make an exception in this case. The first scenes of these movies are weak and then when they get into the flesh and potato of a movie that sucks. This is one movie I took for the bad guys because the captain-save-day was incredible and there was no connection or anything you liked. The leading actor gave the weakest performance and Laurence Fishburne or Matt Dillon couldn't even save this movie. Sometimes there are eye openers or great moments in a movie that may not be that big .. this movie doesn't. If you're looking for a movie to look at in the meantime, nothing would interest your interest ... don't choose this ... save your money.
