The only reason I checked this movie was to see Kim Bassinger's "early". That, and the fact that my TV guide said it was "clamping tension", and it was a three star rating. The rating had to come from the man who wrote this drivel because the only stimulus in this film was whether I would finish it or not. Robert Culp turns to what must be a "catastrophe" of his career as a cop who is not so close to being credible. At any one time, EVERYONE is a suspect, including a fragile old woman. If you want to intentionally embark on a misspelled, misdirected, poorly fiction movie ... then go for it. This can help you appreciate fine movies in comparison. I wish I had an hour and thirty-six minutes back.
