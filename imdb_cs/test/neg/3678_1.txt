I can't remember the worst movie I watched. Total waste of actors and viewers time. If you prefer to sit around and think about when this movie will be, then it's the right movie for you. that people believe that Moscow has a mystical past. But I have to say that I didn't expect anything else from Rade Serbedzi, but I expected more from Vincent Galla. The film lacks plot, character, development, denouement. The film is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique. \ TI must be fair is any camera effect, but even that is too poor.
