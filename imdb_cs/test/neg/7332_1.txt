This guy is real work. An angry, immature boy in the body of an adult man who has packed all of the rock's charisma goes to places where most people just want to look and does everything in his power to be as unhappy as possible. <br /> <br /> Give this job to someone else who appreciates it. I could go for an endless list of all the stupid things this guy does in his "episodes", even if I just highlight the worst: Crete. While the locals in their "honor" build coastal picnics, this clown has a yellow that acts as a grumpy, rotten child. He complains about everything, including the fashion of the people who live there. What an imbecile. When he went to Sweden, he spent at least five minutes pretending to be distrustful of a bunch of chefs (who probably had better things than talking to some dimwit American like work) because they didn't think Abba was terrible. Wherever he went he raised Abba. This is the conversation you'd hear from 13-year-olds watching too much MTV. When he was in New Orleans, he was upset that a restaurant had a better taste than French fries. his, so he "accidentally" spilled some wine on them in order to destroy them. What is a strange, emotionally unstable person. Worst of all are his clumsy voice calls, where he tries in vain to add some insight into a situation that is too strong and ignorant to appreciate. He tries to use all these "big" words to sound like an author, but he's just a showy hack whose lack of consciousness has convinced him to have something to say. By the way, it's probably the only good thing about the TV show of this joker. It will show you, no matter how incompetent you are, until you get serious enough, the world will also be. Then there's the way he talks to local guides whose English is of course just basic. He will use the vocabulary of any writer - as he believes it is - would instinctively know that these persons are most likely not to understand. He does not care? No. Important schemes like this Bourdain clown do not use language to communicate; they are used to make themselves important. The review of Mcg13jthm on the same page is a perfect example of the love Bourdain attracts - that is the weak social failure of IQ. Watch the reviewer try to justify Bourdain's sociopathic nature with simple, childish excuses that hardly make sense. "Bourdain can complain, but is going through" a lot "and not only was he" forced "to do this show, but he is trying to redeem himself." Dolt attracts deltas and reads Mcg13ythm review should give you a very good idea of ​​whether you are the kind of person who would like to enjoy this absolutely useless, senseless show. And finally adding a little "justice" to my diatribe, I admit that Bourdain would be fun for a moment if I met him at the bar. But as a TV show host to show the viewer the beauty of other places and cultures, Bourdain is a miserable, miserable, hopeless, grim and depressed failure. <br /> <br /> Fail.
