This movie is honestly the worst piece of waste I've ever seen. It is slow, plot less and boring. The cameraman deserves to be shot. There were various aspects of unintentional comedy, one of which was Jared's strangely camp. He raised a lot of laughter but also a lot of yawning. don't look with anyone, anytime, anywhere. If you hate someone, recommend buying or renting it. big loss of time and money. Thanks Gus Van Sant ... no. I can't think of anything but say that never see this movie, it will u want to jump off a cliff. I hope Gus and his friends will read this comment before it's too late and he'll do a sequel or some other disaster with what seemed to be filmed by the camera.
