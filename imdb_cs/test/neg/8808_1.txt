There are bad movies and then there are movies that are even the worst. Saw is just that. The movie is just bad at all points. The storyline, acting, working with the camera, music and everything else is terrible and I can't start to understand how garbage is doing on the big screen. The simple fact is that Saw is riddled with holes. The beginning is tempting and much to be expected, but it does not hold and the plot becomes ridiculous and absurd. The film is not creative and does not leave you just a little credibility. People who claim that this movie is bloody, violent, sadistic and scary are sissy girls who have nightmares after watching CSI because it is far from it. So I'm a warning, you know, don't try to watch if you have some form of intellect because you will be disappointed. The real hole and average movie as possible.
