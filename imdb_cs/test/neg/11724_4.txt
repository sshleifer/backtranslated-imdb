Don't get me wrong. I have a lot of soft spot for the works of Charles Banda, producer and director. But you have to raise your eyebrows when a man who is willing to give his name "Dollman Vs The Demonic Toys" holds a pseudonym on anything. As a little bad movie fun, "head of the family" is rather lacking, although it is better to act than you might expect. Jacqueline Lovell is an unambiguous talent that deserves better than these kinds of movies. J.W. Perra is also quite humorous as a titular monster, though he is quite easy for such a superintelligent being. You know, I'm nitpicking because the rest of the movie is so sharp and funny of course .... <br /> <br /> And have a lead character called Lance Bogan? Nice guys. We didn't know the Americans knew that slang!
