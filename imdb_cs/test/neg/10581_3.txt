Here is a spoof that will certainly entertain people in the IQ series by Homer Simpson. It's a cheap shot on every big superhero, especially Spiderman and Batman. But that doesn't stop; it gradually deteriorates until it falls into the pathetic file slapstick trollop from truckload. <br /> <br /> For those interested in conspiracy, you're just watching Spiderman while under the influence of some heavy narcotics. What do you get is Dragonfly Man? The Boy Wonder, who loves the girl side by side, suddenly inherited some amazing super-powers. <br /> <br /> The rest of the script is as predictable as waking up in the morning and brushing your teeth, but not "take it for the word!" It's fun for kids; for adults it is a great movie to turn kids off.
