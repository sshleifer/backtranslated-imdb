This "movie" and I use this term freely, reminds me of the first joke that my daughter wrote at eighteen months: "P.U., stinky poopie!" Just like this joke, this movie can only reach very young, very immature, or very stupid. That means there are a few clear places. The effects that most of the $ 100 million went through are kinetic and convincing - I think as convincing because these CGI kinetic effects can be. CGI baby effects aren't great, but I think those are very hard to do well ... though for a hundred million dollars that could be better! Moose, a dog from "Frasier," phoned in the usual example. Steven Wright was doing well with a small piece. Alan Cummings was, Alan Cummings-as-villain we saw earlier, and Bob Hoskins as Odin was unrecognizable, but enjoyable. The actress playing Mrs. Avery was cute as a button as you would expect, and Jamie Kennedy as you expected. His best role so far has been in the Scream trilogy (not to be confused with the Lord of the Rings trilogy) and in the Three Kings. Perhaps he should stick to the finer forms of comedy. Jim Carrey, he's not. Writing and direction were, if anything, worse than Kennedy's performance. I remember one smart (though seven-year-old smart) line that I would like someone to quote exactly for the "Memorable Quotes" section. Something about Avery's proposed costume, which is "crappiest crappi in Craptown," was a second-level joke, but somewhat funny in context. <br /> <br /> Everyone, because there's nothing lower than "one", I'll give this movie "one".
