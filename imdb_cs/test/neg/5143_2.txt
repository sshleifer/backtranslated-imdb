The film seems to be built from a disjointed dream. There is not enough realism to attract the viewer. The Vermont Farm scene was an unsuccessful opportunity to show how farms were set up and farm families that would be interesting and fun. It was just a small, if not research whiskey smuggling period. Canadian costumes looked like something from the French Revolution, absolutely incredible. Playing the violin was good and for a period of time, but Chris's movements, which they allegedly played, were incredible. The appearance of the owl was never an explained secret, and the train that disappeared in the air was too much. I couldn't understand how the live trout was frozen in the ice and why two men in the wild without food released trout, a good source of food.
