That's a bad movie. It certainly belongs to how not to create a feature film category. Story, direction, acting and style are all like a pancake. The story consists of five? yes five? Football matches are spread throughout the film, each of which is more boring than the last, because a dysfunctional amateur football team is moving from strength to strength. That's it, it's a conspiracy. It's hard to know who this film is focused on. It's too banal for football fans and there's nothing for teens or adults. Even women are nothing, not even a female character. It's ugly to wear you as a team to play a game after a game after a game after a game. The story, such as it is, dialogue and mannerisms seem to have been raised since last Ireland, with all actors spouting theater Dublin accents. It may not be seen to be believed. Avoid at any cost. Can someone give me 90 minutes. High point credits at the end, low point too much to mention. Brendan Gleeson is in this movie.
