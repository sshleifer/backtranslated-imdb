It seems that whenever a film company wants to do youth movies, it focuses on just one thing: sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm not the one, but the fact that these people think I think my rocks are all I'm interested in is very offensive. Take The Convenant, a film that relies so heavily on the main characters to be attractive and think they can get without a plot and / or a script that wasn't written by a six year old. This is basically The Craft with (supposedly) hot guys. And yeah, that's it. It bored me to tears. Even my friend, who usually makes us cow movies, hated him. It's really terribly bad, to the point that it can be really funny. I would laugh if it wasn't because she liked several other women in the cinema. They were accompanied by a few delicate boys who positively twisted and died when (really clich√©) the boy came to the end to kiss the boy. Watching them twist was the highlight of the film. I don't think mainstream, Hollywood cinema will ever make good teenage movies (or, indeed, for anyone), so I think I'll give up. If you are a teenager who likes Pussycat Dolls, thinks that Paris Hilton is "hot" and watches MTV, it's like a wasteland. Life is tough when you're a 15-year-old who likes a house. :( P.S. Someone should tell the director that not all teenagers will find a boy "absolutely HAWT LOL !!! 111 !!"
