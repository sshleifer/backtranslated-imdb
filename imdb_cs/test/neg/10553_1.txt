What can I say? That was one horrible movie he was watching. I am usually not too critical of gay cinematography because most of them are usually low-budget, but that really pushed me up. Is it that it happened to gay cinema? Aren't gay producers and directors from Gus Van Saints and Ang Lee movies anything at all? Just had to sit the whole movie was like being in a dental chair and having my wisdom teeth extracted. I was still praying for the moment when I felt some connection with any character, but that never happened. Most of the characters were little convincing. It was like watching one of those poorly made film specials made for television on local TV stations. I can't tell you how much disappointed this was to see this movie after being a big fan of Tori Spellings other works and directors of the latest work on "Latter-day Saints." It's certainly not worth waiting for. Certainly, I will never come back a few hours of my life and I will certainly not buy on DVD.
