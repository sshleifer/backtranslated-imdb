It's not a horrible movie - my 10 year old boy loved him and he would be a target demographic, so I think they came across. Pretty boring for an adult though. It is hard to relate to animated lego characters, even the modern ones. the world was a little strange - unity, duty and fate. Am I the only one who thinks it sounds a bit fascist? Especially fate. And what about freedom, equality, justice, etc.? Well, Lego will sell. Some boring for a movie, but not bad for a 74-minute ad. It could have been much worse.
