This movie could be a lot better if they didn't use Brian Conley as a gangster and if they didn't start the movie with Christopher Biggins. <br /> <br /> When I watched this movie, I didn't know what's going on. There were too many double crosses and plot twists to make the film believable. The film deserves 0, but when I see it isn't 0, I gave it. 1. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to my worst enemy, I'd rather blow my eyes. Some rusty scissors before watching this movie again. I'm telling you, it was an hour and a half of life, I'm not coming back. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a gangster movie, don't get it. Instead, watch "Going Off Big Time" or "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels".
