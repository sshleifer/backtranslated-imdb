This movie isn't even good enough for a $ 1 bin in a grocery store. I bought it because Terrence Howard was in it. Guess he couldn't be too picky about his roles during this time. The film itself was difficult to sit on. They seemed to grab the straw with a story. "Night boys" had to be the worst I've ever seen. One minute talking and another reciting poetry? Even the arguments were hard to follow. Most games lacked any depth. I have no idea what's going on with this one, but it certainly missed the mark.
