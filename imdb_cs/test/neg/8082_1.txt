Ah sci-fi channel. How often do you disappoint me? Quite often, do you ever think you're showing good movies? OK, you gave me a big 'Heroes' and a reasonably good 'The Lost Room', but they're series, and there's nothing positive about the movie. Bad play, bad direction, horrible characters and a shallow story, and that's just for starters. I checked out director Allan Goldstien and I wasn't surprised when I found nothing interesting in his biography (in fact, I was half thinking that it was a pseudo name). The spaces of four motorists from the motto-intersection in a national park, when one of them has an accident that needs a parking guard to come to save just for them to get caught in a forest fire, is weak and predictable that you know every punch before it happened it. The leading man Bryan Genesse park ranger is so bad he is terrible. Occupied as an action hero of martial arts boy in the footsteps of so many more this guy makes Seagal and Van Damme look like De Nero. The support cast is a little better, and before the end, it remained in the hope that the fire would devour them all than the film crew. Avoid at any cost
