I couldn't stand the woman who played mother. I wanted him to shut up. She had a bizarre way of speaking, and the lines she gave her did not improve. I had no idea why men in the city were so taken to cause all these problems, except that it seemed to be the only woman older than ten and younger than sixty in a city inhabited by men. Even after a terrible tragedy, her voice lacked human emotions, seemed to lack the ability to understand the events of her life. She added her lines with the same emotion, whether she said "I love you", "I hate you", "The bank closes", "My clothes are on fire". Was it actually filmed in Ireland? The sun was spilling all over the film, and the figures seemed surprised by the rain shower during the harvest. In the summer of 2002 I lived in Ireland, the wettest summer of the century. Most were still harvested. If farmers in Ireland were only able to harvest during long dry stretches, the country would starve hundreds of years ago. It looks like there wasn't much money to make a movie. Black-and-white flashes looked as if they were filmed by security cameras that could reach Sam's club.
