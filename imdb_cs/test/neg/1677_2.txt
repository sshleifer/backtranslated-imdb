This movie through it to cgi I mean science fiction really they through it the original '' BATS '' is better not to use cgi as a sequel. In this film his simple people run from mutated bat killers. and really bats in Afghanistan?! The plot includes U.S Army soldiers find a terrorist and be attacking bats and dying <_ <but the reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because the way the camera zooms in on the soldiers. acting is bad and it doesn't even look like a horror movie. in all this movie is a pretty good TV movie for the sci-fi channel. but if you like science fiction movies, you will enjoy this movie because just like channel 43 oh and if you fall asleep during the movie, don't surprise. Oh sorry, I think I give 2 star instead.
