Wasting 1h45 This nasty little movie is the one to avoid, it's like a cheap badly cross between a saw and several other recent kidnapping movies, why the author wrote it, it's obvious ... he has no soul and did it to try and I have some money. Twists were obvious when those in danger could escape, they did it obvious and not etc .. just a good thing about it was that I discovered 1 new actress worth watching the list. there are too many better, nicer movies than looking at it, rather than being miserable and thinking less of the world. Spend your time more wisely watching good movies, do some exercise, cook nice food .. all but waste your time like this
