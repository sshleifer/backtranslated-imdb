This film stinks more than limburger cheese! If you manage to sell it in the garage, GET YOU! I love Sandra Bullock and yet I hate this movie ... Although shy, I have my own copy, and the studio changed the cover to play the fact that Sandra Bullock is in it at all. They play it up to "And Sandra Bullock Movie". She has little role in the whole film and does her best, but she is young and has not yet learned her talent. Everyone has to start somewhere ...
