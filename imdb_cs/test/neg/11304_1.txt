You don't see "Mr. Magoo." It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Leslie Nielson wasn't funny about that. He wasn't funny because of the Naked Gun movies. Well, it won't be long before he finds out it's not a Naked Gun movie! The storyline is ridiculously stupid. Nothing in the whole movie was funny. The first few minutes of the movie were revived to look like old Magoo cartoons. I wish the movie stayed this way.
