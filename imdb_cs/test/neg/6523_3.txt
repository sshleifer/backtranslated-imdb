I didn't like this movie. I rented it and hoped it would be like the 10th Kingdom. I was disappointed to find that it wasn't. I also found it just nervous. Behavior was bad, characters that were incredible and time leaps were crazy. I only recommend this film when a crazy dude is running around in the mood, but I'm sure there are better films with the same thing. I can't believe I was wasting my time.
