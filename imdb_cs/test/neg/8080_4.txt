** MAIN SPOILERS ** Trackable only for action sequences, not story or playing in it “Nature Unleashed: Fire” has one of the longest and unbearable endings in modern film history. We have fearless Ranger Jake, Bryan Genesse, leading the trio of hysterical cyclists to safety in all the steps of the explosive mine on the beach! This during a raging forest fire! Ranger Jake, with all his knowledge of the big outdoors, does not seem to realize that the mine shaft escaping dangerous and explosive methane is the last place to get when all the forests are around the fire! *** SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ON *** It all started some time ago when Ranger Jake, in an effort to save not that on the miner Tiny, Chris Harz aka "Sherd", let him slip through his fingers and fall to his death at the bottom of the shaft or did it! Although we were in constant tension, who set the forest fires for the first half of the film, it was no surprise that Tiny was the culprit! As would be expected with films such as these Tiny, they seemed to be made of hardened steel in that nothing that happened to him would fire or burst, couldn't stop the crazy miner. or Resurrection, Ranger Jake participated in rescuing cyclists Chris Mel Sharon & Marcus, Josh Cohen Melanie Lewis Anastasia Griffith and Ross McCall, who were trapped in the woods with fires breaking around them. Having it all - Marcus - among the bikers, things don't go as smoothly as Ranger Jake wanted them to go. Marcus not only eggs to a humble Chris to do something stupid, jump with his bike over 10 feet of piles of logs, but the guy has to break his leg. It is almost impossible for Ranger Jake to bring Chris air-picked up before fires consume him as well as his fellow cyclists! <br /> <br /> For the rest of the movie Ranger Jake, who has given himself in charge, makes a boner after a boner in his attempt to save himself and trapped and lost in the woods cyclists! All this ends with Jake's great idea of ​​hiding in a dangerous and abandoned mine, where the rescue group is only a few meters away from the rescue if they remain in place and in the open, where the rescue team can find them! Although he was supposed to be the life of a party or movie, Tiny stumbled upon a man who spent too much time in the sun for all his efforts for another indestructible super villain. Make-up work on Tiny was so offensive that he looked like a glass of spaghetti sauces was thrown on his head instead of firing it on the fragile. Ranger Jake stumbled upon a little naive or retarded in his being so impressed with the dangerous Tiny in always attempting to rescue a furious psycho who never hid his feelings on what he thought of the game by the rules of Forest Ranger. In fact, Ranger Jake actually encouraged Tiny to make him with him and with the cyclists by showing him how incapable he was to save them. The fact that Ranger Jake was successful was not because he was so clever, but because Tiny was so headless despite his indestructibility!
