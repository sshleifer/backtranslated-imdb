Before watching this film (at the screening of the director herself), we were informed that he had won a short film award at Galway Fleadh. Surely this result will give filmmakers hope, everyone can do better than this! <br /> <br /> As no one can notice a flagrant rip-off Donnie Darko will never know in this. The film is purely drivel, acting carton, dialogue ridiculous and ending just flat! The only trivia of comfort we enjoyed after we saw this trash was to loudly comment on how terrible it was before the director! Yes, it was average but liberating! At least Irish filmmaking can't drop below!
