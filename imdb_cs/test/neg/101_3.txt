I gave it 3 out of 10 possible stars. <br /> <br /> If you don't want to waste your time watching an anorexic actress, it's Carly Pope in this movie, acting like a ditz, don't bother. Carly Pope plays Sara Novak, a young student who becomes fascinated by the puzzle game that leads her to underground tunnels under the city - a dangerous thing for a well-armed man. There are various intrigues in the film - a classmate who is obviously persecuted by Sarah, a cynical trader who runs some sort of unusual hole in the wall that seems to be located. in the back of the ghetto, a stupid fool who hangs around a cynical store, and a woman named Emily Gray who is in jail. Sarah's father is a lawyer who manipulates Emily Gray's case. A few years back, Emily Gray tried to drown a 12-year-old boy. Emily was put into a psychiatric hospital for 5 years, and for some cockeyed reason she left her again, though it is obvious she is still dangerously split. The only explanation Emily ever gave her is the crime: I never sinned. It's all part of the proposal. Well, my friend, don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that, because you wont.
