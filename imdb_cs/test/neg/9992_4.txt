Some describe CALIGULIA as "the most controversial film of its era. Although debatable, it is certainly one of the most embarrassing: virtually every big name associated with the film tried to distance it from it. The author Gore Vidal actually sued (with mixed results) for his name to be removed from the film, and when the stars saw the film, their reactions differed from the loudly expressed resistance to the strategic silence. Of course, what they wanted was that it was gone. It seemed like it might be for a while. CALIGULA was the main box office and critical flop (producer Guccione had to rent theaters to show them at all), and although the film was released on VHS's home market, so many censorship issues were raised that it was again. the editing version was the only widely available for more than a decade. But now CALIGULIA is on DVD, available in both "R" and "Unrated" editing versions. And undoubtedly, John Gielgud is glad he didn't see it happen. The only way to describe CALIGULII is to say it's like DEEP THROAT when he meets David Lynch DUNE through Fellini. off day. Vidal's screenplay came into the hands of Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione, who used Vidal's reputation to finance the project and lure the big star stars - and then threw out most of Vidal's script and brought the soft porn director Tinto Brassa. Afterwards, when Guccione felt that Brass's work was not sufficiently explicit, he and Giancarlo Lui photographed hard material in a crafty place. Viewers watching the edited version may wonder what the fuss is about, but those who view the original cut quickly realize that it leaves nothing to imagination. There is a huge amount of nudity, and it remains in the edited version, but the original comes complete with XXX scenes: there is a very explicit gay, lesbian, and straight sex, kinky sex, and a big orgy complete with dancing Roman guards thrown in a good scale. The film is also incredibly violent and bloody, with rape, torture and mutilation of the day. In one particularly troubling scene, a person is slowly stabbed to death, a woman urinates on her body, and her genitals are cut off and thrown to the dogs. In a document accompanying the DVD, Guccione says he wants the film to reflect the reality of pagan Rome. If so, he lacked a brand. We know very little about Caligula - and what little we know is at best controversial. That aside, orgy and casual sex were not a matter of course for Roman society, where adultery was a crime of death. And certainly ancient Rome NEVER looked like strange, slightly oriental, strange spatial sets and costumes offered by designers. On the plus side, these sets and costumes are often fantastically beautiful and although cinema is a matter of course at least for justice; The score is also very, very good. The most successful member of the cast is Helen Mirren, who is able to capture our interests and sympathies as Empress Caesonia; Gielgud and O'Toole also escape in a reasonably good form. The same can't be said about McDowell, but he doesn't have much to do with him in justice. The film has a dark fascination, but in the end it is a strangeness that is more interesting to it. design and flatness beyond content. Some of the exposed bodies (including McDowell and Mirren) are very beautiful and some sex scenes work very well as pornography ... but then some of them are so disgusting that they can lead you to abstinence and the bloody and grotesque nature of the film underlines its eroticism . If you're up to it, it's worth seeing once, but one is likely to be enough. Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
