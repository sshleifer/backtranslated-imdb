First, I want to clear the common misconception: It is not unrealistic that the Zoey School goes to give students laptops. In my school, they must have those in class 7 and higher Apple Macbooks (this is paid in the entrance fee). Scroll. This show is very annoying. He has a boring, predictable plot and bad behavior. Often in the show brings "girl power" to a new high, with girls beating guys in everything they try. But that's not the worst. The worst part is that girls are still all shown as focused on their personal performances and shout when they are happy. Except for one clever girl who is portrayed as a madman who is obsessed with ugly boys and science. However, this show is very addictive. I don't know why, but it is. Although the last season was so horrible, bringing stereotypes, boring conspiracies and misconduct to extremes that I never thought would be achievable, so fortunately I'm no longer addicted.
