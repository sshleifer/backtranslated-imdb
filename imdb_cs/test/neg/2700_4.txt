Amnesian women who take off their clothes in a drop of a hat (or a blouse?) Are about the only points in a movie that is otherwise slow and aimless. Although the basic premise of the story offers many possibilities, it never evolved to any satisfactory degree and the exposure almost does not exist. Much of the film is just wandering through the corridors of the multi-storey clinic / hospital. The overall effect is bleak and sterile, namely THX-1138.
