Honest to God, the outline says almost everything. Planet Andromina (not to be confused with Aunt Jemima) is represented by cheap L.A. stripclub. There are no strippers, so the last male visitors are leaving to hire strippers. Men are wrong with kings or arrested for espionage against women (although we only get two women participating in any girls' sex scenes through their women's planet), and finally, as always happens in sci -If clich√©, women are convinced everywhere that men are good for something. Well, not the men who did this movie, anyway! But boy, we see a lot of what is in amazing amounts of erotic sex and nudity. This one has less conspiracy than usual for such movies, so change the channel if you don't like this kind of movie, and grind your teeth if you're into such a thing.
