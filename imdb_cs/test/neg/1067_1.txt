The time I wasted when I saw this movie I demand back! Then I felt sick, but not because she touched me. It's pretentious, trying to get viewers to feel bad for the people involved, but I couldn't care less. The characters are soulless and stupid. You have no explanation for some scenes and don't leave any thoughts then come up with your own explanations. All students in the film have problems, but because you don't feel them, you don't trust their problems. <br /> <br /> If I could write better in English, I'd never stop. But I can't, so I'll stop now. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it.
