This movie found for one dollar ($ 1.00) and the film was a waste of time. Reb Brown, (Mark Hardin), played a military adviser in South America and was successful in capturing the leader of rebel soldiers operating from dense jungles. However, Mark joins the other side after some terrible torture or women and men. In one scene, as Mark drinks in the hotel bar, his eyes see the sexy long legs of Sandra Spencer (Shannon Tweed), "Dead Sexy", 01. Mark and Sandra have extreme heats for themselves and even passionate love they do on some very hard rocks without having time for the comfort of the bed. It's a horrible movie and it's not worth wasting your time to even look at IT.
