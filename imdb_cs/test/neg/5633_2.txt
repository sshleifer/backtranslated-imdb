This movie had to look when it was in development and get Redgrave and Jacobi on board to be thrilled with men's money. All I can say is that they clearly had nothing in that week. Jacobi prepares it just as Jacobi can do, and I thought he seemed to be more of an actor who parodied in his role in Frasier a few years before. Vinnie Jones is not so bad he is clearly from his depth as a leading man. He is really quite friendly and if he was a pilot for a TV series, he may have just gotten there. But Scipt and camera work were frightening. That's why this "jounalist" and press officer from Met never worked. Surely it could not be because of the sexual chemistry that it does not exist. There is nothing wrong with a ridiculous and far-pleasing plot that you can pass on as an original, but the whole thing is so fanciful that these two stories have no meaning at all. It was like two stories that were confused into one, just two hours. Go look for some paint for a few hours. Your life will be more filled than watching this waste
