What should Scream Baby Scream do to avoid feeling like a fool for buying it? I bought it because, God, help me, I'm crazy for the old B-cinema so worthless. However, something about this movie is irritating to me, it's probably Janet, Janet comes out cold and snooty, seemingly intent on leaving so deep and noble, with a look at her face that screams constipation, can not agree with anything her dear friend wants. I'm glad it's her only role. What really irritates me is that it is a gore film from the 1960s that was terribly scary, and as we all know, Floridian is for "zero gore". It is as if the director began with the style of Herschell Lewis, but when his wife learned, she stepped out of the gore scenes, so instead we end up with one blunt conversation after another, and basically, a lot of irritation. In other words, we'll end up with Florida Bore. Joseph Adler should be embarrassed. Friend Janets, Jason is almost as ridiculous as she, this guy has something negative, what to say about absolutely everyone, he finds he's probably the least likeable good guy in the history of horror. The only thing this movie really does is that it carries that 60-year-old and 70-year-old B-gore vibration that you can find in things like Undertaker & his friends, Blood Freak, or most of Herschell Lewis. Even Rodney of Gruesome Twosome is in it, I think his comic book routine was irritating, most of the things from reel to reel are stupid, even the way was stupid. The only positive thing at all is the small amount of beach scenery, but it mostly involves Janet's whining about life is not perfect. The only real ironic twist, Scream Baby Scream becomes even less interesting as soon as the story finally begins, around the 45 minute mark. If you happen to be indifferent to whether your entertainment is traceable but are offended by red, you don't have to hate it. Why does Troma distribute it? Wouldn't that be a weird video? Scream Baby Scream can very well be the worst in Florida horror / gore of his era, but I suppose that under the improbable characters and incoherent plot lies the potential of lies. Screaming, Baby, Scream really looks like a Blood Feast sample is supposed to follow to steal a Janet quote, "If it doesn't fit, I'll throw it out". 2/10
