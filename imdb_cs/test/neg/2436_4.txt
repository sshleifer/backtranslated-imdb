This film takes place as an English version of ABC after a special school, with nudity. This is what you want to be the target audience. It is not as if the writers were too interested in selling a plausible plot. While it has some traceability, virtual sexuality is softer than meringue dandelion. It's a good movie to watch if you're snowy, the cable is out, and it's the only tape you have.
