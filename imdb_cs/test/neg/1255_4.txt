Wow, I just witnessed one of the biggest poker tragedies and I'm not talking about the premature death of a big ungara. I'm sorry to hear that this was terrible. Absolutely terrible. A true tragedy in the history of filming. Well, maybe I'm a little rough, but if you're not interested in the life of the ungara, don't even think about getting close to it. And those who are interested in his life will find that most parts have been trivialized and invented to be great news scenes. I watched it because of Stu UNgar, but I almost wanted to end myself as if doing 4 stars for watching this movie, but unpleasantly painful
