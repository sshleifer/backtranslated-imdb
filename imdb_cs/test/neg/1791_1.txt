Of all the movies I've seen, The Rage must be one of the worst. Direction, logic, continuity, plot-script changes, and dialogue made me scream in pain. "How could someone come up with something so miserable"? Gary Busey is known for his "B" movies, but this is a sure "W" movie. (W = waste). Consider, for example: about two dozen FBI officials and local lawmakers surround a trailer truck with a jeep. Inside jeep is the MA and is "confused" why all the cops are about. Within seconds a huge gun battle follows, the MA is immediately killed. The cops tear off the jeep with the gary and the company blasting at them. The cops are falling like a domino, and a Gary jeep is running in circles and not hit by one ball / pellet. The MA is killed and the gary seems to have noticed the heck that guy is tough. Really a miracle, not because a six-shooter held 300 bullets there was such a miracle.
