I don't know what the creators of this film were trying to achieve or say, but they failed badly in what it was. Of course, the goal was not to totally confuse the viewer. I watched this movie simply because Drew Barrymore was in it, and it turned out to be smaller than small portraits. The whole idea of ​​having this kid go on some wild car trip to win a big money prize from a gas station game and meet all kinds of wackos is absolutely ridiculous.
