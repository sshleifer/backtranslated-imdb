Bad conspiracy, wrong playing, wrong direction. He had options, but he just didn't get anything. <br /> <br /> This movie looks like somebody started with the idea, got a bit of an info and then tried to compact for an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad thrilling music. Others had to stop watching because they were 2/3 of the way - I had to take a break just because I didn't care anymore. She reminded me of an episode of Days of Our Lives with marginally more tension. <br /> <br /> Just wrong.
