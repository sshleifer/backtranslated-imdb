This movie angered me for the simple fact that it was just because Shepherd was gay. The men who murdered him are obviously evil. What happened to the poor man was really terrible and tragedy. However, where was Hollywood when four religious white children were executed, after being forced to perform a number of sexual acts on their murderers and each other, two evil blacks in Wichita two years ago? Celebrities just mug for the camera when they serve a political purpose. Laramie is also portrayed in poor light by this pseudo-documentary film, which, of course, is hardly surprising because they are backward hicks who must be educated by omniscient and enlightened Californians. It's always a treat to see Laura Linney.
