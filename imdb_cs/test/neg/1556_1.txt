This movie stinks. IMDb needs negative numbers in its rating system to correctly evaluate this turkey. The activity is either wooden or over the top; the movie is probably NOT written by anyone else; and the monster scenes were at best average. Even as a movie driven exclusively by monster scenes, these shots were so disappointing that they could not inspire any sympathy for the rest of the film. I want back 80 minutes of my life that stole this movie.
