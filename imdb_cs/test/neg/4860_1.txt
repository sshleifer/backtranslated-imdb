I clicked on the Encore Mystery Channel to wait for the movie I wanted to see, Dr. Moreaua. I just caught the Shadow Plot for a few minutes. The old man runs after Charlie and grabs his arm. Suddenly Assassin taps the old man in the shining cloak (with a shoulder) across the street. After waiting for "C" to turn around and look, "A" is trying to shoot "C" and clearly missing. "C" was a much easier target, the old man couldn't run far. Duh! There is a chase and "C" is on the lift "A" is on the roof, so try to shoot a cable that is parallel to "A". It strikes and breaks the cable, impossible. Later, this time with a specialized rifle, "A" lines up on "C" from maybe 50 meters, but is stupid to notice the motorcycle coming in and knocking the rider instead. How does Charlie get her parts? Dad goes to the producers and says, "Look, my baby needs work ..." It reminds me of his stupid Sit-Com. All actors are good, except for it. I usually have to finish 2 or 3 minutes waiting for C.S.I. go on. Let's see what I can do for the next hour. I know, I'll cut my nails! Much better use of my time.
