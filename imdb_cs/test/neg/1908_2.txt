All I have to say is one word ... SUCKS !!!!. The only reason I gave it is that Josh Hartnett was in it and he's fine. She had to beat that Klein guys ass ... stupid stupid and helpless. You can't build Klein by the end of this movie and you really don't care about what happens to Leelee. Hartnett was the only good thing.
