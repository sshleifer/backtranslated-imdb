The female hot numbers on this show are breathtaking. They can also speak tomorrow. Otherwise, this show would go to the bathroom quickly. How much money they make to all the people who put the text, hoping to be called back to win, $ 100.oo or anything else. Boy, now it's a scam! Can I buy shares in this money maker ??? Let's face it, with the technology that thousands of people can call every minute. And with ten thousand channels and nothing worth crap, thousands of people watch this show. "Oh, I know the answer!" Is probably a super common line among listeners. With these super hotties constantly saying 'salon' needs a caller, I think it's a bunch of B.S. Often, someone who goes through, sounds amazed that they are actually talking to the host. Many of them sound depressed and worn out, probably waiting so long and trying so many times to get to some pocket. Wow, producers just have to poke it. No wonder there are so few ads. Ads are just to give time for more (especially losers) to text and wait, and hope, and dream, and daydream about --- what? --- win enough money for a gas tank and dinner at Mc..something? I look at it now and then on my brother's television because he likes watching him when he's on the computer. I will sit there for 15 to 20 minutes and look at Mel (one of the tastiest women on TV) and laugh with the fraud that is in front of me. Then I have to leave; though not! People who have an active life can only do this show in extreme moderation. Mel, get into movies, or TV sitcoms or something. Many of us are infatuated with you! Even with super ties, I'm impressed that this show is still on!
