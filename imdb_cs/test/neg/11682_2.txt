Hmmm, not patch on original from Shaw Brothers. Fights are average and look very clumsy. The story story is as expected from the 70 Kung Fu movie, confusing and stupid. Silly Voices for Women, dubbed in classy English accents for men. I turned it on early and I love martial arts. Get the original, its much better than this average movie, don't be fooled, I bought the wrong movie I wanted, was the Shaw Brothers movie. I just started commenting, doing only foreign and martial arts, that's just the beginning of my film collection, I personally own the most advanced film martial arts. I hope you don't waste your time watching this, it's just for the hard fans of the 70s Kung Fu.
