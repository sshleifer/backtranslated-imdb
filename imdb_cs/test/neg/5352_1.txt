First of all - although I think Joel Schumacher is at best the average director and more often (as here) downright bad, the lion's share of the film's ugly travesty must go to John Grisham, whose novel is based on it. The film is at an indefinite time (1950s? 70s), the film begins with rape and the murder of a child who is so caricatured that their purpose is to reassure racists. that "at least we are not so bad" ?? Cut to the bad guys coming to the courtroom, when the girls, Samuel L Jackson, worry about performing at some technical level, they shoot them in cold blood before they study. This setting is "deep south" that probably never existed - several black characters live in shacks and seem to choose cotton, dyed races (Kiefer Sutherland is a cartoon version) Klansman is in their village ridiculous. The work is a trial: for the defense there are "good guys" - a milquetoast lawyer played by Matthew McConaughey as if in a coma, his assistant played breasts Sandra Bullock (does not seem to serve any other narrative purpose) and Donald Sutherland as a necessary drunk-lawyer-who- sobs-up-to-fight-good-fight. Kevin Spacey goes through demonic movements while prosecuted, while large crosses are burned in the city, witnesses are intimidated, and locals are not interested? Some reviews state that the film is immoral because Samuel Jackson is certainly a murderer and should trust the forces of the law rather than appearing on the weak heart tug of Matthew McConaughey. . To be honest, uncomfortable, although the basic message "Vigilante Justice is Good" could be, everything about the film stinks: characterization is pitiful, the lead lead, the direction that stretches, the script and the dialogue almost parody. Peter Menzies Fresh, 50s Technicolor cinematography is pretty but derived. And it takes almost two and a half hours !! <br /> <br /> What is left to say? It is a waste of 141 minutes of each person's life, it is tiring, mindless and ham, and almost as an add-on is morally disgusting.
