Even though I watched Salo, I don't know if they like feces. If so, this "film" is precisely called. So much of the fiber, so little substance, it's a celluloid equivalent of celery - it just doesn't clear the palate. It leaves a taste of wasting time in the mind's mouth, and if I could vomit this film and return to what I want. The detention was more exciting. The director should be forced to wear a dune cap and ghost Ed Wood Jr. he could not save this semi-professional projection from some failure. Loss of time, loss of mind. * Don't be fooled by being passionate about Dominique Swain: a competent eye candy that was in Lolita's remake, less tragic and rude than Sue Lyon, though in no way better. However, previously competent turning screw does not mean that it would be a skilled craftsman-person. You need a craft, not a bullshit, that's the movie. Reels belong to the girls' bathroom, flushed down until the pipes burst, while director / director Christina Wayne should do 5-10 in the study room. Watch everything else and go through this class, (bye) forever!
