Great cast, fantastic CGI monster and great script. If this movie had any of those things, then it wouldn't be among the worst movies I've ever spent an hour and a half. Endless chimpanzees with endless typewriters have not yet written the complete works of Shakespeare, but on the way it has appeared in a paper waste bin and somehow it has become a film. You can say that the actors regret signing these contracts with every word they murmur directly into the camera. CGI is amateur at the extreme and they could have created more cast tension was attacked by the Sinclair spectrum that was created on. I wanted to like this movie, it has a nice performance by Gil Gerard and Walter Koenig, so I was expecting a funny horror that didn't take too seriously. It's actually trying to take it seriously, but it's about as fun as a trip to a dentist. Do yourself a favor. Do not follow this movie, you will only encourage them to do more.
