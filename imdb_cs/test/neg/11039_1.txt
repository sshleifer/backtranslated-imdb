So some people might argue that this is not possible, the worst movie ever made, and not. I saw films with weaker charts, worse gaming, and so on. So why do I hate this movie Ã¼ber alles? Well, it's basically about a man who has been kidnapped for many years, and when he comes out, he tries to find out who did it and why to get revenge. The problem I have with this movie has nothing to do with horror or horror, but <br /> <br /> *** THE MAIN SPOILERS STOP READ TO SIGN *** <br /> <br /> our main the character is basically cheated on having sex with her own daughter and wants to cut out her tongue so the enemy won't tell her because she didn't know. It's so humiliating that she crawls on her knees like a dog. And why does it deserve it? Because he saw many years ago that brother and sister had a tender moment - the wrong way. He continued and told people, and therefore commits suicide. And the viola, he's the brother who made everything our main character for us. I was thinking: Maybe I hate this movie so much because I think his punishment is too cruel. Perhaps because I feel that this film does not condemn incest, but somehow confuses it with love. Maybe it's because I was expecting something else. <br /> <br /> *** THE END OF SPOILERS *** <br /> <br /> Believe me, no one deserves what happens to our main character in the end and I am very serious; do you know how some movies get under the skin and stay there? After watching this movie, I felt damned dirty and I really wish I never saw it. She stayed with me for days and some may ask: Well, isn't that a good movie? The ability to influence us in such ways? Yes, it may be, but this film not only paralyzed me, but also the fact that I felt broken.
