I am and have been a serious collector of Christmas-related movies, TV shows, holiday specials, etc., for over 25 years. Please pay attention to my warning and do not be fooled by the fact that you will learn about this movie about how you do it. This is not a Muppett movie because we know them and is definitely NOT for children. The fact that it was created for a large television network was not a surprise given their level of traffic at this time. What is hard for me to believe is that Jim Henson's organization has bent so low to join this travesty of Christmas. hard earned money on this piece of garbage.
