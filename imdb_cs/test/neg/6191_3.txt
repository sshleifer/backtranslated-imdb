Pepe le Moko, played by Charles Boyer, is some sort of international criminal spirit he wanted in countries across Europe, and to stay free that hole himself up in Casbah, a mysterious part of Algiers, where even the police are reluctant to go until. an older officer is sent from Paris to capture Moko once and for all. For Le Moko, although Casbah allows him to stay out of police custody, he also becomes a kind of jail at the same time - a place he can't leave, because when he does, he knows he's going to be arrested. Boyer's performance was good and I understand why he was nominated for an Oscar. It captures the essence of such a character - the perfect combination of very dangerous and at the same time very elegant. The movie itself, unfortunately, was quite disappointed. Many parts of the story seemed inconsistent, two of which I would mention. First, the idea was that the police would not enter Casbah. This was clearly stated at the beginning of the film by the local commander, and yet repeated references in the film suggest that in fact the police entered Casbah fairly regularly. So neither Commissioner Janvier's suggestion that the police would enter, nor the Inspector Sliman's statement (also a decent performance of Joseph Calleio) that they could get to Casbah, but not out, seemed to make sense. I also found it hard to believe that Le Moko - a stubborn criminal master who was - could have been so quickly ripped out of Gaby's feet (Hedy Lamarr) to entertain the locals by singing love songs and then leave Casbah to find her and basically give up. Of course I understand the irony of the last few scenes because Pepe leaves her prison freedom (Casbah) just to find true freedom in his captivity (because he is shot and killed by the police). believe that someone like le Moko will fall into such a trap. It is worth watching Boyer and, to a lesser extent, Calleia, but the story is disappointing and inconsistent. 3/10
