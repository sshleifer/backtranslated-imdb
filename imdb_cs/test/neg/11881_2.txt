For several reasons, this movie is just awful. Other posters show some of the historical mistakes of this movie. Well, I have a layman's knowledge of Roman history, and I even found flagrant inaccuracies. I usually forgive mistakes in historical films because I understand that the goal is to have fun not to educate. And shrinking a long saga for up to two hours requires some, say, historical license. But this film goes far beyond just rounding. It is worse. To tell a story from a distant period, the film uses flashbacks that just make the story confusing. If viewers do not have any prior knowledge of the season, they will be quickly lost. In addition, the film was apparently filmed simultaneously in Italian and English with various actors being dubbed later. Sometimes the actors seem to be in totally different movies that were then edited together. In fact, it's not too bad. The actors were apparently embedded in ancient Rome, computer-generated. The only reason I gave this boring mess is that we always find Peter O'Toole. But this is not a reason to rent. If you're curious about Roman history, much better movies are available.
