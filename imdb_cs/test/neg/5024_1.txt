It may or may not contain spoilers. <br /> <br /> Inuyasha is not a good anime. It's actually very overrated. Why? There is absolutely no story, no storyline, and the show just goes on ... and on ... and on ... It's because there are more side stories and fillings than episodes that make progress. And fillings are just the same stories that are repeated all the time. The same episodes seem to go with the same plot: Kagome sensed a jewel shard, a worm / slime / tentacle demon appeared, Inuyasha says "Wind-Scar", "Iron Reaver Soul Stealer", etc., And kills a demon, they get a jewel shard And then we just repeat this scene 160 or more times. Besides repeating episodes, there is a repetition of a comic device, and they are no longer funny anymore. Wait, they never were. Sexual harassment is not funny. See rated series Older Teens, 16+. I have no idea why they rated it. There's nothing wrong with the so-called humorous sexual harassment, which is somewhat suggestive and that might arrest you these days. Now it is how we know that Inuyasha is overrated. Video games. Everyone sucks. Especially the game Mask. I played it in my friend's house. It was nothing interesting. The game was slow, boring and had Nintendo 64 as graphics. In the magazine he received a 4/10 rating and said, "... this role-playing game is slower than a milk shake moving through a cocktail straw." . COLOR BOOKS! We thought Inuyasha was 16+! Maybe not ... But after I was a member of Inuyasha on MSN, about half of the people there were 10 to 13. I think Inuyasha is just a little anime boy. (I think only a small bit of editing on this show, it might be shown to Toonami.) There are over 40 volumes of manga. I can only help, but I wonder how many kilometers of forests that have been cut to make them. Sad ... <br /> <br /> Then there's music. Music is so unpleasant. We hear the same 5 songs each episode. After 10 episodes, the music is really unpleasant. In other anime, they have music to fit in the mood and we don't hear some songs very often. There are about 15 different Inuyasha soundtracks. Don't waste money on garbage! And how do you think I know all this? Because I was a fan of Inuyasha. I'm ashamed of myself. Instead, I'd rather watch Kim Possible or Pokemon. Sadly, these two shows have more romance between the two main protagonists than ever Inuyasha will have ...
