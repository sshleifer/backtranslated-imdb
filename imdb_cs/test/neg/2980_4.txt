Not finding the right words is a problem in this urban vaudeville comedy. They do not know what to say and do not know how to say it, so they embark on a potentially humiliating venture of pre-agreed speed dating. Unfortunately, they all came across cardboard figures rather than real people. The story follows the conventional structure of three acts: to get acquainted with the great cast in their lonely lives, with the actual circuit and the last section of the romantic fallout that represents some of the newlyweds' blessings. Since it is all so predictable, I would say that as a story, "Shoppen" is a failure. As a comedy, most of the time she is too goofy to be really funny. Thumbs Up Kathrin von Steinburg. It stands out from the crowd of soap operas as a reserved, independently rich Miriam. Great Makeup on Her (Verena Wei√üert): Heavy eye shadows make skin gloss shine, creating a thoughtful and bohemian but girlish effect. Thumbs Up Stefan Zinner as a Bavarian Love Machine and Tanja Schleiff as a Hot Nutritionist. It bypasses the communication challenge through the timeless language of copulation.
