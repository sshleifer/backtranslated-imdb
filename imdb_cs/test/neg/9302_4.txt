As the name suggests, in this film there is a philosophical, meritocratic thread: if one has talent and appears to be in society and money, what could be the result of being denied a lack of factor X? This question is unsatisfactorily addressed in this adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's book and left me on the road quite cold. Matt Damon is Ripley's title and besides he's embarking on a trip to Europe. falls under the spell of his commissioned goal, Dickie Greenleaf (Law). Homoeroticism and social insecurity are all entangled in a violent fire that escalates and complicates the rest of the film. The law, Damon and the damn nice Paltrow's girlfriend are fine. I liked how Philip Seymour Hoffman's actress Freddie Miles, a bluff friend, who Ripley can never be. The problem is that the story is bad without arch - or redemption, it matters - which makes it difficult to swallow. 4/10
