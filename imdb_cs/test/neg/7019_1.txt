To start, I really love Lucy. Her TV show still laughed at me. She was one of the greatest comedians who had ever lived there with Chaplin and Keaton. But her performance in this film is disappointing. She was too old, and the gauze filters on the lens made her look like a London mist refugee. She couldn't sing and her voice was so hot that she fed every song. Her dance days were long in the past. Just because you are a fan of Lucy, do not pollute this mistaken, sad performance and sing it. I prefer to remember Lucy in my beautiful TV series (I Love Lucy) and draw a curtain of charity over the horrible movie mess called "Mame".
