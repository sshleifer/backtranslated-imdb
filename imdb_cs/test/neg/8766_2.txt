The back of the DVD for this movie boasts, "Chey's Quentin Tarantino Christian Films." This is not as much an insult to Quentin as it is to Christian films. This film is poorly written, acted and edited with no purpose. The scenes take place in a confusing and unrealistic way and are scattered with a nice time-lapse photo. The shots disappear into the gray, freeze the frames to tell the time (unimportant in the story), all done with any other obvious reason than to get the film's credibility. The camera is random, some nice crane shots are cut with ridiculous clippings that have no meaning. Bad blocking and lighting leave the viewer who talks to whom in many scenes. And the sound is terrible. Special effects were decent and fortunately limited. But that's just technical. The film cannot capture the emotional level. The dialogue is so falsely sounding and the actors seem to have read it only a moment before the camera turned. The story ... things happening in the sequence have no motivation for them. The characters try to take one dimensionality. Characters must take a stance on Christianity and faith in every single scene. Take the front from M. Night, engaging Christian movies don't have to have characters who say Jesus Christ in every scene to be a Christian movie. Goodness! Please do not try to show it to your unsaved friends with different expectations than laughter.
