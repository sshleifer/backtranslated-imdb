This movie is not a comedy. It's not even funny in "this movie is so bad it's funny" department. Rather, it's just bad. Other reviewers mention poor lighting, but in addition there is an abundance of poor plastic surgery. Meanwhile, many great acting talents have been wasted in the wrong scenario and in an uninteresting direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It is hard to feel compassion for any of them). It's also hard to see four characters as close friends. It seems that only a few women are throwing together, pretending to be close. I will not list all the problems with this movie because it does not deserve much of one's attention. (It's not worth looking at).
