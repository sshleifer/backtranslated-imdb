Two little girls striking a friendship. One tries to convince others that he is a witch. The second is the pushover, which bends to the will of the witch. On and on the film stretches with a senseless interaction between the two girls, with many dramatic cut offs because they pose "shocking" questions. You know, kind little children shouldn't ask, like, "How do you agree with the devil?" Oooh ... haunted. Finally, pushover is sick of being controlled by his wizard friend. Her belief that her friend is a witch leads to a tragic end. But by the time it comes, you won't worry the least. I can imagine that this film could be scary for a Mexican movie viewer in the 1960s, but it won't even last, a charming relic. It's just pulling. It's boring. It's useless. Must not be monitored. There are many people who have a lot of good things to do about it, based on their director's knowledge of other works, and of course, every common denominator everyone says about pointless films: "Oh, cinema is amazing!" These reviewers are probably right. But for those who have found this film without prior knowledge, who do not care about its "photography", its "atmosphere" or its ... anything else - for those viewers who just want a good movie that will entertain them an hour and a half, do yourself a favor, folks: <br /> <br /> Skip.
