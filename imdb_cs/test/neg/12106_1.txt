I don't even know where to start. I did not like it. It did not behave like a story and so much was put into the movie (mugs, son was gay (?) The murder was justified, what possible reason might exist in the script for Linda aka Penelope) that existed. he never explained. It was a liquid spilled on the table and dripping from the counter until there was a big mess on the floor. Why did Vanessa Redgrave do five seconds? Why did Diane Wiest use her bullets over a Broadway character without camp fun? Why did Birken start in the story. The list is endless. The film is over and we all looked at each other - like - did you understand something of this? I told you one thing when I watched my long-lost dad assassinate I would definitely not want to embrace a killer. Say one more thing if "Bob" broke up with "Bob", what purpose was he supposed to hide his son in the closet? Will Bob have sex with Bob in front of his son? How did the killer connect so easily with his son? <br /> <br /> If this review sounds confused, it's because it was a waste of film, talent and time. What the hell did the dead do to do with something! Jezz, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, because it should be / could be better, stronger and make sense. Some sense. Instead, we get watered "Wonder" (a 70s movie with murder) and tired performances that read boring words from a script that is totally crazy. Or maybe the rest of the people who checked this movie are too stupid to understand it - I think it's a French film.
