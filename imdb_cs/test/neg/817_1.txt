I say it. If you want to see art, you go to the art gallery. If you want to see the movie, you go to the theater. Trying to intertwine art and film is disastrous in "Where is the Heart". An interesting cast is absolutely useless in this embarrassment. You like Dabney Coleman, see "Short Time". You like Crispin Glover, see "Bartleby". You like Uma Thurman, see "Kill Bill". Above all, if you like Christopher Plummer, see "The Silent Partner" because his character here is a terrible embarrassment. This whole production is actually embarrassment. Of course, human works of art are interesting for a few minutes, so make a short, but do not subject the audience to pointless nonsense, fancy movies. - MERK
