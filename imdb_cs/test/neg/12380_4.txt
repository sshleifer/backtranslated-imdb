Personally, I have no problem with acting or a script. I have a problem with a giant bird. It was just amazing. Simple and simple. The first impulse is that one laughs when we see it. What did they think! The budget is damn. The monster bird was a monstrous joke. Of course, in my opinion, if producers could get actors like Ankrum, Corday and Morrow, then people of special effect should come up with a much better beast. Oh, good. What's going on is done. This will be the case of an eternal joke that was unintentional.
