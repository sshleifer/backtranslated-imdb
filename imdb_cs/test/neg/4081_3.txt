Evan Almighty continues the mainstream series Bruce Almighty, this time with a journalist who became a congressman from Buffalo, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell). God (Morgan Freeman), who is totally harmless (and not even self-doubtful), decides to push some sort of search on Baxter to illustrate the importance of ... mutual kindness so that Baxter can "change the world" (aka, pay it forward ). Think about Evan Almighty as a healthy derivative of "Dear Sirs". Baxter is not a con, but his colleague, Congressman Long (John Goodman) wants his unquestionable support to a bill that is basically harmful to the environment. And well-meaning Baxter, knowing the importance of networking and visibility, is willing to support it. Besides, more responsibility comes with the new work, and Baxter is, in a sense, defamed for spending enough time with his family. So God decides to give Evan Baxter some clue by making him become Noah's modern day. His orders: to build an ark. Except that it may be slightly funny to see Baxter's transformation into a "whiskey with a beard", it doesn't seem to make sense for this whole thing, which becomes much clearer when the culmination of film noise. (SPOILERS: if none of the populations is killed by the "flood", then what was the point of summoning the animals ... or at least those that apparently weren't from suburban Virginia? Or more importantly, if all Baxter had to realize Long's projects had questioned its quality, so why had to build a sheet?). So, although such a comedy may not be a hysterical laugh - a rebellion, it was certainly one much less entertaining because it was filled with too many homilies (and not all of Morgan Freeman) and action that seemed to be for film more epic events.
