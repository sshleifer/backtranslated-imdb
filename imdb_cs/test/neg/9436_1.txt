You will feel that you have experienced a holiday in hell after you have sat down and watched this horrible TV movie. This movie is an exaggerated (very bad replay) exercise that has become more than what they are. I'm not going to give away the story, but once you realize why people in this movie are running from a native person in the movie, you'll want two wasted hours of your life. The only plus is to see Marcia Brady running around in a bikini!
