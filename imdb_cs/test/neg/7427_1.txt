Perhaps the worst of the "Nemesis" movies (and that says A LOT!), This mess contains so many flashbacks for Part 2 that you could also say that you both saw them, even if you did. . Worse are two wisecracking cyborgs that have no fun value. In other words, they are perfect for this infinitely boring film mistake.
