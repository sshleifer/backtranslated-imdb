I must admit that I was against this film from the beginning, but I tried to be the hardest to be impartial, I really did, but the very idea of ​​reworking a sophisticated, witty, fun, unpredictable British classic must be doubtful. beginning. People in my house watched it, so I swallowed my pride and told myself that I'd be a movie professional (eventually I studied it in the Uni.) <br /> <br /> As Expecting the American movie of this kind begins with a movie that wasn't bad. Indeed, many of the action sequences are trustworthy, and this alone lifts the mark. Yet the characterization was abysmal, set-pieces could be very easily linked from any American blockbuster you could have. misfortune to watch and miss all the characters. The sloping angle to the original movie with the failed initial robbery seemed, the American version makes a predictable thing and introduces an emotional factor with Donald's Death Sutherland character. This allows our American cousins ​​a lot of opportunities for sophisticated, dewy eyes, vengeance against "criminals" that they love for predictable excesses. It is never as obvious as in the scenes representing Charlize Theron (oh quite! Oh so pretty! Look at her pretty, wounded Bambi eyes, everyone!) That have been thoroughly nauseating. Her input scene, in particular, was like something from Resident Evil or Tomb Raider, which were both fun and b) had better starts because they couldn't play the game as it could be with a British cinema that was already full. sparks, people for whom you really feel something and inspiration. But I turn away, the whole inclusion of a pretty girl because of her seems like the most appropriate maneuver I've ever seen and reveals a cynical Hollywood blockbuster - lust for what it is. <br /> <br By the way, if you like any of these actors, and agree to any of the above comments, DO NOT SHOW THIS FILM! If I had the chance to watch 'Fight Club' or 'American History X' after I saw Ed Norton in it, I'd refuse. Like Jason Statham with "Lock Stock" (and I suppose "Transporter" is fine if you like something like that). Unfortunately, all sets are designed in the most transparent way to think, 'Wow! He's smart! ',' Coo! He's fine! "," Hey! What a tough guy! “. Then there's a "funny PC guy" who has "comic relief" stained across his forehead, but whose humor content can be expected two minutes in advance. To be honest if you have seen one or two movies like this, you can easily confuse two as clones from Jerry Bruckheimer's stable. By the way, Jerry is incredibly horrible, but he only uses cliché to make surplus, as everyone knows (or should). This is where I have to come clean. I failed to finish so I couldn't even say if the brilliant ending in Michael Caine's version did, but I'm sorry, it's just one of those extremely rare movies that, when I saw it in the cinema, I went out and held a small protest. It's not just that it's another identical number that is steel 14 or something else (Ocean's Eleven was okay, but don't bother with the rest!) With all the glitter, glamor, false sassy, ​​and pantomime heroes of the film, he knew nothing at all. So, if you expect "Italian work" and not "OCEAN'S 14", though poorly written with less established actors and characters, some shameful elements and cardboard cutout scenarios will NOT be KNOW! I don't mind people like a little mindless fun, but that's a criminal hatchet-work that doesn't deserve a show under the name of the classics in any way. Seriously, show some pride! When I first heard that the film would be made, I felt in my indignant and frantic reaction. Avoid at all costs! <br /> <br /> P.S. Some of the action sequences are not bad at all, add "1" to the tag if you like it.
