Staying alive is a horror movie about a video game that kills people just as they die inside the game. Friends who play this game soon will find it, and then realize they have to beat the Blood Countess from the video game or accept their fates. We had videotapes in The Ring, a deadly website in FearDotCom. Now it's on video games. Staying alive makes some things well; character development is a bit deeper than it would be in a horror movie. We really see some of the characters and the past and get to know them quite well, so viewers can get some emotions for them. The film is also very exciting. The film often has exciting, nervous moments, accompanied by disturbing, scary music. There are plenty of jumps and rumors for the viewer. This can be perfect once or twice, but these fake fears that Hollywood seems to enjoy overplaying in horror movies nowadays, wearing thin in staying alive. The camera will tend to provide sharp angles or rapid flashes to allow viewers to look quickly at the demon or witch and try to scare them with this sudden explosion on the screen. Why? Gore is obviously very weak due to the film's certificate. The script to stay alive is very curvy and quite ridiculous, and the characters tend to play too melodramatic and dim. Also, clich√©s come from all directions, for example, people who roam themselves in search of strange noise, or when they notice characters in the dark, they go and explore. However, the computer graphics used for video game segments are quite impressive and look colorful and sharp, working well with other parts of the movie. But overall, it's just not enough to stick to this movie. It will be just over a hundred minutes away and it won't be a battle to stay alive, but stay up.
