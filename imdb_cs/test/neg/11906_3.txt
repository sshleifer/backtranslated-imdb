There is a certain irony in the parody of the Gothic genre, which is transformed into a cliché of the clichés of filmmakers who did not know what a story was or did not care about at all. All the signs of your average family movie are contemporary younger siblings, a grumpy teenager who doesn't want to move, unsympathetic parents who can't see the revelation, and of course a romantic subplot. The film has little to do with Wilde's original story, which was largely written to entertain melodramatic Gothic newspapers that were all rage at the time. If he saw Wilde this version, he would probably laugh - and then of course he wrote a parody. We can only hope that the children who watched this bland, mass-produced pap eventually discovered the joke and spark of the original version.
