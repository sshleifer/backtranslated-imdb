OK, so I know better than watching SciFi movies. . . er, sorry. . . SyFy. Or shifafa. Or what it is now. So get the fuck. I spent the whole Saturday consulting advisory for a non-profit organization. I may be forgiven for having plunged into a chair and wanted to look at a movie I never saw, rather than reading Proust in the original or learning to play oud. <br /> <br /> What to say, I don't deserve Open Graves. I didn't see it from it. Were there any? I overslept? Why is it called? <br /> <br /> Some icky visual effects. There are not many. As with too many films in modern horror movies, there are no reasons to care for any of these people in addition to shared humanity. Half a point for a ruthless businessman who was clich√© but had one good scene. It's all like games like Final Destination, which are played through board games. The game has an interesting look at it, and it includes one of my favorite old puzzles. I'll give it so much. The downside is that the game has more personality than most characters. <br /> <br /> As for the end, if you haven't seen it, then I think you fell asleep. Somewhere around the dawn of the genre.
