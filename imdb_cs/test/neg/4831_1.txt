Wait till you look at this .... I mean even after reading this review. No other film sucked in more than this .... The one thing I used to understand is that when you copy some English movies, why add your own creativity? With the amount spent on making this film, producers should consider buying "Cellular" rights to be dubbed into Hindi and released. Maybe they got some profits somehow. If it were possible to rate this movie with 0, I would do it and the nicest performances come from Tanushree Datty and the girl who played sidekick on Aftab. I do not know if my problem is that I have seen Cellular much earlier than this movie ..... but it cannot be a reason to support this movie ... I could go for hours but neither do I have time to discuss this useless The bullshit movie that I don't want to remember those horrible movie scenes ..... <br /> <br /> Please stay away from this movie.
