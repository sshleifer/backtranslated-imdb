Look, some movie got into the worst. I suggest it be India Song. When I saw the film in 1976, it was played at Carnegie Hall, where people often worked on film. From the halfway point, people just flooded the theater. My girlfriend wouldn't let us go, but in the end the theater was virtually empty. I told people that they left that "a good part is still coming." And that was it. The good part was the screen at the end, which said "fin." It was the only good part. I am still annoying this film 24 years later. It was useless, stupid and derived (Marienbad, part 2). You see it only if you want to spend endless two hours of learning to distinguish between mere and just terrible ones.
