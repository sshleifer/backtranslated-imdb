In XXII. A century-old architect named Merchant (Bruce Ramsay) commands the space station he personally designed. As can be predicted, a special force is sent so that the expensive station can re-conquer and put Merchant in custody. Upon arrival, he discovers that he is participating in a strange ritual using a mysterious cube. During the interrogation, he tells him that he must let him finish what he has started, otherwise the hell he has released will redeem in his blood ... To convince the officers holding him in captivity, he remembers his inheritance, the toymaker who built the box and the reasons Why He Is Here in the Universe ... <br /> <br /> A film that is basically the same as Hellraiser, The Quickening was for Highlander. Something that should be ignored and forgotten will not affect the Hellraiser tradition much. By far the most surprising of the series with a much lower impression than its predecessors (who pretend to be class B or C films). <br /> <br /> It seems that the action sometimes affects the medium budget porn-movie with the wooden incredible performances you actually think: So when do they undress and begin to contact? Surprisingly, not much sex in the movie, even though the performance of the seducer-demon Angelique (a totally redundant figure who unnecessarily spoils what we know from the Hellraiser world), offers plenty of opportunities for making love. The film basically consists of three suddenly inserted separate stories (one in the future, one in the present and one in the past) that are not interested and are rushed in amateur fashion. The end result is extremely poor, basically underlined by the fact that you are not interested in what happens to any of the characters in the film. Some decent gore in the movie, but in contrast, complete failure.
