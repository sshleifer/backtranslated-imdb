When I did not read the original book or saw an earlier film and actually didn't know anything about the story or the contemporary films, I came to this movie with an open mind. It's really hard to know where to start commenting on a movie because the whole thing seems so confused. Looks like there's a point or message in the movie, or something in the movie, but what's still totally unclear. The effects were fantastic and very well rated. The idea was set really well with motivation for time travel clearly. However, it was downhill from here. <br /> <br /> Throughout the journey, there seems to be only a vague connection to the quest that was set at the beginning. There are some nice ideas, but there seem to be isolated events that really don't flow and the movie seems to be incoherent and lost. At one point one asks whether the main story in the film is the fate of the moon. When Hartdegen arrives in 802 701 AD, the film becomes very frustrating because it seems to be unable to discover anything important about Eloi, and although it seems clear that there is something to be Find out what is still unpleasantly elusive. This is a strange change from earlier times travel and one wonders why it all suddenly became abandoned for what looks like a whole new story. So many things happen that there should be an explanation, but there is no discovery. Indeed, I really wanted to know what that movie meant to "get to" what was there to reveal, but without success. When I read a summary of what was going on in this book at the moment, it seemed to be a very unreal attempt to make it in the movie, but it was so simplified and "confused" that the meaning and context lost them completely. Just as we hope to finally find out where it all leads, the film suddenly makes another significant change and becomes a thoughtless action film without any real action. It is as if the director simply gave up the harassment at this point to give some meaning to the film. Countless important things are now happening without significant explanations. Hartdegen does not take the opportunity to return to the past on two occasions for any reason, and then suddenly loses all interest in time travel without reason. The film comes to a sudden end because Hartdegen decides to stay with Eloi. <br /> <br /> In short, after a good start, the film is very disappointing. Too much time is devoted to Hartdegen's adventures before coming up with Eloi. However, the worst part of the film is what I think is the most important part: setting up a situation with Eloi. The whole point is completely omitted and it undermines the rest of the film. Then the film focuses too much on effects and action, and all attempts to return to the meaning and core of the film seem to be forced and out of place. With so many things happening without explanation, the film seems to be lost and losing direction. However, the final in which Hartdegen has decided that he no longer cares about time travel is inexplicable. Finally, the whole movie looked like a collection of unattached incidents. The meaning and context were lost, although the gaping hole where it was supposed to be was very obvious. What was so frustrating about it was that there was obviously so much potential here: it was by no means a bad movie, it could have been so much better. The start was very promising, travel time seemed fantastic and it would work if it didn't happen on the tangent, and Hartdegen's Eloi experience could have worked so easily if a few correct questions had been asked, and if not, such a dumb down temptation and simplification . I wish I had a time machine so I could travel in time and consult the mistakes that were made.
