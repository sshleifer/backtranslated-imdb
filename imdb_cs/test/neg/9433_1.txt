Meet Cosmo (Jason Priestley), a jerky young bookmaker with his boring life screaming crowd numbers and living in a sharp cellar apartment in the center of seniors. His only recreation is watching TV and an occasional experience with his unpredictable prostitute friend Honey (Janeane Garofalo). But one day, all these changes, when the crowd boss is killed and Cosmo's well-intentioned, is chosen by the smooth and persuasive new boss Gordon (Robert Loggia) to become a full-fledged hitman. It is an offer that the unwilling Cosmo cannot repeat, cannot refuse, and he quickly trades in his material, lonely existence for a vengeance crash under the supervision of gangster veteran Steve (Peter Riegert), a relaxed, suburban bon vivant who enjoys a maximum wage hours and minimum hours. Cosmo will surprise himself and mentor Steve by showing a completely unusual talent for his work. Although he never touched the gun earlier, Cosmo proves that he is both a shooter and an initial wave of moral hesitation. Soon, Cosmo broadcasts dead clients with speed and style, and his natural pistol atmosphere quickly determines him as an invaluable addition to Gordon's crowd. Cosmo, massaged by Honey, admits that she feels a little nervous and recommends that she practice yoga for rest. Cosmo takes the advice and joins a nearby yoga class taught by a beautiful young woman named Jasmine (Kimberly Williams). Cosmo is immediately taken with the kind and gentle Jasmine, who will soon withdraw to Cosmo. Now that she can get rid of her annoying, offensive friend Randy (Josh Charles), maybe she and Cosmo can start something. Cosmo, using some of the "skills" of his new business, eventually convinces Randy to disappear and his relationship with Jasmine takes off. Writer / director M. Wallace Wolodarksy, double Emmy Award- winner for his work on "The Tracy Ullman Show" and "The Simpsons" created a screenplay linking his three genre loves: "I love comedy, gangster Movies and Romance, "Wolodarsky explained," so I basically broke all three of them all to create this movie. "But what came up is the movie so incoherent and unlikely that it looks like a very long sketch on Saturday Night Live. It is a monotonous tone that does not correspond to the fact that it is humorous because they underline the fact that a lot of money has been spent on a vehicle for Jason Priestly, so that his nice image of a man who fails can become quite successful. his character is not like a nerd but like a laconic zombie. Nerd can be naive, but nerd has a passion. Passion for internally focused things. But the priest plays his character as a mentally deficient, almost anti-Forrest Gump. Unfortunately, "Coldblooded" has no sense of range to actually BE anti-Forrest Gump. Peter Riegert (the local hero, the animal house) is changing his usual performance and Kimberly Williams is doing his best to work, but Janeane Garofalo (HBO's Larry Sanders Show) is virtually useless in her role as friend Cosmo. Probably not long. Garofalo has all the enthusiasm and charm of an apple waiting to be picked up, and it's just a matter of time before a foul role is given, hopefully he'll do with the Marisa Tomei team. <br /> <br />
