ASTROESQUE (2 outta 5 stars) <br /> <br /> I have no idea what is supposed to ... even less of what is in this movie in the middle of the time ... I still wonder. This is a low, low-budget "El Mariachi" movie made in 16mm ... and for what's worth, the pictures are very well composed and visually stylish. Directed, written and played by comic writer / artist Michael Allred ... I think it's no surprise that the movie looks good. Unfortunately, some of the actors are bad ... and the rest is competent at best. Allred leaves the best of himself ... but just because he doesn't really talk much. Most of the time, he's just trying to look cool ... or run out of crazed blushes trying to kill him. The sound is also bad enough ... almost as if it was unfinished ... maybe they couldn't afford to pay for the music they were planning to use? A strange, vaguely science-fictional plot ... similar to tones like "The Man Who Fell on Earth" ... but most of the film boils down to the standard run-from-the-bad-guys and kills-is-before -I- Kill You Fence. Finally too sloping to be successful, but not without interest in adventurous movie viewers.
