I really like Ryan Reynolds and Hope Davis and I actually had great hopes to watch this last night on DVD. Especially because I'm trying to avoid reviews until I look at myself and create my own opinion Big mistake! My 2/10 is for the first segment, which is fairly fairly decent, and if they made a movie about the characters in Section 1 itself, it could be above 5/10. As soon as he moved to the reality TV show, the territory that was spreading over the high sky. Ryan Reynolds captured the essence of the actor on the edge, but as a gay television writer and famous game creator / dedicated family man he was definitely less effective. From the box enhancements, I expected a flashback thriller in the spirit of 'Memento' - unfortunately it is nowhere near the film standard.
