MacBeth, I always thought it was most accessible from Shakespeare's 'Great Period' games. Compact, focused, with plenty of violence, it was supposed to be a game that is most open to editing on screen. I don't know the story is really good, but the best thing is to make Orson Welles a strong version of the drawstring. We must add Connery / Baxendale to the MacBotches list. (It seems that it wasn't a 'film adaptation' at all, but a TV version that received theatrical releases, Luhrman's Romeo + Juliet and Branagh's Hamlet, which might explain some of his shortcomings, but doesn't excuse is.) It starts well, with a wild battle sequence with pleasing grisly witches. Poor Gray Malkin and Paddock are cut out of the opening scene, but they haven't been alone for a long time. In rapid succession, they are joined by the bloodied Sargent and his description of the battle, the betrayal of Thane Cawdor, the helpless tiger master Tiger, even MacBeth's meeting with Duncan when he is invested as Cawdor. All of them had the virtues that pushed themselves as a trumpet of angels who rushed against the dark damnation of their sending, but sent them. These are not single slices. That's MacBeth in a hurry. Since the opening battle, we've been right into MacBeth's encounter with witches, which is well done. Curiously, Brian Blessed has directed witch sequences and has great fun with special effects, as MacBeth and Banquo talk about their lives. Jason Connery as MacBeth is awkward, obviously not sure what he thinks of the verse. Graham MacTavish as Banquo, on the other hand, is capable, so his lines are natural and easy. Within minutes of Connery's muttering, the viewer is struck by the urge to see the roles reversed and MacTavish in the title role. No wonder MacBeth felt he needed to kill him. These first few minutes mark the top of the movie. From there we moved to Helena Baxendale, who received the word of her husband. She is just as lost as Connery, and denied the beard that she is hiding. Her evil evil "Unsex me here" is embarrassing, not disturbing. There are some reasonably clever touches - MacBeth's "We'll Talk Beyond" is not a sign of his hesitation in the face of his wife's evil ambition, but his attempt to silence her prattling as she tosses it on the bed. <br /> <Br /> The effect of conductors is greatest. Connery's method is to look glazed on the screen while murmuring his monologues over his voice. Baxendale looks slim and neurotic. Trying to do something interesting with "It's a dagger" - a fantastic dagger is a shadow thrown across the altar - it falls flat because of Connery's bad delivery and the sloppy direction that mars through. We will escort Lady MacBeth back to the murder chamber, where he gets to stab the reviving Duncan, but the effect is comical, not dramatic. Great scenes are spoiled - Banquo's appearance at the feast is made incomprehensible through attempts to blend a subjective rendition of MacBeth's deception with what he sees around him or not. The second encounter with witches is even less coherent and prophetic visions are confusing. Timing seems to be a problem here - Banquo's banquet is the center of the game, but the film moves quickly to a conclusion after it, which is an unbalanced feeling and no room for the intricacies of MacBeth's puzzles is caught in being appreciated, or His descent into madness is compelling. Another major step is the scene where Malcolm tests MacDuff and MacDuff learns about the murder of his family. It robs its vengeance of most of its emotional power - and character a lot of screen time. He's a virtual alien when he turns to kill MacBeth. <br /> <br /> The point he is trying to. MacTavish's Banquo earns more. He picks up more for the first few minutes. But that's it. Since then, it is the sound and fury of blah blah blah.
