Okay, I saw Ninja anger. It is not something I would recommend to people who are not serious about Japanese martial movies. It is a kind of Japanese ninja fighting film, with a complex plot. It's about these 3 old ninja schools that had these 3 "Swords of Sorcery". I saw the subtitle version (NO recommended, it's something you would miss something) and I wasn't really good at it. It had some good scenes, but in general it wasn't my idea.
