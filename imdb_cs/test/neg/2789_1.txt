According to the budget information on this website, Dark Harvest had an estimated budget of $ 130,000. Where this money was spent, I'm not entirely sure. Let's see ... costumes ... no ... locations and sets ... hmmm, I think not ... special f / x ... NO ... acting lessons ... ah, well. The Dark Harvest tells the epic story of a young man who inherits a family farm in the hills of West Virginia. His girlfriend talks to him to marry his friends and check the place. As soon as our fearless hero learns that his great-grandfather has used a unique method to grow his crops, and now is time for revenge. Killer Scarecrows Take Revenge! Ewww scary. Well, no. We all know that there were some amazing movies made with very little money, but this is not one of them. This film contains to some extent some of the worst games and dialogues I've ever seen. Terrible clich√©s with terrible birth. All in all, you must not be fooled by avoiding half a decent cover and at all costs. I would like to give filmmakers at least D- for a try, but I'm afraid they didn't even do a good job with it. GRADE: F
