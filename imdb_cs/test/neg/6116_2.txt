Worst Wrestlemania ever. It wasn't supposed to be seen, seizures and a lot of bullshit about it. It took place in Las Vegas and WWE did that its employees dress like Egyptian gods! They even changed the name of Howard Finkels to Finkus Maximus, which probably doesn't mean anything. Even today, a look at Jim Ross's vision of those horrible clothes brings me nightmares and I am 21 years old, so you can imagine it when I was seven! But Bobby Heenan was fun. Matches included The Undertaker vs. Giant Gonzales in ap * ss matches, The Headshrinkers vs Steiner Brothers in a useless match, Doink vs Crush in a comedy match and a boring match featuring Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund. Hulk Hogan teamed up with Brutus Beefcake to battle Money Inc. He could clearly see that Hogan had a black eye. In the story the purposes of Ted DiBias and the IRS defeated Hogan while he was playing poker or something like that in casinos, which is a poor story, but in fact, Macho man Randy Savage hit Hogan because Savage thinks he's like The Hulk (no pun intended) ) Not a wrestler, but a movie character. The main event consisted of Bret 'Hitman' Hart, who stood against Yokozuna in a very dull match of the main event. Mr. Fuji threw salt into Hart's face and Yoko won, but not until Hogan came down and squashed Yoko in 21 seconds. <br /> <br /> Total grade - E
