Good actors, good director, well done, well-directed, but ... Where is the movie? Do they have a script or just improvised? At least it's a short film (only 80 minutes, including credits). There's nothing going on in this movie, nothing at all. A few small drug dealers caught in little time, but you never have a clue about what's going on or what they're talking about in some movie sequences. Tons of "f *** 's" and "maternal *****' s" but nothing else ... <br /> <br /> For people who love Abel Ferrara movies like The Funeral, 'R Xmas it will be a great disappointment as it was for me. What was he thinking about? Did he really think it was a good movie? And if not, why did he do it?
