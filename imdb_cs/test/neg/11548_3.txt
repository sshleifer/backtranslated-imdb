This unintentionally entertaining TV movie from the mid-1980s is based on the assumption that Donna Mills (in a largely scary wardrobe) is a neglected housewife who chooses as a cheerleader for her sexy past. She escapes from her empty life by fantasizing about random sexual encounters with one of the many attractive men she encounters, and finally puts herself into her fantasies and gives herself a little on her side, though all she really wants is to reign of the passion flames with her. boring husband James Brolin. There are many ridiculous aspects of this movie, Mills is the first foray into co-produce (later, after her departure from Knots Landing, she found great success as the kitschy queen of the TV movie) in most of the nineties played mostly in Melodrama of the Week - Usually played a sacrifice of some sort, clearly determined to wash the hands of a gloriously sinister and entertaining teammate who had been playing the knots for so long. The funniest are stretched fantasy sequences filmed as they should be soft-core porn (wind and smoke machines, backlighting, porn music), but because it's a network TV movie, the scenes are very chaste and ultimately not. very sexy. The funniest (and bizarre) scene has a Mills walk on the wild side of the center between pointed hair punks (complete with Robert Palmer's soundtrack). Less ridiculous is the horrible dialogue that cartoons are forced to pronounce (the pity of poor Cicely Tyson as a mandatory psycho-analyst, or Veronica Cartwright as a compulsory best friend, or even pre-Babs James Brolin with this daily style Of course, as with all these kinds of movies, we learn that all problems can be solved by psycho-therapy and then the film becomes stupid as we examine, briefly, the reasons why Mills's "shocking" behavior (as if it wasn't just that he wanted a good shit!) <br /> <br /> Vacuum.
