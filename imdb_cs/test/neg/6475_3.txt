Chris Ricci goes through most of it, but then he's not bored and contemptuous - just like I was watching. Without it, it would be nothing but a film for cheap kids, but at least it adds quality air. There are few, if any, more visually striking and charismatic young actresses in business. It's not too bad if you accept it for what it is - cheap Disney re-doing the goal for very undemanding children. I could watch Ricci all day so I probably didn't notice the many shortcomings of the movie, but if you're also a Ricci fan, a cat lover, or a very young child, I doubt you will like it.
