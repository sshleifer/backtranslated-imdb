... OK, small town, helpless sheriff? Control. Sheriff's hot daughter? Control? No, the unhappy friend of the Sheriff's hot daughter, who the sheriff hates? Control. Corporate land developer who hatefully gives profit over people? Control. The developer is a rank-and-file accidentally unleash a primordial monster, then is under pressure to cover it up? Control. Natives warn of mass death and destruction if things don't go back as they were? Control. Amateurish CGI Special Effects That Could Be Made By Commodore 64? Control. Seriously, virtually all of the clich√©s of your typical Sci-Fi Original movie have been concentrated in both classic and bad movies. The only one missing is a scientist / expert trying to pass on his knowledge; There is a paleontologist with three students who get ambushed by my bone eater quite early in the movie, but they are basically accessories in the movie. And I can honestly say that I anticipated it all; except for who survives and who doesn't (although I have to say that I have a real death time for one of the characters for about an hour). I swear I could do this movie myself if they gave me all the characters. Despite all this, the movie is fun to watch if for a different reason than to play MST3K with your friends. If you're for some mindless fun, it's a great movie to watch, which is why I give this movie a surprisingly decent 4, though for all intents and purposes it deserves a much, much lower ranking. But then you shouldn't tune in to SciFi Original if you were looking for a movie with real storylines, important characters or good special effects, right?
