I've rented some bad movies in the last 5 years ... deliberately. I see that I'm trying to be a film reviewer, and horrible movies appear every year as we all know. Anyway, about 3 months ago I rented it. I watched it all the way ... and shouted loudly. This is one of those movies that's so crazy you want to vomit. Actually, it felt sick in the stomach. I've seen a lot of bad movies (Mystery Science Theater 3000 anyone?), But this takes the cake. The plot was hard to follow, the illumination was terrible and the sounds almost inaudible. If a negative rating appeared on the scale, this movie would be -11 for me. This may seem strange, but I recommend. It's something you have to see for yourself ... but don't say I didn't warn you. I don't think this report could be more accurate, so I did it now. <br /> <br />
