Do you think the film about the incestuous sisters who eventually murdered their employer couldn't help but be smart, but then you'd be wrong. There is no conspiracy. There is no character development. There is no redemption of visual beauty. This movie is a waste of time. Examining how a nurse relationship develops is zero, their sexuality is never anything but grotesque, class relations are overlooked and the employer is a silly cartoon. there is no same depth of meaning.
