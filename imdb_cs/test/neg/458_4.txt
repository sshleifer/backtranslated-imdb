After the breakthrough point of NIGHT MUST FALL, Robert Montgomery (most of the time) has gotten into his best films and performances: HERE ACCEPT MR. JORDAN, ARE GREAT, LADY ON RIDING, RIDE WITH HORSE, SAXON CHARM, JUNE BRIDE. Even some of the failures in which they were, were interesting enough to be still observable (RAGE IN HEAVEN, MR. AND MRS. SMITH). But Montgomery wanted to do more and more production and direction work. In 1949, he did his last film performance - played by Collier Lang, an egoistic movie star who is drawn into helping the authorities investigate a young girl's friend. this film is a minority view. Most of the views expressed are favorable. I thought it was a boring, toothless scenario, with Ann Blyth's heroine, not as attractive as a character. He admires Montgomery as a star and it "helps" when he is called to help the authorities, but after a while, I find that there is no chemistry between them. The script was also fun, although Montgomery and Roland Winters tried it. All I can remember is that Taylor Holmes is the rich father of Blyth and is an admirer of Winston Churchill. So he always dresses like Churchill and we see him wearing a wide-brimmed hat, smoking a big cigar and painting (Holmes's bald head helps in disguise). That was the most memorable joke of this movie - not much real memory. Montgomery went into early television and eventually gained the attention and respect he always deserved in the movies. His last contact with movies was his director THE GALLANT HOURS about Admiral William "Bull" Halsey, starring his friend Jimmy Cagney. It's a much better film than this. For my overall film and television career I will give this average movie "4". That hits me so generously.
