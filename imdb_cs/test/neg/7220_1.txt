This TV show is an idiotic waste of time if you want to learn about animals watching a discovery channel. If you want to watch nincompoops <br /> on TV just watch MTV. MTV stands for music television <br /> <br /> not nitwit D-listers preforming retarded skits or brothers' crying <br /> <br /> their hearts out for not getting BMW for the 16th birthday. I bet if you like this show, I bet you love viva la bam, and jackass huh? I think my IQ was watching this show. <br /> <br /> This is a combination of two jackass and animal planet shows. Some people think it's a good combination. On the other hand, I think it's a retardant. And if you notice his much like jackass <br /> <br /> and viva la bam <br /> <br /> just a note, this show is terrible
