When I first watched this movie, I loved it in the 1980s. I was absolutely fascinated by music, dance ... everything. But recently I watched the whole thing on DVD again and I was totally taken aback by how immensely stupid the story was - how it contained holes, discrepancies, and - frankly - a lot of crap - and how terrible the dance was. She would never get into the ballet in a realistic world ... The whole thing was quite pathetic. The development of the characters also lacked depth. I think it was, very much, a product of the 80's: the film is not holding today!
