The best thing about this movie is that it seems that they used a lot of things from Pearl Harbor's attack on Tora Tora. My favorite was the P-40 shot that crashed into a row of parked P-40s, but it was shooting from the top of the hangar or crane. Unfortunately, it just gets worse. There are two blacks and two white boys like American prisoners of war, as well as some Philippine prisoners of war and Japanese guards. The organizer of POW Americans is a white naval lieutenant who is of course in the O-3 Navy. In any case, he needs to cut, sharply, embarrassed. Hockey hair does not belong to the film of World War II. And he's a racist. He does not want to share "negros". Of course, he wouldn't want to share rooms with a white petty officer in real life. I believe that the Geneva Convention has a police officers 'and non-commissioned officers' clause, but that was not there. Well, I think the plot is secondary to the other issues in this movie. He gets to his place and spends much of the rest of the film as a look out and runs a diver's air pump. But once you get there, it's not a bad story. The Japanese want scuba divers to raise silver thrown out by Americans before Corrigador fell. Philippine resistance wants them to take the time. And prisoners of war are trying to help. Potentially good story and not so bad. A bit incredible when prisoners of war use camp to swim every night between a prison camp and a Philippine village. Maybe I'm not so picky when I know it's not a blockbuster. I think that's why it comes to a 20-pack DVD war movie collection for five dollars. The 70th music did not belong to this film or any WWII movie. It's at least a little distracting. The meeting was not so bad. Probably better than I could do. I'm not a football fan, at least I've found that Jim Brown is a real person and not someone who Richard Pryor invented. That alone was worth 25 Â¢ I paid for this movie. It is worth watching on TCM or paying a quarter for. One star for a war movie, the other for World War II and more because I feel generous.
