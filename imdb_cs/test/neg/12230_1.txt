Do all fake movies require pure stupidity and lack of any kind of intelligence for humor? Is there only one really parody movie? I can only see zero-quality films that look like a few stoned high school students bored with a video camera one day. These movies are not funny, they are not smart, they are not fun, they are just useless in every conceivable way. Comebacks was a movie that tried to hide its hideous level of the basket by calling it "Sports Movie". But it is the same thing. There are several different writers for these movies, Wayans did some, Freidberg and Seltzer did some others, and I'm sure there is another couple. I can't even tell the difference in direction or humor to be honest, it seems that all the same people have written and directed them. I can't tell if Comebacks were done by people who did Scary Movie or the guys who did Epic Movie or someone else, it's just the same jokes from everyone else. <br /> <br /> If you have ANY pieces of taste or value for humor, you don't see this movie. If you have your own value, don't bother to see it. If you have any respect for filmmaking, don't even consider watching it. You don't see it in any broken, abandoned theater that could still carry it, don't rent it, buy it on Netflix or Pay-Per-View, don't do it to Redbox, and you don't even have to watch the free OD. Avoid it as a plague. The only reasons I see this movie are the following. A. Masochism. If you like torture, there are few better ways. B. When we see the main example of why to avoid ANY that says "Fox Atomic". C. You are paid considerably high amounts of cash. <br /> <br /> I would really look at the whole thing if someone offered me $ 100 on it. It's just mindless, mental torture. <br /> <br /> You can also watch Zohan.
