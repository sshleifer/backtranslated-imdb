Fun with Dick and Jane couldn't have fun on so many levels. There were free ends with writing, for example, it looks as if one of the major conflicts was the accusations of Jim Carrey's character Dick Harper, but writers never follow this particular conflict. The story is basically weak and mostly unfair, but Carrey rescues several scenes with his physical humor, but frankly, Jim Carrey wasn't very funny in this movie and Leone tea could also be just for her look because it wasn't even funny. This is just another example of Hollywood banking with franchise actors with a lousy, unoriginal story.
