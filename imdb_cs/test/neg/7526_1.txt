Wells is spinning. Undoubtedly about it. Indeed, it would be a decent sci-fi / adventure film if it wasn't based on a classic novel and directed by the author's grandson. I still heard about how this would be the definitive version of the novel. The result was pathetic and simplified bastardization. The novel is a great sci-fi story, but what many people read while reading (probably because they read it when they are very young) is missing. is that it overflows with social commentary. Eloi and Morlocks are the satire of Victorian England class honors, and the overall message of the film is that ALL TOURS AND DEGENERATES, a satirical fit of Victorian satisfaction and their belief that their civilization will last forever. There is no love story, no romance with a beautiful woman Eloi .... in the novel, Eloi are 3-foot-high baby creatures with mental ability not far above the animal's level. Time Traveler makes friends with Eloi's wife, but it is clear that he thinks he's more like a pet, and he's killed before the novel ends. This film first attempts a totally stupid backstage. "Why does he want to travel in time." Humble romance and the lessons they have to teach are enough to make movie fans vomit. The road to the future is interrupted by a future disaster. OK, that's not bad, but it would have more blows if we had the chance to see that mankind generally degenerates, just like in the book. I think more reflections of the time as the nuclear war took place in the version with George Pal. <br /> <br /> General Story? Ugh. Full distortion of the novel. Eloi are too competent and warlike. Morlocks are too intelligent. UberMorlock is embarrassed and there is no setting. He just appears in time to be killed. Yawn. Samantha Mumba does OK. Guy Pearce is one of my favorites, but he often seems confused and painful. (Allegedly he broke his rib when filming this movie.) He also looks unhealthy and too skinny, as if he was sick for a long time before he did. A sad, excused movie version of one of the world classics. H. G. Wells deserves better .... much better. <br /> <br />
