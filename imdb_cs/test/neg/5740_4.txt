I believe that in the future any movie created by the Sci fi channel and subsequently released on DVD must say that it was actually made by such a channel because I wouldn't buy it if I knew that. Not that it was all bad, but if you get lost for the middle of the movie, it just ruins the movie. This in turn makes the film somewhat boring. This one had an interesting story, but the light and extremely generic soundtrack scattered one of the movies just like most evil actors except Dien and Linda Carter. The story, vampires are on the offensive in South America, of course the rules of vampire movies aren't really that they usually aren't in any of the vampire movies I've seen lately with the exception of the Blade Trilogy. A group of soldiers is sent to fight where the team is sent to meet the team and track down a former wife of one of the soldiers ... why he's not just his wife who knows that this part of the conspiracy isn't really where. We still have an interesting boat ride, a nice jungle and lots of blood. However, this fact does not save the film from the way it jerks in its presentation, and at times it seems to be really boring. I don't know, maybe it was blood cgi, smoke and whatever it has to do now, even though the old effects look better and not worth more. I think cheap Italian zombie movies could make a bullet without a cgi, why can't we now?
