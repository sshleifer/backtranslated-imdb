"Quintet" is definitely not a movie that most people find fun or even interesting. There is no scene, dialogue, gaming or plot development that will spark a spark. The icy world is one thing, but a confused conspiracy is something you can't really carry. The characters are not only three-dimensional, they are not even one-dimensional, there are no emotions and there is no point in anything that goes on. There is a world enclosed in ice, where no one does any meaningful work except the Quintet, and the rules for the game are never even implied. The houses are not heated, nor is there electricity, but who and what produces? There is wood, but there are no animals from where the clothes or shoes come from, since there is apparently no industry and everyone is dressed as in the 16th century Europe, which is in special contrast. Not so futuristic pavilion background. The entire film seam stuck inside Altman's imagination and never bothered to share his ideas or his vision with the audience. Despair or hopelessness has nothing to do with the lack of attraction of this film, the world of "THX1138" George Lucas is no clearer place and the characters are no more fun, but the story has its way. There is no apparent or even indicated path in the Quintet, and in my opinion it does not even cause a thought about the idea behind it, such as John Boorman's "Zardoz". It's not even done in Altman's unique style, so he doesn't like his fans, and I'm one of them. All in all, Robert Altman had a dream and he woke up without telling anyone what it meant or him.
