I'm an animator myself and all around buff media, so when I saw this movie in a $ 5 bin I thought it was worth shooting to add to my collection. Although I never regret having a new addition to my animation library, this movie was definitely disappointing. <br /> <br /> Prerequisite has enough potential. A penguin named Hubie finds the perfect pebble to give the girl he loves as an engagement ring equivalent penguin, but is driven out of the evil rival and lost at sea before he gives it. He then makes another penguin to help him find his way home. This setting is not great, but it's enough to do what could be a fun adventure. Unfortunately, the use of a duo is never too different and it is all quite repeated. Most of the situations in which they find themselves are really unnoticed and lack in creativity ... and the merging of both of them is strange and forced. The animation is good, but not the usual Don Bluth norms. This is the guy who gave us the Nimh Secrets, Earth Before Time, and the American Story, all of which had attention to the details they often overcame Disney, the grandfather of animation. This doesn't mean much more than a high-end trade show. Music is fine, but quite forgotten and vocal actors are a waste of talent ... Martin Short is mainly wasted here as the main character who, despite being spoken of as a bumbler, is practically a straight man across film. In short, the film is likely to appeal to very young children, but a good family movie should appeal to all ages. unfortunately it doesn't.
