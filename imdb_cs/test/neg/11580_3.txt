A team of amateur journalists and tree disgraces captured a secret government project, the Carnivore Project on the remote South Pacific Island. Scientists are producing giant corn sizes, but genes spread to other species, creating abnormally large Komodo dragons and cobra (which is bulletproof and floats underwater). With the help of a scientific daughter can they escape from the island and tell the world? Even if I haven't seen this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel (which I, unfortunately, did) it would scream "Sci-Fi Channel" with its low production value, weak gameplay and some of the worst special effects in history. The effects here are comparable to another film of creation, "Raptor Island", though not so badly. I think there must be at least a few people working on both movies, but I didn't bother to confirm it and probably not. It will be a sad day to see one of the movies again. <br /> <br /> Which doesn't mean it's not pleasant. I watched it with my sister's friend at two in the morning and I can't talk for him, but I thought it was a pretty good time. The whole thing is just as bad, it's a fun picture if you want to make fun of movies and the scientist's daughter is so attractive to the movie (I believe the actress's name is Michelle Borth). Michael Pare also appears to be the captain of the ship, and his poor role selection actually makes his work on the "Oven" decent (though this movie is unbearably bad). I can't be too hard on this movie just because it was more or less exactly what I thought it would be. Bad effects? Low budget? No actors? I had no higher hopes. But that doesn't mean it's amazing. There's nothing you can be proud of for par, and it's slowly falling apart into the remote memory department. For one fan who likes this movie (and calls it "KvC"), stick to your copy because you will have a damn time to get a refund.
