Terrible terrible video for television. Again, life brings us a predictable triangle; Scheming Bitchy Woman Get Silly Unconscious Wives Still Another Stupid Husband Who Has No Clue. I'm getting antsy when I see these movies. Can you ask why I'm following them? I have no idea. Usually by mistake. And the movie is so bad I can't get away from it. I'm waiting for her bitch to get her upstairs. And usually I'm not happy with just getting desserts. Now that you can trust our vixen, steal embryos from the clinic and how do you do that? Without blood tests, DNA, questions and recommendations. Continues to kill a realtor, Gabrielle Rose, who is on her, in the daylight of the house for sale and nobody sees it? She kills her mother, Susan Hogan, and you could predict that the mother who learns about her is allergic to peanuts and that the pills to fight this allergy are in her pocket. Guess what? I'm not going to go on with it. Finally, you're in the house alone with your wife and bitch. Well triumphing evil, but too slowly. As a bad girlfriend, Victoria Pratt is adequate in the role, looking a little too confused and clear. Tori Spelling simply stands empty most of the time. She has the big big eyes of Bette Davis, who seem to be out of their heads. I liked TRICK better. And Tahmoh Penikett plays a husband who goes to reassure his wife that he and his ex-girlfriend are saying nothing, even though he is seen all over the city being very annoyed with her, standing half naked in her house when he sent the woman to the house. overnight. Yet he still denies romance. Lifetime never disappoints viewers with their boring charts and stories about women and their stupid husbands. I wish this chestnut gave a "0" rating.
