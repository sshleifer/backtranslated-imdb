In a not entirely successful attempt to take seriously, and move in 'adult' movies, Mr. Hughes gave us this film about a young married couple. It is true that it has all the clich√©s in the book in it, silly fantasy stuff and everything but more importantly - it's Elizabeth McGovern. It is clear that the best actress who has ever appeared in John Hughes's film appreciates that she sometimes raises stupid material. Kevin Bacon (and his hair) is pretty good as her husband, but McGovern steals the film with its calm real moments of honesty. The "teen movie" entertainment that worked so well in other Hughes movies is here - like a favorite uncle whose jokes made you laugh when you were nine, but you still tell them when you are 15 years old and you want them to find some new material . But I'm still returning to the performance of McGovern because it's really moving. Mr. Hughes' most exciting films are for some of the Kind of Wonderful (Breakfast Club) and when his material meets real talent, some amazing things can happen. If only he believed it might not be dusty with silly fantasy things.
