I know my summary sounds very cruel, but this film has a very limited attraction. The average Joe out there will have a hard time sticking to this movie. The whole film consists of animated loggers who do their work and dance on floating logs. All this is happening with very splashy and artsy colors and the film can be great to show patrons in an art museum. However, if you really do not love this kind of art, or if you are a Canadian person who loves movies about your home country, then you probably won't be able to finish it. I have a relatively high tolerance for this kind of stuff and I even had to force myself to look after a few minutes. I can respect the work that has entered it, but it's not just convincing.
