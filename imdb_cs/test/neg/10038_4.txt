I wanted to like this movie. Really, really. I was so excited to see a preview that scared me. But when I saw the real movie, I was disappointed. Acting is upset and comedy attempts are woefully unpleasant and forced. And I'm sorry, but a boy who is being chased by a shepherd in bed is neither funny nor scary, it's just stupid. I grew up on the legend of Bell Witch, so I know a little about it. Many facts in the movie are right on the target, but this movie should be much better. The entire birthday party scene, for example, takes about fifteen minutes, does not add anything to the plot or story and should be left on the floor of the room. A more cumbersome editor could be able to get a decent movie out of this mess. Please understand, I'm not in any way, shape or form involved with any other Bell Witch movie, and I'm not trying to "attack" this IMDb list. I'm saying it is.
