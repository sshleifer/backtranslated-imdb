If you can get through a slow start and bad gameplay is worth watching. The story was pretty decent. His father was in a bad mood because he was unemployed and barely met his boy, except for the summer, because his ex-wife was in custody. Father was very angry and frustrated most of the time. The monster in the story wasn't too scary. The film breaks the consistency of a monster that is so incredibly strong. The only scene that filmmakers do is one of the times when a child is in the cellar and the monster comes to mind. When a monster attacks a child, his hand gets caught in a steel trap attached to the chain. The monster is about one foot away from the baby's face. Throughout the film, the monster is strong enough to break or destroy anything. Steel trap and chain keeps him back from the boy! More than likely, film makers have done it because of the shock factor, because no one wants one of the main characters to die. Moviemakers just wanted to scare us to think it might be a possibility that a child might die. Instead of breaking the consistency, moviemakers should replace the child with someone they could destroy!
