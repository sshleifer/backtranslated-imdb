Her space swing, or at least I think she is. You have a half-naked female prisoner in a space jail and a monster at a space station that uses the virus to infect humanity through sexy encounters. His Friggin cheerful. Acting is so bad that space matrices look like Emmy's award-winning film. The story is simple. A space prisoner gets a chance to reduce the sentence by investigating a space station that has lost contact with humanity. She finds a doctor "experimenting" with women and angry stranger. He fights against them, so on and so on. It's a movie worth seeing, just to keep wet pants laughing. If you like Real sci-fi flicks its not-no but its a great mood adjuster for amateur movie makers because I can guarantee their movie is better than this.
