****** Spoilers inside ******* What a boring, predictable, no-scary snore-fest. The film had no character development: I felt no empathy for any of the characters (except for being a little boy), and didn't care what happened to any of them. The film had so many clich√©s or elements stolen from other horror movies. The film was so predictable. Many times I would say, "Let me guess, {fill in guess} will become another?" Yeah, I was right. Even in the opening scene, I predicted that the "attack" on the family was a man, probably a father (because only women and children were attacked). Sure, that's what happened (of course you have to wait 79 minutes to find out). And, of course, another "bad man" scenario. Why was he evil and killed his family? Because he's a man, duh! As someone else has said, this film can be frightening for someone under the age of 13, or for a 70's movie, but it's the FAR of the frightening film according to today's standards. And, like many horror horror movies, a lot of horror was "counterfeit". Scary music, scary music, scary music and ..... Crow suddenly flies by the window! Wow, scary! How old does the old bank, several times, walk on open land without being seen by the father? I thought the old man was a ghost. No, just a lousy movie. I rated this movie as 2 out of 10 because it kept my attention enough to sit the whole thing.
