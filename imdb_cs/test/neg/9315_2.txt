Historical films always take freedom - conversations are conceived where no one could truly know what was said, habits are arranged to be understandable to the modern audience, etc. However, historical films of real historical personalities should at least nod to history. This movie is not. The only scene I remember is when our hero surprises the killer who sneaks into his chamber at night. He confronts the dangerous intruder: "I don't remember sending to room service". The main amusement value is in its badness; I recommended putting your local video story on the "Turkeys" shelf.
