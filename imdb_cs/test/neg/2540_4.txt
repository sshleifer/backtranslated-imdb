This film was different from most of Jimmy Cangey's films in the 1930s in that it wasn't done by Warner Brothers / First National, but it was borrowing to a smaller studio. Because it was a studio with poverty, production values ​​are lower than you could be used to Cagney movies. Moreover, the storyline is certainly one of the strangest things I've ever seen. Instead of being a gangster, he was good at this - he fought for the law. This is not so unusual because Cagney has often played lawyers - such as the OSS leader (CIA predecessor) FBI agent. BUT was really strange to be an investigator of the Bureau of Weights and Measures - especially since he sometimes worked as much as he did in G-MEN! All in all, passers-by and that's about it. Finally, the videotape I saw in Memory Lane Video was perhaps one of the poorest I've ever seen. . The sound was terrible and scratched, and the print looked very white and had a lot of torn film and gaps.
