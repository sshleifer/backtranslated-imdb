I have read many book readers that it would be a faithful adaptation of Nora Roberts' story. When I didn't read the book, I don't know if this adaptation was faithful, but I know it wasn't good. In fact, the script was the best part of the film so kudos to Nora Roberts. I planned forward and watched Carolina Moon because of Claire Forlani. I was never sure she was a good actress. She was decent in some movies, moderate in others, and she was really bad at that. But Forlani was not alone. The performances were everywhere. Oliver Hudson was wooden and boring. Josie Davis was a hammy. Then, amidst all these B-acting, is Jacqueline Bisset! She had little to do but portray bitterness, but even though she was leaning overnight she was miles ahead of the others. Forlani, however, still remains one of the most amazing women in movies and film. here he was not disappointed. I believe Forlani can be more than eye candy, but she excels until she appears in good performance in good film. And I will continue to pursue faithfully everything he participates in. Fandom is fun. In addition to bad behavior (fake South accents are really disturbing) the direction was pedestrian. It wasn't terrible. It was just boring made for caliber television you're used to seeing for life. <br /> <br /> If you are a fan of some of the stars you can probably use Carolina Moon for this reason, as I did. If you are a fan of the book, you can enjoy seeing the story on the screen, though in a bland form. Otherwise, this film is remarkable.
