Next in the long line of Conan wannabes that tired of cashing in this success film, this Italian monstrosity is about as bad as they came. You know it's a bad sign when your heroes fight invisible enemies because the movie was so cheap that there was no money for adequate special effects or for renting real people. I won't even bother going into a conspiracy to resist anyone who follows him and gives a sense of story. Maybe it's a TV cut I've been watching, but I can't imagine any version being much better. Everything seems so random to me. Evil sorcerers, cavemen, giant snakes, medieval castles, grenades and hang gliders? none of them fit. It is as if director Joe D'Amato had an epileptic seizure while Cave Dwellers (or one of the other half dozen movie names) threw everything he could think of the screen, no matter how unrelated or how it was . they fit into the already confused plot of the film. Negotiations are bad enough. Miles O'Keeffe could never get out of a wet paper bag and prove it again in this movie. The rest of the cast is just as cruel. Then he's here. . . Well, you have an idea. It's too late, I'm tired and I've been wasting more than enough time to write this waste. Take my word for it? Avoid Cave Dwellers (or anything you want to call) at all costs.
