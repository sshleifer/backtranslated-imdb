This rather cumbersome sci-fi-horror schlock from the late 1950s is not completely defeated. It's about a missile with a crew that hits a distant area. A bunch of scientists goes to explore and find that the astronaut is in some sort of coma; it is kept alive by foreign embryos that have been mysteriously implanted in it. By the way, the title of a foreign monster soon picks up a head that causes a general disaster, including partial removal of the head. The main problem with film is stimulation. It takes a long time for the blood beast to appear, and he only gets into it in the last 20 minutes. He is undoubtedly a totally ridiculous creature, but it really is not a problem because it provides a fair amount of comic relief. At the end of the movie, where we have the ultimate stand-off and this ridiculous creature starts talking to the doctor's voice he killed earlier, you'll do well not to laugh. Also in a brilliant x-ray scene where we see extraterrestrial embryos floating in the body of an astronaut - it's just too funny for words. But unfortunately, the fun moments at Night Blood Beasts come too little and far. If you are 50 years of science fiction matrix, then it's well worth checking this one out. Don't wait too much.
