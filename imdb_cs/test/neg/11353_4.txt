"Mararia" really disappointed me. I can't think of it as a bad movie, but the development seemed too rushed and incredible to evoke any emotion. Dr. Ferm√≠n exhibits some unprecedented bizarre behavior from passion that one cannot understand from where he was born. How many times does she have an interview with Mararia? Maybe once? Also Mararia never looked like a real character, rather like a movie stereotype that needed to be just in a movie (or another title was needed?). Some of the best performances came from a role that wasn't really important to the story, Marcial, a sub-intelligent but humble drunk. Of course, the scenery, cultural tidbits in the Canary Islands, and other "wow" moments were interesting, but the film lacked documentary (if it was his real intention), and most importantly, as a solid drama.
