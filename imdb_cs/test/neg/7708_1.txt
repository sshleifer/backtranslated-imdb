I must admit that I enjoyed the House of the Dead quite well, despite the well-documented shortcomings. But that was the worst movie I saw from the door demons. The effects are much better compared to DATD. However, the story is weak, acting like a favorite, a porn movie, and the decisions and actions of "characters" are constantly shifting to moron. I want to try out the latest Uwe Boll movie circuits to get a look at HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really a cure, rather a case of another disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such a nasty way, the only way up is. OK there. I managed at least ten lines and wasted no time on the waste of the celluloid, the House of the Dead 2.
