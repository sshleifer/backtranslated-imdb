Very intrusive, but professionally crafted and written and intelligently directed with good eyesight for color and detail. Mary Beth Hurt, Sandy Dennis and especially Randy Quaid are unusually good. The story is centered around a young boy (Bryan Madorsky), wondering where all the remains they eat every night come from. His parents (Hurt, Quaid), a strange behavior, cause the school psychiatrist (Dennis) to get involved. It's a horrible cannibal movie. But it's not bad. If you like Hannibal, you'll love it. If you don't like parents, stay away from the movie. Just giving advice to Cannibal Lover and Haters. <br /> <br /> Rated R for Strong Adult Themes and Graphic Violence.
