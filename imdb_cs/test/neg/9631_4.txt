1971 it was more and more obvious that Hammer Film Studios was on the way out. HANDS RIPPER is the case where the idea of ​​slapping despair - the spirit of Jack the Ripper has his own daughter! Yeah fine no one expected the document, but this plot seems to scratch the bottom of the barrel for a stupid assumption, and you're wondering why the producers brought Jack Ripper to the story. Was it for the film to be elegant? <br /> <br /> Production values ​​are bland and cinematography gives the film a cheap TVM feel, but you know you won't watch the classic Hammer horror once the title starts because the music is ridiculously inappropriate. I think the composer was trying to make the theme fit and touch, but the music resembles something that is from the raging romantic film. I'm going to cast some credit because their roles are serious about what's far from serious movie <br /> <br /> I didn't really like this movie and immediately reminded me of Phantom Raspberry Blower of London Town of the two Ronnies to whom I was laughing in the weeks I saw it
