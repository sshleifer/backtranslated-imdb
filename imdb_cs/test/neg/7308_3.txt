In fact, it happened: the royal mother in law and the father of Taiwan had lunched for a few days after the wedding and gave her the money in public. That bothered the young Elisabeth so much that she never forgot the problem. We must remember that she was only 16 years old. She was so embarrassed that she had been worried about sex all her life. Maybe it started to look like trauma. Also the constant interference of her aunt and mother-in-law. As you say, she kept all her children from her, criticized her teeth and ways (which she thought was inappropriate for the Empress), and when Sissi finally left for Venice with her husband and children, her eldest daughter died and her mother accused her of this unfortunate premature death. She never recovered.
