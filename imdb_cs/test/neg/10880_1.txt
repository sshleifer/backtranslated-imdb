Under no circumstances should this film be viewed. It's terrible for a number of reasons: <br /> <br /> No land No structure No direction No playing talking No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. > <br /> The best thing about boxing and the fact that it ends. Who would have thought 85mins would feel so long. <br /> <br /> Again: Don't take this movie in any way. It's scary. <br /> <br /> No land No structure No direction No talking No visual style No tension <br /> <br /> In a word - no. The best thing about boxing and the fact that it ends. Who would think that 85 minutes could feel so long.
