The Hollywood film industry is the most beautiful in the world. It only needs one hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re-invented over and over. Take for example superheroes, for every X-Man Spiderman are Daredevil, Elektra, Ghost Rider and Hulk. Japanese horror remake is even worst. It only took the ring, which was pitch-perfect (mostly because of Mr. Gore Verbinsky), bring a ton of similar fearsome-based women of horror, eg Ring 2, The Eye, Dark Water (which was okay, but meaningless) and grudge. <br /> <br /> The first Grudge wasn't completely wrong. Most of the way it scared, which is what he could expect. In addition, the plot had some brains mixing stories. Grudge 2 is just like the previous one; It might be a good thing, but hey, what guys men in black II? Was it a nice thing to xerox the entire script and just change the villain? For Grudge 2, the critic goes the same way. Tired of fear, wrong playing (except Amber Tamblyn), and clich√©s everywhere. There are three stories in different places and time. There is Aubrey (Tamblyn) investigating what drove her sister Karen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) to death; Allison (Arielle Kebbel), taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident was shown in the first film; And finally, an American family who witnesses strange things happening in the apartment next door. I would like to say (and I think) that everything is tied at the end, but one must not rely on the end to be a good picture when everything else is just tedious and boring. chills are everywhere, the girl alone in the lockers, someone who should not enter the house, others who dig. Meanwhile, the ghosts kill and kill and kill, which seems even more deadly than the ten world wars or the Ebola epidemic. Hey, doesn't it look like another bad Japanese remake, like Pulse? Yeah, day after day it's easier to hold a grudge ... against Hollywood shit.
