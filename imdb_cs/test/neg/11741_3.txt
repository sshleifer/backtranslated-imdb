What is this embarrassment ... This does not make the justice of the original with the terrifying action of everyone in this film, Hitchcock revolves in his grave. The scream when Marion kills in the shower is so inefficient and unoriginal. The only good piece is that they used the same music and it was so clear who would kill her in the shower. I rate this movie 3/10
