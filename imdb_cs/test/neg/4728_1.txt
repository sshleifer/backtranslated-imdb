This is not a real story. It is the darkest possible fiction derived from events. It promotes suicide, the posthumous obsession with death, the totally unreasonable bouncing of organized religion in general (and especially the Church of England), and generally provides a nihilistic, pointless world view from which moviegoers intend to leave, richer in their poverty and more hopeful in their hopelessness. <br /> <br /> Handy waste, though appealingly able to cast. Anyone suggesting it is true rendering, but it is a very false advertisement. Want a real story? Rent "Fairy Tale". That's a real story. See if you can find any correspondence between the facts mentioned in both cases. I found only one: the girls who made the original photographs were before puberty.
