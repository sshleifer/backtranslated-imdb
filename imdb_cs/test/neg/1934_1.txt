It is probably a cultural thing - somehow the natives of this country were conditioned to find such things funny. I experienced this phenomenon at first hand, during an open-air cinema event where the film appeared before gaming. Most indigenous listeners laughed, and no, this was not in the sanatorium or retarded clinic, it was in a well-functioning area and the audience was mostly educated adults. So it must be possible, in some way, to find this fun but sincere goodness, I have no idea what it means - maybe it's in the air or in the water, the long-term exposure that causes this condition. Something must cause, of course, the only thing I can say is that I'm pretty sure what it doesn't cause: the movie itself. There are no jokes in that. It's a dead brain, stupid, absurd, indecent, lame. It's just a waste of time. Any Tom and Jerry is more fun, the funeral is fun. Only if you were lucky to have never seen any of the Stooges performances: They are three boys who behave, run, even speak as retarded infants, causing all kinds of unbearable chaos, without a plot, no real purpose and no real conclusion. It's like ugly Teletubbies without cute costumes. Sitting in a crowd watching this waste in this country can be quite annoyed because you feel you are having a party with a bunch of potheads and you're just the one who didn't smoke anything. So if you are not ready to get intoxicated to make it bearable, or to be equipped with what is what makes people watch the three ugly old men behave like morons, funny, mine advice is: Stay on the road. Far.
