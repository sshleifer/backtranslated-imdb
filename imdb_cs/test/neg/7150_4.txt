Everything that this film tried to do is better - and great in "Run Lola Run". Red Hair Hip Cutie, Critical Term (s), Lover at Risk, and "Crime Pays-Sometimes" Report. But, unlike "Lola", it just isn't believable or well put together. It's a strenuous knock that might work for me if I saw it in front of "Lola" - but it fades. Yes! The falling beetle was nice! But that was probably the only surprise in the movie. Do yourself a favor and check out Real McCoy - (in REAL hip red head!) - Run Lola Run!
