The idea of ​​this movie was great. The story of a little girl who faces abuse (emotional and physical) and tries to deal with it and survive. What makes a movie fall apart is the terrible use of voice overs and corny dialogs. The actors must again and again draw attention to the most obvious things. Also there is a very tedious, almost funny, overuse of metaphors in voice overs. The highlight is the action of a little girl. Nice try, but this is smelly.
