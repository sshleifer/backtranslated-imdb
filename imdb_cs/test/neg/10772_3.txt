When I read the books and saw the version of Anthony Andrews / Jane <br /> <br /> in 1982, I have to say it's not good at all. According to the books, Percy is supposed to be seemingly <br /> <br /> a foppish aristocrat when he is Percy, and funny and clever <br /> <br /> when he is Pimpernel, but here he just bored as Percy and as Pimpernel. Marguerite is supposed to be <br /> <br /> the most beautiful woman in Europe, not a tired and tasteless looking matron (looks middle aged, probably because of <br /> <br /> bad makeup)). Richard E. Grant has done much better things, and Elizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat. Joke and <br /> <br /> a dash of books and the Andrews / Seymour movie is replaced by <br /> <br /> vibrant and flashy adjustments that just don't cut. <br /> <br /> I could add that a person who didn't see any previous version of <br /> <br /> or read the book would probably look good.
