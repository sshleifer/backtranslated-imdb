Normally, I wouldn't waste my time criticizing an unnecessary film like this. But this week I'm out of work, so I have plenty of time to deal with insignificant trivialities. To begin, let me say that I often enjoy a non-commercial, non-traditional, non-American cinema. (Feel free to click on my user profile for supportive filmography.) That means there are a lot of bad movies that are being released in countries outside the US. Believe me, hundreds of them have tortured me. "Lost in Beijing" is one particularly bad movie. The introductory half hour is an impressive, continuous exhibition of moral degeneration. This film provides some classic morals that belong to the same level as Kim Ki-duk's "Bad Guy" (2001). 1. Women are actually raped; 2. rape should be celebrated, praised and respected; 3. Don't be afraid to rape every woman you like because while your "doing" she will eventually start to enjoy and achieve orgasm; 4. If you are a woman raped, be sure to blackmail her violence for a lot of money, but if she doesn't pay, just repeatedly bang his slut women as a substitute; 5. If your wife gets rape, be sure to screw it and degrade it for the next day while playing the role of a rapist, mocking her with lines like: "Do you like it?"; 6. If you are a husband's abuser, just accept; 7. After you have personally raped, befriended and go with him whenever possible. How can anyone in their right mind take care of any of these characters? It is no more than a lot of degenerates who not only live their lives in careless ways, but actually enjoy their absurdity and support each other. Don't understand me. I am very capable of enjoying movies that capture lifestyles and morals that conflict with my own. "Ichi the Killer" (2001) and "Moonlight Whispers" (1999) are a very interesting portrait of sadomasochism. "Strange Circus" (2005) is an immensely perverted game about child sexual abuse. "Marriage is a crazy thing" (2002) is a scary accusation of traditional marriage. Even religiously based films such as "Running in the Charge" (2003) and "Samsara" (2001) occasionally enjoyed me. The difference is that these movies actually have some interesting psychological content and character development, while "Lost in Beijing" has virtually none. any type of character development or psychology behind the acts themselves, you end up with a superficial exposure to scornful behavior. Why exactly did Bing Bing make friends and care for her bully? Why does the violent wife accept his behavior unconditionally? The creators never mind us. Even the obvious combination of rich and poor classes was incomprehensibly conceived and eventually served as a mere situational trick. Everything feels too faint and forgetful after the dirty opening half hour disappears. Other reviewers seem to have confused the moral ambiguity with complex characterization. The reason you can't choose who the root is is is that they were not properly developed. Don't think that this movie has complex characters just because they aren't clearly defined. On the contrary, the reason they are not clearly defined is that we know nothing or think about them. This is hardly a positive attribute of this movie. The positive thing is that working with the camera and acting are pretty good, but everything else becomes boring and boring as the film progresses. You can place this next to the basket like "Turning Gate" (2002), "What Time Is It There" (2001), "Irreversible" (2002) and the aforementioned "Bad Guy".
