The only reason this movie is not given 1 (terrible) vote is that the acting of Ida Lupino and Robert Ryan is excellent. Ida Lupino, who is beautiful, as usual, becomes increasingly upset when she tries to get rid of the madman. Robert Ryan is terrifying as a menacing stranger whose character, led only by his disturbed mind, changes from one minute to another. Seemingly simple and docile, it suddenly becomes clever and threatening. Mrs. Lupine's character was to a greater extent threatened by the house she lived in and her own stupidity than the one who came. She couldn't get her out of her own house: the windows didn't open, the front and back doors locked and unlocked from inside with a key. If you tried, you couldn't suggest worse traps. She didn't take any measures to have one more key. She couldn't figure out how to get help from neighboring neighbors, or get out of her own cellar when she was shut and out of sight of her captor. I do not know in what war her husband was killed, but if it were World War II, the equipment in her house, the styles of clothing, especially the children and auto repairers of the telephone company, were clearly anachronistic. I recommend watching this movie just to find out what peculiarities you can find.
