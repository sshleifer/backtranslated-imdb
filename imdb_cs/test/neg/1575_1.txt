Place the movie down and slowly. Acting rivals play high school, the story is worn out and production values ​​are slightly higher than social theater. Nerds are so rich that he becomes a lauger. The rooms are switched around, deadlift, dogs are used to wolves, men shot a point with a .45 caliber pistol, are able to walk and ride snowmobiles, blouse and unbutton without human contact ... this is the movie baaaaaaaaadddddddd. I almost fainted when I saw the average rating. There is no account for the taste. BTW, not nudity.
