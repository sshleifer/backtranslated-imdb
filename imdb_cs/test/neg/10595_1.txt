I watched this movie for the first time and was bored with tears. I think I was just looking for some flashback in a wonderful series that I remembered. I watched the Mod Squad television return to daylight and it was fantastic. It was an action packed and the relationship that had 3 with Greer was cute. None of this was here. When Greer was murdered, you have the idea that the three could care less. The actor who portrayed Pete is a really good actor, but he wrote his part as if he was mentally attacked. Pete was calm and serious in the TV series, but he also had a funny side. They had the guy who acted like him, either on drugs at the time, drunk or just ignorant. I wouldn't recommend this movie at all. Especially if you were a fan of the TV series. It will be a complete breakdown.
