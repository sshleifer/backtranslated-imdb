As a small Michael Dudikoff fan, I sat down to watch one of his old, old-fashioned action-still waiting. The film is based on a group of American commandos trying to get rid of Syrian terrorists who took over a nuclear reactor. Maddie Reese (Felicity Waterman) was an English squad member and of course became romantically involved with Tom Dickson (Dudikoff). I have to ask when when the SAS had SAS SAS members - if they know they are ever needed, they get from other sources. Even if they do, I can guarantee they're not as wet as Maddie Reese. I would also think that Tom Dickson would be a little more responsible in his position - or did I lose the story?! I know that there is always a romantic angle in these films, because it helps to provide the feeling that this is a good factor, but it has to be all the time, especially when important things need to be taken into account - such as nuclear war! Signing a contract for an American aircraft carrier intrigued me. The "Sacred Pen" carried by one of the alleged members of the television news - there are no security controls to see who or what goes on one of these ships, especially the caliber of the people who were on it. Note that if he was there, I suppose there would be no story. I could go on, but when he got to the "inner bomb defect" to safely remove the bullet I gave up. Battle for an action drama and enjoy it for the comedy it was in. By the way, a journalist would really say, "Downtown Damascus"?
