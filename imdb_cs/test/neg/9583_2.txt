It looks like an innocent choice in the first place - the name "employee of the month" could ring the bells with "Office Space" and the show "Office Clerk". I think not. It's not even a dark comedy. The director of this film, who is called anyone, was a total blockbuster and has a sick perverted mind. There is no joy in attracting you to regret the complete loser who cheats his wife, steals from work at peak hours and is 24/7. The second when I looked at it (and believe me that they just watched it more because they prayed there would be at least some relief at the end, maybe even some fable sending a good message) of good justice and when good guys look good . All the good guys were killed so long that they didn't have time to look good. No memorial was created. This film has borderline madness. He does not respect the elderly, the dead and the women - and the director tries to make people like it. I gave this movie two just because the soundtrack was good. But it wasn't so unforgettable either. If you were fortunate enough not to see it in theaters, then my friends don't do it at home.
