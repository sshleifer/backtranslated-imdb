I didn't expect much from this movie, but I was eager to try something I originally thought would be primarily a 1980s teen horror movie. Although three teens are somewhat of a critical plot, it is by no means a teen horror movie. 'The Power' is about a small Aztec idol who exchanges many hands as his owner (who must be an adult and so, 'spoiled') becomes a vessel to dissolve the entire idol evil and often with fatal consequences not only for the owner, but also for the owner. After making several exchanges in the rivalry for control of this thing, the three teenagers ended it up and couldn't figure out what it was, except that they were strange and dangerous since they found it. They offer to explain the situation to a reporter who does not buy into the clergy of Bologna. Although she is a producer who wants to explore further, especially if it means she can gain control of the idol (I suppose teenagers are not yet sufficiently damaged to feel dangerous idol-supported desires). It's a story told a thousand times, especially in the 1950s and 1960s horror and science fiction prizes. This one was at least able to keep me interested. Though low budget, it was not done so overtly cheaply or loaded with bad behavior as many of the low budget, come-and-go horror fare of previous decades had (today, they have the same quality cheesy, but larger budgets). We are spare enough to at least allow us to at least absorb a spooky atmosphere and so on, despite the clich√© story. Although it is not terribly bloody, special effects have been nicely processed. Again, it's a routine horror story, especially with the ending (which, according to modern standards, has become a device that is unpleasantly overused), but one that isn't so embarrassingly bad. Maybe it's worth checking out, though just for laughter.
