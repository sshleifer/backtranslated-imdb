You know that this film is in serious trouble when Arnold Schwarzenegger's support is the best work. While this was still relatively early in his career and he was not the best actor, compared to Brigitte Nielsen, he is Sir John Gielgud. In fact, this film proves that the only reason she received a lot of attention was her breasts and because she was involved with the incredibly self-destructive footballer Mark Gastineau. So, instead of it's her "break out movie", this and Beverly Hills Cop movie marks about as high as she went in her career one-note. It was also obvious that the financial guides had given up on this film too, because the support cast (except Arnold) is very poor and the script is boring, boring, boring. Fans looking for another CONAN movie would undoubtedly be very disappointed in this slow and idle movie.
