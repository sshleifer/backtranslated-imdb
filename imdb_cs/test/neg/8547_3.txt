He commended him 3 - one point for the Fund, Stanwyck, and supportive cast. I've never seen it before - I'm watching it now and just got to the part where Henry Fonda is carrying Babs across the threshold. If I continue to watch, it will only be seen if Fonda and Stanwyck can pull this from the dumper. But after reading the viewer's other comments, I'm not very optimistic. The opening ski scenes were enough to get me out of lunch. Voice-overs was apparently made in the sound studio, and the cut between external footage and detail was horrible. I don't know so much about the technology of this era - but I can't believe there wasn't something they could do to make it more believable. My second breath of distrust was when Fonda wiped it out and (I think, due to the extreme speed of travel) it was first pulled up in the snow to its hull - Stanwyck pulls it out with obviously difficult difficulties - (I think it's an experienced physician) react at all to his seemingly subconscious state and flabby posture. Look, I'm totally able to suspend my infidelity, but I couldn't overcome the fact that she just pushed a man with a possible head injury and that he could be paralyzed for life. Not my idea of ​​big yuks. So, as I have finished this commentary, we have just seen Kirk's first jealous explosion and dr. Hunt's gone to do appendectomy! I'm not sure what more I hate - script, background music or story !! Argghhhh! I'm done. Game Over. Click on.
