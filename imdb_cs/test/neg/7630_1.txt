I thought Sliver offered the most serious and trivial "trick" ending in film history, but of course I was wrong. I had no disappointment that this movie would be good. Unfortunately, it was worse than I expected. Worst of all, the obvious ending is so ridiculous and terrible that you can't believe it until it really happens.
