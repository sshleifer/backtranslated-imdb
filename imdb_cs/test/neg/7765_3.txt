All my friends and other co-workers think this show is great. I hate this show first !!!!!!! I think I could be the only one alive! I just watched it because my best friend adores him and cheers for being Charlotte! First of all the plot (If you call it) is about four women Superslut Samantha (Kim Cattrall), who most likely has every STD available and mossy, brown and green genitals considering she's three sexual (she will try something). Samantha is not like most 40 women, even in NY, but before the show She wouldn't have any kind of fun because Samantha (along with some good NY scenery) is the only reason to watch and they aren't adequate . Charlotte (Kristen Davis) is a well dressed NY idiot who still believes in the myth of Pince Charming! However, the sweet and pretty she won't let her deceive you, she spreads quite often. Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) now this woman is a stereotypical angry, butch feminist. I think in one episode she is considered a lesbian, but apparently it is not ... What a pity she is almost interesting. Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) is an annoying character. I swear I thought I was watching Dee Snider look at a manly glance, dress, sissy boy, brother, at the top man Twisted Sister! This is a girl who can't live without love ... Did I hear about a puppy? This show is stupid and I'm making fun of it because I hear about it as a new awakening for women. It's just sad when you're trying to watch slutty, pathetic, addictive people with too expensive clothes that drink cosmopolitan people and sound like an annoying 15 years on cocaine than the show for you ........... only protection.
