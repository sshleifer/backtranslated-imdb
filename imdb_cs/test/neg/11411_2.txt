Wow. I saw Demon Wind a moment ago and I don't think I'll ever be the same. It has the power to inspire nightmares, but for all the wrong reasons, actually. Never before has mankind seen such an unjustified change in makeup without any damn reason. Or, similarly, so much bad zombie (?) Make-up that makes hunger for those Halloween green marshmallows. Or so much naked old lady, for that matter. But then, there was "The Shining." The plot here is so amateurish that in fact it almost holds a bit of magic, as well as dialogue. The last picture of the movie is so stupid it is beyond its description. Is it like a drunken college student has met some friends and decided that with (I think)? The result is annoying and it would be really funny if it were intended. Ah, what is it. Anyway, I'll laugh. <br /> <br /> Go to hell with your friends and watch it. Make sure you're drunk. Or you can go crazy. Especially if you're a college student. Cheers.
