Although it is not a classic comedy at all, it is a pretty good little movie that you watch when you catch it on a rainy Saturday morning without doing anything else. Harold Lloyd plays Ezekiel Cobb, an American coming home after growing up in China, where his father was a missionary. He came home from China to find an American wife and plans to return to China to continue his father's work. his corrupt home town, when an existing political machine that controls the city, realizes that he would make a perfect dirty run against the current mayor, who is also the head of the underworld. therefore, the current mayor continues to lead the city and run his plans to make everyone rich. Lloyd is not doing a physical comedy here, as if he was doing it in his silent films. Cobb with a reserved untrustworthy dignity was good from everyone involved, and the story and script were also pretty good. Being Made in 1934 the film has some somewhat racist language when talking about Chinese and it also has a typical black character from that era, but these stereotypes aren't nearly as average as I have seen from other movies of that time . Although not close to Lloyd's best movie, this movie is fun and Lloyd is very good as a Cobb You won't be blown away by this movie, but it may be enough to get your interest in Lloyd and you would like to see more of his work.
