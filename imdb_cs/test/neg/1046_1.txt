"Five characters in search of the exit" must be one of the most boring "zones" ever made. It was at Sci-Fi this morning and as usual I changed the channel. I put it in the Top Top list of the worst "Zones" ever made. Dull and predictable and not worth watching. Serling has been working on this subject to death (aliens in the hands of strangers who were often giants) and it just doesn't work in this particular version. Anyone who hasn't seen it yet will find it fast. This is another Serling philosophical mood, perhaps parallel to the fate of those in captivity or in concentration camps, where imprisonment may lose interest in finding out where they are or fighting their prisoners. William Windom, the soldier who is the last to "throw himself", is the only one curious to try, and the result doesn't last long.
