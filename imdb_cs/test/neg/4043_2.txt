This movie was so stupid that I couldn't believe what I saw when I watched it, it was like a huge train wreck - I couldn't break it because it was so awful! I can honestly say that I've never seen anything like it in my life. It was so cheesy and the acting was so lame that I just thought it just had to be a joke, right? I really hope this is all just a bad joke and these people don't really expect people to look at it with a straight face, and I really hope that the people who were in this movie did horrible acts intentionally and don't really believe that they are good actors?! Drag queens are pretty funny to watch though, and so are the cheesy special effects right from the wrong 80 sci-fi movie. Watch it only if you have already seen every other film in existence first and there is nothing at all to watch! If possible, I'd give it "0".
