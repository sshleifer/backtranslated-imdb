I gave him a rating of 3 out of 10. <br /> <br /> And sadly, I was trying to find a movie schedule for this channel so I shouldn't see it. I wanted to watch this movie because it is based on a book by one of my favorite authors, Barbara Wilson. As a lesbian, I expected him to love this movie. I don't know how Mrs. Wilson felt the film, but I found it a big disappointment. It was supposed to be interesting - it was a secret - in Spain, and the main character, Cassandra, is a language translator who is contacted by a mysterious, beautiful woman who offers Cassandra a lot of money to find her former husband, Ben. . Secrets are revealed, but for some reason it didn't matter. It was like, oh, so what. I could not deal with these characters or care for them, nor do I think about them. I couldn't even identify with these characters. I think a big part of the movie's failure was an actress playing the main character. She looked old, tired, worn and as boring as the dishes. Her hair was a constant mess, her baggy clothes were boring, and she just wasn't attractive or interesting. <br /> <br /> The best work of the movie was to record Dean Martin's record, but it was destroyed as well. a strange makeup worn by a man who danced and lied to the song. Believe me, it was nothing to see what it looks like with pretty handsome Mr. Martin. The end is so syrupy that you want some pancakes to go with your syrup. <br /> <br />
