The most successful man in Ireland revolves around Eamon Manley, who is 24 years old and still becomes a virgin. He lives with his mother in Belfast. He is also a very shy guy to women. Everything has changes for Eamon when she is seduced by a woman (if I remember a neighbor). It's not because he's losing his virginity, but he finds out he has super power. Despite the protection, this neighbor becomes pregnant. The doctor tells him that he has a very high sperm count. His mother brilliantly comes up with the idea that we saw the children of the ginger head at the end of the film. She starts helping women on both sides of Belfast to get pregnant. First, he volunteers with the help of his colleague. The most powerful man in Ireland has his funny moments, but he needed to come up with better jokes and a better script. I couldn't think I was impressed by the television sitcom rather than the movie. Kris Marshall is a different name on the silver screen, but it doesn't shine like a star. It's more like a person you saw in such a movie. Like he is in Love Actually (I think he was very funny about this) .. Well, it was okay to watch but from time to time I couldn't help. ** outside *****
