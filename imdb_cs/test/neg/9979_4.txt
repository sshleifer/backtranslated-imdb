"Caligula" shares many of the same attributes as in 1970 "Fellini Satyricon" with bizarre sights, insanity and depiction of sexual excesses that take place in the "glory" of ancient Rome. But Fellini's not ... At first it's not so fun. Too much time on the screen is devoted to bug-eyed, rubber-faced McDowell in the titular role. His performance is too convincing. The illustrations of Jay Robinson in "The Robe" (1953) and David Cain-Haughton in "Emperor Caligula" (1983) are much more convincing and believable, with the latter being the most striking. Relief could be deliberately provided by the surrounding characters developing more. As it is, they are a little more than cyphers. One example is the role of the macro played by Guido Mannari, who has a huge presence on the screen in an important role, but is mostly left in the background. The only positive feature of the loan is the use of some of Prokofiev's and Stravinsky's themes in the musical score and the inclusion of some disgusting, yet accurate, despot actions. However, these two factors are much smaller than what is needed to relieve the prevailing tedia.
