Storyline - In the future, when almost all men were killed by a Y-targeting chromosome, the (hot) female genetic engineer "creates" a human in a chemical lab - is interesting. Despite a somewhat hopeful assumption, the film falls in almost every respect. Dialogue is ridiculous. The characters are thin. The survey of one sex world is shallow. The worst part of the film is an Asian detective who delivers lines so raw and invented that you want to vomit. <br /> <br /> I can't imagine how this waste is produced on earth. Most of the film is male assault. "All men are violent." "All men rape women." "Men are just animals." It seems that all women - even "box-like" cases - are pointing to anger - fear of - and hatred of men. If you want to see a sci-fi movie that is in line with the premise of this movie, you should look elsewhere.
