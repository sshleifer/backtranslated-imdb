The launch of "The Jungle" promises a science fiction adventure safari, but mostly what we get is a travelogue with lots of footage and padding (and a strange leopard attack). The film is leisurely when you want it to be grasped and tries to enter the game with poorly staged struggles between different wild animals (I did not know that lions and wild boars were natural enemies, not big cats stuck to hunting herbivores but the producers probably knew better). As for the actors: Cesar makes his usual great job swinging a mustache and Marie Windsor is reasonably believable as a gradually thinking Rajah's daughter (nice eyebrows, btw!). However, Rod Cameron is barely observable because the hunter returns as the only survivor of his expedition. I'm sure he was in demand in his bottom, but here he comes as a Bogart rental center: rough looking, but with no Bogey ranges or timing. The film spends back and forth from stoic anger to angry stoicism, and whenever the script tries to wrap some romantic sparks between itself and Windsor, you just have to laugh. Crab's face is not a good means of tenderness. <br /> <br /> The script is not entirely without merit, although it does make some special choices. At the beginning of Act 1, the screenplay is a place where it spends a few moments when the heroes choose to bring a compulsory clever young boy and a monkey mascot to each other, but then basically ignore them until the monkey gets caught up in some way. a live hand grenade during a mammoth scene and randomly thrown near Windsor. That's so Cameron can prove his bravery by sinking and saving life at the cost of his own. It is possible that the Indian version of this movie (which I understood ran better than 2 1/2 hours) could give the baby and the monkey more to do. Another thing that makes the film show its age ** SPOILER ** is a question of woolly mammoths (a plot device that sets safaris in the first place). When it finally appears, the way the scene is shot is clear that "mammoths" (apparently elephants wrapped in a carpet) aren't really "attacking" anyone or even moving so fast, yet Cameron tries to wipe is hand grenades. These days, the idea of ​​destroying the last known specimens of a species that was supposed to become extinct was unthinkable, especially when all that seems to be a good walking pace in the jungle. *** END OF SPOILER *** << Br /> <br /> So IMO, four stars, which is pretty good for Robert Lippert's production (usually Lippert hack jobs at best two or three stars). It's not a movie wreck or anything; plus, it looks good to mean, with a Rajah's daughter arguing about improving the most repressive aspect of "traditional ways" and elements of "mixed race" romance that was quite progressive in 1952. And there is some nice scenery and exotic spectacle. See if anyone can offer it for free, but don't wait for an interesting historical chapter of the fantasy movie.
