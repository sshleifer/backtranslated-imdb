I like J-horror, anime and even a little digging of the pink movement that some claimed to be this member, but that meant nothing to me. I would like to go one step further and mark this one of the greatest kills of my film tracking career. Three Young Rockabillies Go Around to Get Their Kicks From Rape Girls. One of the groups begins to develop their thoughts on their time when their sister is almost caught by the child. The group always turns on like friends who fight together. It ends on a note that fits the film as a whole. <br /> <br /> Besides watching your friends shout at each other, they do a lot, there's not much going on. The film is dotted with LONG continuous shots that only make the problem worse. Besides, even if the movie starts doing something interesting, it suddenly fits into an ethereal philosophy that never makes sense. For example, after one of the friends has a change of heart attacking the girls, she goes out and does it again, but then stops her friends from taking turns. Huh? The camera is slow and the lighting is bad. Writing is fine as well as acting, which makes it a sub-par film effort. Mix the lack of technical prowess with fragile content and have nothing more than a waste of time. And one more extra note, at least one of the girls who appears in the buff shouldn't look old enough to do things. <br /> <br /> 3/10
