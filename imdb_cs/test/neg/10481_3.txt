Rivalry between brothers leads to the main story. Navy Commander Chuck Prescott (Marshall Thompson) has developed a Y12 to test how far a man can rise in the atmosphere. His brother, Lieutenant Dan Prescott (Bill Edwards) seems to be the best test pilot in the area and is chosen to go up in the Y12. Of course, Dan has a problem with accepting orders and is also a very self-confident devil. <br /> <br /> On the second flight, Dan crosses the 300-kilometer comfort zone and his vessel passes a meteor storm. When Dan returns to the ground, he becomes a monster that resembles 200 pounds of bad asphalt. He also has a demanding desire for blood, be it from farm animals or other human beings. Short Run Time An hour and seventeen minutes; black-and-white with almost stoic performanceâ€¦ typical of low budget sci-fi. Rounding is Marla Landi, Robert Ayers and Carl Jaffe. Notable Trivia: about two months after the release of this film; The Russians put the real first man into space.
