Apparently re-cut episodes from Gangbusters TV show on big screen. Although this was often done in the 1950s and 1960s because people did not have television or color TV, and manufacturers wanted to increase their return on investment (selling billboards or if they went to a small screen series that is not in syndication), the results were usually smaller than the sum of their parts. The only time I've ever seen was that multi-part stories (Ala Rocky Jones or Man From Uncle) or horror anthology (The Veil and 13 Demon Street) were put together. The result is having stories of American criminals in the 1920s and 1930s (Dillinger, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie and Clyde, etc.), which intertwine when the narrator talks about how the FBI hunts them. It is a strange mixture that does not work completely because it is clear that there are things that do not belong together. More than once, I looked at the TV strangely because it didn't seem right. In justice, I will not describe the cheapness of production because it was what was early television (and the series). It's not bad, but it's not very good either. To be absolutely honest episodes of the series that I have seen working better one episode where we did not expect so much. Due to the choice I would rent a DVD from the program instead of this movie.
