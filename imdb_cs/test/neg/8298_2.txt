This film clearly has an agenda that can be summarized as follows: Never, never cross the border (physical or metaphorical). Let's avoid everything that is on the other side of the wall or fence or something else, pretend that all "gring" are evil, satanic or drug dealers. All that is beyond the boundaries of one country (and especially the American border) is dangerous, malevolent, and people will hate you or envy you or try to steal you or something else. "Based on real events" is just a perverted brand that can be pinned to anything that gives it some aura of trust, or, in this case, just to push the film's ideology down the naive throat. The perversion of the film is that it reduces countries, people and everyone else to very black-and-white stereotypical categories: Mexicans in disgusting people, Mexican police in a bunch of corrupt police officers, Republicans in right-wing myths, Democrats in almost hippie humanists, and so on. Is there anything good about the movie? I hardly think so, but maybe you think otherwise.
