I often wonder how movies like this get, and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them. Aksar looks as though the director has created a story when he went together, adding twists and turns when he liked, no matter how ridiculous they were. The scenario did not exist with inan dialogues like "Jo Sheena Roy pehenti hai, wahee fashion hai" and "Yeh Versace hai Madam" (right). Each of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped. The deal was terrible. Constumes (lycra for Udit and terrible suits for chunky Emran), locales (numerous houses that were used for interiors were not vaguely similar to Victorian dominion), script, etc., Just one word - garbage. <br /> <br /> Watch those people who love Hashmi and his movies. As for me, I'll never get those two and a half hours back. The only redemption factor was the music that was decent.
