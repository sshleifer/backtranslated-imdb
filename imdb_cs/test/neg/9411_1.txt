Very bad script and playing. I was very surprised that the director was able to convince his cast by his empty story, which tells us nothing. Everything is in the clich√© of "mentor" and "talented immature pupil". The characters are neither interesting nor sympathetic. He is artistically so empty and insignificant. The colors are very impersonal and light. Only the poster can be attractive. Al Pacino tries hard to give his character depth without success. Too bad because sports betting can be a really interesting topic that can be a big deal. But I can't have a complete commentary on this movie as I got out of the theater 20 minutes before the end. Everything was so predictable that it was a time pass ...
