The sudden yawning of a movie that does not preserve the zing and racism of its predecessor, "Gold Diggers of 1933". The production code was firmly in place at the time of this film, so humor is all hockey, the wocka-wock variety, and the dry pads are gone that sounded so cosmopolitan that the lips of the beautiful dames lipped out of their lips. first movie. Casting second-level stars and character actors are moving through the movements, and the "puttin" motif on the show seems to be terribly enforced; instead of creating or breaking the Broadway world, there is a show of charity event organized by an elegant hotel. Who really cares if the show continues? The score here is also bland. Of course, a large number of films are "Lullaby of Broadway", which accompanies a long fantasy dance number about the eventual disappearance of New York's sociality from too big a party - it does not have exactly the same effect as the "Forgotten Man" number used as the final in '33. Busby Berkeley directs as well as choreography this film, and what a promise is created in the fluid movie opening scene is rapidly deteriorating. Unfortunately, no one learned any lessons and two years later there was another Gold Diggers movie. <br /> <br /> Level: C-
