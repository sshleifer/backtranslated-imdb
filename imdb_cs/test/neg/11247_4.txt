The first movie was quite modern and had fun moments, this movie does not have exactly the same standard. Calvin Palmer (Ice Cube) is still trying to keep his barbershop going, but it's not just against stylist Gina (queen Latifah) with a cosmetics shop next door, but soon she'll have a big hairdressing chain called Nappy Cutz on the street. Calvin, along with co-workers and friends Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), Terri (Eve), and Isaac Rosenberg (Troy Garity), do their best to keep their regular customers and ultimately their counterparts competition. Also starring Michael Ealy as Ricky Nash, Leonard Earl Howze as Dinka, Harry Lennix as Quentin Leroux, Robert Wisdom as Alderman Brown, Jazsmin Lewis as Jennifer, Kenan Thompson as Kenard and Bad Company Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon as Loretta. I didn't like this movie just like the first one, because of the unnecessary flashbacks about Eddie, and it's not so funny that I was bored of it. Good!
