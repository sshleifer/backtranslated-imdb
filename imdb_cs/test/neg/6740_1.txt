The alien's direct-to-video Steven Seagal film, which was originally intended to be released as a theatrical feature in March 2003, an intention that was allegedly reversed when Seagal's previous film (half past dead) was tanked at the box office. According to some reports, the film had a rich $ 20 million budget, including location shoots in Warsaw and Paris, and was completed as part of the studio's duty to a two-image deal that was negotiated after relative success of Exit Injury showed hints. that Seagal still had solid consequences. Despite the size of your investment, Sony Screen Gems has probably made the right step on the shelves of this movie. It's almost incomprehensible. What I say? It's incomprehensible. I don't think I understood what was happening at all except the broadest terms. Seagal is employed by a mysterious guy to give another mysterious boy a mysterious package. The other mysterious boys are trying to stop him. Another very mysterious guys are trying to kill the slightly mysterious boys trying to stop him. Others really, mysterious guys are doing particularly mysterious things, all of which were actually too mysterious to find out. The enigmatic wife of the intended recipient tries to capture the package before he can deliver it to his husband. Because he is a self-appointed "perfect professional" who has been hired to deliver the package just to the husband's hands, Seagal first defies his wife, then later joins her in protection of her and her daughter from other mysterious guys with unexplained men. agenda as well as her husband. Many people have mysterious, mysterious conversations. Many people throw out their brains. Some guys seem to die more than once, while in other scenes they stop shooting without a clear view of the result, so viewers see someone dying but not sure which of the guns is heading for the hill. Devotion often changes and adds secrets. Or should I say confusion? I don't know who was on whose side or what anyone really wanted, and the decision was as unsatisfactory as the exposition. At the end of the movie, I just sat there thinking, "Is that the end? What ...?" <br /> <br /> I couldn't even find credits. IMDb says Aussie actress Kate Fischer (from "Sirens") was in this movie, but I'll be damned if I know where. Either she stayed on the floor of the room, or wisely left the project. She could find some activities that would be more beneficial to her career, such as unnecessary surgery, tearing those annoying insert cards from magazines, or organizing some community rail courses in animal husbandry. Seagal used to be a pretty Righteous Warrior, but the action scenes didn't buy the movie at all. Seagal is at the age of fifty, and he is a very big man, so he is reduced to an extraordinary level of physical exertion and even when he is in a knee-length coat to cover his Brandoesque inchoate circuit. He could even get a little wind removal of the sticks, though it is understandable if you estimate how many of the ones he must eat to keep his current circuit. It seems Steven Seagal comeback with Exit Wounds, but if his last movie was half dead, this one must be pretty close to filling the other half.
