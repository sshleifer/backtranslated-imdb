As other reviewers have noted, this film is a cross between the stories we've seen before. Specifically, it looks like Clint Eastwood in the High Plains Drifter embedded in the Mad Max. Remove Clint's cigar and replace it with a cigarette; Remove his horse and give him a high-tech motorcycle, and voil√†, an updated drifter. In this movie, "Hero" is even more ruthlessly "Savior" than High Plains Drifter. Now our hero has long brown hair, suffers from a wound on the left and his entry into the city is preceded by a plea for "saving" the surviving burghers - quite a transparent reference to "Second Coming". I watched the movie on a hot, wet wound. Sleep was impossible and when he appeared at 4:30, there was nothing else on TV. The film served its purpose. While unoriginal, with characters that are almost comic cartoons, the film is still somewhat funny ... at least at 4:30 in the morning.
