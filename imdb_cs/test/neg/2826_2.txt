I wrote an essay in 1981, a year I graduated from high school called "the last American virgin". I also had a friend named Nancy who was a prostitute in this movie. Her daughter seems to have taken over my essay one night when she slept over my house. a year later I woke up one morning and saw an advertisement for this movie. I was 18 years old and started an essay on my life experiences. the film is a little different from my essay, but I certainly took it from it. I had no proof of this thing except my English teacher mr.Versace who gave me A on my essay.i let it go and never anything about it.i figured out what comes around going around.i still would be no action against anyone involved in this movie. I just needed to get it out of my chest, as I never really told anyone about it, except my closest friend & they agreed it would be a secret. whether I had some good stories or scripts to look at. I think that's what Hollywood is all about, getting stories from anywhere can.it was interesting to see parts of my life on the big screen though. Ghost Writer!
