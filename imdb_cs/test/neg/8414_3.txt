This movie is a bad movie, but to get any nutritional value, I recommend watching it with Rosemary's Baby. There's a lot to learn how different directors can draw different shows from the same actor playing the same characters. Watch Minnie Castevet (Ruth Gordon) and the great work she did in the first movie vs. the terrible rendition in this movie. It's also interesting to see how different actors have played the same characters. Which leads me to wonder if anyone who has continued to know about the first film and watched Rosemary's Baby before doing it? <br /> <br /> If your interest in movies is just superficial, then you should avoid this. I have something to say about it, but I don't want to go there.
