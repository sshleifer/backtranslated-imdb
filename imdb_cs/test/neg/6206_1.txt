That's not a good movie. It's an attempt to remake the English movie The Hitch. But it offends the original. This is hardly the movie you expect from a veteran director like 'David Dhawan' who is credited to directing good movies like "Raja Babu", "Coolie No.1", "Hero No. 1" ... The main theme of this film is taken from "The Hitch" with some changes to appeal to the Indian audience, but somehow the story and script are not convincing enough. In addition, acting from the lead roles, ie Salman Khan and Govinda, is pitiful. They seem to need the slightest provocation to remove their shirts to expose the bare chest. I do not find it fascinating and least comical. What did the director say? The audience also added the Govinda Over-Hering case. It was simply unbearable. WE INFLUENCE VIEWERS TO WATCH THE OWN RISK. My rating of 2 for this movie could be considered very generous. Instead, I would recommend to viewers to watch the English movie "Hitch", which is much better.
