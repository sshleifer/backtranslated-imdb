It's amazing what you can see when you wake up at 2:00 and turn on the TV. I didn't know they had such movies. Immediately, I thought about Roger Corman, who had re-used movies or used other films for his own movies. <br /> <br /> The tags of this movie could only move the camera angles and add some time. XXX film. There was no story, only minimal dialogue that led to undressing and sex. I bet there weren't 100 words in the whole movie, but there were a lot of very big busts and hot lesbian events. There was also a man / woman action, but it was only about 25% of the movie. Another interesting thing came to mind while watching this movie, which may be of interest to those who buy hi def DVDs. Sony refused to grant a Betamax license to adult filmmakers, and adult films were released on VHS. You can guess what happened to beta max because the adult film industry is making millions of videos. Sony has again refused to award a Blu-ray film to the adult film industry and has just signed an agreement with Toshiba. You can guess which high defect system will disappear.
