Highly erroneous but only guardable "comedies" that run like the Farrelly brothers. The most criminal thing about it is casting. I couldn't believe Jerry About Connell and Jake Busey in the role of superstudy for one minute, who could pull a woman out of a hat, or even (very beautiful) Shannon Elizabeth as a hard cop! The story is predictable, but on several occasions he manages to increase the titre, though "rough", to be "shock comic" scenes (one involving the amputated testicles, and the other in sperm) horrible. If this movie is on TV, then it's probably worth watching if you are extremely bored, but don't waste your money on renting!
