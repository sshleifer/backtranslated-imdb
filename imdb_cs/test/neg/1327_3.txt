One would think with the incredible backdrop of World War II Stalingrad that writers would come up with a script. No way. There's no story! It's like porn, medallions of violence interrupted by pathetic, rote and insignificant dialogue. A bunch of Germans march around filming and shooting. Slowly there are fewer Germans to march around, shoot and shoot. Then there are no Germans who should march, shoot and shoot. <br /> <br /> Pretty bad. Chilcoot
