Oh, boy, it's another comet-hitting-earth movie. Coming within one year or two of Deep Impact, Armageddon, Space Cowboys and various other silly movies with rap stars in them. Apparently not because I rented it, I hope MIGHT won't be horrible: Dennis Hopper was in it, after all, and he's a good actor, right? I've forgotten something important: along with Peter O 'Toole, Robert De Niro and quite a few other respected actors, Hopper likes to appear in horrible movies. Not only that, but he seems to be preparing for them by forgetting the forgotten classes. His performance in Tychus is so terrible that you expect Divine or Edith Massey to appear in some scenes. I don't know what else to say about this garbage, except that you watch Deep Impact on things that fall into earth movies, and then Armageddon and Space Cowboys on the stretch. Forget others completely. This one is really the bottom of the pile.
