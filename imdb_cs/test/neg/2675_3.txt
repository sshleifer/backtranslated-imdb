If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to fans of the series before Halloween 6 is like a bad insult. The story went to all dogs. Michael is used as a helpless pawn in this film and is not scary at all. It reminds me of an excessive alcoholic than a boogeyman who hit the fear in our hearts back in the original. There are almost no redeemable features about this feature and I am so glad that H20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to make it fresh in our minds. Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked. Having an adult Tommy Doyle in the movie was nice to the touch and merged with the original. Donald Pleasance is here (in his last performance ... what a bad movie will end an otherwise nice career). When he is on the screen, he makes memories of the good old days when Halloween was actually scary. This is about my friends. Stem sequences are non-original. One of them is the shameless riot of Laurie / Michael Chase in the original. Other characters are terribly under-written and just not likeable. In this movie, the music that is on the Halloween highs is tortured, even if the film is bad. we get a stupid rock version of stalk / chase. What they thought when they did this movie. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * <br /> <br /> Their biggest mistake was to kill the character Jamie (now another actress who is not worth mentioning that this character escaped death in two movies. We rooted in it and when it is killed in this movie, you can't help but apologize to it and realize that filmmakers don't care about good characters appearing in the movie. <br /> <br /> * END SPOILER * <br /> <br /> The less they said about the embarrassment, the better, I wish it didn't exist, I suggest skipping this movie, and even 5, and just go straight to H20 because if you watch that You don't want to see another Halloween movie again.
