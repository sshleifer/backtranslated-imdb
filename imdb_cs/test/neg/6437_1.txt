If it is classified as "real life" in London, then it must be producers on another planet. It's the most depressing, suicidal, dark, dirty, dirty TV. Everyone fights, everything has tones that stretch, nothing is done for real reasons. <br /> <br /> If you want a real picture of people in London or the UK, then this program is farthest from reality. <br /> <br /> I can't say one good word about this program. The only certainty is that it will be a great big fight for Christmas dinner. <br /> <br /> Even the characters are absolutely incredible!
