As Anthony Bourdain said ... "I wanted to keep my head in a bucket of lye, pull out my eyeballs and jump off the cliff." This summarizes my feelings of this pathetic waste of human effort. Helpless, confident, thoughtless and evil. Bad out of understanding. What else should I say? If you are unhappy enough to be in an area where this piece of idiotic basket is playing, please pity the soul and avoid at all costs.
