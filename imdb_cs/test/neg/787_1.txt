This is my first review on IMDb.com and probably the first ever written review of the movie I made on my own - not for some classroom tasks. I think this fact itself says something about this movie ... it's not a good thing! I am no seasoned journalist or critic (although I have seen my fair share of movies), but I have found that this film is so painful that I did not have to look at the need for my own calm to scatter o experience. Where to do better than IMDb? When I forced myself to sit in the film, physically writhing from the inability to connect the dots, I was sure there would be some light at the end of the tunnel - a revelation that would explain what in samhe. happening. The film ended and I was as enlightened as a dog ****. After some rewinding to review some of the scenes, I couldn't do anything reasonable. I found out that I wanted to shout: "Does it make sense to someone?" I would recommend not to waste time, but then again, if I were you, I would probably want to experience it myself. If so, bring a crossword puzzle or something to get bored.
