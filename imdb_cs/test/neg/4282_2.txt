Animation is great, I admit it. But Disney has maintained every stereotype that Alaskan seeks to overcome in the last two generations. And the names, I think, come ... Sitka, Kenai, Tanana & Denahi? These are real places where real people live! And the real people for whom these real places were named seem to be trying to break free from Earth and seek revenge on this little thing. Disney, you're out of California and Florida, amidst the rest of the states that still treat us as a foreign country. If you can't stick to what you know, at least hire and / or work with people who know where you're trying to caricuture. Maybe it wouldn't be so insulting! :(
