The earth was destroyed in a nuclear holocaust. Parts of Earth, because somewhere in Italy, a group of pureblood survivors - those without radioactive contamination - are hidden in a massive mansion surrounded by lush landscapes and waiting for another opportunity to go hunting those who have polluted blood. . The ultimate executor is the story of one of their victims, Alan (William Mang, who looks, not surprisingly, much like Kurt Russell), and his efforts to take down the legally convicted hunters who are led by Erda (Marina Costa) and Erasmus (Harrison Muller Jr.) . Alan was trained to kill former NYPD Sam (Woody Strode), who mostly hangs and gives him pupil moral support and mooching for canned meat. Strode is by far the best thing on film, though it doesn't feel good and only appears about a third of the run time. As far as the story is concerned, it is the mixing of elements from better movies and stories, including ten Indians, the most dangerous game and the escape from New York. The final executor moves at a fair pace and provides reasonable entertainment for less discriminating action fans.
