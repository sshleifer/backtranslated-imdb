One of Bolls' attempts. It just shows that if you do something long enough, you just need to improve by chance. It is still not good, but at least traceable, which is an improvement over blood. The main difference between Bloodrayne and FarCry is the fact that Farcry's story was not the strength of the game, while Bloodrayne had a strong story, so Boll had a better chance to spoil it. The action in this movie is actually pretty good. Sometimes he touched the touch, but in a good way and worth the watch for it. <br /> <br /> Acting wisely was quite decent. Most actors are pretty good, but you can say they don't take it seriously by comparison with other performances. But the lighter mood that gives the movie really helps. Although I think that sticking a little closer to the story of the game could be a slightly better film change made are quite practical and not big enough to make a difference. Especially because of the conspiracy of the game, Oscar was hard to win just a car for the FPS massacre. She would like it to be in the jungle because it was a pretty integral part of the game, but Canada doesn't have much jungle and is at least set in some rainforest. Why Boll feels the need to change the already professionally written and managed game charts I don't know. And until the source material begins to be spoken through its adaptation, it will always be missing. Look at the movie for laughter that is good for him, and maybe for watching during the party as party food.
