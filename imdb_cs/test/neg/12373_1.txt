This is really a terrible sci-fi / horror movie of 1957. In fact, despite Ed Wood, Jr. and his horrifying films, which receive a lot of publicity, this turkey is as bad as the worst of wood. Now, acting is a little better than you would find in Wood's epics (such as PLAN 9 and BRIDE OF MONSTER), but the special effects have been considerably worse than Wood's! However, bad movie fans will be happy to hear that it's so bad that it's still great watching. As a wooden movie, it's great to watch this crap and laugh with your friends. The movie starts with a scientist who flies about doing some tests in his jet. However, out of the blue, the UFO stripes and his message about it through the radio will trigger the air force's panic. But later they realized that the UFO did not appear on the radio and thought the scientist was a matrix! But as soon as these planes begin to disappear everywhere, they realize there must be something to watch. The film is not big yet, but it is observable. However, when a terrible flying monster appears, you know you are watching Turkey. First of all, thanks to the terrible use of stock movies and lousy models, the aircraft changes course. Some of them may not be bothered, but with aircraft lovers like me, when I saw the F-80 turned into an F-86 on an F-102, I went crazy - especially since the planes looked like any other . Second, through "clever" cinematography, all you really see on a monster is a fuzz ball for half the movie! This is frustrating and you hope that when you see it clearly, it will be worth the wait. Well, no luck! "Monster" looks less realistic or frightening than Groucho's "You Bet Your Life" !! In fact, it's much less realistic than any of the Japanese giant monsters !! In fact, the Big Bird from "Sesame Street" is still a little scarier and more realistic !!! It's just god-horrible in every way and can only be the dumbest movie monster in history - about as bad (or worse) as monsters in ROBOT MONSTER or TEENAGERS FROM THE OUTSIDE SPACE !!! The bottom line is that it is a totally horrible movie that people will not like. Bad movie fans like me (who are crazy partners) seem to love it! All the others ... afraid ... to be BIG afraid !! <br /> <br /> FYI - You may notice that some of the clips in this movie are from other sci-fi movies !! I'm positive that the Washington Monument crash scene was stolen from EARTH VS. FLYING SAUCERS, but I also saw some other scenes that I swear by other movies. What is hack work!
