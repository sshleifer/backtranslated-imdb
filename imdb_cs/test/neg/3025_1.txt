Good Lord. I'll say right on the bat, watching only 20 minutes of this movie. As I am a hardcore Eraserhead fan, "what, you can't watch a wild black and white movie with a little-to-no dialogue?" defense does not apply. I just can't watch TERRIBLE strange black and white movies with little-to-no dialogue. This movie is what happens when you give an angsty goth-child no talent and nothing to tell the camera and the budget, and let it give the most pointlessly offensive images on the screen. From the beginning it was clear that this film should be 5 minutes long (assuming it should exist at all). The shots, which should take a few seconds, are dragged for a few minutes, as the director has the "I-Just-Love-The-Sound-Of-My-Voice" syndrome and refuses to cut another shot until it's all over the listing was displayed. Ever since the girl in the mask started to masturbate the corpse of "God" (the opening scene of the movie! Joy!), I knew it was just a matter of time before I turned off the tape. After at least 10 minutes, when another corpse was pulling around, a gang of veiled mysterious men twitched on the rope, I knew it was time to give up. I rarely give up the movie. I sat all over Blair's Witch 2: The Book of Shadows, though not happy. It didn't deserve the 20 minutes I gave him. <br /> <br /> If you're an Eraserhead fan, don't let the simple mindset compare to this movie to let you rent this piece of amateur basket. Let me refer you to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, for an observable and entertaining piece of incoherent black and white strangeness.
