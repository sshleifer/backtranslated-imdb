If the movies where the virtual reality figures come to life and are either male males or female eye candy sounds good, then perhaps this film may not be a complete waste of film. Needless to say, the vast majority of people will consider it an absolute hole, with little acting talent and even less scenario. Yes, Athena Massey is nice to look at, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this disaster.
