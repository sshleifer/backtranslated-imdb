I watched this movie several times and I never really liked it. I'm not a so-called "horror" fan, so I can't be denied this account. I found it a little stupid, I think what's bothering me about the hammers is the sexploitation aspect, not the sex mind, but the Sexploitation. I'm surprised how many people rated this movie so high, so I'll look at it again. But it wasn't scary for me, she had no atmosphere, just a little "omigod, look at those evil / stupid women from a prostitute in London and the little innocent Anna who is about to rape another nasty man, ooherh!" I suppose that in the end the film had no depth for me, just a lot of ugly men and women who were there, just for the titration value. This doubt was to a certain extent what was similar to Victorian England, but the sets are still too clumsy and boring to give a Victorian threat. The horrors of Roger Corman, on the other hand, are style, atmosphere and graceful horror. For me, it was just exploitative, flat feet.
