What a lousy movie, it took me three times to finish it. The thing I liked most was an infantile sense of humor. jokes from 10 year old child. it's not funny. actually quite annoying, for example, when a detective can't get into a bar that shouts "she'll take it all away" and then everyone runs around "fast forward" the slapstick rushing a bit. so stupid. And also the guy sitting at the bar smashing the fruit to develop his post-traumatic stress disorder. On bar! and the bartender gives him more and more fresh fruit. it should be funny? and I mean ... I love good exploitation of gore flicks, and I've seen a lot of horrible movies, but its one is bad. and also "gore" is not so exciting. do not bother. I wouldn't recommend it.
