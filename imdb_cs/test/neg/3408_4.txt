Solange is not a great Italian thriller. Prepare for a spoiler - the chief suspect, Professor, didn't do it. But is it really a spoiler? No, because you know he couldn't have been a murderer from the beginning; he and the student witnessed the first murder. So there is absolutely no tension whether the professor is a murderer. There is a long, tedious build into the final explanation of the mystery. The solution is interesting, but it comes out of nothing. The rest of the movie (and it's not a short movie) just isn't exciting enough to attract you. Even in the tradition of "badly accused man" it fails because the police never seriously accuse the professor, and the murderer never after him. Dull, boring, boring.
