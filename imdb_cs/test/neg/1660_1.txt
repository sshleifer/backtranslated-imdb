Have you ever thought, like after watching a horror movie with a group of friends: "Wow, this is so cool! We have to make a silver-plated horror movie a few days early. I bet it's not as hard as it seems"? "Well, it had to be what happened in the minds of the young Campbell brothers in 2003, probably right after watching Sam Raimi's "The Evil Dead" or similar independent horror movie, but this "Demon Summer" is so bad that it's awkward! a horrible genre and they know their classics, but it doesn't almost increase them.In my years I saw quite a lot of miserable B-movies as a horror fanatic, but that's honestly one of the biggest pieces of crap ever made. it is an open heart, because the whole cast and crew clearly had good intentions, there is no scenario, the duo of criminals simply steals a mysterious book from their ass and reads some passports One of them mutates into a nasty demon who starts killing members of all the different teen groups: dorks, hot Catholic girls, stoners and troublemakers. That's it, with the exception of all the mandatory cliches, of course, like the hot girl falling on the biggest dork, etc. Etc. Performances are really painful to listen to and none of these annoying teenagers use mimicry! He just stands there motionless until the script says it's up to them to communicate with them. I hate that! Some of the make-up effects are decent at a distance, but they're still not spectacular, and the soundtrack includes some of the worst punk songs ever. This film should never be released ... I can very well imagine that it must have been fun to be part of the production, but it's absolutely imbecile and doesn't show the slightest redemption element. Not a little amateur nudity, damn it!
