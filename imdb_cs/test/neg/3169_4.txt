Although Stephen Gyllenhaal is a good television director with a few good experiences, "Homegrown" is just a mess in his script and direction. Despite the performance of Billy Bob Thorton, John Lithgow, Kelly Lynch, Jon Bon Jovi, Jamie Lee Curtis and Ted Danson, this film could not save the film. Gyllenhaalics will know that Jake and Maggie are in the movie, but you don't see Jake very well and Maggie is just in it for 30 seconds as a guard who throws Lithgow's bust away. It's not even a lowbrow comedy, as the movie was supposed to be. It just wasn't fun.
