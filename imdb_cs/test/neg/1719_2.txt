Unimpressive and extremely low science fiction budget with no charm and appeal. Even scenes associated with the fall of asteroids are stolen from other films with the same plot. It's just a bad rip-off "Asteroid" (with Annabela Sciora) and "Deep Impact" (with Morgan Freeman). It seems Mr. Hopper is trying to get away from this absurd and blunt sci-fi entry. I give it 2 (two). And don't say I'm not a good boy!
