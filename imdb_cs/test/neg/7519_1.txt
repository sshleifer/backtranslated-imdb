If you loved the early '60s of The Time Machine, don't waste your time; Just like last year "Planet of the Apes", it was "reimagined" and not for the better. And as with the "planet ...", its main actor is woefully condemned and guided; Guy Pearce, a great actor with a wide range, is bad for this role, giving one record that evokes zero compassion; he is so dour and serious and lacking in the horror of (supposedly) wonderful things he sees that you don't believe he is experiencing. Worse, the idea was to resemble David Spade's child and Calista Flockhart? A handsome actor, here he is extremely skinny, which is, believe it or not, a major distraction. Frankly, a man looks seriously ill and is cruelly photographed. He shares absolutely no chemistry with anyone on the screen, a direct result of performance that is not synchronized with anyone else. Sadly, even with the right leader, this film has no chance of being mortally burdened by both a totally incompetent director - the scenes go nowhere and are poorly implemented - and a scenario that is totally inferior, scattered and sometimes disjointed - for one moment You don't care about anyone in this movie, for that there is nothing that should be in character development! In the original, you have to know Eloi, so you felt them and felt their horror Morelocks; Here, as the film emphasizes several times, they are nothing but sheep and act accordingly. If you're not a PETA member, scared sheep are ALSO fun! Samantha Mumba is doing his best in his film debut, but just like everyone else in this mess, especially Jeremy Irons (if he is the leader of the Morelocks [who look like a rejection of the Mummy Returns]), why not looks like the long-lost brother of Edgar Winter? "Also unnecessary was the money that was spent on endless" special "effects that believed $ 70 million spent on the film; they are uniformly bland, obvious, and unconvincing. , his artistic direction and ensembles are simply "out there" and his costumes are typical of design. There is no original idea or thought on the screen. It is not even fun! (The creators now use the ubiquitous Orlando Jones as "comical relief" but as usual, Jones is irritating, and just how his electrically driven character survives in a world that seemingly lacks electricity inu?) Overall, it's empty, lifeless, dull, sterile and confused: NOT YOU ARE THE "Planet of the Apes" ??? (At least it has a wealth of some powerful performances!) <br /> <br /> * SPOILER! * The ultimate insult (behind the head that trembled with terrible fear, not to mention the appropriate, ending)? Not only do the BARELES have changing dress figures at their disposal, but also the time itself the machine itself anachronistic, gaudy glass-n-chrome hole! (If "The Sopranos" had a time machine, this is exactly what it would look like.)
