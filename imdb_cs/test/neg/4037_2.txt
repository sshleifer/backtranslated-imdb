I let a friend talk to me to see this movie, and all I can say is - I want to kill that friend. This is an hour and a half of life that I will never come back I will regret it forever. <br /> <br /> If you also were unlucky to see this movie you would agree with me that it's the absolutely worst movie ever made, always! <br /> <br /> If you have never seen this movie and are thinking about seeing it - let me save you time and warn you: DO NOT MISS THE FILM, SUCKS !!!! Everything in this movie fails, an attempt at comedy and sexiness - it just seems stupid, cheesy and disgusting. Try to have women in the movie who are really attractive and sexy and not fat, ugly and rude to look at !! Acting is laughing, just like writing. Of course it was made by quite amateurs, I can't believe these people could do such a stupid movie, isn't the law against it? There should be. <br /> <br /> There are a number of good "b" movies if you're in such a thing, but you're not wasting your time on this crappy wanna-be movie. <br /> PEACE
