It's not as bad as 1992 "Nails" (where Hopper plays "unstable" cop), but bad enough. How can a movie with such a great cast go so badly? This film can find a way. The story was pretty stupid, and Hopper's direction seemed like he'd never driven before. All the long shots at the beginning were unpleasant. Lots of pointless scenes with lots of meaningless dialogue.
