Unlike most reviewers, I hated this movie, simply because the bloated ego of the author / director was in the way of an otherwise potentially interesting topic. Too many movie fans compare 'EXTREME self-indulgence' to 'GENIUS movie!', But I don't buy into this cult of personality. The film should be about his theme, not his director (unless of course Woody Allen's film). * SPOILER * (which is just as good, it saves your time ...) There is nothing brilliant about showing you how long you are - what you know in the last picture - it is actually called the cheap maneuver that SCREAMS movie hacking. Posing after the film has reached a state of "great movie" based on its forbearance and pandering to the audience? who is primarily a writer / director. However, other viewers should look at the brutal, brutal nature of porn biz. The film movie had a porn star angle and looked down at every player that could be bash. Regardless, just love your writer / director. Loving those four-minute steadicam segments that have to show the moment of the moment, but somehow had all the switches on the switch. Love the story - no matter how boring it is - about gee-whiz rise and sordid fall porn stars. Of course, look at it. While the subject has the potential to be fascinating? innocence, money, degradation, beauty- your worship writer / director somehow managed to make it all look again, DULL. Partly because of its running time. Here's something your author does not try to make a hero: Gives characters a dimension. Or soul. Anything EVERYTHING to take care of Genius is Paul. But I don't buy. I'm not buying into indulgent hacks with stunning hype. Another long autistic hack figure with fifty times more humbug than quality. I know some of you agree. The rest will see this benevolent film again. It is not my problem.
