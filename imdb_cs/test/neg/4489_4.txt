When I read this story a while ago, I was very excited to see the movie. I read the book again. It's one of my favorite books by Nicholas Sparks. What I think the story is relationships. This was decisive for me in the film because I think the relationships were poorly expressed in the film. I have no idea what the meaning of changing the role of the main characters (the characters of Tim and Alan) is. The film did not capture the relationship between John and Savannah at all. Maybe if you haven't read the book, you may like this movie, but I thought it was so boring compared to the book. I thought Channing was a great choice for John, but I had the feeling that all young adults would bring them to look at it, so I think it was more focused on them. The end cuts the whole point of the book, so I wasn't satisfied with it either. I was hoping the film was more like a notebook or a memorial walk and the way the books were captured. I feel like I spent Friday night and 10 bucks on a kindly love story, not the story I was expecting.
