Hollywood was throwing up one more waste that is wildly exaggerated and not tasted on the first basis. Hannibal is bad, terrible, inept, lame, droll, idiotic, resourceful, ridiculous and utterly cruel (no pun). Minor Spoilers Follow ... <br /> <br /> This movie has huge logic holes - more than any Bruckheimer / Bay movie - or for that matter - any movie that demonstrates the indulgence of Hollywood hyperbole. It is a slick Hollywood cash production on Hannibal Lector's mania, which director Ridley Scott hacks director-director "so-somber-he-takes-this-too-this-too-" and produces an Italian producer with a puffed-up ego whose "no matter" on whether film is ** t, money is good ‚Äù. I can't get through the fact that the acclaimed screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian have written this tripe adapted from the lame and pretentious book of good novelist-author-hack-author Thomas Harris. David and Steven - well-known and extremely talented screenwriters - have wasted their efforts on a bad script in exchange for fat payouts. Another factor in the disappointment of this film. There are too many ridiculous scenes on the list that are ridiculous in clumsy execution and bad logic, such as Starling / Pazzi's cell phone amidst the persecution of Lecter, who is becoming a victim of Inspector Pazzi. Not to mention the sadly bad talks that Tony Hopkins made with a grin and Julianne Moore, Ray Liotta and others who can't deal with a straight face. Hopkins gives the true meaning of "scenery-chewing" along with the hammy playing Gary Oldman as a deformed psychopath striving for challenging revenge against Lecter. The Gore effect is good, but it just serves to repel rather than provide the tension that is absent from Hannibal. The ancestor - the silence of lambs - is more plausible with tension and tension. Tension is what made the Silence of the Lamb difficult as a magnificent mixture of psychological horror and thriller, not to mention the superbly written and tense film. The "brain dinner" sequence is so ridiculously false that it borders on its own parody. The end is a bit moving and stupid - we believe Lecter is still a threat to the company with the last shot. to establish his glittering eye that stares at you? Ooh, scary ... <br /> <br />
