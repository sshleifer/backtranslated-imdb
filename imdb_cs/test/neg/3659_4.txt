Maybe I saw a clean version, but apart from a few flashes of my breast, I'm not sure what these other commentators are referring to in top nudity. <br /> <br /> Everything is not as bad as I was Waiting for the previous comments, even though you are interested in ...

The quality of the movie could have been better, but the acting was pretty decent. All in all, a fairly creepy (and yes, brutal) movie with an unsatisfactory ending.
