I managed to do this whole movie, but I was impressed by the total lack of fun. My friends and I are fans of HK, but WOW. This film has everything and I mean everything that a film shouldn't have. Poorly developed and stereotyped characters, over-the-top overacting, cheesy special effects, talking robots, no less than 20 double-foot jumpkicks, impossible situations, rude "gags" and "jokes" too - long run time. Throw in that Gen-X Cops was a decent movie and this movie is even harder to carry. Quite simply, if you're having fun watching the movie ... no.
