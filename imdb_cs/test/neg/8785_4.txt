Hey. I mean, who. I mean, who, who. I saw this movie when I was eight in 1996. At that time, CGI movies were rare; and good. Also at that time we listened to things called CD players. But I turn. I used to like this movie a lot, so I remembered it well until it was displayed again. Hey, it's Don Bluth! Anyone who hates "All dogs go to heaven" is definitely a robot. But again I turned. Then I saw it again. It's really not one of his best, I can say now, eleven years later. I've seen a lot more movies and got a little more knowledge. Sure, the voice is good, I'll give it. The story is fine. I think we see it all the time. MANY. But it works. Music numbers are what I'm sorry about. That would be more home in the eighties, with these kinds of musical numbers. In 1996, most children's films had epic numbers, like the Lion King (which came out a year or so previous, but anything) or similar things. You get here showtunes, in the style of vaudeville. Sometimes jerky, and on others completely changing style and format with changing shots, it's really hard not to notice. <br /> <br /> I still love "All dogs go to heaven, but it could be better waaay. <br /> <br /> 4/10
