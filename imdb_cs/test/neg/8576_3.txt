This week's surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror of The Nun (La Monja). Seriously, I think horror movies should try and invent more imaginative titles, though the story is about character as described in the title. Who knows, we will soon have spinoffs like a monk, a priest, and others belonging to different religious sects. The basic assumption is very simple that a ghoul dressed in monk clothing (so that he can claim title) goes around killing ex-convent girls. It seemed to be some kind of conspiracy because the daughter of one of the victims, Eva (played by Icelandic Anita Briem eye candy), continues with the help of a few good friends to reveal I know what you did last summer (also mentioned by the way). <br /> <br /> When the number of bodies increases, it's a race against time for our emotionally scarred (not always?) heroines. reveal the truth and save the day. The film plunged into the sins of mothers and introduced it to the unthinkable, with the succession of dreams as an introduction. I hate the dream sequence because it's a pretty cheap technique if it isn't done properly, and there are a few of them in the movie. Partially, the movie played at a time like Ju-On went wrong with lots of Dark Water links, and they could retitled this Unholy water, under the circumstances and plot points in the movie. However, there are plot holes, so don't look into going too deep. You would come to expect a standard textbook to turn to the end about a sadistic nun, and sets that seem to compete with a recent Thai horror chamber. Respect is quite forgotten, with the cast speaking in a perfectly accentuated English. And because most of them are pleasing to the eye, the story has to be in a love scene amidst witch hunt. What does he give? Hello, I have a hantu, I still have a mood and ah? Ghoul is quite a low-cost animated / SFX, which has a built-in AI popping up every now and then, in different ways, just to shout out shy viewers. The characters also break every unwritten rule in Do-Nots in a horror tradition, so you know and expect their simple desserts. <br /> <br /> Can you enjoy this movie? Of course you can. Just make sure you're looking at it in a full house (it should be easy because local people are infants for anything at a distance scary), and laugh at those who are so nervous they scream at every "scary" scene. It's quite entertaining and adds atmosphere to the on-screen atmosphere. The surround sound won't even come close. Think of it as watching Scooby Doo's episode without wisdom and it's a pity that the bloody moments in the movie had to be censored for PG rating. It could have been the best pieces that were left rotting on the censor board.
