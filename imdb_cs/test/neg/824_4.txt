If I compare two films with Sacha Cohen, Borat and Ali G, then Ali G is extremely better. I'm not a masterpiece but at least a movie. Borat is a complete waste and I don't understand how it was better than Ali G. <br /> <br /> I can't put a finger on it, something bad with Ali G: half of the jokes are like being written 15 years, not an adult . And a lot of jokes, including Mr. Cohen's lower body, are quite tasteless. But the film is actually connected as a comedy and there are some valid jokes that are funny: how, for example, Ali G becomes a member of the government for doing something scandalous and stupid in public (unfortunately true ) in today's Western society: people get a career for doing stupid things in public), also Ali's advice on immigrant policy and some others. Ali G overall remains a sympathetic character, though he is mentally retarded for his age. But it's okay to watch, it's pretty funny. But never look at Borat, it's terrible and makes every intelligent filmmaker sick.
