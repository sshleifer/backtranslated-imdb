Wow! I really regret seeing this picture ... Funny, I agreed to see it only for my wife who suffered torture when I saw him about half an hour before retiring while I stayed in front of the TV but only to feed the masochistic in me and myself because I wanted to know if this movie was so bad in its wholeness, or if there were any removable aspects that could relieve the feeling that I was stupid when I was looking at this ** ** Two Girls and a Guy ... <br /> <br /> Everything in this picture is bad, absolutely wrong ... from the initial, absurd, assumption that two women are so stupid to stay with their common friend , except for the horrible but merciful end, don't forget the terrible action of three actors ... Don't believe the reputation, junkie is wrong and I don't see Graham becoming a famous name in the film industry ... <br /> I wonder why, after the producers saved some money with only three actors and one place, they shouldn't hire a person to write the script instead of doing it with a monkey with his *** ... /> <br /> At least I felt a little cool when I destroyed the DVD and threw it in the trash ... Anyway, I liked (and just a little bit) brunette actress, Natasha something but it wasn't enough to beat incredibly stupid and crazy assumption Face-off (changing faces), so two girls and a guy at the bottom ... <br /> <br /> Stay away from this ****!
