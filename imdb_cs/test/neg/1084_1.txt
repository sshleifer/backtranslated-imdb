I will say it again ... one of the worst films he has ever made and was made by a director who made one of my favorite films - "Excalibur". I was on the floor to find that she had a mark of over six. This movie is upset. It looked terrible. It looked like it was in 18 days, and Boorman had to sleep when he ordered it. Arquette didn't do anything. Just a terrible, rotten, unbearable and probably the only flaw in Boorman's celebrated career. <br /> <br /> 1/10 !!!!!
