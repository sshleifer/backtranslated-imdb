A total shame! Really awful! The screenplay and dialogue is a joke and combined with a director who has no idea about life in Saudi Arabia. It's not a surprise, quite a Saudi film ha, the director is a Palestinian-Canadian, a writer is Lebanese, a major actress is Jordanian, and filming took place in Dubai, and all of these elements have proven to be far from representative. society. Yes, it contains some Saudi clich√©s, the things we see in the newspaper cartoons every day, but that's all. The film had the opportunity to show the real problem with Saudi society, or at least to bring something new and true about the problems and concerns of the youth in Saudi Arabia, instead copying and pasting back and forth, resulting in a mess. Even the alleged love story in the film does not exist, or at least we haven't seen it. The only clear side in this total debacle is any good action from the supportive cast. Veteran Khaled Sami was funny in the badly written role of a great father, who is obviously wrong because he looks younger than an actor who plays his son. Also, the actor who plays the role of a fanatical brother, Turki Al-Yusuf, did well, in fact, was the best actor in the film. The rest of the cast, the pros long, did OK, but the main actor Hisham Abdulrahman was just bad. For all the situations he had one look at a little adorable bobby. He couldn't even say lines properly. He has a charisma that has earned him a Star Academy title, a very famous reality show, and is good at interviews and TV shows, but was just the weakest link in this movie. The main actress didn't bother me very much, but even in some scenes she behaved badly and played her sensuality in an unpredictable way. The film was a huge hit, Saudi plunged into thousands of neighboring Bahrain and Dubai took part in it when it was screened and made a tone of money, then it was screened in a pay-per-view, then on TV and it was within a few weeks. It was cash on Saudi's eagerness of home entertainment, but unfortunately; the movie was neither home nor fun.
