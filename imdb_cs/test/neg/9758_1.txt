As I watched this film, I felt like a plastic bag was slowly closing around my head. Acting was terribly choking and it was a bad deal. The most vibrant piece in the whole movie was the one who had to play a warped rocket. When I finally finished, I felt nothing but relief. I expected this film to be a real tragedy, with some profound psychological intrigue in the aftermath. All around it was stupid, no beginning, no climax, no end, just on and on, and the plastic bag was getting worse. Let's do it here. That's a horrible movie.
