I loved the first 1/3 of this movie and thought it would be one of Truffaut's best movies. I loved the conspiracy where a pen friend marries a man from half the world - sight invisible. Especially when this woman turns out to be a scam and was responsible for a friend's death to take her place! She then cleared her husband's huge bank account and disappeared! I was really addicted and I wanted to see more ... <br /> <br /> And then the movie broke up and became simple stupid! Despite coming from New Caladonia and Reunion, when he sets off on a trip to the south of France, he almost stumbles on her. Hmm, ... odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. Then, instead of killing her or turning it to the police, she forgives her - even if she recognizes what she has done. Okay - that's hard to believe, but okay ... but then she helps her hide her from a private detective by killing him !!!! Nobody's so stupid! Yes, Catherine Deneuve's character is pretty beautiful, but come to people - that's just stupid. Moreover, if he wanted it as a sexual object, why would he do it for a woman who is often frigid and utterly selfish and evil. This film, due to its senseless conspiracy, does not deserve such a high rating! If you're not a Truffaut fan, try another film - even one of Truffauts - just NOT this one.
