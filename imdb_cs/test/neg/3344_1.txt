This movie is so unreal. French movies like these are just a waste of time. Why watch this movie? I didn't even know why. What? Well-known sex scene of half-hearted siblings? Although the sex scene is so real and explicit, the story on which it is based is unrealistic. So what does it mean? Can you easily find it in life, half sibling doing such things? Did I learn something from this movie? Yeah: some people are so happy to lose time doing such movies, such stories, such nonsense. But for those who like nihilism, nothingness in life, or simply life without hope, then there you have to see this movie. Only one is worth adoring, though: CATHERINE DENEUVE. She is so strikingly beautiful woman.
