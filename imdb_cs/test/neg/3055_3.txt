When I first saw it, I thought the pieces were pretty scary. But the horror is somewhat undermined by the fact that teenagers are so exciting that you don't really care what happens to them. There are some really good moments like Angel's talk about demons, and a briefly seen demon himself is effective. But it's not really worth repeating or detailed analysis. It is all pretty cheap and cheap looking and often downright stupid, pornography and indecent wisdom that too often replace horror. The music is great, and the episode is definitely fun, but this movie doesn't have much to recommend, just comes as another Jason type of stem and slash.
