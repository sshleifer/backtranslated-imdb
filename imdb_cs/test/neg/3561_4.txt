This film is about a grieving woman who has lost her husband during suicide. She is troubled by her son who refused to talk after it. Children's grief is rarely studied on film, so it's refreshing to see a movie like Addison's Wall. However, due to the very nature of the film, there is no tension or drama. In addition to a few key emotional moments, everything in the film is very simple. A sudden end that doesn't solve any mysteries will certainly not help the film be more attentive. Addison's Wall might have been much better, such as examining the contents of the wall, the intensive care program to help Addison go through his trauma. Instead, the film feels very unfinished and uninteresting.
