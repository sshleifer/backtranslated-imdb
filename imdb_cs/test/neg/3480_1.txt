Being a fan of bad movies, I was excited to find a 3 pack cr @ ppy horror movie at Best Buy today. The set was inexpensive and included a horrible movie called "Dark" that I actually remember seeing in a theater. The remaining 2 was just as bad. The beings of Abyss are probably the worst of the game. Because they were all bad, he doesn't say much. But his stupidity, bad acting, terrible effects and retarded story actually made this a lot of fun to watch. With every new development of the land I rolled across the floor. Discovering an abandoned ship, missing crew, knowing there was something terribly wrong !!! It was great!!! Of course, the favorite scene is a sex scene. PRO BOHA !! I almost lost it !!! In between, "monster cam", I must say that I enjoyed this movie a lot. I'm a fan of bad movies so I enjoyed it, but in everything I had to give a movie and 1. It was okay ... But if the bag is garbage, at least you borrow it (YES BAD pun was intentional)
