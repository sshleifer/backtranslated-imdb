The setting for "Nature of the Beast" is brilliantly simple and full of unlimited potential for tension: harried salesman Jack (very much Lance Henriksen) raises trouble in the form of hitchhiker Adrian (Eric Roberts), who seems to be against Jack. Oh, and more than a million dollars were stolen from the casino and someone dubbed 'Hatchet Man' crushed people in the desert. Sounds great, right? Something like "Hitcher" meets "Psycho". One or both of these men have secrets and nothing is as it seems! Well, unfortunately, writer-director Victor Salva (of "Jeepers Creepers" and "Powder" fame) does not have enough ideas to make the film go, the script arouses no tension or tension (poison for what is supposedly "thriller"), and inclusion the underlying homo-erotic tone seems to be in place. Henriksen evokes an unusual, not-quite-terrestrial man (even sporting enough intestines), but Roberts is about as frightening and frightening as extra in "Death Wish 3"; we are never saturated to the point where we were really interested in what's going on, and the conclusion moves to an unlikely territory (I still thought it would be a "Fight Club" but I was wrong). Very bad. "Nature of the beast" could have been something else ... instead of anything else.
