for people who have no idea what comedy is. This includes not only people who liked this movie, but also the people who did it. What did they think? Madonna plays Judy Holliday? Please can't even play MADONNA (if it's Madonna). I hope Griffin Dunne was well paid. He deserved every penny he got, because if he didn't kill his career, there would be nothing. I'm sure the few people who actually paid to see this movie left a feeling that pockets were selected. Madonna is apparently the past point of feeling embarrassed by her virtually total lack of talent as an actress, but you can't help feeling embarrassed for her anyway. He has no connection with the rest of the cast; She seems to have appeared on the scene and said, "OK, I'm here, I'm gonna be embarrassed by making the absolute worst impression ever Judy Holliday ever saw. Do exactly that. I know the phrase" rotten Madonna movie "is it is painful to watch a totally awkward and talented "actress" who does herself a complete fool, but apparently does not mind because she does it over and over again. <br /> <br /> The only remotely entertaining The thing about this "comedy" is that she managed to find the people who gave her the money to do it.
