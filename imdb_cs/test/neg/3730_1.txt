During your life, when you see and enjoy thousands of movies, the feeling of Minnesota is the worst (main movie with A-list stars) I've ever seen. Bar none. This film completely fails at every level. It's badly photographed and edited. There is an uninspired acting, the kind where the actors look bored. Perhaps just collecting payouts? And the worst of all is that the sand script was written under the influence of some unpleasant substance found only in the sewers. I can't even begin to understand how a writer / director could ever find someone to fund this project, let alone attract all the stars he did. I really wish I could go back to a time when I watched this piece of waste unnecessarily. If possible, I'd give this movie zero. Even better, a negative number.
