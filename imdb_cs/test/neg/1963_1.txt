Okay, let's start in the office of the downsizing and probably not very good. The main character from the first Jack Frost is in a shrinking office that raises random rhymes about Jack Frost. Gee, all right, my brother shouts '' Turn it off! ''. By the way, back to the crappy movie. The collision has a speaker phone and lets his secretary and her friends listen to this heroic insane sheriff. I suppose he's supposed to be the hero of the first movie, but he doesn't look like him! Yadda yadda yadda, laughing at the poor sheriff, yadda yadda. Now some people kick an anti-frozed snowman, yadda yadda, now we're in the lab with some kind of doctor of people. I don't see how it is supposed to do anything but their shoving against frost / evil killer mutant snowman with needles, warming up, shocking it, adding strange and bizarre chemicals to it, all nine yards. Nothing. Well, they give up and leave it in the aquarium. One of the doctors leaves the coffee on top of the tank. The janitor walks in, cleans things, hits a fish tank, and coffee spills a tank that makes Jack alive. Behold the power! Now he's somehow in .... ..I believe in the Bahamas ... but it looked more like Hawaii .. But it couldn't be Hawaii! If they spent all their budget on dang airplanes. Bah .. I'm used to messing up the rest of this rotten film, so you'll have to rent it and watch it yourself.
