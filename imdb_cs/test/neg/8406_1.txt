I still watched it because it seemed the plot was going somewhere. When he got there ambiguously, I was very disappointed. I'll tell you what really happened in the next sentence. But maybe not. Maybe I'll just suggest something happens. Writers lacked any imagination. It's not even a "B" movie - it's a TV "B" movie.
