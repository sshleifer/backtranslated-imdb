Annoyingly long gloomy film waffle. I couldn't believe how bad the movie was. I only watched it because of the many people who went on this site. Did I watch the same movie? The whole episode is one-dimensional. Nothing that happened in Garps' past has affected his (or someone else's) future, and none of them have been affected by their past. I think it was Socrates who said about games that if the scene can be removed from the game without any effect, it shouldn't be there. It is clear that the director did not know this rule, so he filled his "work" with one disastrous scene after another. Even the plane that crashed into the house was unexpected, it wasn't a surprise, but it was unexpected! It is worth noting that at the time of writing this article (December 1, 2002), although many people say it's one of their favorite movies, no one has bothered to add an unforgettable quote. The reason is that they just aren't any. Don't waste your time watching this, watch the warp board instead.
