The strange, deliberately skewed biography of Dyan Thomas, in which we hear a little more than a dozen lines of his poetry. Instead, we have to endure the raw character we see through the prism of his proto-bigam relationship with his wife (Sienna Miller) and child love (Keira Knightley). Matthew Rhys plays Thomas with enough magic to inoculate us against his otherwise repulsive self-interest, and Cillian Murphy creates a constant tense lovetet. It seems that the movie never decides where it goes. There is no arch as much as a viaduct from one end of war to another. Maybury looks much more interested in his two female leadership (who would not ??) than in the man who brings them together and then shares them. Miller is the choice of two (at best I found Knightley competent but then I never found her sympathy), but they both offer incredibly inconsistent Welsh accents. Other humorous decisions include too much for the inconsistent character of William (Murphy), artistic production (eg Double Crossfades) that is neither an impressionist nor a symbolic and old chestnut act of period shots that may not. 4/10
