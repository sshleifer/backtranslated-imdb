Los Angeles, 1976. India film brat John Carpenter, fresh outside the film school and with one film - his budget for a non-spoof in 2001 called Dark Star - under the belt, completes a bold action player called Assault On Precinct 13. Story of an almost abandoned police station besieged by an invisible gang of LA, it was a minor hit on the circuit and accumulated little praise from several critics who cared, but unlike carpentry followers, he barely set the film world. Smash Halloween (1978). On Precinct, Carpenter was still teaching how to use his almost non-existent budget by using lower-police actors, keeping the action to one hellishly small location, and moving the film at a tight pace with a combination of editing, intelligent camera. work and switched genre wit. Nobody wants or may not be hungry in Hollywood, especially if the 2005 Assault On Precinct 13 weekly bill is higher than the original. This translates into a kind of laziness on the part of the filmmaker - you have a stupid big union crew, a studio and a marketing firm that does your thinking for you. Which is why twenty years after watching Carpenter's film, I still see every glorious moment, from a little girl shot in the cold blood when buying ice cream, to the tireless pounding of the synthetic score. One week after Assault 2005, I remember Larry Fishburn's still ping pong balls and something else. It's New Year's Eve in District 13, a station closing with skeleton staff to see in their last hour. The challenge is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-narc now deeply worried and jumped on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners were icy in the opening scene; Iris (Sopranos' Drea de Matteo), a nymphomaniac with things for criminal types and Jasper (Brian Dennehy). As in the carpentry attack ..., a bus with four heavy criminals is redirected to the precinct. All hairy eyes are on the gangster King Bishop (Fishburne, still overwhelmed by his time in the Matrix), who has survived the assassination attempt of a clandestine cop and plans to blow the cap off endemic corruption in an organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall (tired of Gabriel Byrne) . Early phones are off, power lines are down, and both crims and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging a war against Duvall's working group of corrupt cops playing white balaclavas, bullet vests, infra-red bazookas and more high-tech equipment than Skywalker Ranch. It is expected that we believe that helicopters buzz around the top of a police station and shoot missiles into the windows, a covert operation that covers Duvall's tracks. As with the recent overhaul of the Seventies Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 can experience the most basic plot of John Carpenter's original and quote the 1970s. "It's its own thing, man." The main question is - why bother? 1976 John Carpenter is a cult favorite among genre enthusiasts, but is barely labeled in public collective consciousness. The carpenter himself was busy reprocessing the classic Western Rio Brava of Howard Hawks into a tight, claustrophobic urban thriller for as little as $ 20,000. French wunderkind director and rap producer Jean-Francois Richet, a confident fan of John Carpenter's work, seems less concerned about giving up either Hawks or JC - although the script is dotted with references to cowboys and injunctions - and it seems to be intention. Squeeze in as much lightning and firepower as a multi-million dollar budget lasts. The result: some strained moments with POV handheld cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) number of bodies, a couple of neat twists, but basically a class B urban action member with a much exaggerated price tag. When it comes to carpentry control, it is pure conceit by filmmakers who do not pay. Monsieur Richet says it's a journey, and I wish you good luck with your musical career.
