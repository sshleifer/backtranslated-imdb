My mom wouldn't let me watch this movie when I was in grade 2 because she said she was too violent. Well, a few years later, and the only reason I remember this movie is my mom, I stayed and watched him at PBS. Well, maybe all this year will lead to a great disappointment with this movie, but I found it lame. It did not fly at all, and that made the actor's jerky, huge incredible holes, but there are a few cool scenes like car chases and a big fight for weapons. I won't be back for this movie.
