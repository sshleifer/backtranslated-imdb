It's hard to believe that a movie can be so bad, but you live and learn. What is more amazing is the fact that people who put this thing together probably had a college degree. Meanwhile, the fruit of their work reveals something that a group of five eighth graders might come up with. On the clear side (if any), the soundtrack has some nice moments, which is another reason to ask how the rest of the film can be so incredibly bad.
