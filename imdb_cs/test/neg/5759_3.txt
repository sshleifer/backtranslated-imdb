My friend and I decided to follow this obvious piece of waste purely on the basis of his slogan? After nearly 30 years of miserable and rudimentary teen slashers, I can't believe that just now some stupid horrible brain comes up with a brilliantly funny slogan "They Axed for it"! Other than that, "Miner's Massacre" is just as random, annoying and forgotten as any other out there. Maybe even more! The script contains all the typical clich√©s and contains all the terribly stereotypical characters you want horrible and painful death. Gore effects are computer engineering, and so beyond the sad and mandatory "big" stars (Karen Black, John Philip Law and Richard Lynch) are completely useless despite their top billing. Cursed mines and abandoned ghost towns make the ideal horror environment? The creators of "My Bloody Valentine" have already figured out that in the early 80s? but his blunt film simply has no innovative ideas, or remotely surprising elements he could offer. A bunch of greedy twenty who defeat themselves, called friends, though apparently unable to stand, desecrate an ancient mine in search of gold that is allegedly hidden there. Of course, he inadvertently resurrects a zombie miner in this way and he only 150 years of rest to prepare for a massive teen massacre. Yay! The cast is exceptionally irritating. All girls have impressive stands, but refuse to show anything. Instead, they prefer endless whining and taking unnecessary risks. Dark dogs clearly serve only as a screen filler. In her barely five minutes of playing, Karen Black still can make herself a total fool by portraying the most prototypical and hysterical local mother of all time. Zombie has a stupid and very unconvincing face, but looks good and reasonably threatening as he is shown in the distant shade of moonlight while swinging around his ax. Since the best thing about the "Miner Massacre" relates to the above brand and you can read that on the box in the video store itself, there is very little I recommend here. Director John Carl Buechler scored several modest hits during the 1980s, such as the original "Troll" and "Friday 13" sequel, but it's obviously time to leave now.
