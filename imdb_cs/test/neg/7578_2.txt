I don't know, but the movie was too similar to the other movies I saw. Ring, Eye, Dark Water, everyone is the same for me. Don't get me wrong, it's beautifully made, beautiful camera work, great graphics, but the story is too ... too frequent. In the end, it is a score that makes tension, you know: shouts, rumble. The characters in the film also do not respond very naturally, moving very slowly, surprised by anything they see. I know some people who love this kind of movie, and if so, it's a well done movie, I think it doesn't hurt to watch. But if you saw the movie I mentioned above and I didn't like, then I would recommend you not to bother.
