Don Wilson plays the role of a cop who sometimes uses virtual reality fighting games, but things go wrong when people decide to take virtual reality to the next level by making the video game real people. as a prototype, but the main bad of the video game wakes up and starts killing people, and now the only person who can beat the guy is Don Wilson, who in the meantime falls in love with the cybersex model. In fact, with all the things I consider to be my greatest confusion, I try to understand whether people have brought a country from a virtual reality, were robots, people, cyborgs, or just some type of unknown computer program. It doesn't matter because it's just an excuse to watch one of the worst actors when a butcher appeared as if he was leading a deli. The complete lack of Don Wilson's charisma is the biggest mistake of the film, because the man doesn't like a guy, he's too good-good, his voice is too high and doesn't look very impressive in action sequences. What saves this bore-fest from my lowest rating is Athenia Massey, who looks super hot in high-cut outfits and who gets infrequently naked. Also on-board is Loren Avedon (a good martial artist), Stella Stevens and Michael Dorn as the evil guy's main voice, but their efforts are futile because they are all hidden by the very bad deal of Wilson. Another drawback, the biggest mistake of the film, is the lack of action, because we are asked to watch the story unfold, but besides Massey's nudity and perhaps some unintentional amusement as a result of ridiculously unconvincing play, there is nothing really interesting. This also applies to action sequences in which they are choreographic, poorly directed, and completely free of any excitement. This is virtually unobservable. <br /> <br /> * off 4- (bad)
