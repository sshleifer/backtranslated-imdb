And the title says everything: a cheery-sounding title that is a cheery-sounding joke of a movie known as "Alien from L.A." Why not say "Alien from South Africa" ​​because this is where this movie was made? My advice for watching movies that have been featured on the "Mystery Science Theater 3000:" don't look at the original version of the movie at all! Time! Always watch a movie with a theatrical shadow at the bottom of the screen, with a man trapped in space with his two funny, wisely cracked friends of robots sitting in the lower right corner of the screen. It seems better. The film as originally seen: Awful! The movie as seen on MST3K: Genius!
