Doug McClure has played in several of these British genre adventures and this must be the worst of the series. I know that this time has its critics, but at least the movie was about filming a place and relatively good production value. This is a problem with this movie - Production values ​​go beyond "so bad that they are good" loving territory and become "so bad, I think I'll go and see what's on the other channels" <br /> <br One example is the first scene with intrepid Cushing and McClure, who meet a monster. It is painfully evident that a monster is an average-sized man dressed like a rubber monster to look over twenty feet tall over an exaggerated rear projection. It is even more painful that our heroes try to escape the monster by running in place. Did I mention it's one of the more convincing pieces? Not like that, it looks like it was filmed in someone's living room with a reserve that remained in the budget of the WOC DOCTOR. Even the former DOCTOR WHO Peter Cushing is a bland and what should be the fun line "Can't seize me - I'm Brit" is delivered in a very straight line (a very similar line is pronounced by Cushing in the HORROR EXPRESS) script without description, rendering and unforgettable dialogue. It's not just that dialogue is unchanging, it's also rare and rare because monsters don't talk. It wouldn't be better if the main criminals humanoids like in WARLORS OF ATLANTIS to explain the plot. Does anyone know what the plot is? A very boring British movie that even Caroline Munro's double talent can't save. The entire mood of the film is summarized in the final sequence representing two keystone cops
