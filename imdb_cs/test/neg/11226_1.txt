I think they're rewarding idiots today, because the one who came up with the concept of this movie wasn't shot in sight. This is Moron's joy. The worst stereo types of each ghetto and high school movie are pulled around and are even more unbearable. Every character in this film has a story of sobbing over sympathy. Let's pray for a remake where the whole school goes into battle. <br /> <br /> *** Spoiler *** how does the school run away to have the internet in the first place?
