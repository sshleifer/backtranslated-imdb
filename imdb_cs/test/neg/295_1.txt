Well, imagine that every state in the US, no, every country has exactly the same trees that grow and soil leaves. Also imagine that a monkey-shepherd camp so far from the beaten track that you had to make in the first half of the river access has a beautifully tarmaced track, a perfectly straight road leading to it. Imagine a world in which you will need to wear a full biohazard suit to collect a floppy disk, then just put it in a ziploc bag and transfer it to your pocket without any action once you return to the office. A world where two nine-year-old girls are happy to give a lot of blood without complaining. This is the world in which this film is. Besides, it's one of the most classic pieces of excrement I've seen in my misfortune over the past year. <br /> <br /> I liked it. :)
