Now don't get me wrong, I like to see half of the nude babies twisting around. It is part of a Moroccan restaurant entertainment: ogling belly dancer. But it's not a lot of conspiracy. <br /> <br /> My first big problem is music. I feel that when Ann Rice wrote "The Vampire Lestat", The Cure was more of a style of music that he wished (even if I was wrong). I know that when it comes to contemporary goth music, it seemed a good idea, but they did the horrible work that contained it. Lestat was an actor with probably pretty good singing. That they chose Jonathan Davis to become his podium voice is heartbreaking. Second, and someone else said it was a very bad idea. "Lestat" could be a movie in his own right, and damn good if he did it right. I honestly don't think the "Queen of the Damned" fits very well with the film. While I would like to see a film that contains a story about creation, it's too much to say "inactivity" in the book to make it a very interesting movie. And the story was very badly polluted. Now remember, it's been a long time since I read it, I always thought "Lestat", "Body Thieves" and "Memnoch the Devil" were much more packed and would make better movies. /> <br /> I know a lot of people (hey, including me) who like a lot of kitschy vampire crap who thought it was the worst of the genres that it was the main movie. I tend to agree with them. But Aaliyah had a nice body.
