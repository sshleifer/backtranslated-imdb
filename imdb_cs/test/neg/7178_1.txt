Yes. Norway has to destroy and kill two big books and a concept that works well on film - this film is indeed the worst Swedish film ever. I hated it so badly that I even thought about going on it, something I never did. But it was so terrible that I was almost convincing. I just had to sit to the end. Like some of Stallone's action bands from the early 1980s, the Swedish event will return to the Stone Age. It's so full of logical mistakes and stupid mistakes that it's almost fun - but who would ever see something good in horrible acting, Mark Hamill survived a minefield or stupid ass, useless and irrational? Allow me to ask you: Are we not with a clock that pulls down to zero, the hero is running away in a moment of time, and two friends are in contact with the enemies in the end? STUPID !!!! And one more thing: product placement in this movie is incredible. While other countries understand that it shouldn't be so OBVIOUS, the Swedish film industry probably didn't understand at all: just look at the credit card Hamilton uses to open the window? Or or ... this movie really makes me angry.
