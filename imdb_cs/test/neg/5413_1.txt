Wow where to start with this. Well, if you like the laughter of the filmmakers' total failure, then this is for you. I bought this movie for 5 bucks because I never overcame the opportunity to laugh with B-movie God Casper Van Dien, who was approaching the film, and the boy was one of them. Maybe it was enough that this film contains the single most beautiful movie monster ever. This thing, which is supposed to be an Indian spirit, looks more like a skeleton made of a plastic confectionery bowl that you put on Halloween on the front porch. He dons a cape that is a bright garbage bag, complete with what appears to be a head shaped bucket. On some points, he is a man in costume, for others he is a bright plastic mat placed on top of a horse. This monster has the miraculous ability to see with the vision of a "predator", a clear rebound and miraculously appear after throwing a spear. Sometimes it jabs people, sometimes not. This thing also manages to shoot down a single-arrow helicopter. Wow, it makes a lot of sense when a kid fires a spacecraft at the end of a "Critters". This creature is impassable to the balls, but dies somehow at the end of the film. At the end of his killing spree, which we never found out, why is it to blow him up. This is an incredible achievement because we've already seen that thing threw three times in the movie. But I think it was the last time. And don't even start me at the cruelty of other characters. First, what Delta Force employs women? The last time I checked was that the army was still making women impossible to fight. This unit is also "secret". Why? What possible reason would they have to be kept secret? And they're not even good at it, I think no one would realize that they would be military if they weren't wearing uniforms, but ALL TRANSPORT MACHINES (which, incidentally, change the sound effects throughout the movie, at some points) as BB gun air rifles, and others, canons). There is one part when the Skeleton Man throws some construction workers from the pier, and you can clearly see the pad that they are falling on. On the other place. Michael Rooker falls down a hill that is clearly straight. Slightly tilted the camera to make the slope appear, but in this scene the fall of looooooonnnnnggggggg shifts. Then, when he returns to the hill, the rope is flat, and when it shows the woman on the "top" of the hill, the rope rises from her grip, not as it would if someone were pulling them uphill. Rooker actually has a line that says, "I'm not following him, I'm following him." What? This is perhaps the stupidest thing I've ever heard, and I watch these bad movies as a hobby. The saddest part of this quote is that you can say that everyone involved in making this movie thought it was such a bad ass. Believe it or not, it's good compared to the rest of the dialogue. Negotiations, bad. Makeup, really bad. These characters had either scars or wounds that wanted to change the sides of the face. Perhaps they are foreign scars that like running around on their faces. Yeah, I think I'll make a movie about it, "Attack of alien scars that move on the face." The thief would be more intimidating than the Skeleton Man, and the movie would probably be scarier.
