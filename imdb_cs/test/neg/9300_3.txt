Frank Falenczyk: I'm not sorry I killed them; I'm sorry I killed them wrong. <br /> <br /> Wow! Talk about swing and miss. Do you have a great cast and a great plot with endless possibilities ... how do you do it! Well, apparently John Dahl found his way. With a cruel scenario with jokes about the humorous episode of malaria and dialogue so painfully dry that none of the characters is sympathetic, 'You Kill Me' could be the biggest film failure of 2007. Positively, Ben Kinglsey provides another great performance as an alcoholic Polish hit man trying to get clean, but the material they have to work with is crap. Leoni tea is good as well as Luke Wilson, Dennis Farina, Bill Pullman, Philip Baker Hall and the rest of the cast. I think the best way to describe 'You Kill Me' is a terrible movie with good performance. Grade: D +
