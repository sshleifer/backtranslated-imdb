Let me say that I lived in Louisville, Kentucky all my life. I grew up about half a mile from Waverly. In the winter, we pulled the sled down the Maryman Road and went over the Dixie Highway to sledge on Waverly Hill. Many times during the winter of 76-77 we climbed into the tunnel to warm up. The site was still operated as a "geriatric center" at the time. We walked all the way up the hill through the tunnel to rebel against what we thought was the "morgue door". I have to be honest. The only feeling we felt was getting away with something we shouldn't do. I would have to say that we have driven the tunnel more than 50 times. Nothing alien than teen boys stupid has ever happened. I like the fact that after all these years he has been receiving attention. One evening, when I was young, we looked out of our front porch and the whole hill seemed to be on fire. There was an older hospital on the hill that burned down. It took hours, while the whole neighborhood was sitting outside watching. The thing that has been lost about Waverly is that many people survived TB. Let's face it: Doctors then did everything they thought was right to save people. People worked there to know how infectious TB was. Too much is aimed at those who have suffered. I also traveled to the building several times in the early 1970s. We went to visit and we closed in the house for the caregiver through the church youth group. By the way, the door there was not a prison like a steel door with chains and padlocks as shown in the movie. They were wooden and open, sometimes too open. He made the smell of urine and faeces and saw occasional open dresses associated with patients with dementia. It was true that the state was closed in the early 1980s. Lots of things that might have to do with the age of the building or the right guy don't pay. After all, Kentucky. Part of the document that bounced me the most was the accumulation of bodies in the basket. If I'm not mistaken, it seems that they were Holocaust shots. This was added for a dramatic effect. It left a sour taste in the mouth for the filmmaker. I'm a skeptic about "Ghosts". I believe many people really think it is a scary place. But for me, Waverly symbolized a fun adventure place for a boy with a sled.
