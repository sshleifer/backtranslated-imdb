When the film's claim to fame is that the younger, lesser-known brother of Martin Sheen is in it, you know it's not going to be a good one. "Soultaker" is a low-budget, stupid movie about a group of 20-year-olds watched by the Angel of Death. It's a silly movie, but it's pretty fun and even somewhat sympathetic in your stupidity. The storyline in the movie is very small and is stretched as far as it can be. Joe Estevez is not much of an actor, so fortunately for the audience, he has very few lines and his role in most just him. This movie really feels as if it was trying to be a horror / fantasy franchise, whereas it has the same chart layout as slasher. 4 characters, everyone dies one by one ... will he live? Who really cares. Though it sounds like I hated it, no. I didn't like it very much, but I was interested in most of them, so I think it counts something. <br /> <br /> My rating: * 1/2 of ****. 90 minutes. PG-13 for language, violence and nudity.
