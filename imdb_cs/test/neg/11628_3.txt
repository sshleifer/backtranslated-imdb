Jack Higgins's straightforward thriller about the murderous IRA bomber forced to "last work" (where did I hear the plot before?) Gets ugly treatment from cult director Mike Hodges. Mickey Rourke admits with disturbing red hair to all the priests (Bob Hoskins, all the people) who happened to be witnessing the shooting. Church rules keep Father Bob in conversation, but then Rourke falls in love with a blind priest's niece. They connect with the ecclesiastical authority. What? Indeed, this is a conspiracy. Alan Bates is around as a top dog gangster who calls shots (literally) and seems to be the only actor who's on jokey tone Hodges focuses on. Bates is set to do some sort of U.K. PRIZZIHO HONOR, but no one else, including the carefree charismatic Liam Neeson in the supporting role, was informed.
