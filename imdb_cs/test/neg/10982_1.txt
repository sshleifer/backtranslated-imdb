It's scary. Pretty brief review I know, but it's been a long time since the film left me in such a confused state - I was wondering how the hell they were doing. > <br /> Last time it happened in recent years turkey 'Mission to Mars'. Salvatore Coco is an ex-con - trying better through self-help videos, endless workshops and improvement courses. He lives by catchphrases these courses unload. He encounters a washed-out night singer singer, starred Nikki Bennett, and has an epiphany; his new career will be a talented agent - with the singer as the only and only client. Funded by his gospel singing, paraplegic girlfriend, played by Sasha Horler. He is trying to revive Nikki's career with disastrous results. 'Walk the Talk' is why Australians are so scornful of the Australian cinema. It is poorly designed, lame and way too long (111 minutes for a comedy that should barely scratch the 80-minute mark). <br /> <br /> Each scene is too long and is very repetitive. The audience has no character to empathize with; A vital component in a movie like this supposedly "petty officer" giving it a go. Downbeat and the honestly bad end comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most mind-insensitive dialogue and scenes that you have screamed at power outage. This film is a failure at all levels - worse for Queensland viewers to its liberal and inaccurate use of various Gold Coast / Palm Beach locations; and its ridiculous use of Brisbane suburbs names like Norman Park and Caboolture.
