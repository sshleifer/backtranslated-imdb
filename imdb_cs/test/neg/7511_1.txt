I saw this film at the Club in Germany in 1970. Most of the participants came from the local private school I was teaching. I saw some Godard movies before I lived in France, and although they weren't my favorite, I could at least make sense to them. Being able to speak French has helped. The relatively harmless beginning of "Le of the Week" soon turned into a kaleidoscope of images, very well, maybe too well photographed, which soon didn't make sense to me. Films, like books, must have some clear meaning for me. It wasn't for me. I suppose I'm not "into" artsy films. Images still haunt me from the movie. To this day, I refuse to eat the rabbit meat that the French love. Those who saw the movie may have realized why. Yes, the subject of materialism has taken place, but cannibalism, car wrecks, and all other scenes of destruction and horror have only made me angry. I'm not sure I left before the end, but I certainly felt it. I promised myself that I would never follow another Godard movie, and I would never and consciously not. <br /> <br /> My rating: nothing. It was the most disgusting movie I've ever seen. Others may have been more clumsy, stupid or stupid. I forgot about them while the scenes from this will haunt me forever.
