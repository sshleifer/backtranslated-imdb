I really wanted to like this movie for all sorts of reasons - the topic is intrinsically interesting and it is probably the main problem facing the world today and has cast fascinating works (eg Linda Grant, when I lived in modern times) usually from the Israeli side of the fence . Also, the guy told me he thought it was the best movie he had seen all year, so with such a recommendation ... <br /> <br /> Although I was actually on the go! It is true that I was tired and the cinemas were sitting comfortably, but I found it too hard to try to identify with the characters. Once I got a headache about the idea that it was a series of medallions, I went with it, but that made it a disappointment, rather than a movie. I liked the concept of a restrained, almost silent mission en scene contrasting with these utopian moments - a sexy girl, a red balloon, and a ninja Muslim warrior. But personally I think the movie was exaggerated. I'm not saying that story and conspiracy is all (definitely not), but even a little more dialogue would help.
