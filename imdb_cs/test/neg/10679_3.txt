Like the entire cast and crew knows that f *** all about film making. This film concerns the adventures and difficulties of modern day cockney vampire assassin, and the age of the old spit with her seemingly tired vampire lover. That conspiracy in itself smells of clichés and promises of boredom when on a small scale movie like this, and that's exactly what you get. <br /> <br /> First of all, let me just say that I never said movies because they're B movies, some of my favorite movies are B movies like Jesus Christ: Vampire Hunter, but he misses the brand mile. Everyone who has some knowledge of small budget films knows that acting is rarely grasping and emotional, but Razor Blade Smile creates a whole new dimension of hamming on the screen. Some of the so-called acting are just indescribably wrong, with characters spewing out kitschy linings that fall flat, and a discourse about so many emotions and beliefs as a terminator after a couple of horse calming. The vast part of the film is also taken over by vampire characters, especially the protagonist, waving his mouth in vain, showing their ridiculously large vampire teeth and exhaling very loudly. It must literally happen in almost every scene at least once, and it quickly became annoying and unnecessary, as if many views of the slack jaws of the supposedly ghostly faces of vampires were used only to fill a little time and plunder the rest of this grassy film sandwich. Contrary to what some of the reviewers believe here, I feel that this film (especially the director) is really trying to take this film seriously in many parts. It seems to me that the overwhelming number of overly dramatic action shots and extreme shots shows that the director wanted people to feel this film and its genres were legitimate and not spoofed, and failing miserably. Attempts at allegedly tasteful sex scenes are comic and silly, and action sequences are sometimes just stupid. Also, the ending of this film was one of the weakest and most ethical conclusions I saw. film, B movie or not. When movies like this make you sit for hours just to be rewarded "oh that was all, game" ending up is actually scary. The conclusion of the "conspiracy" feels that it is a follow-up idea of ​​the director who came on the last day of filming because they have reached the end of their cords budget. But I didn't rate this movie as one star despite the overwhelming misery, and that's the only point I can really give to this movie. Intentionally or not, it was funny. I'm pretty sure the parts I found humorous were not intended, and I found that most of the effort in real timbering was barren, but when I watched with friends, it's a good movie to marry mickey.
