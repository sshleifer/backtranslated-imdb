When I was 8 years old and went through the Marx Brothers phase, my father read in a TV guide that they showed Marx Brothers "Big Shop" on Friday night and set the VCR on tape. . When I woke up on Saturday - no doubt in the TV guide - my father and I discovered "The Story of Mankind" instead. "Big Shop" Probably one of the least witty Marx Brothers movies and yet is one of the best cinematic works of the century compared to "The Story of Mankind". I can almost justify the TV Guide's mistake that the Marx Brothers - Groucho, Chico and Harpo - appear in both movies. Though in "Humanity's story," they are divided into a series of unrelated scenes: Groucho Star Peter Minuit, Chico plays any guy talking to Christopher Columbus, and Harpo starring Isaac Newton ????? Harpa takes about half a minute; Chico has only two or three lines; Grouch's scene is at least funny, but terribly racially insensitive to today's standards. He doesn't mention the rest of the film. They pulled out some of the best actors of the day and forced them to make a total garbage. What a disappointment. TV Guide, I sent you a nice letter, I'm still waiting for an apology. <br /> <br /> For the record: "Big Shop" has a wonderful piece of physical comedy with Marx Brothers on roller skates and a few songs from Virginia O'Brien. I was really looking forward to it.
