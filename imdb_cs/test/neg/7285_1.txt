I'm sorry to say that, but I didn't like this movie at all. It was too boring. So boring that I couldn't watch the rest. It's not as interesting as The Left King or Aladdin. That's why I hate those stupid days because these days just aren't what they used to be. The movies that Disney recently released really sucks! I miss the old days of making good films like The Left King, Aladdin, Pocahontas, Cinderella, Aristocats and Robin Hood. This movie is really awful. I really tried to be interested in this movie, but I just couldn't. I don't think I could recommend this movie to anyone. I would recommend the ones I just mentioned above.
