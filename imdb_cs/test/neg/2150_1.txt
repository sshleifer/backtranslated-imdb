This must be the worst case of a silent era. Not only one or two actors, but virtually the entire cast. Lee Majors and Bo Svenson were all right, but the rest looked like their first play. So the budget wasn't huge. Much of the costume and set was believable, but there were many things that jumped on the viewer to let us know they couldn't check or get all the props to match the season. I can't think of one aspect of a movie that I liked or shook my head. Your time will be better spent burning the clumps of your navel.
