Willies starts late at night when brother Josh (Joshua Miller) and Kyle (Jason Horst) camp out with their cousin Michael (Sean Astin), decide to spend time telling scary stories ... <br /> < The first one is Michael with a story called "Bad Apples" in which a young boy named Danny Hollister (Ian Fried) is bullied at school, but the sinister new janitor Mr. Jenkins (James Karen) decides to help him. Next is Kyle, when she tells a strange story called "Flyboy", in which overweight with a disturbing fascination with dead flies gets what she deserves in a terrible twisted way ... <br /> <br / > Written and directed by Brian Peck The Willies didn't do much for me and I doubt he'll do much for you too. The scenario is strange when it comes to episodic anthologies, instead of the usual three or four stories, it has only two main stories at the beginning and a few bizarre mini-urban myth scenes. a fast food restaurant just find a dead rat in her chicken, a man who dies of a heart attack on a ride and someone who tries to dry his poodle in a microwave just to explode. I have no idea what the purpose of these scenes is, but they do not add anything to the film, just as with the two main stories they are both weak. To begin with, they are too long, which is a huge mistake in these types of movies, usually the anthology stories are short, sharp and fast with a nice twist at the end usually involving people getting what they deserve. However in The Willies stories insist on the best part of 40 minutes, each of which is longer than the average TV episode & I have to admit that I have found both stories very boring, have very little to go to them and seem to be aimed at children. The first story is better to watch as a whole, but it has no twist if I saw it while the other one has a nice end to a mere desert, but the building is weak and without good reason. . I really like horror movies, so The Willies comes as disappointment, frankly, leaves the genre down. Director Peck seems to have worked on a low budget and as a whole, there's a lot of continuity errors and it's wrong. There is no atmosphere, there is no fear, there is no gore, special effects are bad and several times unnecessary shots of dirty toilets. Overall, it's a pretty annoying movie to sit over. Technically Willies is rough around the edges, at least, the effects are far from special & has an extremely drab and grainy look at the image. Acting is wrong, none of them will win any award that is certain. Willies is a bad movie, it's not scary, it's not fun, it's not fun and it's just two long stories. Definitely not recommended.
