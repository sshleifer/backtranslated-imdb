If you are a fan of the original ten commandments, this movie will cry inside. I'm only about half an hour, but it's so painful, I felt it was my duty to warn ten fans of the commandments before they were subjected to this bastardization. I didn't think it would be possible for these effects to be really worse than they were in the 1950s when the picture was taken, but this 2006 remake is wrong. I can forgive some lame special effects, but craptastic dialogue, melodramatic lifelong film-style schlockiness, and stilted we-are-wax-characters-come-to-life acting is my hope to rewrite the plot and drown moses in the Red Sea.
