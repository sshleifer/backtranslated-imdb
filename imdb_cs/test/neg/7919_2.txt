I think this is an unsatisfactory continuation. I miss a lot of old characters (King Gator, Anne Marie, etc.) and I don't like it because half of the original voices aren't back to stand up. Charlie has lost a lot of personalities, and the villain Red is not half as bad as Carface was at first. If you're a big ADGTH fan like me, it's worth seeing just how the story goes, but don't count on the 5-star in your book.
