This is just one of those movies that keep you going and that I wanted to be over. Problems are many and little is good. I feel that the main problem with this movie is that it has what equals kitschy conspiracy and tries to make it an epic film that a movie about super evil monkeys and smarts that just sign is not an epic, it's cheese. When you have cheese, you make the movie more fun. It is true that the last scene with monkeys and the laser were very nice to watch and need other things of this kind. Instead, the actors do such a serious job that you feel that the movie has only a conspirator plot amid all the serious tensions the film is trying to set. The plot revolves around a woman trying to find what happened to her with a missing former husband while looking for some legendary diamonds. He uses these two guys who trained apes to make sign language, and now they want to return to the wild to get to the ground and start an average life adventure. The only things that make this film somewhat tolerable are the character of Ernie Hudson and the laser attack at the end.
