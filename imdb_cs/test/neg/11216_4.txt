Young Michael Dudikoff as young Mr. Greystoke was left in the jungle on a Pacific island as a child. Instead of being exalted by apes, he fell into the hands of a Japanese soldier who still lived there because he hadn't heard the war ended. And like young Luke Skywalker, it turned out that he had fallen into his hands and learned the Ninja combat skills. Good thing because they were separated and the young guy came down with a case of amnesia, but those who were in place. combat skills have not disappeared. A lone boy, now named Joe Armstrong, enlisted in the army and got into the Phillipines. Meanwhile, his Obi Wan Kenobe played John Fujioka rescued himself and goes to work as a gardener at the property planter and terrorist going between Don Stewart using a cheese accent that seems to vary between French and Spanish. As these things happen, everyone meets and Dudikoff both solves the mystery of part of his past and saves the commanding officer's daughter from the bad guys in this Golan-Globus production. Charles Bronson was a little jerky now and Golan-Globus needed a new star for their action moves. Michael Dudikoff filled the account pretty well and made several films for them, including several American Ninja sequels. This film is an event and Dudikoff broadcasts bad guys at record speed. What he doesn't do, Steve James does his best Rambo imitation and shows his considerable martial arts skills. The movie has enough holes in the plot to drive one of those military vehicles through you to see the story. But that is what the buyer does not care about. Dudikoff definitely looks magnificent, tied to combat clothing. No wonder many sequels were made.
