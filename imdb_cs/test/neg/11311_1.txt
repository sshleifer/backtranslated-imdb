I left the theater and was only 10 years old. It was so bad. The story was terrible and the negotiations were worse. Leslie Nielson should be ashamed of himself, and so should the one who made the film. I was only 10 years old when I met this catastrophe with a friend, and I was not smiling in the film at the young, innocent age. We (me and my friend) are still laughing at how bad the movie was. We ended up in the movie "R" in which my parents were. The bottom line - this movie was bad. Mr. Magoo - more like Mr. Ma-who? This film could have deprived me of my life if I watched a popular cartoon on television as a child, but fortunately I never saw it, so I was spared the suffering, but I never return to the precious minutes of my life that I have wasted.
