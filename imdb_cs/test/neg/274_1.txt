I wasn't planning to watch O12 because I didn't like O11 much. I thought O11 was a nice but rather boring movie about bank robbers with a sensational arsenal of stars. Anyway, I was once involved in watching O12 and I regretted a lot. The land is not only boring but also absurd. I honestly don't even know what it was about. I left the film after three quarters and got coffee with another girl who didn't like it. I can tell you much more joy. But even the guys who stayed to the end told me that the conspiracy was still terrible and unnecessary. My advice: Don't look. Check out Team America (cheerful btw ;-)) and forget Ocean's Twelve. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the most boring and absurd peace of mind is the crap that will appear on the screen in years.
