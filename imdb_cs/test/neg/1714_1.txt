This movie (although it says the movie is exaggerated) is ridiculously horrible. Normally a huge Erica Roberts fan in the "B" Movie List, this flick of a flick makes me question his real B list influence! And Charlie, please go back to hope to revive the Diagnosis of Killing rather than to this ..... you can't blame the nameless eye candy (uhhum ... members of beauty beauty) for participating in this weak film, but you're a former television star human! Get up. Don't even get me on Stuart Pankin. For all that Stuart is good, you should see it wasn't necessarily a real movie! Bryan Michael Stoller demonstrates absolute genius only in being able to double everyone who has invested in this image (money or time). Indeed, this was not a parody or a spoof movie, even though it was trying to get a level two. Mostly it is bad writing and playing and working with the camera and editing andâ€¦ all wrong. I was looking at it because I read an article in some magic about agent agent MJ's involvement and my interest was culminated in the lawsuit he was involved in. Now I'm wondering if the only reason they show him that they appear in the film on their shoulders is that, like the rehearsal, he appeared in his pajamas and hardly lucidly (wait a minute, is it ever really lucid? ... I turn). And Agent MJ? Is it the best they could come up with the title for its character? Sheez. What a surprising piece of originality! Or maybe it was supposed to be funny? The introduction of the Marriott to the film was initially nice to the touch, but exaggerated and annoying after all it is said and done. Save your grief and watch ...... don't say I didn't warn you.
