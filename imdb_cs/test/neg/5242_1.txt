I once heard that the greatest and oldest surviving Germanic poem was transformed into a film that almost became my obsession. The first glimpses of his look that I caught never let me down. Futuristic Interpretation With Lambert, our favorite highlander and Mitra, the grave robber to be in the lead roles, got stuck, even though there were some doubts (an important female character in Beowulf?) ... I saw the movie two hours ago. When I read the director's name, my world fell apart. As I said - there were not many surprises since then. First of all, the film has nothing to do with the original Beowulf if we ignore a few violently and absurdly stolen names. If they didn't save the names and wouldn't consider it a new story, it could go like a f-class action stupid with nice costumes and scenography. This way it's just a crime! Attacking the legend and its ideology and common sense. Okay, to be positive for a second ... in addition to the general electro-goth atmosphere that is nice, it also has good music. This was also a comment for the positive.
