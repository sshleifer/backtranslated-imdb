Take the clich√© story and insert Steve Guttenberg. It really is as bad as you would expect. Sheriff Tom Palmer (Guttenberg) and Anna Montgormery are trying to turn a group of useless, clumsy children into a winning football team. Reducing originality and direction from offset is quite a struggle to maintain any form of interest in this film. Despite my reservations about Guttenberg's gaming skills, I can safely say that team coach rival action is actually worse than Guttenberg. This type of story of losers fighting all the way to the top was done earlier and better than this so-called Film
