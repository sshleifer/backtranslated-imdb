To be fair, it's been a few years since I watched the bile commit itself to a celluloid known as "here on Earth," so forgive me if my memory of the film is a bit shallow. I will keep the main points that plague the soul of the unhappy viewer. Scene one: Chris Klein, after being kicked out of the preparatory school (because he looks like a 17-year-old--) yes, very believable), gives what I suppose his valedictorian speech ... on the field . Let me repeat this - the field. I think we should be driven by a combination of shame and eloquence he can't express. Klein has a van and facial expressions of a cardboard cutout. It's a decent looking piece of cardboard, but a little more. Scene Two: After some joyriding and teenage pyromaniac hijinks, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett do some damage to the local restaurant, which is forced to rebuild. Of course. Because who better helped with construction than some random Moron who hit him / burned first. Better yet, let's say that random Moron moved to the girl Josh Hartnett, Miss Sobeski, the girl she cares about ... just like the wooden line? The Third Scene: Chris Klein's character with Leelee Sobeski and decides to name her different parts of the body along the states of the East Coast. My soul cries. Indeed, how can this scenario work out well? Certainly you must alienate several million people if you suggest that their home is equivalent to more Miss Sobeski ... women's areas. Secondly, naming her breasts after New York and New Jersey raises some confusion as to whether Miss Sobeski is truly frighteningly disproportionate. Four: Leelee is running. It falls down. It gives her ... knee cancer. "We always knew it could come back," says her father (?). Right. Knee Cancer. From tripping. Maybe I missed something. As I said, it has been a few years. I'm sure I missed something. Not what? For love of God, please tell me that the girl did not close KNEE cancer from the fall. The scream you just heard was my dying soul.
