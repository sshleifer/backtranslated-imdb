This film is a hodge-podge of various idiotic clich√©s. For example, a boy-meets-spoiled-rich-girl and gets her to fall in love with him by bothering her at college (over-used background in recent Indian commercial films). Male chauvinist celebrating sexual conquest. The peak is predictable (to be used ad nauseum in several other films). As with many other commercial Hindu films, there is a disparate insertion of songs that has probably contributed more to the film's success than anything else.
