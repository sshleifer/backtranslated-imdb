If you want to be hungry, I like this show and watch it regularly, but now (thank God!) I don't understand why I watched it. Sex and the city is one of the most senseless and offensive TV shows I've ever seen. Despite my efforts, I have no sense of this show. People say sex and the city are funny. How? Curse all the time, talk about vibrators and penis size? Give me a break. I don't understand the conspiracy: we have four girls trying to find the perfect man to sleep with every dork coming around. And this show is about four spoiled chicks who sleep with every man in town, but they finally admit that the best pleasure comes from penis vibrators. And yeah ... the show is trying to tell us that sex is the most important thing in every relationship. If you can have good sex, you are a good husband (or wife). It doesn't matter if you want to be loyal and have a good heart .. size matters. The worst problem is also bad behavior. The four main actresses (Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattral, Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis) are so bad and unconvincing that it makes me a bad watch on this show. Parker is still shouting and complaining all the time, Cattral shows his old boobs and says "f - word" all the time, Davis brings her smile (and nothing else) and Nixon behaves as if she was bored all the time. And yes ... men are in this show chicks having sex. But according to this show, women are not much better. This show is offensive to both men and women. Women are so primitive and emotionless as they have no heart, just hungry for sex. It's offensive to everyone. Gender and the city is one of the worst TV shows and I'm glad the show is over because it brings bad gameplay and meaningless stories. The whole world is not just about sex and vibrators.
