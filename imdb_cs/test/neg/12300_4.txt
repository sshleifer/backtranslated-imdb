'4. Floor ‚Äùis definitely the average movie with Juliette Lewis as a young interior designer, with a neighbor's problem. Jane (Lewis) recently inherited an amazing 5th-floor apartment from her grandmother and gets a ridiculously low rental rate by agreement with the landlord. Her boyfriend (William Hurt as a fearsome man) wants her to move with him, but she wants her own space. So he moves in and weird things start to happen, and since it's a B-class horror swing, there's a reason it's stupid, not-to-be-found-in-reality. Since Jane, who is too uninteresting, is still trying to tell others - her friend, police, co-workers - what's going on, everyone thinks he's losing her. So of course they have to face the problem - a fool living right below her. Neither scary nor interesting, the film's only saving grace is Lewis. She's a very nice actress, but she's badly used here, which doesn't mean she's not the best on this movie - because she's. He has a wild charisma and holds the screen better than a dozen silicone bimbos that routinely populate this type of film. But this type of film is not worthy of it - which is ironic, given that it is probably the only reason anyone would see it.
