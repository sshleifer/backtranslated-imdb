After watching the first film at BCI's new Aztec Mummy Collection, it's hard to believe how excited I was about how I was and how angry I was when the release date was shifted back. I've been watching a lot of Mexican horror movies in recent months. Some great? The curse of a crying woman. Some fun despite obvious flaws? Bloody Monkey Night. And some Cheesy ??? Choose the movie Santo. One thing that all these movies have in common is that no one can be called "boring". This is not the case with the Aztec mummy. It's been a while since I last watched something that causes sleep. I was hoping I wouldn't wait for a great movie, but at least it would entertain me! The Aztec mummy takes every situation that might be interesting and draws life out of it with repetitive scenes of people who do nothing, and then extends these scenes with what is happening as eternity. I think what happens when you make an 80 minute film with only 30 minutes of material. Fill extraordinaire! For example, for anyone who saw the movie, what purpose does the bat have other than bringing a masked type of wrestler to the screen and extending the run time by 15 or so minutes? I can only hope that the other two movies in the collection are more fun than this one.
