I usually do not write exhibition reviews unless I have seen them in full. However, there were so many positive opinions about this show here I felt it was necessary to cope with it with a bit of realism. This show is hysterically bad. I don't think it should be, but it is. I see a lot of praise at the show, and I honestly can't understand why - this show is so badly behaved, the dialogue is so horrible and the plot is thin around its holes. <br /> <br /> I think this show is interesting because it's a clear test of your standards. Some elements of the show work, and these elements may be more important to some people than they don't, which makes the show almost unnoticeable to people like me. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy the show's fun, how you look at it, anticipate clich√©s and the like, it can be a fun show that will mock if you have such time on your hands. The pilot is quite a fair example of the whole show. If the absurd saccharine cliche doesn't leave you in a silly shock, then it can be a show for you.
