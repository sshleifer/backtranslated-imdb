Hard to believe - but it is! I shouldn't be surprised. The ads are trying to show how unique and "fun" the show can be. Not only do the ads that announce this new show have the slightest humor for me, I have not spoken to anyone who has found the entertainment fun. <br /> <br /> I never remember seeing a pilot who is clever, cute or humorous. The characters were largely unbearable. Especially Selma Blair (who is astonishing to agree to be in a sample of this kind of show). A few moments when the characters were slightly curable were hackney and trite. Rare is a show without any qualities. And this is not one of them. Kath and Kim have exactly one quality - that's Selma Blair. Despite wearing abominable clothing and acting as a woeful, crazy, stupid excuse for a young woman who looks like a cross between Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian, Selma is still nice to look at. But if you want to take a look at Selma, go to Hellboy. You'll at least keep a prayer of respect with her instead of igniting this nasty character in your brain to connect with her. All in all, Kath and Kim are waste and actually embody the worst. TV is or has been. It sets a new minimum.
