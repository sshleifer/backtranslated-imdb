The film is visually stunning: from the dusty interior of the church with the lighted stove, the drizzly street and the demolished garage to the flame, which is the highlight of the film. It also has a wonderful time, both the 1950s (opening of the film) and the 1960s. All performances are top-notch, especially Mathew MacFadyen as a psychotic preacher and Gerard McSorley as a father who scares his son in horror. Too bad the story is so ridiculous. To begin with, focusing on the relationship between Gabriel (McFadyen) and his family, he can't quite show how he managed to keep so much in the community. In the church, we see five or six main characters on the front and another two or three on the back, but the rest of the congregation can also be dummies: there are no signs of hearing, watching or disagreeing; no one will say yes or no to a duel when they disrupt control, but none of them applauds or condemns when Caroline throws him a pint; the situation that results in a stone thrown through a pub window is mysteriously solved by the onset of labor pains. Secondly, Middletown (which is not actually a city but a small village) apparently lacks some basic services such as police and firefighters: murder can only be solved by a family member with a crowbar; residents are watching hell threatening the whole city as if they were in the cinema. For this reason, everyday things like telephones and newspapers are noticeably absent, the rural community is strangely free of farm animals or wheat fields, and only one Christian community is the most mysterious of all Northern Ireland. - Not even a few Anglicans to mix the season. Although you are willing to suspend distrust, the story itself is pretty crushed, pale imitation of A.J. Cronin melodrama. And music? The first two minutes are beautiful, but when the same four chords are repeated continuously for 90 minutes, it gets more than a little irritating. My advice: Watch it with the sound off.
