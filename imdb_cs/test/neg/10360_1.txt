Yes, I admire the independent spirit of it all, but it's like a Road Trip with a bad cast and no budget. When I watched American comedies, I laughed. This movie made me laugh, but only because of the abundantly obvious efforts to simulate college / pot-flicks. <br /> <br /> If you want a good, independent American comedy with sweat links, check out Kevin Smith or Richard Linklater flick or something. Don't waste time on this piece of film. <br /> <br /> I mean, how can you take these comments seriously when most people complain about characters who don't smoke! By the way: in Norway it is called "Dude, Where's My Pot"!
