It was a lousy, miserable film based on sublimed male fantasies. Too bad she was founded in Texas, otherwise excellent. I would recommend this film to anyone, and I wish it would never enter my consciousness because I am so irritated now that I have wasted brain cells, even though I paid the slightest attention to it.
