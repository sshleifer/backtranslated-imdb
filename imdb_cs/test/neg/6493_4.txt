It's a very average movie by Jackie Chan and one of his worst James Glickenhaus has destroyed him! All the characters are decent I think, but the story is so, but Jackie Chan is still amazing in it, even though he was looking bored. Jackie and Danny Aiello had zero chemistry, and it was a lot boring, but the finals were above average and managed to be quite fun, and had some good bits !. I haven't seen the Hong Kong version yet, but I'm sure it's better than this bagpipe, plus a twist is very predictable!. It's really lifeless and bland, and I don't blame Jackie for not feeling happy about it, and it would be unbearable and utterly unobservable if he didn't. The launch is supposed to be unforgettable, but it's nothing I haven't seen and done better, and I thought the whole movie was a bit lazy and could have been an amazing movie if Jackie had control of it! did not enter any characters. This is a very average movie by Jackie Chan and one of his worst worst James Glickenhaus has destroyed him! The direction is terrible! James Glickenhaus is doing a terrible job here with extremely low camera work, poor angles and keeping the film boring in most cases. That's it. Jackie Chan is AMAZING as always, but he's not his usual energetic self, and he looks bored and Ps * ed away throughout the movie, he had zero chemistry with Danny Aiello, and I really don't blame him either! (Jackie rules !!!!!). Danny Aiello is fine, like Jackie's partner, but his character is a little ass, and he had zero chemistry with Jackie, he did OK I guess. Roy Chiao is decent as the main villain, but he just went through the movements and wasn't so menacing, yet he's pretty damn cool. The rest of the cast is at best average. Overall, it's not worth your time or money. * 1/2 of 5
