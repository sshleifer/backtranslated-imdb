Please if you're thinking about renting this movie, no. If you're thinking of watching several downloaded clips, no. If I had my way, no one would have to read this summary. Acting, although one of the highlights of the film, was still pathetic. The director was probably a sadist. The funny one liners were something you'd expect from a room of high-paid antisocial 7-year-olds who eat breakfast. The problem with this movie is that it is trying to be a movie like "Evil Dead 2" (under no circumstances link these 2 movies) in that it's so bad it's funny. But also try to be funny at the same time, and fail so greatly to do so that your sense of humor is left too crippled to do anything, but knocked your gag reflex in attmept to save yourself. I could go on much more and specify how much it really was, but I think it would free me of my will to live just to think about it. If you need me, I'll try to cook myself to feel clean again ...
