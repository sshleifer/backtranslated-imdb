PLOT: Trucker (Kristofferson) struggles with a corrupt sheriff (Borgnine) by joining his colleagues to join and create an unstoppable convoy that stretches for miles and will soon create national media insanity. <br /> <br /> NEGATIVE: The movie setting is weak and the end is even weaker. He has all the good-ole-boy / trucker cliches without adding anything new to the process. It ends with SMOKEY AND BANDIT looking brilliant and inspired. Kristofferson is too condemned for the leading role of man and cannot carry the image. Borgnine's character is shown awkwardly. In the beginning, it is designed to look like a real sheriff sheriff who overcomes a minor controversy that is beginning to roll over. Eventually, he is a little more sympathetic and even secretly lying down with Kristofferson, who doesn't work at all. In any case, Jackie Gleason is much better for this type of role. The worst part about the movie, though, is director Peckinpah attempts to throw in a 'serious message' into this silly action movie that does nothing but slow down and bomb in the process. POSITIVE: The only good scene in the whole movie is a fighting sequence in a restaurant stopping a truck. Director Peckinpah puts his humorous spin on "slow motion" violence and the result is fun. Unfortunately, all the time the rest of the image becomes tedious, it will start all the action. McGraw is always a pleasure to see, but unfortunately she is given very little to say or do. REDUCING: If you've read the synopsis, then you've "seen" the movie. The song that this film is based on is pretty good, but the film doesn't add anything and should never be made. This is all that is very unprecedented for such a maverick director. RATING: 3 out of 10.
