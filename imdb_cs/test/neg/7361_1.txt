What starts as a proven film breaks down into one of the most coherent, clumsy, incompetent, stupid attempts at horror movies of recent years. <br /> <br /> Absolutely awful. It is such a derived disorder that tears every decent shock you can imagine without creating a single fear. Whether it's copying a recent trend with scary kids or ghosts walking around the camera or old school horror Fulci's Gate of Hell. The worst thing is, there's no cat jumping out of the closet to jump. Avoid it.
