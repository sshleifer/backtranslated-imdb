Boring film. Poor guy. Poor actors. The film takes place in a room to be in Morocco, but in fact in an American city! "Arab terrorists" are patriots whose patriot is "Arab terrorist" ... DAMN! But there is something good about this movie (that's why the score is 2 out of 10). The director turns the ridiculous stereotype of terrorism that the media feeds us daily into the real thing, terrorists are Americans (or Western people if you want to). The film is divided into two parts. The first part of the film relates to Dutch travel (15 seconds), while the second part is about staying in an amazing dark brown room (1 hour and something). A Dutch guy is going to deliver money in Morocco to some "charity", get out of the plain, take a bus and end up being kidnapped in a dark brown room. He is kidnapped with another guy who is shot after he said, "They won't shoot at us". The Dutch survivor is forced to play chess with an Arab guy like Morpheus for so long that you learn to play chess! In the end, a Dutch guy reveals his plot not because they cut four fingers, but because he is cheated by such a lame game, you should watch the movie for! <br /> <br /> Good when you're so tired you can't sleep.
