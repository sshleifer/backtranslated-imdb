Since the characters begin with "Unknown" identities that are not identified by name, so you start with handsome James Caviezel waking up in the store. He finds that the place is locked. Don't ask - windows are made of safety glass and you can't get out. Four other awakened men make it a quintet - Mr. Caviezel in his "Jean Jacket", Barry Pepper in "Ranger's Shirt", Greg Kinnear with "Broken Nose", Joe Pantoliano as Chair "Tied Man", and Jeremy Sisto \ t Handcuffs ". Oh, man? These five men have collective amnesia. They think that three of them are kidnappers and two are victims - but they don't know who is who or who is who. Forgetfulness is caused by pipe leakage. Don't ask - that happens. Meanwhile, outside lawyer David Selby (as Parker) sends his cops to solve the kidnapping while one of the male wives Bridget Moynahan (like Eliza Coles) is desperately waiting. But, the leader of the criminal gang, Peter Stormare in "Snakeskin Boots", is also on the way to the scene. Just like the DVD synopsis, he says: "As the secrets are revealed and the tracks are broken up, (five men) must race against time to find out who is good and who is evil to stay alive. Unfortunately, it sounds a lot better than it looks on film, and when the secrets are finally revealed and the memories become clear, there is no more interest in what has happened, to put it simply, director Simon Brand has a brilliant premise with Matthew Wayne's idea, but will burden light investment to the characters who hold the short end of the stick. <br /> <br /> **** Unknown (11/1/06) Simon Brand ~ James Caviezel, Barry Pepper, Greg Kinnear, David Selby
