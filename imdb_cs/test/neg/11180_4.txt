There are very few movies where the name says everything you need to know about the movie. Such a movie is I was a Communist for the FBI. Another example would be to take a monster from space. This movie is really interesting, how did it become an Oscar nominee in the documentary category for the heavenly name? It's not a document in any sense, it's not even in the hybrid docudrama category. It is just a somewhat exploitative film about the work of an FBI secret agent named Matt Cvetic, who infiltrated the Communist Party in Pittsburgh and actively sought to take over the Communist Union of Steel Workers and to inform their FBI staff about these activities. The documentary about this work might be interesting, but what we got was a movie that fits into those paranoid times. I found it fascinating that when Cvetic finally broke his cover, he was a councilor for the UN Committee on Non-American Activities, rather than the New York leaders of the Communist Party. In the film, the moment when Communist boss James Millican tells his followers to spread the word that House Un American's Home Activities Committee has composed of a bunch of right-wing yahoos trying to get their names in front of the camera. What could the idea give him? Anyway, just add the dots and undoubtedly the word that came from J. Edgar Hoover, who tried to give HUAC some credibility by having an effective secret secret system out there, rather than in the real process. A little thing called a cross test. Warner Brothers, who produced I was a FBI Communist, later made Big Jim McLain, who played John Wayne on HUAC investigator in Hawaii. HUAC seized the appreciation for the work done by Honolulu PD in the collapse of the Communist spy circle among the dock workers. But at least in John Wayne's movie, no one claimed to be a documentary. Frank Lovejoy is in the title role of Cvetic and his FBI handlers are Richard Webb and Philip Carey. Dorothy Hart plays a school teacher in Pittsburgh who says there are 30 or so similar people in this school system who indoctrinate young people, including Ron Hagerthy, son of Lovejoy. He has a change of heart concerning the Communists and Lovejoy must save her from the murderous fate that his superiors are planning. Ironically, Hart left the movies and went to work in all places, the United Nations, which we know was often accused of Communist nesting in the US. More than half a century later, we have very few objective films about the film or the press on the Communist Party of the United States. In fact, it was a very active group in the labor movement. The real heroes who stopped them were organizers such as Walter Reuther in UAW or David Dubinsky in ILGWU. But since they were people left, they simply do not have the right to be the right propaganda material. Anyway, I was a Communist for the FBI's exploitative work based on real life character and testimony to these paranoid times.
