As long as you keep in mind that the production of this film was a trick and is not intended to be a serious release, it is actually surprising how awful it is. I even liked the theme music. And if ever a movie came up for Joel (or Mike) and MST3K Bots, this is it! Watch it with lots of smart ass-wise biscuits, and you're in good time. Have a brew, butter up some big pretzels, and enjoy. Of course, getting a copy requires buying bootleg or downloading as shareware, but if you're here on IMDb, then you're most likely so savvy. Good luck. And take a look at my favorite part ... where Dr. Doom informs FF that he has 12 hours to meet his wishes ... "He does with his finger ... it's like" Evil Sesame Street ".... guy hoo. <br /> <br /> ... and of course Mrs. Storm declares:" Just look at you. Fanstastic Four "is just so pleasing .... you will laugh, you will cry ..... <br /> <br /> So if you like Sci-Fi schlocks, this is Fantastic for you!
