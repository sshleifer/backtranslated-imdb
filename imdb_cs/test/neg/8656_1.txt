Neal N Nikki is elected on the worst films of Planetbollywood. It's hard to believe that the famous Chopra made this crappy movie. It was introduced as a film for the family, but proves to be ridiculous sex comedy. It doesn't even make you laugh, but scream boredom and doesn't even have sexy girls to make the movie look sexy. The title track is the most pleasant song of the decade, I'm Neil, I'm a man, a superstar rock star. Uday Chopra is one of Bollywood's worst actors who never had talent. After making many Super Flops, and not receiving any movies from the producer rather than his family. It gives total power that bores you to death. Tanisha, who is and will always be known to be Kajol's sister, gives a terrible performance. Both actors have the most unpleasant chemistry and are very immature for their age. It has a special look of a very cute Richa Pollad, in a pathetic role. The end was so stupid and stupid, I can't believe I actually paid the money to rent this crap.
