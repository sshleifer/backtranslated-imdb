At first I thought that 'nasaan ka man' could be one of those progressive new filipino movies. as someone remarked earlier, the movie doesn't look bad. It is clear that the directors used more expensive cameras for photography, better angles, better audio equipment, good looking actors and more enjoyable places. <br /> <br /> However, these enhancements are purely superficial. If it weren't for all Polish and expensive filters, 'nasaan ka man' would feel just like your typical, second-local local movie - - hyper drama, predictable twists, "yeah!" moments, crying, screaming, and characters that you could care less about, all thrust into your throat. a few things bothered me about the movie. First, because when is it OK to have sex with an adopted family? that no-blood-related argument does not make an ounce of difference. Secondly, wouldn't a woman say 40 years to anyone that she was raped, simply because her father told her to keep her secret? and where the hell was in this movie? I know the director tried to make things look super dramatic, but I was just forced to increase the brightness of the TV.
