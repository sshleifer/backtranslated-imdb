Director and playwright Richard Day has adapted his own screen material, clearly inspired by the realistic dilemma of Rock Hudson in the 1950s: what to do with a screen idol that is secretly homosexual? Take him to an unsuspecting woman to suppress gossip (and keep him at work). The thought has given some energy to a good cast and a retro production design that is reminiscent of the Shag greeting card. The dialogue is not very clever and there is a slap around the beginning that doesn't work (spitting food, etc.). But when the ultimate act comes with a serious tone, it is treated with great appetite - and the viewer welcomes it much more than all the knots. Matt Letscher has a good job as a movie hero / girl Guy Stone, but his experience is enough to enhance his character or would he be at the bar next night? Apparently the film doesn't know - or doesn't care about it. The day wants to leave several lines and one carefully written pro-gay speech - a plea for tolerance - but has no other agenda. For viewers who invest their time and interest in these people, the sentimental compliment on this thing may look like nothing but a joke. * 1/2 from ****
