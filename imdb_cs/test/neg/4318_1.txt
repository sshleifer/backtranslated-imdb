OK I went to this page before I watched this movie, read the comments, got the pumps, - because where everything was good for B-flick - he watched it and was completely disappointed. The main characters that would be lonely lonely rebels out of the Midwestern act were frightening on their stomach, and they didn't even start me on two cops, I think there are bloody doors in plain sight, look at it! The story was quite predictable, the cut was somewhat limited, I swear that the editor was even coming to an end when this film was cut, and the direction was shrouded in bad cinema. Please don't get me wrong, I love B-flicks, some are really good. <br /> <br /> Want to watch a good B rated movie ??? Dave recommends <br /> <br /> "High Voltage" <br /> <br /> http://imdb.com/title/tt0338095/
