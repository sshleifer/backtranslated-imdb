Okay, so writer / director Larry Bishop obviously has several important links and knows the right people in Hollywood to create his own film and fill up the cast with handsome names. Good for him! Now what he really needs is inspiration and talent to come up with a really useful script, rather than an overly demanding and wannabe crap that has written here. "Hell Ride" is not a movie; He is a hectic and hopelessly fanatical boy who seeks to pay tribute to the notorious film films of the 1960s and the generally renewed Grindhouse movie. With "Hell Ride," Larry Bishop fails, and there are many obvious reasons. Shouldn't tell a story? or at least not very interesting? but he is seriously trying to cover it up with numerous unnecessary conspiracy twists, lots of gratuitous and very feminine enemy sleaze, long and tense dialogues that are trying to be cool and enormous amounts of senseless violence. The plot looks complicated, but in fact it can be summarized in one sentence. The ancient vendetta between the two rival biker gangs will burn again with the arrival of a new member; a boy who may or may not have been a long-lost son of a double cross who was executed in 1976. That's serious! Everything else, from treacherous gang members to recruiting old timer members to playing with his informing girl with a nymphomaniac, is a totally useless and confusing padding material. Another big problem in "Hell Ride" is the huge and seemingly insatiable ego of Larry Bishop. He should definitely not reward the role of a hard and relentless gang leader, because it only encounters an incredibly challenging and narrow mind; especially when there are so many more experienced stars in the movie. It is true that Bishop has starred in several original 60s movies (such as "The Savage Seven" and "Angel Unchained"), but that was a long time ago and honestly nothing good as an actor. Maybe it was simply Bishop's lifelong dream of playing a character who always overcomes his enemies and for which every hot boy is sexually craving, and that's what he wrote the whole story about. The veterans in the cast, like Dennis Hopper and Michael Madsen, are not really bothering to leave a credible impression and I can't say I blame them. This whole production is lame and pathetic and I can't afford to recommend it to anyone, despite the fact that many beautiful girls walk around around their bare breasts and naked asses.
