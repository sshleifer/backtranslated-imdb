The dominant conflict is a couple of great actors (Huppert and Dutronc) and a terrible scenario. Obviously, the actors lost because the director / writer Claude Chabrol eventually forced the lead pair to follow this worthless piece of the ill-fated letter. Fortunately, the powerful performances of Hupper and Dutronke dramatically improve the overall quality of the film, which miraculously acquires depth and humor. As for Chabrla's perseverance in keeping the film bland and illogical, it reaches its peak in the final scene, which is so incredibly poor that you wonder what pills it takes while driving.
