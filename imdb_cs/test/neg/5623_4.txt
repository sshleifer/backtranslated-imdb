Quentin Tarantino's partner in Roger Avary (co-founder of "Pulp Fiction") sets off on his own (this time QT goes exec. Prod) for this over-cooked French thriller. Eric Stoltz is Zed, a safe extraordinaire cracker who moved to France from the US at the request of an old friend. There, they team up with a diverse crew of dazed hippies who, with little or no planning, think they can knock down a bank vault full of gold bars on a French national holiday. Avary has redesigned the robbery has become a bad topic that Tarantino has developed so well in "Reservoir Dogs" that only "Killing Zoe" is not good enough to survive the power of this one, so Avary he was throwing in rather beautiful distractions. Julie Delpy is Zoe, a student comes to call a girl who amuses Zeda on his arrival in Paris. A stunning distraction that certainly is, but nothing more. I think our director wanted to add a different angle to this basic theme, but unfortunately this move did not help add the depth of his shallow plot so desperately. need. There was never a story in this idea that was anything but an idea. Even the surreal journey into dirty dives in Paris is uninspiring. I think one would have to admit that many movies never happened in the story of a bunch of gangsters who were shooting at each other. "Dam dogs" had it, "Killing Zoe" no. Stoltz's strong interpretation of dubious Zed and Jean Hughes-Anglade's insane depiction of the obsessive ring leader does nothing to cancel the proceedings. In short, Avary unsuccessfully tried to conjure up the fun of nothing. Friday, September 15, 1995 - Astor Theater
