I am usually a big fan of Pacina (Scarface, Serpico, advocate of the Devils), but since Scent of the woman plays a lot of role and shouts a lot. This movie had no cute characters to warm up. Brandon played Bongo McConnahey is the least likeable bunch. He never touched a real human being. Pacino was hopelessly unlikely and my goodness, how old is Renee Russo? The only high light of this miserable mess was a hot hooker with a perfect lipstick and a total of 10 lines. Even the usually reliable Jeremy Piven was completely unlikely. As the film closes and old Brandon is at the airport, my only thought was, let the plane crash into the airport and kill Brandon.
