This movie was quite a mess. There was nothing really about it. The only character who had an appeal was Bobbie Phillips' Maya and she wasn't worth it either. <br /> <br /> The action is a standard, double-cross double-crosser double crossing. With a few too many double crosses it makes sense. Sometimes it means that "it keeps you guessing" in this case it "keeps you waiting". By the end I wanted everyone to be imprisoned or shot.
