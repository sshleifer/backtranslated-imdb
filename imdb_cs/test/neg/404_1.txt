I watched this movie based on a few notes that it was bad but funny. But you have to be warned that this movie has the worst special effects ever made. They make 1950s science fiction films look like works of art. This is sometimes fun, but mostly uncomfortable. And combining the problem of seriously pathetic special effects is a complete lack of logic that has characterized most of the displayed events. One of my favorites is when three characters drop hundreds of feet into a tunnel of arachnids and arrive at it to light it up. Apparently, the arachnia also managed to hang into the power grid. Very impressive. But this is just one example. And for what's worth, the music sucks, the actor sucks, the two cute girls are uncomfortable, the unpleasant person is uncomfortable, the so-called handsome leader is a geek and the black girl who falls on him is crazy. Her father is the worst actor I've ever seen. I'm not sure if short moments of humor can replace this experience.
