As a big fan of Brian Yuzna and most of the films he was involved in, I thought I should enjoy Progeny. I didn't do it, even though it has its moments. However, if you expect anything from a caliber company or Beyond ReAnimator, you may be in shock. In this way it is similar to a society that is the story of a seemingly ordinary world with a horrible supernatural lower abdomen ... but it ends there. I will not say Yuzna when I say the mistake is not actually with him because the wrong direction is the wrong direction but the direction is healthy. What he films is both script and play. Stuart Gordon (ReAnimator, Dagon) wrote an intelligent script, but the one who doesn't really work with Yuzn's style of directing let him stop on the actors who had a lengthy dialogue when he really wants to throw the camera and get down with his bad style. I. This matter makes the film awkward as it is, but it is worse. If the movie was made with great actors, the movie would probably have kept its own. Unfortunately it is very far from the case. Acting is wooden, shocking, even for low-budget functions B. The inexplicably successful and renowned Arnold Vosloo destroys every damn line with almost precisely determined accuracy and passes on one of the worst performances I've seen in a long time. A man manages to turn each line of well-weighed dialogue into a kind of ham that you will drunk the other way around next time you are in a pub. â€œHey Bob! GOOD GOD, AM I AM MAD! What is ... CHANGE! NOOOO! In fact, I can try it myself next weekend. The latest addition to the veteran genre (and personal favorite) of Brad Dourif, instead of enriching the film as if he had, almost seems to hand the Dourif film in the last attempt to stop Vosloo from hamming, but quite honestly Dourif looks deeply uncomfortable (maybe waiting for another bad attack acting) next to Vosloo, and even the eccentric turning away from him cannot revive the film. <br /> <br /> If the acting was better, this movie would be fine. It could be quite pleasant, but the lack of character makes the film a souffess thing and makes the horror element seemingly clipped and tasteless instead of the organic part of the film. I have already found out that extraterrestrial torture / rape is a little difficult to stomach, but the fact that the characters were missing is unreasonable and unpleasant, so that the taste was not unpleasant. <br /> <br /> If you really like Sci-Fi and don't have a problem with bad acting, pedestrian walkers and really gaudy, ugly rape scenes, your offspring will probably be your cup of tea. But because I'm doing it, I'm probably never gonna watch him again. It was enough. On the plus side, this is the only Sci-Fi Yuzna movie that has ever bothered, so apparently he wasn't happy with him.
