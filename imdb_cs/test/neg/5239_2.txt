I like Christophe Lambert as an actor. He played in several good movies (Highlander, Subway, Greystoke, ...). But I can't even think he's been in the movie. The story is almost nothing, special effects are very bad and the actors also. To continue the movie, I only have one thing to say: it's the first time I go watch a movie and want to leave after 10 minutes.
