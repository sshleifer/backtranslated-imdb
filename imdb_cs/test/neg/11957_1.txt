This is a very horrible movie. And if you thought you saw another horrible movie, just like this one, you probably have. You've probably seen Scarecrow 2 made in 2003. Yes, that's what I said, Brian (the director) stole the movie idea. Not only was he stealing it, but in fact he could make it even worse. I bet the actors were afraid to tell people that they were really in the movie. I also have to mention that the director tried to replace cheesiness by showing as many goats as possible. Also kissing scenes were compiled as a porn movie. In fact, this is probably all the director has ever seen and tried to put together a decent movie that will never work.
