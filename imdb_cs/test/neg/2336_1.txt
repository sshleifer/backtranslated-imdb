How does David Lynch do it? Unlike the legions of fat black framed-glasses-wearing types and pretentious film critics who praise his name, I just don't understand how this guy still gets paid to make such insolence. How can Lynch carelessly pave the remains of footage from an unsuccessful TV pilot into a nonsensical, misbehaved mess, and critics struggle to do so and actually include him in the best lists of the year? I'm confused. If you are looking for a good film noir, rent a "Bound" instead. If you are looking for a good "puzzle" movie try "Memento". But beware of this overcrowded stinker if your idea of ​​a fun night does not throw away 2 1/2 hours of your life and $ 3.50 of your hard earned cash.
