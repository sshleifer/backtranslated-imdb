Usually I will not rate movies that I have not seen before, so I will deliver them or rent them to get a full and fresh film. In the case of "A Sound of Thunder," I remembered my promise to never see this movie, so I will remember. In fact, I didn't think about how badly this movie was made until I read someone else's reviews and remembered the experience I had in 2005 when I saw it in the theater. My movie friend made me see, even though I wasn't interested and wow. (Later I forced him to see 'Basic Instinct 2' in the theater, reminding him that he saw me.) So, I think it made us.)

Yes, the movie would be a great movie to see drunk (or otherwise opi l√Ω): horrible over-the-top acting, "special" FX that even nintendo64 would turn away and ridiculous plot twists. The biggest disappointment was that Razzies did not even record this film at any cost.
