I saw this movie and frankly I was quite disappointed. And in my opinion, this film lacks a heart. Frankly, I wasn't interested in what happens to the characters until the end of the movie. There were so many that they could do with the film that they weren't because they were either so wrapped in trying to be obscure and do some deep comments about life or trying so hard not. that the characters and the story were completely lost. I saw another director's film and enjoyed it pretty well. However, I felt that the film was free from the whims and hearts of the other, and I was interested in what was going on, or if it was that it made no sense. Honestly, when I didn't feel like tearing my hair out during the movie, I liked that I lost my time on a sad little movie. I have no doubt that some people will love this movie, but honestly, no.
