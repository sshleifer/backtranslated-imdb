I did a test on the screen and read the scenario of this turkey in 1988. It was horrible and even worse - now I noticed it on VHS at the local HollowWood Video and said, "Oh, what a hey, auld ang sine". Yech. They had to shoot most of them in Mexico after they ran out of money, a few "stars" of sloppy bitches because they ran out of exotic crap of fruit drinks. I suppose the movie is fine, but I knew the writer was meant to have a spy sleeve that runs around the world. Dr O ended up as a cartoon character. He must still cover himself in a grave in the Kremlin Wall. The technical flaws were all over the movie, not only with child atomic technology, but with uniforms, badges, and military jargon. Of course they were too cheap to hire a professional military advisor. Even Mr. Augustine and Mr. Newman's expert presence could not save this bird from being stuffed for Thanksgiving.
