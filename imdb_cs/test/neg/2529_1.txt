I can not believe that! Were they crazy about filming a Connecticut movie in Southern California? For God, Palm Tree is everywhere. In one of the opening scenes, one says "Welcome to Connecticut" and throws a newspaper, the newspaper says something like "Greenwich Herald". Greenwich Connecticut has no "Herald" has the "Times" as in "Stamford Advocate A GREENWICH TIMES." (Referring to Stamford, Connecticut Newspaper). Perhaps filmmakers should do a little research, I mean my god, at least get the name of a newspaper right, or a movie in places that look at least remotely like Connecticut.
