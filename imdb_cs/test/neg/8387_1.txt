I was unlucky to see this movie recently and I have to sit with it. A friend bought him for Â£ 1 and insisted we watch him sound as good as the story on the back cover. 10 minutes into the movie it was obvious that the actors were amateurs and it was an extremely low budget effort. The scenes were very poorly behaved, the script was stupid, and the story contained many scenes that seemed unnecessarily long, so the movie would have a reasonable length. For example, when a lead character rents a warehouse, the film spends a ridiculous amount of time on that scene, with a meaningless dialogue that has no real purpose or necessity to conspire. The main actor is allegedly performing revenge on a woman who sleeps with boys to give them HIV, he never thinks they get tested. Instead, he turns into a crazy killer who decides to torture her before killing her and cutting her into pieces. <br /> <br /> If it sounds good and you think it will have a lot of gore, think again. This film has no real bloody succession and is quite tame for this type of movie. It's not fear, it doesn't make you think it doesn't offer quick fun. But he can make you sleep, it's sure he'll get you tired of tears, so please save your despair and follow my heading. <br /> <br /> DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILM 1/2 of 10 (it doesn't even deserve 1) <br /> <br /> The movie was 78 minutes but it looked like it was 2 1/2 hours.
