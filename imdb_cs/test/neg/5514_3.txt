As several posters have "hinted", this is a sorry "Star Wars" ripoff. Now that you're going to break away "Star Wars", at least do it right; "Battlestar Galactica" did it, and there were several other space operas that didn't do a bad job, but that's definitely not one of them. David Mendenhall, a youthful lead, is not really too bad even though he goes overboard to a "cute" factor every so often. Vince Edwards has not improved as an actor since his days "Ben Casey"; if something is even more wooden than ten. Other shows are not about what could be written home. Even worse are special effects; The best thing you can say about them is that they are miserable. Obviously, "aliens" are simply actors who wear rubber masks with little foam or latex, and "battle" scenes between Edwards raiders and aliens are poorly staged and poorly shot. Very weak effort from Roger Corman. Skip it.
