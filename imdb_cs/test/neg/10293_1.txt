I went to the movies to look at this movie without knowing anything about it. Recognizing the name of Jennifer Lynch and seeing Certificate 18, I realized that it might be disruptive. In fact, I found the film as a farce. I found myself giggling incredulously. Acting is Terrible - Bill Pullman and his ridiculous face. Almost a shame to the actors, even though the script offers them no chance of any plausible interaction. After some shocking events, (there is plenty of "try" and shock the viewer in this movie), 2 characters are seen to share beer and talk about the weather. Everything was exaggerated or he thought it clever when it was obvious! The performance of a little character named Stephanie was best on film. Quiet and intense. I really couldn't recommend this movie to anyone. His violent pointless, ridiculous characters, bad behavior, bad script and plain stupid.
