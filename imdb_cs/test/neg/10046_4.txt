This is one of those strange, confident, self-confident movies that try to be too heavy to be deep. It's not so. Instead, it spews clichés that are trying to pass for Profundity. Typical is the scene in which Peter (Kelsey Grammer) explains to the protagonist and best friend Adam (Dwier Brown) how one starts breastfeeding life, then moves to sucking his girlfriend's breast and finally to his wife, eventually ending up with life. . So deep. We are treated by different characters who offer their views of life, the universe, etc. During Adam's travels through the Mojave Desert. (He suddenly leaves L.A. on the day of his wedding, and his family, friends, and fiancé assume he's dead when his car was found in a military test area broken by a rocket.) Some characters are more fun than others. The best way is to escape from a psychiatric hospital that speaks only through the voices of others. The actor, James Kevin Ward, makes some great impressions, including Nicholson, Popeye, and several characters from the original Star Trek. But as soon as the interesting characters leave the screen, we are stuck with Adam and his quest for deep. It is a long journey that stretches in many places. In fact, it's the longest hour and a half of a movie I've ever seen. And the finals hardly do what is worth while, at all. <br /> <br /> I found that this movie plays HBO one day by waking up too early and clicking on the TV. That'll teach me. Next time I'll try to sleep.
