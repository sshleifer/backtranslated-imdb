A serious effort that achieves some success customize the classic story of the Odyssey '' nostalgia period '30 piece. This time, adventurers escaped convicts who roam the depressed South to get in trouble. The greatest strength of the film is the great musical accompaniment that evokes not only the era that is set. in, but spiritual links that run in the movie. In addition to its value for the tone of film, music is simply plain fun to listen to. What paralyzes the movie is that the characters really aren't so sympathetic. In comedy you need this element to talk to them in their misfortune. Instead, we have a lot of selfish, arrogant, mindless, exquisite spirited nobody who has no positive points at all. They aren't impressive enough to either hate you, so it's hard to relate to them at all. They are offered as clowns, but as people who give clown make-up and march in parades, they just aren't funny. Like the story that inspired him, the film takes these boys to "odyssey," to meet a variety of symbolic (some even mystical) characters. Everyone is labeled with offensive stereotypes, the operative word is "stupid". People are derisively right and left, and as a result, no one is particularly interesting or appealing. The film does not like its own characters, and that will not allow you to like them. Riverbank christening, beautiful sirens, stolen cars, fighting matches, radio preachers, people who are whipped with clubs; everyone is thrown to you incoherently. Some evoke a few laughs, others confuse or carry you. I laughed when a stupid guy beat a snot out of a particularly annoying leading character. But there were much more unnecessary scenes; Example: Some '30's Dillinger-type guy strafes a cow with tommy-gun. Comedy? Symbolism? No; just mindless violence that reflects the intellectual nature of the original source material that this story draws from. Other Odyssey adaptations are much better. If you're not a fan of George Clooney, rent something else. But buy a soundtrack CD; music is great.
