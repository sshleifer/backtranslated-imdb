well, the writing was very sloppy, directing was sloppier, and editing it worse (at least I hope it was the edit). the meeting was not bad, but it wasn't that good either. almost none of the characters were sympathetic. at least 45 minutes of this film has been wasted over time and so the second hour has never been used in its full potential. It was a great idea, but another unnecessary good idea goes. it could end up in 3 different places but it only continued to a mostly predictable Hollywood end. and what was not predictable was done so badly that it didn't matter. the end is not worth watching. Sandra Bullock was beyond her element and should stay away from these types of movies. The movie also looked rushed. the movie is just not worth seeing and I paid for being very crazy. Maybe I was more disappointed because I was expecting a really good movie and got a bad movie. the film wasn't terribly bad after all, but I wouldn't recommend it. I gave it 2 out of 10 b / c I liked the idea so much and I liked one character (justin I believe super smart one). And it also had some very inexpensive ways to cover the conspiracy holes. It was like trying to cover the volcano with cheap masking tape, it wasn't nice. If you see it, wait for a $ 1.50 theater or video if you don't like almost every movie you see then you'll enjoy this one.
