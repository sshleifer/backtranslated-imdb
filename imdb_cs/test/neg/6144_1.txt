What exactly makes sense to pretend to be "people" from things like ski passes and pizza? I don't see a point. I wouldn't be clever or original, and it makes me pointless. Skyler Stone doesn't seem very bad or even nice. He has very little charisma and only everyone can do about what he does in this show. The worst thing about this crap is the fact that many phone calls are back in operation, so they not only seem to convert poor people to the other end of the phone, but also viewers who don't have enough time to have read "pronounced" that flashes on the screen for about half a second on the screen at the end of the show! Not only that, but He also claims to be how he lives all his life. What a lie. No one could live his life like that, and the fact that he says it's not just another show to watch his show, but it's also one of the most beautiful, blatant bull $ hits I've ever heard. This guy is @ $$! What makes them think that going for all the problems, such as writing and recording a song, getting someone to pain a huge picture of you and two friends, getting dance lessons and actually traveling to the ski resort is actually worth it do you get free ski passes and some free food? What's the point? It's a lot of trouble going just for a few ski passes and a little snow. As for the "comedy" goes, it's the bottom of the barrel stuff.
