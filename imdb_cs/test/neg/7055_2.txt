The movie title sounds like porn, but it's not even comedy sex. Instead, Hot Summer in Barefoot County is about an official sent from a southern state to a small town to find and arrest moonshiners. But the moonlight comes from an old woman's farm with three beautiful daughters. Almost everyone can guess what happens next, but strangely enough, the film is very tame. Hardly qualifies for PG ranking. What's more, the low budget is obvious in almost every shot and the acting is sooooo amateur. This movie was probably intended for the audience, but is unlikely to satisfy them in 1974.
