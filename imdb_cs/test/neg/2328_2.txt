In this David Lynch, whom I really like, I suppressed great hopes, film, but very bad behavior of all, but Naomi Watts was the first clue that it was an unnecessary effort. Some Twin Peaks are recycled into this movie, but it wasn't scary, it wasn't interesting (except for the scenes without Watts) and the jokes were wrong. Probably I'll give Lynch one more chance, but the hype about this movie just won't go away, especially for those of us who have seen Eraserhead when it first came out.
