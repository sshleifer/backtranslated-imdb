A lonely, detached, middle-class housewife in the middle of a divorce seeks consolation to think about her immediate future. At some type of bed and breakfast (well, literally in the sea) the ocean, which for some special reason, will bear for the owner. Enter the lonely, arrogant Richard Gere. He's a plastic surgeon. He is the only guest at the sea inn. Diane Lane is a lonely housewife. You never think of these two falls in love again. A tropical storm makes them a real lover. Subplots in this melodrama make little or no sense. Places, photos are fine. Gere remains one of the most revised actors in the cinema and will not disappoint. Mrs. Lane needed money, but telephones in her part with grace.
