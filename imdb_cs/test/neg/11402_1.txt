One of the movies I didn't want to see. I got it in a creeping look, but damn, acting was very bad! At the end of the movie (still surprised to watch the movie), I was wondering why I was watching the movie. Giphart's book) thought it was very bad, and he was disappointed that his movie came out like this. Next time he wants a role in choosing people to cast.
