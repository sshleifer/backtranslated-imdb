The best thing about Shrieker is dialogue. As Scream and I Know What You Last Summer, this film is aware of the conventions of this type of horror film and will come up with some good lines and scenes that play on these conventions. Unfortunately, Shrieker is just boring. The storyline is your basic ten small whodunni indians with a monster controlled by one of the suspects / victims. From the beginning you know that each character will be rebounded until only the hero (ine) remains to defeat the evil. And that's exactly what happens. Absolutely no surprises and no tension. Production values ​​and acting were all right, but I had no motivation to watch (even though I did) because I already knew how the final scene would play. The end surprised me a little because he managed to literally burst out instead of throwing out a bucket of special effects. The special effects budget may have been up to the end.
