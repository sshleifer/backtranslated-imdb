A group of adventurers travel to the "dark continent" to try to find a lost heiress named Diana, who crashed years ago years ago, and who is now convinced she lives with a wild tribe who considers her a goddess. Again, my search for lean European cannibal films dragged me deep into the territory of Jess Franco - a seemingly endless movie wilderness that crawls with a sub-script, crawls with crap, and works with them with horrible acting (Franco regular Lina Romay, who this time took the prize for her pitiful performance as a sick, elderly woman). It is here, in this hellish place, that I finally came across the diamonds of Kilimanjaro, a jungle-based abysmal exploiter so stupidly bad that it took me three consecutive evenings to finish it. Tawdry and inexorably Blunt, even by Frank's standards, this tedious piece of waste fails at almost every level: the story is a horribly boring derivative of Tarzan Edgar Rice Burrough, though with a female twist; the film seems to have been filmed in local botanical gardens, although a grainy stock record is poorly integrated into the film in an absurd effort to persuade viewers that the action really takes place in Africa; and the scenes of death are practically bloodless (Franco usually can rely on some splashes, but despite his initial appearance, this is not a cannibal film and it's not gory). Where the director succeeds, however, is in his cast sexy young Katja Bienert as jungle jail-bait Diana. Running and jumping undergrowth in nothing but a barely woven fabric, her dwarf chin, which at that time was only sixteen years old, this beautiful beauty makes an impression. Franco also throws some other nudity courtesy of Mari Carmen Nieto as a treacherous traveler Lita (who gives us a glimpse of her untamed regions), and Aline Mess as a topless warrior woman of Noba, so closely avoid getting another rating of 1/10 from me ( Even if I'm sure he'll get a lot of other things in the future?
