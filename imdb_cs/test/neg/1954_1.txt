I remember when I first heard about Jack Frost. I was in the Ezy Video with Miranda and my family on a monthly video recruitment tradition. It was at this time that I worked up the courage to venture into the horror section of the store. While browsing through different titles, I finally came across Jack Frost. The envelope was enough to convince me that the film was out of my pleasure. A few years later the film disappeared only to be replaced by an inevitable but unnecessary continuation. Again, I went into the horror section and took the case just to conclude: would the movie be scary? but not intentionally. Jack Frost 2: The Revenge of the Killer Mutant The Snowman (quite a title) follows where his predecessor left it. Sheriff Sam seeks advice after his suffering, and Jack is now in the form of an antifreeze. To escape from the past, Sam and his wife head to an island hotel where she is in a company of a wide range of film stereotypes, including busty female models, strong sports athletes and Caribbean employees. However, Jack is released from his liquid grave and is back to his icy methods. He heads to the island and kills anyone who can have an amazing death. Only Sam can stop him. <br /> <br /> Let me say that this is a movie right from the video, so it must be bad. But it is also horrible in the eyes of other films. Working with the camera is bad, using a camera that would make the soap opera majestic. Half of the actors seemed to come out of a porn movie and the other half seemed to come out of a retirement home, but in fact it really came out of asylum. There is a widespread use of special effects used in a film that tends to alternately between bland puppetry and CGI that can be improved by an infant, and death scenes are mostly off the screen showing us little of what happened to the unhappy, yet deserving, victims. But the film is most memorable for his killer one pads such as "There is something that needs a little Christmas stuffing" and "I know to pronounce you officially f *** ing dead!" The consequence is that popcorn bored for these Friday nights and even fails. To make a sequel to a film that was a poor slasher with the notion that a child would find incredible, had to take some nerves out of steel? or total frontal lobotomy. Director Michael Cooney ?? thanks for losing time. Everybody else? Avoid like arsenic.
