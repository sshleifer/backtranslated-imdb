I had to suffer through this film three times when I was a zombie in addition to the director's new film After Sundown. For the first time when I saw this film, the director stood beside me, and a fake and grim-looking hand emerged, emerging from nothing and grabbing one of the characters. I couldn't take it anymore when I laughed before the guy. The film has no direction and one thing that could make this movie decent (Woman Nudity) was nowhere to be found. I'm a fan of low-budget horror movies, but that was too much for me. The worst thing was I had to watch it so many times. Also, don't expect the new movie to be better.
