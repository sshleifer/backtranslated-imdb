This is one of those movies where acting, placement, direction and effects were so bad that you have to rent a copy, get 5 or 6 friends, a keg of beer, sit down and watch. If you want to borrow from the late Douglas Adams, "Watching this movie will be like having your brains broken with a slice of lemon ... wrapped around a large gold bar." <br /> <br /> What's wrong? All. British actors who act as Americans were many who can pull him out like Bob Hoskins, but he's not in this. Nor was it necessary to choose North America as a place, why not say it happened in England or something? The director seemed to like to take shots of girls and asses than he was actually motivated. So at this point you will be drunken friends saying "ALL RIGHT! Another shot of T&A!". There are not many dialogues, so do not hesitate to jump into the kitchen and do the sandwiches. What do I like about this movie? After my friends died, I managed to pick up $ 185 and told them they'd spent them in the strip bar after we finished watching the horrible movie.
