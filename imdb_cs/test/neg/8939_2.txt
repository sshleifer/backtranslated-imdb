The most obvious mistake ... terrible, terrible scenario. This film had a potentially good story, but it was destroyed by bad dialogue, problems with continuity, things that were never explained, gaping plotholes, partial plots of land that went nowhere, and simple stupidity. Not to mention the horrible clich√© of director Sandra Locke. Even two great performances could not save this film. It didn't matter that Devon Gummersall and Rosanna Arquette were doing scary performances. The thing is, there are better actors than this movie would believe you. The best of Arquettes, Rosanna Arquette (Silverado, After Hours, Desperate Seeker Susan) has a few great moments - like a great scene at the beginning when it pulls its handcuffs painfully - but gives it a poor performance according to its standards. And Devon Gummersall (Dick, When Trumpets Fade, and Brilliant My So-Called Life) is much worse, without any conviction or emotion. But I won't blame the actors who were good at other roles. The script is terrible and the wrong direction doesn't help. Do me a favor ... avoid this movie.
