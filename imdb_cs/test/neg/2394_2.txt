The assumption is interesting and the cast does the best that is possible, but the script and the overhead effort are so poor that it is no wonder that this film was buried - which is appropriate to the script. When I watched it, I couldn't decide what was worse, script or direction. The actors are on top, the art looks like a Disney movie, the music is fanciful and the sentiment so sweet that it gives viewers a cavity. It's a bad attempt to imitate "Weddings and Funeral". If a person wants to watch a comedy that is as flat as a pancake and how bad a direction can turn a story into a sweetness cavity, it's good to watch.
