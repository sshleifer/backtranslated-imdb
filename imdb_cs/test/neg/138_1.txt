I am BOUT IT (1997) <br /> <br /> Made and published No Limit Films <br /> <br /> >> Pros: Absolutely none <br /> >> Disadvantages: I don't even know where to start! <br /> <br /> Overview Plot: Master P plays a drug dealer who looks, talks and acts like a live cartoon character. That's all the plot I got from this movie. Review: I remember when I was in ninth grade during my release and everyone in my class praised this clown named Master P. This movie is so bad, it's not funny either. All characters in this movie are extremely tired of stereotypes, the sound is only audible when playing music, and the movie looks as if it were filmed outside the public access channel. Fortunately, I didn't buy this movie like all the other confreres in town. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1 of 10 <br /> <br /> My verdict: Avoid this video as a sexually transmitted disease.
