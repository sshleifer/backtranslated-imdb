The original Sci-Fi network. Not the best. Not far from the worst. An electrician (Richard Grieco) encounters a "key" that can open a gateway to a parallel Earth that has been taken over by mutant spiders. Mutations have been controlled by super-sized foreign queens for the past thirty years. She already ate the population of this parallel world that resembles Chicago minus the inhabitants. Guess what? Now he has to find another world to make a living. An electrician leads a four-member team reluctantly in the task of saving the world. The final confrontation is probably the best part of the film. The cast also features: Richard Yearwood, Colin Fox, Kate Greenhouse, Jason Jones and David Newman. One would think the Sci-Fi network could spend more money on special effects.
