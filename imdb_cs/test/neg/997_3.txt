Writer and director Robert Downey, Sr., a pioneer of the underground film movement in the 1960s, satirized the New York Madison Avenue advertising world with his "Putney Swope" avant-garde comedy. Downey does not limit his mockery to advertising, but fights the black militant culture, the dynamics of the Hollywood depiction, the elite white power structure, and the corruption character in every power struggle. As brave and ambitious as "Putney Swope" trying to be, it qualifies as a horrible movie, amateur-made to shoe-string budget with a no-name cast and humor that lacks merriment. Everything about this film brings with it improvisation. "Putney Swope" has provoked controversy during its initial release with politically incorrect processing of racial issues and consumer culture. Like most Marx Brothers films, this story is thin, providing an apology for Downey's anecdotes, most of which are terrible. Madison Avenue, a prestigious advertising agency, dies during a board meeting. Before the body has been removed, the Council has a secret ballot to determine who will replace it. Each member understands that it is forbidden to vote for himself. A total accident occurs when everyone votes for a black member, Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), because nobody thought anyone would vote for him. Swope pink underpants all but one of the white managers, surrounds with black, pistol packing employees, and renames the company "Truth and Soul Advertising." Swope decides to change the face of American advertising. He refuses to accept clients whose products are alcohol, tobacco, or war toys. Swope clients come to exodus after the CEO's arrival and generosity attracts a new set of clients who appear in his office in money bags and are ready to suffer from the abuse of Swope militant employees. Swope also uses his African-American workers to ruthlessly appropriate his ideas after firing them, and raises a number of offensive advertising campaigns, all of which are welcomed as a "new wave" of marketing genius. It is unbelievable that Swop's conservatism has proven itself, but the agency is becoming the target of government officials who claim that Swope's advertising tactic is a "threat to national security." The highlight of this 85-minute black and white comedy is color TV commercials. Unfortunately, Downey does not know when to cut off these ads that consistently start cleverly, but wear their welcome. The funniest part of "Putney Swope" includes our eponymous protagonist talks with US President Mime in Washington DC (Pepi Hermine), a marijuana dwarf who likes Kissinger, a Germanic advisor (Larry Wolf). come up with an advertising campaign for his new car, Borman 6.
