Actor Sidney Poitier of "Lilies of the Field" reprises his role as Lieutenant Virgil Tibbs of the 1967 Oscar Best Picture "In the Heat of the Night" for veteran director Gordon Douglas "Tired, uninspired sequel," with no equal Rod Steiger, with dialogue. " Obviously, both "Bullitt" screenwriter Alan R. Trustman and Robert D. Webb of "Cape Fear" were out of their game when they wrote this predictable police procedural potboiler. Dialogue is dull and none of the characters are interesting, not even the main suspect. Definitely nothing distantly exciting, thrilling or surprising is happening in this tame whodunite. Meanwhile, things have changed a lot since Virgil was last seen in "In the Heat of the Night". He worked as a murder detective for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the police department. In "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs," our hero works for the San Francisco Police Department. In addition, she has a wife, Valerie (Barbara McNair of "Change of Habit") and a family, a young rebellious son, Andy (George Spell "The Naked Kiss") and a younger dot daughter Ginger (Wanda Spell) "Hickey and Boggs"). Tibbs drives a medium blue Mustang and his wife holds a house and floats over their two children because she doesn't have so much time with them. There are no surprises in this mystery of pedestrian murder. Indeed, the best thing about what they call MISTER Tibbs is the amazing Quincy Jones orchestral soundtrack with an unforgettable introductory theme that is more memorable than this forgotten criminal thriller he deserved. a prostitute, Joy Sturges (Linda Towne of "Adventurers"), who was revealed by death in her dormitory's bedroom by an invisible attacker. Housekeeper Mealie Williamson ("Intruder in the Dust" Juano Hernandez) enters Joy's apartment and finds it dotted on a dead-blooded carpet. He briefly picks up the statue and then returns it to the floor and announces Joy's death to the Chief of the Flat, Rice Weedon (Anthony Zerbe of the "Kill License"), and Weedon gives Mealie and a handful of dollars and sends it to him. Then, Weedon anonymously reports to the SFPD that the popular Minister Logan Sharpe (Martin Landau of "Nevada Smith") has beaten Joy to death and seemed to leave Joy's apartment. Captain Marden (Jeff Corey of "True Grit") assigns Tibbs to handle this case; It seems that both Tibbs and Sharpe have known each other for 18 years. Of course, Tibbs' wife Valerie cannot believe that a well-known, politically active evangelist could commit such a crime. In order to mention the film context, it should be noted that when Tibbs and the police study the crime scene, they mention the word "sperm," a controversial term to be mentioned in the early 1970s movie. Tibb's questions Weedon, whom he suspects, is either a drug pusher or a pimp. Weedon explains that he has no records of Joy Sturges because she rented an apartment from another real estate company. Tibbs visits real estate company and real estate agency Woody Garfield (Ed Anser of "JFK"), runs and leaves, basically does O.J. Simpson until he succeeds in the car after a long but tame pursuit. When Tibbs proves that Woody did not kill Joy, he allows him to leave his disgruntled wife Marge (Norma Crane of Penelope) ready to file for divorce after the revelation that he has paid a hooker to stay in the apartment <br /> <br /> Tibbs follows his husband, Mealie, and deprives him of the crime, then goes to Weedon. Fortunately for Tibbs, our hero catches Weedon's evil in the middle of a narcotic business. One of Weedon's followers attacks Gibbs, but Tibbs takes a brief walk before he goes on a long trail of Weedon. Finally he pulls Weedon into the underground garage and shoots him. Guess who wins. Tibbs' home scenes are more interesting than his investigations. Andy runs uncontrollably, hits his sister and smokes in the garden. Our hero wants you to clean your room. When Andy refuses, Tibbs finds him on his jaw three times. These children's educational scenes would probably never be dealt with today as they did in 1970. At the end of the film, as if the sequence of the family had to be strengthened, Tibbs was seen leaving with his wife and children. There is a confrontation between Valerie and Virgil about the welfare of their children and how his long hours at work influenced them. Director Gordon Douglas drives a competent fashion. Surprisingly, for a film released in 1970, filmmakers never play a racing card. In one scene, when Tibbs searches an African-American owned billiard hall, we see a mixed breed of races that frown on the hero as he finds Mealie and leaves him in tow. <br /> <br /> Total, "They call me MISTER Tibbs" is a bad sequel "In the heat of the night." Remember, Poitier brings another great performance with nuance, but everything looks prefabricated. All sets look fake and there is not much physical violence: one underground car park that does not last long and fights. Apart from Jones' key jazz score, is this the only surprise? And does this really not mean that it would be a big surprise as a comfortable controversy? Donald Medford's "Organization" followed "They Call Me MISTER Tibbs" as the second, more action-packed sequel.
