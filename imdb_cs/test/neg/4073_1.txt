I should have left without reading the review when I saw the movie. I saw the whole movie with a quick transfer and ended in 25 minutes. although his low budget movie it could have been made better. <br /> <br /> The movie begins as a thriller and tells you within minutes that you should shut down immediately. And why the film was named "crash landing" when it landed so well in such a bad climate. <br /> <br /> Without any acting, all characters where you move or do like kids. And you shouldn't forget to comment on a joker - the main kidnapper who would be more appropriate if this movie was a full-time comedy.
