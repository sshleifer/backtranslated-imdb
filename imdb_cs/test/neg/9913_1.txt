Anyone who complains about Peter Jackson's making movies too long should go through this "CBS" CBS. There is about 45 minutes of story stuffed 2 hours of unnecessary subplots, featuring a bland by-the-book television drama clich√©. Bad science is the basis of miserable weather catastrophes, so I won't complain about it. Silly science can be fun to watch if it is executed in a fun way. What kills this movie is 10 subplots ... all of which could be cut out without destroying what is supposed to be the central storyline. One character that is fun to watch in Category 6 is Tommy Tommy, although it is a very unpleasant stereotype. <br /> <br /> Note that I also didn't bother to comment on special effects. Their quality should not be a surprise. <br /> <br /> Not recommended.
