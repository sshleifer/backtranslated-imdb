then it's hard to watch the other half of this movie. I got the first part with the Spanish inquistion, but the film skipped many years ahead with the French ruling Spain. The movie doesn't fill you up with what happened, and I don't remember much about it. So the movie is confusing. The film begins when Ines, the daughter of a wealthy merchant, is accused of Judiam Church, specifically Father Lorenzo. It is asked on the question and forced to confess. Even her family's wealth cannot buy her from prison. Her father forces Lorenzo to sign a confession that he is a descendant of a chimpanzee, hoping to get Ines. All he does is make the church condemn Lorenzo, who runs to France. The film then goes beyond many years and the French Revolution is in full force. Ines is released from prison. It was very good to make the work to Natalie Portman look torn. She finds her family dead and looking for Goya for her help. He tells him he has a child in jail. Goya is preparing a meeting between her and Lorenzo, who is now with the French and in power. He's a father. Goya sees her daughter and tells Lorenzo who decides it's best to send her away to America, so no one will find out. But before his plans are made, the British will join Spain and Spain will gain power and now be persecuted. It's not well said in the film. It's like a film showing it happens in one day. FINAL VERDICT: The film is good until after many years after the movie, the film expects you to understand what's going on. Then I'm too confusing about me.
