Leave Ed Wood alone. To call "Plan 9 from the outer space", the worst movie ever made would be to deny this immensely vulgar pile of Hollywood guana his rightful title. In fact, this pretentious fusion of thoughtless whim and bathroom sociopolitical "commentary" seems to have been created in accordance with the "Plan 9" plan with poorly staged scenes of lucky, low-cost sets scattered with what appears to be footage battle and crowd scenes ceded from higher budgets. But while "Plan 9" occasionally manages to be humorous when it means being and quite entertaining overall, this cheap parade is scaryly missing in basic showmanship, with scenes ranging from insultingly indecent (disgusting burlesque Groucho Marx stealing Manhattan from Indians) to a low camp ( Hedy Lamarr attempting to impersonate Joan Arc to hear her "voices") to tedious (Dennis Hopper do absolutely nothing with Napoleon's role) to the unexpectedly annoying performance of Peter Lorra as a psychotic Nero. Give the worst director a trophy to Irwin Allen to turn so much into so little.
