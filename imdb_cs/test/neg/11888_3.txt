The computer savvy John Light (as John Elias) goes from the Stanford Lunge to the successful young Dotcom-tycoon era. But Mr. Light's fragile success could be short-lived, with partners as ambitious Jeffrey Donovan (like Robert Jennings). Mr. Donovan sat with girlfriend Light, Megan Dodds (as Lisa Forrester). Donovan wants Light to know that excessive drinking and casual sex don't have to end up in college. After reading the naughty internet sex session, Miss Dodds shines Light on. It can lose the internet realm "Digital Dreams"! Among the veterans who have unsuccessfully attempted to borrow dramatic gravity are the red lollipop-sucking Mia Farrow (like Anna Simmons) and the quick drawing, the computer hating Hal Holbrook (like Tom Walker). Mrs. Farrow looks sweet with her lollipops. *** Purpose (2/21/02) Alan Lazar ~ John Light, Jeffrey Donovan, Mia Farrow
