I can't believe some of these movies are getting to the IMDb website! I was released with Special Edition naff? Modified by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be housed in Battersea. I am sorry for all UK-oriented references, but if you are elsewhere and have no nail nails, or do not have a catalog of beer mats, then this film can be a lifetime remaining in 90 minutes (if you don't have any paint for drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of netted stockings and the direction and cut is tremendously ham. What Do Ironi Do In This Movie?
