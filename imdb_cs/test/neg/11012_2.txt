Ants are shown in cartoons as being able to take away chicken legs, watermelons, humans, etc. This can be an admirable character because the ants carry the Phase IV movie. It's not because they want to, but because they have to. The film opens with a narrator who cryptically explains that a cosmic event has arrived on Earth and that a fellow scientist is working on this disorder to have an ants population. The film is divided into segments; the first part after the cosmic event is phase I, and so on until the end of the film, which is phase IV. <br /> <br /> What is Phase IV? Who knows? We don't understand the part; it probably has something to do with sticking one of the ant scientists and the girl who lived in the area. A girl who looks like a cross between Alice Silverstone and Liv Tyler, is angry with the ant because they killed their horse, but with the exception of one angry explosion, the bionome bypasses with a blank expression ("Clueless"?). These ants are pretty smart; or scientists are somewhat stupid. I'll give the ants recognition. Why? Anything that usually destroys my picnics, which can then build a rebound tower, blow up trucks and adapt to poison with the greatest ease, gets my voice a smarter kind, at least in this movie. Sterno says he will stamp on this anthill. <br /> <br />
