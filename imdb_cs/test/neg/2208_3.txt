Poor Casper Van Dien, his career slipped a long way from Tarzan and Starship Troopers. In Meltdown there is a policeman who is just going to a television reporter Stefanie Von Pfeten and her brother is a scientist who is trying to deal with the commentary on the speed he was heading to Earth. But in the comet's escape business, even a close lady is causing some real problems as the Earth's orbit is off the kilter. From Earth Survival, we go to survive Van Dien and his closest family. In fact, his gangbanger friend Ryan McDonell proves that he is somehow useful, especially when he suspects that the person he knows as a crooked cop can mean that Van Dien has a lot of damage. My only question here is Why don't Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton and the rest of the crew deal with the ugly comet?
