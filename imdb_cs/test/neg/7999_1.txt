Anyone who claims that this film is a classic ninja movie must have seen this film before the mid-1990s or less than 10 years before seeing it. Otherwise I can't explain this 'classic ninja movie' title. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes in this movie are simply unbearable. Instead of casting Franco Nero as a ninja, they could instead hire an experienced martial artist. In this kind of film, acting skill is by no means important. Nero is barely capable of a street fighter in a bar. His kicks and punches are lame. There are enough old action movies with good talk. That's just a waste of time.
