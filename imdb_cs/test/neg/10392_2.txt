This movie was probably one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. My friend grabbed him from the shelf at the video store and everyone forced me to watch the action we both deeply regretted. Ehh ... Where to start? Writing, acting, quality? Everything sucked. <br /> <br /> Quite probably some of the worst fonts ever seen in the movie. The dialogue was worse than I thought it could be in movies. Unshakable dialogue, such as "how do you do it?" ... "not so big, doc" (right after trying to exorcize the male daughter and then attempt to suicide her wife). points, kind of fun. If it's not terribly written, planned and obvious. The general storyline of film, writing, and the way it worked, HORRIBLE. It was as if the writers could come up with nothing better than to write a lot of miserable dialogue and throw in so many sex and nudity scenes as he could. The only pretty good sex scene (between preacher and tattooed and Peirced girl) was made with such low quality that it looked more like a cheap porn than a feature film. Yeah, and they never got the deed. <br /> <br /> Acting? Grapes. x100. I think the only good actor was a short Spanish boy who played Miguel, Del Zamora. And part of it was written terribly. Worst Negotiations? Paul Kappellas, whose acting, combined with lush music, gun and half naked bluish white girl who ran in the woods, seemed to make the film almost unbearable. He even had his own death scene that could be easily nailed. Although, most of the others are horrible anyway. <br /> <br /> The lack of characters also added to the overall suck level of the movie. There were only enough characters so that nearly half of the characters died, that same number of people became obsessed in one place, and then the remaining characters could not be counted on either side. Like ... 50 inches down. <br /> <br /> P.S. What is the culmination of exorcism movies going on in the stable anyway?
