An example of all the worst homosexual stereotypes of everything in one movie. And Charles, why do you talk in that pseudo-British / high-brow accent and insist that the kid is talking like that? Did anyone else notice that the whole music was exactly the same? You should stick to a good old Hollywood camp that is so good! Die Mommy Die II, Sequel !! I do not see the value of spending time and money on such a project; There are so many REAL lives of gay youth stories to be narrated and we should see those not this waste. Sheesh, it's a waste of time. Embarrassed example of gay cinema.
