See Dick's Work. Look at Jane's work. Dick and Jane are married. <br /> <br /> They are successful. They have a son. <br /> <br /> They have a nice house. They have Latino housekeeper. Housekeeper teaches Spanish to her son. The son speaks Spanish. Ha-ha. <br /> <br /> See how Dick gets promoted. Pompous CEO is a cheater. > <br /> See how Dick failed the CEO. Jane left her job. <br /> <br /> Oops. See Dick and Jane without work. Dick & Jane turns to crime. <br /> <br /> As a rendering device, they decide to rob the CEO. <br /> <br /> See the Robbery <br /> <br /> See Dick & Jane Fund the Company's Pension Robbery Plan. Yay. Check out the final credits. Okay, so you have a plot. In addition, Dick and Jane care from one scene to another. One barely connects the last or the next. The whole thing is terribly episodic in nature. Jim Carrey didn't bother to bring his "A" material, he just seems to be bored and somewhat ashamed of the whole thing. But damn, when you get paid $ 20 million plus why bother. Leoni tea is frantic. I think I'd be frantic to get no blame for this flop. There's just something like that on Dick & Jane. Carrey and Leoni are not funny and have little chemistry. The script isn't funny. And it's not well rendered. But it can be even bigger. The reality of Dick and Jane may be too real. Maybe it's just not fun for people to lose their job in a situation similar to Enron when there's still a happy ending in real life.
