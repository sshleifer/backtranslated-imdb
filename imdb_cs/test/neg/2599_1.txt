Family Guy is easily one of the worst shows I've ever forced to watch (not to the bottom even though I saw The Jersey Shore). A popular hit with high school kids and high school students who mistakenly immaturity for the edge, this show is unoriginal and outdated. As it was nicknamed a comedy show, let's take a look at his "humor". 1. Random flashbacks to celebrities or movies or politics, or anything that can be cut to knee-laughter. It happened after 5 reps per episode. A simple solution: Every time you hear "It's worse than / like time ...", plug your ears. <br /> <br /> 2. Inadmissible for personal use. This show is notorious for embedding inappropriate gags that have little to do with the overall chart. Solution: Follow South Park. They did it right. The bottom line is that Family Guy isn't worth your time, and doesn't hold the Simpsons candle.
