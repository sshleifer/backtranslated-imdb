In this film, we are invited to observe the descent into the moral and emotional fun of someone with whom it is impossible to start. What was the point of making the movie? To show that it would be better not to have V COLD BLOOD - a book I admire by the way - to make our hero's integrity intact? Hardly. She behaves at a party at the beginning of a movie exactly as she does after a triumphant reading from a book, so its degradation is a matter of degree. Should we take care of Capote to take seriously his claim that he and the murderer Perry Smith are relatives of the spirits who had all the breaks while the other had none? I'm afraid Mr. Capote's situation didn't touch me at all, so if it were the main idea, she was wasted on me. But even if I could understand why the filmmakers visited this nonsensical project on us, the clumsy story would still bore me the way it did. Hoffman gives brilliant performance to no emotional effect, while Keener and Cooper are so warm and interesting that I wanted more of them. Rough without faith.
