I'll stick to the points, so here goes: 1. Very poorly written. 2. Trying to be like Resident Evil. 3. Zombies slow and docile one minute the next minute raging freaks. 4. Never saw blood so easy to clean! 5. Special effects are not as good as the original "living dead day." 6. Do not do as well as "brave and beautiful". 7. It looks like it was written in 1 week and did next week. Basicaly Med team plus Special Forces go to the university attacked by Zombies to find the first Zombies and extract the serum to cure the plague. Everyone will die in addition to the two main stars of such predictable, though unarmed and swarmed, 100s of the surviving zombies. However, special forces (who were trained in school scouts at a kindergarten) killed only 1 zombie, even though they had weapons. Also mandatory blockbuster to fill all gaps. Total waste load.
