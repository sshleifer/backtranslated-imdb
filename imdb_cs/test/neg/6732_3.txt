Can they be worse than this? Probably. But eventually Steven Seagal does what he does. A bit; this time instead of a fatal injury to the bad guys, he just injured them. Agent Seagal's good ass being bad ass is hired to deliver a special package from France to America. But it's not an easy task with so many people trying to capture and defuse the mission. Fighting simply doesn't have enough bite and big blows are just big and that's all. Anna-Louis Plowman seems to be the only member who didn't appear to be a wooden one. Also in the cast are: Jeffery Pierce, Max Ryan and Harry Van Gorkum. Don't blame Seagal for this clunker.
