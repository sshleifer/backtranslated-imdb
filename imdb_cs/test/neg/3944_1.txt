I could say it was bad from a trailer, but the DVD box bait leased me anyway. The boy was right. <br /> <br /> For some reason, the DVD version is very unclear and unclear (in terms of video quality). It looks like they're making a whole movie with a 20-year-old video camera, it looks so bad. I really didn't like the conspiracy, and after watching the movie, I was very released. I will not say any spoilers, but let's say the end was so bad that I laughed, it was many times before. The whole story looks like something out of English high school paper. If I had to stretch one movie as the worst horror movie I've ever seen, it could just be the one. I can't believe they really released this movie. It's really not worth the rent, not the penny for the money if you don't want a good laugh at the cost of the movie.
