Well, I haven't read the book yet, but I have to say the main character was wrong. How can I say such a thing didn't read a book you're asking? It's easy. As a spectator of these miniseries, I was upset by the mannerisms, gestures, and look of the lead character, Fannie Price. It is one thing to be a good person, but it is another thing that is a wand in the mud that despises someone else's sight or another look. In addition to the exaggerated profile of "Susan B. Anthony", she seemed determined to refuse to look at another person. The scene Edmond pours out of the heart looks all the time and makes him do the same. The result was that it was just embarrassing and I couldn't understand that someone who was in love with her let alone Henry and Edmond. Many have said that it is true for the book, if it is, it is hard to believe that Jane Austen has created such a character as her main character. It is possible to create a character that others have faced and succeed in gaining confidence and enthusiasm, but the depiction of this character in this miniseries just didn't do it for me.
