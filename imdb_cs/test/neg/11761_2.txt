CHE! is a bad movie and deserves its reputation as an unintentionally funny movie. It takes a serious subject and presents it as a version of Cliff Notes or Classic Comics because there is not much emotion or proper narration - just episodic segments sewn together with the most silly "true stories" that convey various yutzes. This is a deservedly ridiculous film because it is poorly written and acted. The most interesting of the film, however, is his apparent gay subtext. Instead of Che Guevarra and Fidel Castro, who are working on Communist Cuba, they seem to be more homosexual couples - Che behaves coy and defiant and Fidel as a zealous suitor! Time and time again, the film abounds with big lines like Fidel implores Che "Cuba needs you .... I need you!". I'm not sure if the studio intended this gay undercurrent, but it doesn't take the brain surgeon to recognize it! I am very surprised that other reviewers have not mentioned it. But if you remember this while watching a movie, watching is much more exciting and even more fun. <br /> <br /> Last note. In recent years, Che has been very elegant - even a fashion statement with piles of dead teenage brains who have no idea who he is, wearing a shirt decorated with a face. Because he was a cold-blooded murderer and a nihilist (a special combination for doctors), this new respect for men is rude. What they will do next will build Hitler or Dr. Mengele's T-Shirts and Posters?!? Even the Communists with conscience should be appalled at the bloodshed that Guevara was responsible for, and I find it ironic that the computer people are fighting for a man who probably killed them when she gave them half the chance! As this film is stupid and unintentionally entertaining, it does nothing to reinforce the message that Guevara was not a hero. I'd like to see a realistic film from his life - with both good and bad, but also with dialogue and conspiracy that chimpanzees probably didn't!
