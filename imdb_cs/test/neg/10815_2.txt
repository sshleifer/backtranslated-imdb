I can't help but forget the incredible scene in Alien when another terrestrial land emerged from one of the men's chest. Or even in Predator, when the invisible monster struck the confused soldiers and cut them into pieces. Both of these films have expressed fascinating ideas for the run-of-the-mill creation feature. Back to the kitsch film era B, they watch the big men in fake suits walking around to kill people in small towns. Now remember that these two films have revolutionized this genre. The cave does nothing to improve. Nothing new is trying, and the worst of all is that the cave has no good gore. Shame on them, shame on everyone. The one-dimensional figures of this cave are in sexy spandex. They seem not to care when they witness the death of their colleagues. They simply walk along, unknown to the evil creature lurking in the dark. The plot is very easy to understand. So you have two brothers, a black man and a sexy guy. The rest (by the others I mean all those who come together with terrible extinctions) is even more relentless than others. We have a Korean assistant, a risky outdoor chick, a Russian scientist, and two divers, both lacking a sense of emotion and being stupid enough to lose themselves. This film overcomes extreme clich√©s because everyone, except the blacks, one of the brothers and the female scientist, ends. It also seems that only Americans can survive the horror because the Russians and the Korean people will die. Don't be offended if I give out the details. Nor is there any real surprise. <br /> <br /> To be straight forward, we'll find the cave. They go to the cave. They get stuck in the cave. They start dying in the cave. One of them gets infected in the cave. More die in the cave. They come out of the cave; just to find out that one of them has a parasite that makes them a spooky monster that they don't mind. This is the simplicity of an expressionless plot. Nor does it try to be original. He even has the part where he decides that their leader is not capable and divided. We've seen this many times before. I know in a movie like this people don't care about performance, but it's worth mentioning how bad they were. Everyone is just so crushed. Cole Hauser was especially sophisticated and didn't get me on Eddie Cibrian, which is often much better. Morris Chestnut hands the best thing in the movie. His performance is actually decent. Draws a guy who calms everyone. On average, all other actors are average at best. It's really not a bad thing in this show. Now that we're going to this movie genre; action. Well, to my regret, the action was boring. The death scenes are boring, the whole movie was. Hardly blood at all. It's either they disappear and find out later, or are attacked and die without bruises. When I saw the death of the Koreans, it was the only exciting event I found. <br /> <br /> It's amazing. Bad things over the shadow of most things that are good. A good example is to say that the special effects were well done, which were. The only thing that is wrong is that because everything takes place in a cave, it will be dark. I found it very difficult to distinguish between cave walls and monsters. It was hard enough to see those creatures. Although I liked the special effects, there was nothing original about the monsters. They all resembled each other and were not scary at all. The Cave is the directorial debut for Bruce Hunt. I don't see what he was trying to achieve by making this movie. Apparently he made a huge mistake. Almost everything that stuck on this film like a stinking bomb. The stinking bomb is probably even more enjoyable than watching this mess again. Only those who are forgiving find out what is forgiven. I gave up hope in the middle of the movie when I heard the phrase "what the hell was" for the third time.
