Imagine the worst thing that could ever be understood by human intellect. Now imagine something infinitely darker - I mean worse. Then multiply it by the amount of nausea the Star Wars Special Special has. This movie is much worse than that. "Dracula 3000: Infinite Darkness" to play such famous and reputable actors as Coolio and Langley Kirkwood (as the movie "Awesome Antagonist", Earl ORLOCK) is to cope with eating one's feces exclusively for one's a lifetime, condensed to about one hour and twenty minutes. To be honest, there is no way to approach the revision of this film tragedy - riddled with communist propaganda, the promotion of drug use, futuristic anachronisms, and quite possibly the worst special effects from the (original) "world war." The Soviet Union's hammer and sickle coat can be proudly displayed in dingo sets, which they dare to call a spacecraft. Lenin can be seen on several posters throughout the film. And of course, religion was abolished for two centuries. So they don't know who this "God" is, even though they have no reservations about using his name unnecessarily. Of course, in the Socialist Republic of the Universe (headed by Interstellar President Baker), legal drugs are fairly commonplace. Disability mobility seems to be even worse than it is today (they don't even have a wheelchair ramp). Racial tensions still occur in a familiar / predictable way in the galaxy. We receive great commentary on ethnic division through lines such as "Dracula and Broth?", "We brothas must stick together," and "once you go black, you won't come back." Speaking of symbolic black characters, one of them plays Coolio. Play a stereotypical stoner, Coolio becomes perhaps the most enjoyable and ridiculous vampire ever. Oh wait, the second most sensual vampire ever. This prized title goes to our friend COUNT ORLOCK, from PLANET TRANSYLVANIA, at CARPATHIAN SYSTEM. These two are doing quite a few, between Coolio's attempts to paralyze paraplegic, strange attempts to produce high-level animal sounds, 1004-year-old hairstyle and GIGANTIC's utterly worthless dialogue; and Count Orlock is a twenty dollar generic Halloween-style vampire costume, exploding coffin, or dimly inane back story. One wonders if you just give Coolio the opportunity to get "as high as the dragon in the universe without gravity", let him communicate with the other "actors" and just leave. Earl Orlock's motivation is also somewhat controversial. He wants "infinite darkness", how would you believe the subtitle of the movie? Want to eat a crew? Or does he want "Coolio *" to kill everyone? Or do they want to give people with disabilities a chance in such an inhospitable future? It doesn't matter because none of this film makes any sense. The highlight of the film must be the end. More for that means that the film is over than any thanks to the sudden train from the climax that calls before the credits. Instead of facing Count Orlock in a duel (closest to what we've got, there is a shot of Orlock taking off at various speeds in front of our protagonist who dies shortly afterwards), our heroes defeated him by cutting off his hand in the normal door. Orlock then proceeds to collapse, pain in a completely secular but understandably painful injury. This is by far the funniest of this movie. Watching the vampire's twisted face as she cries in pain will keep you on the edge of her seat - laughing. Almost for the four money for it alone. Of course, right after we treated them with one of the worst one-liners movies, a mandatory allusion to sex, and maybe most ABRUPT EXCUSE FOR THE END * EVER *. They go to the sun and their ship literally blows up before they can get within reach. I think they just overcame Wachowski bros. for the worst finals ever. <br /> <br /> I can only sleep at night because we know the sequel is impossible. Safe in this, we can safely say that it is WORST MOVIE EVER CREATED, and one that will never be exceeded in low quality, lower budget and lower acting talent.
