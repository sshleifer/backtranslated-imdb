Unfortunately, another Costner movie that was too long for an hour. A plausible performance, but the script had nowhere to go and wasn't in a hurry to get there. First, we offered an unrelated chain of events, of which only a few are in this story. Will the scenario focus on Randall and his wife? Randall and Fischer? And what about Fischer and Thomas? Eventually, no real story develops and the characters themselves are artificially supported by third party monologues. The singer explains to Randall, Randall explains to Fischer, and on. Finally, long after you don't care, you'll learn about the scenario encounters. The three ends were undoubtedly offered and no one could decide. The final result? All three were used, one after another. If you can hang in the past 100. yawn, you will be able to select them. Despite a transparent attempt to score points with the Coast Guard's dedication, he should wash this first day.
