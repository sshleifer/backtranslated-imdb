The film's premise had a lot to go for, however, despite the novelty of models selling someone else's furniture to live a high life, this film has nothing to do for it. Characters are cardboard. The dialogue is so painfully written, it's hard to sit, and if there were any jokes in the movie, I missed them. Marilyn Monroe goes to the walls because she doesn't want to wear glasses, she is absolutely incredible and not funny. Grable's stupidity is also too ham to be believed. Bacall's gold digging is so forced, it's uncomfortable to listen. Why would anyone want to sit through this is behind me.
