Bay Area residents probably remember Paul from The Diamond Center, an incredible late night huckster who left easy credit and cheap rocks in the 1980s and early 1990s. I mention it just because in Death Machines is an actor who looks like JUST LIKE HIM, who plays the owner of an Italian restaurant. He appears in the best scene in this positively scary and reckless dramatic drama about Dragon Lady (Mari Honjo, who wisely hung up her acting impulses after completing this movie), which controls the local syndicate. Our hero (let's call him no Paul from the diamond center) plays a restorer with all the subtleties of The Simpsons' Luigi ("you lika da spaghetti?") And it doesn't seem to be affected when one of his patrons complains about food. No, there is no fly in soup or hair in the sauce: there is a red Buddha in the pasta, a business card murdering the chief of criminals who sends a statue to each of his potential victims. The death of a machine is bad by any measure and it is quite boring, which is an even worse crime.
