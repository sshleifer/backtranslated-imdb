In what attempts to be a positive story, Dolph Lundgren leads a group of mercenaries to take over a tropical island that looks a lot like paradise so that the men who hired his team can mine it for ... bird droppings. In fact, the nitrogen gas that emanates from the mud on this island is what is after them. There was only one good thing about this film - the island spot where it was shot was beautiful. Otherwise, the story drowns and the actors don't want to work. The result: Lots of violence, a lot of language, lots of blood and a few shots of women topless. If you want senseless violence (sorry, the story can't even give violence, even when trying), then it's a movie for you. Parents: Warn that this film is full of violence and blood.
