The last installment in the Karate Kid series is predictable, badly behaved and so badly bordered with a pleasant one. But not entirely, it's just bad. This installment lacks Karate Kid Ralph Macchio, who was already in one of the many episodes. The new boy, played by Hillary Swank, is a teenage granddaughter of one of Mr. Miyogi's friends WWII. Her parents are recently deceased and her grandmother is unsuccessfully trying to raise this young hell. In steps, Mr. Miyogi corrected things. True formula, there is a group of neo-Fascist bullying, called Alpha Troopers that must be put in their place and a new movement of karate, called Praying Mantis. As I said earlier, this movie is a mess and should be avoided.
