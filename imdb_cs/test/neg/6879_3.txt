I see this movie as a bad tribute to old slasher movies. Because it doesn't really hold the candle for the 70s and 80s of the era of horror gold, it's of course where personal taste comes. This film falls under the category of "New Generation Slashers" in my book, casting is typical of those 18-24 years and potential models. Personally, I'm quite tired of that horror movie, old movies have at least some differences in people. One or more fat people and dorks in general. Just looking people, of course, with a few good seekers, it's okay they've always been there. But when the whole cast is just a few nice shelves and butts, it's stupid. Yeah, I'd like to watch HOT chicks. But not in horror that should reflect some ordinary people who are hunted, for example, by a knife maniac ... You expect people to be hunted to look like any random person you see on the street. I think. Of course, there are several movies with good seekers that are perfectly fine, but not many. "Bad turnover" is one example of the better. The next point is the killing scene that all slash should be about. In this bad movie, all you can see is 2-3 frames of sudden high sound / scream and music in the crescendo. And that's all. The little you see is not at all graphic, not for people who have seen some horrors over the years. Old schoolchildren had much more and better deaths, blood and gore than that. Not to mention the killers in the movies who overcame the ones you see here. As for real horror fans, it's more fun and exciting to watch the horrors of new approaches thanks to the original that appears, the killer in this one doesn't add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion. I have to agree with what someone said earlier, CGI is something I hate to watch. Personally, I did make-up in the sense that I was conservative (unless CGI was really well done). But most importantly, set a good mood setting that allows you to "get into the movie", a good story is one good thing. Also, revealing and explaining too much of everything in the movie takes away all the sense of mysticism that adds to the mood, and doesn't give you much thought. As an example: in many cases it is a good step to keep the murderers in complete background for the viewer. I mean, if everything about the story or people in it needs to be explained or explained in detail, then it's not too much content for the viewer to think about ... That's like watching a porn movie and hoping for a great story in the meantime. Why old-school slashers still work, at least for some people. This is because cult films from the time of new things are being set up, so new ones like this are hard today. An exception could be for people who are newer to this kind of horror. I have noticed that many people like this kind of horror movie, so of course they are not "right taste" for horror movies. But for people who can share my opinion; here you have a reference frame that can be expected from this movie.
