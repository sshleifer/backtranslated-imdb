Luther Geek (1990) is a boring horror movie and is really bad by Troma's standards !! It's about a fool who bites chick heads and kills people by biting his neck, and he thinks he's a chicken himself !!!!! Luther is released from prison after 25 years because he is obviously a "model" prisoner and deserves another chance in life (which is very hard to believe after seeing how he behaves and dealing with people throughout the film). After killing an elderly lady in a supermarket parking lot, he manages to sneak into a woman's car and continues to torture, daughter and daughter's daughters in a family home in the country. Then we get to a long and boring movie, with horrible action all the way before a useless cop turns to try to kill Luther once and for all! And the film also has a ridiculous and ridiculous end !!! I love low budget horror movies and I think "The Toxic Avenger" is a classic of all time, but I'm afraid Luther Geek is just boring, illogical and boring, not too much in the way of gore, just a little bloody neck biting and that's about tom! 3/10
