To call this film a complete waste of celluloid, it would be underestimated. Acting was at least unconvincing, especially from actor Craig Fong, who couldn't act harder. As for the story ... well ... what story?! "Film" is nominally about Harry Lee, a Malaysian Chinese descent who, after returning from every course he has taken, returns to his home country and tries to start the band. The movie has clich√©s you can think of - sex, tension between band members and a little racial tension that is thrown in. The problem is that even in a subject that is sufficiently covered by the most ambitious directors, the film is everywhere and the whole thing just thinks up with parts that even the hardest hair of reviewers would end . <br /> <br />
