Where to start with 'Speck' the real story of Richard Speck, the murderer of the eight sisters in the 1960s. Director Keith Walley has worked on several extremely low Full Moon budgets that release movies (such as the Birth of the Rite) and here he works from the (at that time) regular Don Adam script. Unfortunately, when the film looks like an exact depiction of a terrible crime, the screenplay isn't great, maybe because the real Speck ramblings weren't terribly interesting! Despite the care that has been taken to be authentic, it is a cheap cash-in of the acclaimed movie serial killers of the same period (eg "Ed Gein"). Films filmed in dirty brown, not quite sepia, for the most part and narrated star Doug Cole's film fails to imagine the horror of crime because narration is irritating, the color of the disruptive story and crime, though horrible and upset to follow, is only that, and no editorial The work seems to have occurred to what is largely a very bad camcorder display on the event. There is no exploration of motivation or Speck's life really, just a cheap shot of a terrible crime. Full Moon released little evidence of better Full Moon performance here, Charles Band ignores its own rule that his films include killing fantasy (such as Dolls, Monsters, and so on) and not quite knowing what to do with this new reality. Incidentally Band has introduced a special label for these films called 'Shadow Entertainment'. The band said it regrets the Full Moon season season alongside Tempe Entertainment (whose creator J.R. Bookwalter and regular Danny Draven also speaks very badly about Charles Band). The Tempe era offers a unified Apple Mac layout and a brutal manual shooting of cameras, just like a home movie. Speck retains these qualities and, for example, Witchouse 3 has made good use of them, Speck is just boring and rude.
