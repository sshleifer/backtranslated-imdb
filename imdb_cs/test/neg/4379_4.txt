It's pretty tame for Norris film. For the action movie it's a little boring, and when it comes to predictability goes my friend and I almost every turn of this movie nailed. It was nice that all the murderers had not been telegraphed on the clich√©s of the 80th action movies, but with an unpredictable stroke, they resist the plot and the cut settings. Rather, it is said that the murderer (Jack O'Halloran, who is one of the few little known actors) kills only women. Yet he suddenly stops his M.O. and kills a man, huh? I think it can be interpreted and rationalized in some way, but why is the film edited to show that it will kill women? Yet I'm sure there is a reason (ie to build tension), but why spend time watching when many other exciting movies are much better. Renegade fans can look forward to a small Branscombe Richmond portrait as Victor, but his short speech can't save the film and even voice 4 seems generous. <br /> <br />
