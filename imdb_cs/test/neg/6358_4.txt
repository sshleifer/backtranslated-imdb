* Spoilers - sorry! * The first word that appeared in mind when you watch a movie is 'Gremlins'. It's the only movie I've seen from four movies, but I liked it. It wasn't too complicated to see the last two, but I thought it was a pretty good movie. Critters starts with a man, his son and daughter stop on their way to vacation (even if he turns out to end up in his own home - which I have no idea what the hell is going on)) with a boy (playing Leo DiCaprio) and going out to the nearby forest. They meet this strange guy who tells them to be careful about animals. He seems a little psychotic, and if I were in this situation, I wouldn't talk to him. Animals steal the ride of the girl and the boy's car and end up in their apartment. They hide in the basement and kill this lazy blockbuster. Then they almost kill the fat woman and the girl's father. They are haunted higher and higher into the apartment until they hide in the attic. Animals Eat in the Kitchen Things (Spoof from Gremlins Kitchen Scene ??? Anyway, they end up getting out and saved. he sends home. <br /> <br /> The end was disappointing and I was upset that only a lazy guy died because there were enough unpleasant characters to personally kill. But if you are looking for a better version of this genre, I recommend gremlins movies.
