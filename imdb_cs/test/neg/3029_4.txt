Anyone remembers docudrama THREADS? It's a dramatic document that shocked Britain in September 1984. Although it's not entirely fun with Mick Jackson's nuclear holocaust, I could respect that. Unfortunately, I cannot respect this documentary broadcast twenty years later, which deals with terrorists who emit a radioactive dirty bomb in central London. The problem I have with director Daniel Percival's production values ​​is far too good. if, in fact, it would benefit rather cheap production value. The camera is excellent, but in this type of speculative drama, do we need an excellent and well-lit Oscar's standard cinema? What we certainly do not need is a musical score because the survivors of the blast are slowly smoking from the smoke. We don't even need vaguely known members. Someone else was sitting there asking himself, "Hey, what was that? I know that face" several times? I know I did it and it's very distracting. Perhaps the biggest production mistake in DIRTY WAR is that someone has decided to make it a documentary with too much stylistic emphasis on drama. At THREADS, the action breaks away from the action in Sheffield, which is several times, and becomes the release of HORIZON on the effects of nuclear war before it returns to the fictional protagonists and THREADS makes it very effective. The information presented here chokes a drama that drowns in an exposure and utterly unconvincing dialogue. Characters in teleplay are not really characters that are just cyphers out there to inform the audience what happens when the radioactive material is exploded. It would be better if the action to be cut into the headlines be communicated to this type of information and THREADS. Worst of all, director Daniel Percival used the same technique they had seen a few years ago with his pox document. He should use the same style with DIRTY WAR <br /> <br /> I should also put my cards on the table and note that although I do not consider most Muslims to be terrorists, I get slightly enough TV productions such as HAMBURG CELL, GRID and DIRTY WAR, which must have brought this to my attention by knocking me over, which is somewhat typical of the promoted PC positions in television companies. I managed to skip the studio debate that Bob mentions here, but I also heard that it is being discussed elsewhere, and I can't help thinking that it makes a better observation than DIRTY WAR itself with its heated arguments between different fractions of the political spectrum. If DIRTY WAR recalls for twenty years (very unlikely to know), it may be remembered that it caused more than anything else
