The second reviewer was absolutely right on this issue. Writing was horrible, the negotiations were terrible, the topic was terrible. The actors looked as if they weren't really as if they were almost there. There were some unique camera effects, but they were not really the key to the story (or what was there the story), and they were not produced especially well. I suppose they tried to back on success (I can say?) other eschatologically influenced films (Omega Code, Left Behind). And yes, it makes Christians embarrassed when these types of films are produced. I would not recommend this film to anyone, especially to non-Christian.
