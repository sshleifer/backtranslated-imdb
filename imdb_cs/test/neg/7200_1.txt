I totally hated this movie! I was 9 when I saw it. It's the only movie I've ever left in the theater. My mom, Dad, and I looked at each other during the movie and we knew we were wasting time. This movie stole about 45 minutes of my life. Everything was ridiculous. The whole assumption was too distorted. Being 9, I was always easy to have fun. This film showed that I could not submit to something and still have fun.
