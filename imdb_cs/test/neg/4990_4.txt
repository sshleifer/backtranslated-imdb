They did it again: they tore the old exhibition and then destroyed nostalgia with boring "re-imagined" things. The 60's cartoon was one of the most entertaining of its time, a good-natured satire of superhero comics. The character was drawn as a 1/2 way between animal and man, the way of Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real beagle; that's probably the same thing that Mickey Mouse does with a real rat. <br /> <br /> Most of the clever schtickers who made the original entertaining show are missing from this movie. Instead, we get a clumsy former police dog who is even worse than Cad. And some pet owners who don't add anything to the story. Cheesy effects (dog-talk animation is awkward). Bad scripting. Stereotypical dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The gravel fool they hired to vote was painful. Do you think they would at least get the impressionist voice to bring Wally Cox's humorous voice to Underdog. But not. There are, at least, a few affectionate references to source material (such as rhyming lines), which raise it to 4. <br /> <br /> Only young children who love dogs can enjoy. Everybody else should get a DVD from the original cartoon series. Just watch it in despair.
