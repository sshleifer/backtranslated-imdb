The bottom-of-the-barrel stinker is so bad it's out of the funny. "The Conspiracy" is about the American mercenary, played by Reb Brown (in the film he called "Military Advisor" but it is not really clear if he is in the US Army or not), helping the army of the Latin American country fight \ t guerrillas when the government turns to him, imprisoned and tortured. Shannon Tweed is a "sports equipment saleswoman" who picks up a bar that is trapped in all the intrigues. This description actually makes the movie sound better than it is because it is really smelly of almost biblical proportions. How bad is it? Shannon Tweed turns in the film's most professional acting work. If this is not an indication of what a 12th-piece piece of junk this turkey is, nothing is from mismatched sound effects to the musical score that sounds like it was from 1940's "Z" - horror worse movement (and can very be well on the same shots (ie armored personnel carriers descending the same jungle trail) have repeatedly used some of the most inauspiciously staged "action" scenes in recent memory, this laugh-minute sun must be seen as incredible. Tweed looks bored, Brown looks hanging, and when this thing is done - if it lasts so long; I couldn't - you'll know how he feels. Although there are a lot of explosions and gunfights, it cannot be considered an "action" image by some part of the imagination. . It's boring (there's a scene in the back of a truck where everyone is staring at each other for three or four minutes), repeating (the same "rebels" and "soldiers" killing over and over), illogical (when a group of insurgents are caught in an open field helicopter, instead of breaking into a cover that just stands there staring at it), incapacitated (soldiers and insurgents falling "dead" when no shots are heard, a battle inside the house where the warriors are standing against the walls are machine shot, but miraculously, the walls avoid undamaged) predictable (when the "governor" says he will offer a reward for Brown's capture because "someone" could turn him in, you know exactly who "someone" will be, and it turns out to be exactly that what you thought it was) and just downright dumb (pretty much everything else in the picture). Unable, mindless and stupid for faith. Don't waste your time.
