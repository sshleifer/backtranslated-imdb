The success of Anna Kokkinos with 'Head On' is now starting to look as if it was totally dependent on the script and Alex Dimitriades great performance. It seems that the extent to which this last is "The Book of Revelation" is both derived, pretentious and utterly unoriginal (except for Tristan Milani's fine cinematography). . Unfortunately, there have been quite a few Aussie films dealing with these topics, some have come to life for 'sexism' (and / or explicit sex scenes) in and out of the '70s and' 80s for it to look again after this piece of fluff. Of course, setting the whole thing to the ballet world and making it all slow (and in its choreography, as well as the experimental number of the Dutch ballet of the 1960s), suggests a great art if you didn't travel too much - and then only if you never crossed the framework of the theory of art 101. <br /> <br /> Add to the preload, the eerily arched dialogue ("you do as we command ...") and the whole shebang hits its well-funded face. Then there are "sexy" pieces: straight from Dario Argento. <br /> <br /> Due to the beautiful but shortened performance of Colin Friels - how about a real city prehistoric thriller? All in, all, with 'The Book of Revelation', a feminist project has been set for another decade - and with willing and deeply imitating (male writers like Henry Miller, William Burroughs, even Bukowski) collaboration of a collective in Melbourne , Oz, suffering from educational and ideological amnesia! There are no revelations here.
