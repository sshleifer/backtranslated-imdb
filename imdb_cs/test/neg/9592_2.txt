This movie has 7.0 ratings on IMDb, so I also felt something rotten in its synopsis I decided to try. What waste is 100 minutes. First, the 1980s were not a good decade for crime and the thriller genre. Most of them, in those days, were poorly done with a silly plot (if they had any), so there are very few that can stand out, and even if they were good they still aren't very good. But the hit suffers from everything that made silly pictures of criminal crimes. He has bad character development, unlikely conspiracy and has not been written or managed in a decent manner, and if you have such flaws, it won't help. Stephen Frears has often attempted to emulate the French New Wave in the English style, and the two do not match. Terence Stamp is in the forefront for 10 years because it testified against some of its former partners. crime. He hides all places in Spain. He finally catches up with him, and before a group of stupid-looking Spanish criminals kidnap him for the first time, he must be taken to the distance of two people to deal with him. These two are John Hurt, who is to be a hard-cooked, stone killer and Tim Roth (in his first role) as the devil's apprentice. Stamp does not kill immediately, first they dispose of "three Amigos", they should not hire in the first place, and then Stamp will go to Paris because one of the friends to whom he testified wants to stand up to him. OK, that's possible. But even though Stamp is such a dangerous character that they have to hire four boys to overcome him, they do not tie him up, do not devalue him and go with him as if he were one of his friends. The stamp has no objection and is happy to go to Paris to be shot without the use of half a dozen chances that these "pros" offer to escape. Before Tim Roth seems to be just a schoolboy, so the idea of ​​a big criminal boss connected him with a hard core like John Hurt, even more unlikely, especially on such an important job. But before John Hurt is such a hard core, he spends twenty minutes of film, killing or not killing an absolutely redundant Australian player, played by Bill Hunter, whose only goal in this film is to introduce his mistress Laura Del Sol, his mistress. (who says he's 15, but looks more like 25), and whose role in the story and acting ability suggests that she was offered a role solely on the basis that she was a director or producer's mistress at the time. After many reflections, Hurt kills an Australian, but marries his mistress for no apparent reason. Then he wants to kill her, but Roth with his "gentle ways" convinces him not to, so she kicks him, bites him and scratches the whole film, stays true to the deeply buried human side. Before you have simple idiotic scenes like Hurt and Roth lock the car from outside and try to prevent people from getting out?!?! In any case, the film goes on. Tim Roth falls asleep, guarding Terence Stamp with a gun on his chest, and Stamp just waiting and watching the waterfall. Before the whole plot of the conspiracy comes to a point where everything we've seen in the last hour and 20 minutes goes through the window. Let us recapitulate that the whole point of not being known is to kill Stampa right away (except for having a movie), take him to Paris, so his former partner should have the last word with him. And the whole point in it that does not escape is that it is ready to die and says, "It's just a moment. We're here. Then we're not here. We're somewhere else ... maybe. And it's so natural Why should we be afraid? "But my friends, here's where the plot reverses, Hurt kills the man while still in Spain, and we ask why to bother and ride for days, he could do it in the first 15 minutes, and than contradict his The philosophy stamp is very afraid of killing me, so we ask again why he didn't run and had a lot of chances. Roth will also kill himself, but he shouldn't be in the movie at all, and Del Sol, but she promised a role in this movie purely for romantic (reading sexual) reasons, so she would stay alive again, even when she attacked Hurt. 15th time in the movie. He killed all the others, but not her, must have the maximum appearance. The film was made on a budget chain of shoes and shows, but when you have no story and character cards, it shows even more. And yes, Fernando Ray appears and goes through the film as a guest star, having a single audible line of dialogue. Terrible
