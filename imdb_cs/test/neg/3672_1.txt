If you're enjoying sitting in the dark, literally and figuratively, ninety minutes, then it's a movie for you. Wasting of actors, resources and audience time. Finally, wasting space. Don't be tempted by a resume. There is nothing else than it could be. The film lacks all the basics you can expect from the genre; plot, character, development, denouement. The cast may have the heart of knowing that in this case, their efforts will be completely forgotten and eventually their careers may improve. <br /> <br /> Absolute impudence.
