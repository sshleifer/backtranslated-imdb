One of those movies where there are no big twists and you can predict what will happen. Matt dillon was amazing again, but the rest didn't play a bigger role than he should have. It was exciting at the beginning, but a little slow and finally predictable. Flicks in which a good guy wins no matter what happens. The story might be more interesting, and the director could make him a lesser B-movie by creating a happy ending.
