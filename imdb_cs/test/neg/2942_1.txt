"The Twins Effect" is the worst movie I've ever seen! Support is not only weak but also characters. I'm sorry to tell you Edison fans, but Kazaf is by far the weakest vampire I've ever seen. I'm sorry Edison; Your role in this movie was disappointing. Edison is not fighting at all in this film and I'm sure that if they didn't have Kazaf in the movie, the plot wouldn't be much different. The main storyline in the film is not explained almost enough, and the whole film has focused too much on the growing relationship between Helena and Kazaf. Who the hell was Kazaf and why did they need his blood? Yeah, is he a prince? So what! Some scenes in this movie were just stupid. Yeah, the action was great, but her outline was stupid. In one scene to the end, Duke Dekotes says Kazaf is the strongest of his brothers ... Yeah, it would seem that he is now an adult. Why would you wait for it to grow to attack? The next scene was with Jackie Chan, one of my favorite favorites. In the scene, Jackie asked Helena, who was the followers. How can you be so na√Øve not to know that they are vampires? People around them die bites on the neck; NEWS would certainly be faster than you can say "Vampire". The characters were yet another mistake in the movie. Helen, played by Charlene Choi, is Kazaf's girlfriend. What girl wouldn't be afraid of the Vampire fears, especially if it's your brother's job to kill? I bet you wouldn't find such a brave girl like Helen if you searched your whole life. Helen is annoying, biting, and she is the absolute queen of the movie drama. He tries too hard to be different and eventually fails. One of the strangest and most disturbing characters I've seen in every movie. Why would you bite someone's neck, especially when you're not a vampire? It is very strange that his reaction to Kazafa's confession will not turn him off. Kazaf, played by Edison Chen, is another stupidity in the story. As humiliating for a young actor as he plays in a movie with such a badly built role. Throughout the film he does not become alone and does not fight. Even though I'm a fan of Edison, I wouldn't want to be lying on the ground all the time. Gypsy and Reeve are my favorite characters in the movie. Their love is pure and sweet. The Gypsy is beautiful and doesn't try too hard as Helen. Reeve, played by Ekin Cheng, is wise and seems to be the only person who makes sense in the movie. The conspiracy failure was the death of Reeve. The film had no substance at all, but he himself was condemned to remove the only likable character. Another character was Duke Dekotes. The story was not too focused on him, so his desire to get Kazaf's "rock" seemed irrelevant. It is very sad because I forced myself to look at the end of the film because I was so desperate to see Kazaf fight. The end was so steep because I was expecting it all the time. Kazaf, who is supposed to be a Vampire Prince, will do nothing for the film and I'm sure that if he was taken, the movie wouldn't be much different. I highly recommend that you not waste your time on this movie as I had. I was very disappointed. If you're looking for a great movie, why not watch "Lord of the Rings" or "Pirates of the Caribbean?" Favorable figures with a well-written chart.
