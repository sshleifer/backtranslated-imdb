I give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot. Without getting into too much detail. Playing in this movie is terrible. Really awful - wooden, shallow. The graphite at the show is weak, so bloody that I can wonder why they even bothered to use graffiti artists at all. In spraying scenes, it was clear that other people had "got" to work. They could also leave the actor to picture and save a few cents. <br /> <br /> I would avoid this movie at all costs. Kid loco soundtrack used to be something I listened to on my iPod; <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost. If you don't think about yourself, "Wow, that was the moment I saw a really sh * t movie ...."
