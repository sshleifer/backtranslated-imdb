Though Humphrey Bogart got a bill of stars at King Of The Underworld, I'm willing to bet he didn't believe Jack Warner. In fact, this film was one hollow crown. The King of the Underworld was allegedly a remake of Paul Muni's film, Dr. Socrata, but since Humphrey Bogart was in cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in the Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer together in a James Stephenson person. Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors, and Eldredge pulls a complex piece of surgery on one of Bogart's followers. Bogey is a man who appreciates the good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $ 500.00 and is more where he comes from if he plays his cards correctly. Eldredge, who has a gambling problem, sees a good way to earn some undeclared revenue. But when he is killed in a raid on a gang shelter, Francis is also considered a party to the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much he protests against his innocence. It's not good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley are moving to a small town to get away from notoriety. Of course, the notoriety and Bogart and the traveling Leslie Howard as a writer at Stephenson meet him. again. But Kay is at least insecure and resourceful. Bogart's character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor man was screaming for a better part. He's a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his followers hotfoots just for laughter. He is concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to write his autobiography, and of course admits to firing him in all 48 states. And then let Kay Francis outsmart him, hard to believe he was the king of something. Definitely one of the smaller works for one of the stars.
