I've been trying to write a summary graph for a few minutes and can't do it. But with a film as bad as Night of the Blood Beast, the plot hardly happens. The astronaut lands and is trapped dead. His body later reanimates, but it is found to carry the embryos of some strange alien life forms. But how did they get there? And where is the alien who implanted strange creatures in Majo John Corcoran's body? <br /> <br /> The IMDb features the Night of the Blood Beast runtime in 62 minutes. Is it right? 62 minutes? That must have been longer than that. It was continuous for me. Even with the commentary MST3K (which, by the way, was very funny), the real movie felt much, much longer. And it's almost a snoozer from start to finish. I like a lot of these movies from a foreign invasion of the 1950s, but not this. I couldn't catch my interest at any level. The baby aliens were too stupid to take them seriously, the titular blood animal was pathetic and none of the characters did anything for me. Add to this the usual low-budget Roger Corman trappings and you have a real loser.
