"Another Karate Kid" is a totally predictable movie, just like its predecessors. His predictability often leads the viewer to a sense of impatience, who often wishes the story to move a little faster. Despite the decline and extreme familiarity, however, this fourth entry in the series is painless, almost exclusively due to Morita's presence. He does not seem to be tired of his role, and puts some life and humor in the film that is the best reason for you. It's not terrible, but not much.
