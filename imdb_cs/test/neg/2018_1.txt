Dracula 3000 is the epitome of the painfully kitschy movie. Before the trip I assumed that I was pretty ugly in something. With a cast line up that featured Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, and Tiny Lister, what could be expected? Well, let's say the expectations were crushed ... <br /> <br /> If I really start up, I feel like this review will last forever, so we'll keep it simple. The vampire is not even named Dracula. Space crew carries coffins from the Carpathian sector of the Transylvanian system. In his big scene, Coolio talks about the worst things that film history is talking about. In the year 3000, they all wear bad clothes to today's standards, have nothing more advanced than a modern wheelchair, and decorate neon lights that appear to be stolen from the roller track. Up it all away ... end. Sweet Merciful God. It doesn't deserve to be destroyed. It must be a dream to be believed. I rated this movie "1" and I wish I could give it a zero ... yet I'm forced to look at you. What's the madness?
