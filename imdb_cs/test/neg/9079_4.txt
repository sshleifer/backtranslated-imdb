"Evil that men do" begins a truly repellent torture scene, followed, somewhat later, by a graphic verbal description of equally repulsive torture methods that a sadistic, ruthless villain likes to use. Despite the use of such strict shock effects, however, filmmakers cannot really hide the fact that it is only a Bronson matte vehicle. Bronson himself is solid here, but he should have chosen a better scenario.
