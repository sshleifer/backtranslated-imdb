Seen this one in Sneak Preview yesterday and must say it was terrible. After the credits, I thought, "Hey, with this cast it will probably be pretty good". She didn't appear like that at all. Lame predictable stalkers, terribly simply drawn characters (maybe except for Mrs. Lara) and one end can anticipate 10 minutes for the movie. And the worst of all is that he abused the fragile subject (people with disabilities) for low-level and mostly tasteless jokes without touching anything other than the surface of the problem. The person with disabilities with whom the film most sympathizes is the one who just shows off. What's the message? And the film has no idea at all, in essence: "I love you, no matter that you acted like a prick." Summary: A great cast that must have been terribly bored she signed up for a terrible movie.
