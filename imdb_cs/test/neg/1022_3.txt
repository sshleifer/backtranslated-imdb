A film about an illegitimate son of a wealthy Chilean who is worth to inherit wealth and shuffle into the affairs of the bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer (Vargas). It looks like a TV movie, not really exciting. The only reason I bothered to see it was because it was Valentina Vargas. No real surprises, although it's nice to see Vargas. A great looking Chilean landscape on display, but Malcolm McDowell's section is very small and does not contribute to the film. Michael Ironside plays a bad guy as usual, but it's not one of his most memorable parts. Chase scenes are standard fare.
