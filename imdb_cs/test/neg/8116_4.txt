I have to admit to being ashamed, even though I am as a captivating young teenager that under par horror-chiller was one of my favorite movies of all time. Nine years after the first glimpse of Stephen King's terrifying story, however, I got to my senses and was able to judge Fritz Kiersch's work more sensibly. Really the king's story of a small agricultural community in Nebraskan, which turned up a young demon demon preacher and his sadistic sidekick is really distracting on paper, but it's a cheap, average celluloid horror performance. Much of this result can be attributed to the fact that Kiersch almost allows the beginning of the film to become a hacker-slasher show, and then transforms the finals into a nightmare of special effects of tastes. The cast is reasonable, but it can only portray as much credibility as it is somewhat unbelievable over the top movie will allow them, and the soundtrack of Jonathan Elias is more terrifying than the pictures. A real pity that George Goldsmith's Screenplay has transformed Stephen King's haunted story into a shocking horror. Isaac, Malachai, and all the other "Corn Kids" aren't really that scary. <br /> <br /> Sunday, August 7, 1994 - Video
