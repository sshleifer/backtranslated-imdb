Well, as the headline suggests it's not a particularly good movie I was hoping it would be. I thought it would be great if Mr. Monty was alone, but not tragically. From the beginning I literally lost interest immediately when 2 women are just making tea and then suddenly showing that random water is coming under the door, then a full flood over the way home that is hard to believe they didn't. Don't notice rising water levels outside or at least hear it. I apologize for it sounds like bragging, but it really does. Most of the games were poor and the story tried to copy almost every clich√© to every catastrophe movie, but it just failed in that sense. CGI was poor I could do a better job using ms painting, directing the poor too, and in the end I didn't care for 1 character at all! Don't waste your time with people it's no wonder he was released directly on DVD. Well thanks for reading xxx
