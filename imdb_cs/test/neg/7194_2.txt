Have you ever had one of those sneezes that seems to be increasing forever? You duck and you cringe and catch the nearest paper product in preparation for the world's biggest bagpiper in the world ... and then it flashes. "Frankenhooker" was the film equivalent of this lost sneezing. Now I'm big on B-movies and I always look on the other side when the bum mike appears on the screen, or the actor talks to his enthusiasm about Gerald Ford, but that really left me. The video envelope, for example, is the brand-line of the entire movie. Dr. Franken, who used parts from murdered prostitutes in New York, rebuilds his deceased fianc√©e just to have his run in Manhattan as a supergrowth with a bad attitude. After an hour and a half of building it seemed that it was pretty funny ten minutes a little backlit.
