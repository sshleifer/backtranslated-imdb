Don't be fooled by other reviewers. Although this film contains an impressive array of talents, the material they represent leaves much to be desired. The three figures of Nat King Cole are quite lame and not even close to his later efforts, even though he is impressed by playing the piano. 'Moms' Mabley is not a bit funny, though I remember her as a youth guest as a fun guest. The best performance is actually a couple of fat guys who impress on a live tap dance and a four-pointed takeoff, and a jazz band alone, especially in the number of bass players. The print itself is a very poor quality and the wonderful McQueen butterfly is absolutely useless in the tangles.
