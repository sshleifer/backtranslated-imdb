The worst part of this movie is that it might not have been so bad. <br /> <br /> They had a nice budget, though so many movies; They seemed to look smooth and nice, and the best of all were viewers who had lesbian savvy viewers who would accept a lesbian positive film. lesbian affliction and confusion at boarding schools, (you know, the place where love lives and lesbians). This is a theme that is happening again and again and AGAIN in the movie, but something that viewers - if someone is using this voting forum as a guide - can't seem enough. Each element of this story was so upstairs, excessively fake and created that it was painful to sit. Leading characters say everything: crazy, lonely, genius, rebellious lesbian hard girl (well, they took a super pretty femme like Piper Perabo and tried to rough it, but didn't stick too much) seducing a pretty rich girl who is destined to betray her. Watch them every step of the way is character 3, dopey, well-meaning, wide-eyed, good girl observer. I say "every step" because they share every thought with the audience over the toughest, most dangerous monologues. Her lines seem to have been written fifteen years, although she is trying oh so, so hard to make it look like 15-year-old really, um, you know, well ... talk. "Hear them (love them) with their sounds was um, you know, like, well ... well!" She says about her two roommates who are moving in bed next to her. Later he asks Graham Greene - the perfect indigenous American actor who is wasting roles as a gardener (!) "Is it bad to worry about what people think?" Sorry, but he's a teen, or she's 7 years old. Piper Perabo (as a Polly tortured) dike) and others are doing a good job for the terrible lines that are forced to pronounce. Perabo has a nice level of energy and is probably very comfortable in front of the camera. She would do well in a decent project, so it is by no means a criticism of acting. But this story is SHAMELESS in maintaining every single lesbian stereotype that is all transformed into one character. They could not stop with her (Polly) to be an angry, mad-passionate, secret genius who had completed mathematical problems for teachers without speaking. Oh, but that is after arguing with a teacher who dared to accuse her of "gabbing". "This is the word they (men) use against the US (women)!" he says, stomping from the classroom. Is It Anything a Writer Could Come? Or should we ask: Why stop there? <br /> <br /> Poole et al. continued and made Polly a poetic dark child who communicates with wild hawks to shout their name in the forest. <br /> <br /> Cue Slow Motion, Science Fiction, Xena Atmosphere! Then we have her writing to her mother-born ... (most lesbians are love-starving orphans if you were in the dark). Then we have two teachers (one up, one zany type with loose neck ties) who float around the event (school looks so big just for 2 teachers) ... and give the dark child / seducer / bird girl tense look. Hmmmm. I wonder if something good, you know ... um, FUNNY happens between these two TEACHERS ?????? There's just no excuse for doing something wrong with it. Heartbreak happens, but surely the writer and director know that lesbians exist in more sophisticated times than this schlock. I can't reveal the end of respect to those who are forced to sit to the end, but if you don't laugh, I can only guess you are crying. And not for the right reason. And I don't think it would be scenes.
