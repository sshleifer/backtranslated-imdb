Big Yul Brynner, who won 'Oscar', and played with many other charts like 'The Ten Commandments', ended his remarkable career with cheap movies like this one, 'Sartana', and so on. It's regrettable. One should apologize for seeing it doing its best to build this idiotic thing. Gone were the days when he was surrounded by Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, Eli Wallach in 'The Magnificent Seven' and walked under the famous Elmer Bernstein soundtrack. Sometimes it's hard to make a living from acting.
