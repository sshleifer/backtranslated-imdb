Why do you ask that this man is right about the existence of the almighty? Well, his deductive logic known to my friends, I know I know that God exists because Satan does, how else would my poor eyes be soiled on such a horrible film? Yes, no doubt, Satan owned me on a cold Friday in 2006 and forced me to watch this movie. What? Are you surprised; the devil are making girls spit vomit and rising ceilings, why should they waste time watching this movie? My only conclusion to this question is that Satan believes that watching Fear is the worst form of mortal punishment, not avoiding your eyes or speaking you in the language, instead of sitting thoughtlessly in one and a half hours of the worst movie. Can this film be as terrible as it says? Yes, my friend watching this movie is the equivalent of kicking a bag about fifty million times, maybe more. But maybe I'm too rough, this movie has a few moments in it, for example, the beginning starts in a family house with lots of topless girls. I'm never in an association now. I'm not sure if the girls really do, but hey, you can always pray. Now after five minutes of breasts and butt cheeks we ended up presenting the scene on campus to all girls college; The girls themselves (about eight in all) are in an archaeological class where virgin victims and ancient mounds are discussed. Lightning forward a class professor (who happens to be the only man at this girls college apparently) takes a handful of his pupils, plus a girlfriend, to a distant lake in the mountains, their quests, find ancient Indian artifacts; Yeah, Professor, we know what angle your pitching is. Now this is where the movie gets, a group of five, four girls, one guy stops at a gas station to get in some directions, but, behold, the biker gang rises and annoys the girls just to leave them alone and they go their way. They move to the "camp", which consists of four trunks and some trees and then things start terribly wrong. First, prof. and his girlfriends are wandering away to have some time alone when one of the girls takes it to find them, just to be captured by some unknown force. The sequel to the other two girls begins to look for the missing girl when he's cyclists, plus one drunk, they come looking for, their plan, rape girls and do horrible things to them. The film continues with something about the druid who needs four virgins to sacrifice to save the world from some sort of water monster two thousand years ago; But their grief for this plan Mr. Druid, one of the girls is devirginized right in front of us, so far goes the plan. Since I said that they would be spoilers, I'll go and destroy the end of the movie for you, the four girls will marry, get some green goo and then be ready to be sacrificed after one of them is killed. the remaining cyclists and prof. come to save them; standing on a ledge, where an unsuspecting biker says, "I think I can!" Just jump down and break your leg. Prof. running a guy and getting conquered just leaving the once rape-minded-now-heroic biker left to bounce the 6'3 "giant druid. First he makes a pathetic attempt with the stick then pulls the knife, the knife reflects some lazer beam inside the golden serpent's mouth and lights up the druid on fire instantly is a movie and this is my review, which unfortunately most of the eyes will not read, because it's just the fifth published review of a movie that has been fifteen years old, fortunately Satan can only get to some of us and not all. he liked to make one heartfelt apology to the poor girl in Circuit City I borrow this movie, "I'm sorry, Sheila, please hate me for letting you watch."
