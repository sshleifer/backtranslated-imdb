Kate is a tired young woman who has trouble meeting and dating guys. Throughout the film, you can meet some of her losers. And during the film, you are exposed to the negative views of Kate on love and relationships. This negative aspect continues and is presented as The Ultimate Truth. I had a real problem with that. Why would anyone want to learn about love, life and dating from someone who is obviously so confused? That would work if it was a joke, but it wasn't. For movie jokes (which are neither funny nor original) to work at all, you have to believe what Kate says: that all relationships inevitably end up with bad or no sex, that the highest level with which a relationship can develop is when you are able to break through your partner ... You get an idea. There is no movie in the last memory that comes close to the stomach as well as love and sex. Why do filmmakers waste time on such waste? Every joke in Love & Sex is something I've experienced in another movie or my life. There is nothing original or creative about the story, production or style. He is cynical, stupid and absurd. Mind, numb!
