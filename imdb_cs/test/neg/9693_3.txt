Dramatic? Yes ...... Historically accurate? It's not quite! .... This film turns the Bible details of the flood by placing the Lot meeting Noah during the Ark construction. Fascinating time travel for Lot made part of NBC! ... being Lot was not born until 2136 BC, 234 years after the flood (2370BCE) .... It is like having George Bush meet William Shakepeare! And what about the guy who moves around the seller of goods and the nickname Noah? <br /> <br /> You can create a film based on historical facts dramatic, but not spin around the location of people where they weren't .... especially when it comes to Word Gods.
