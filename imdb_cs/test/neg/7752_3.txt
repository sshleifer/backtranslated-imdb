Albert Pyun presents his vision of the lost city of Atlantis - and it is a vision so crowded with claustrophobic settings, strange costumes and noisy "quirky" tiny figures that one thing is certain. (unfortunately it will take about 80 minutes). "Alice in Wonderland" - a similar story is meandering and uninteresting, and there was probably no actress in the world that could turn it into a good movie, although Kathy Ireland makes it an appealing (all-too-bad voice) attempt.
