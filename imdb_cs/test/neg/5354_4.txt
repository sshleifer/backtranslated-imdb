Time To Kill is based on John Grisham's first novel, which he wrote before he was famous, and the one who did not take him to fame. (This would be achieved by a "company"). That is why this film did not get until much later, after Grisham was gone to churn out the absurd books with movie dollar signs fresh in his head. Unlike most of them, this book was actually about something. He had meat, had weight, and had a heart. But it also had a fatal mistake, and this fatal mistake is projected into the movie. "A Time To Kill" names you. Here we have a Negro (Jackson) who is tried for the murder of two white men who have been violently raped and tortured by their 10-year-old man. daughter. We have a loser lawyer (McConaughey) who fights a big bad system to save his client. And by the way, the whole thing is built on the background of racism in Mississippi, complemented by KKK men with burning crosses. In other words, we should sympathize with Carl Lee Hailey. We should believe that a father who loves his daughter is entitled to kill the men who raped her. We should feel the injustice of a system where a racist white jury could judge a black man who was just trying to avenge the brutal crime. We feel that we are standing next to people who sing "Free Carl Lee". But the problem of racism is a smoke screen and the whole thing is made up. Carl Lee Hailey was alert. Yes, there were mitigating circumstances for what he did, but the fact remains that he was not innocent. That would be true no matter what his skin color, or the skin color of his daughter, judge, jury or anyone else's skin. And what is so hard about this movie? is that he paints anyone who believes that Carl Lee should be convicted is a racist. The message seems to be that if you believe that the law should not be taken into the hands of people, then you could also burn crosses on a lawn somewhere with a hood. <br /> <br /> the first time a heavy dose of sentimentalism is put into a story like this, and it won't be the last. Like a movie, the time to kill remains quite faithful to the book, and playing is not half bad. But she played the hand that had been dealt with. Even a good cast cannot increase bad source material.
