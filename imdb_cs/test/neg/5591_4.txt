This is another of the films I knew I would hate, but it ended as badly as one might expect. It has a lot of T&A and even a DVD on women's breasts. The first few scenes of the movie have a lot of sex and nudity, and I started to think that no story at all would use only nudity for making money from the popular 8MM prequel. As I continued to watch, there was only more sex and nudity and the main characters I could care less about, but then the story began to develop and I started to see everything that was, and it was a little better. It's about a man who is a fiancé daughter of Ambassador and all have a promising future until naked pictures of the threat that appear in trois sex appear and blackmail is in the senders' cards. The man and his fiancé must now get to the bottom of the one who sent the photos and how to close them. The first part of the film has nothing to do with Part 1, nor does it have to do with 8MM, its about sex video though so I can see the similarities as small as they can be. Acting is neither good nor bad, its just nobody to play parts anyone could do. The value of film production is in the middle of the road and its pure drama of yawning. I enjoyed getting to the bottom of the blackmail motifs with this ride. I anticipated answers that are much more than I could say for the first I consider to be waste. This movie also has some nice twists that are always welcome. It's not great, and it's very slow, but it's fun. I wasn't on the edge of my place and I won't be afraid of my friends that it is necessary to see it, but hey, when you watch a lot of movies and are always looking for something new, you can enjoy 90 minutes.
