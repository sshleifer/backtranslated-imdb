I think Purvis is getting gay "Gone With The Wind" If yes, sorry, tag, it didn't happen. It also did not happen as a gay "sexploitation" movie. I think I'm confused; What are we trying to do here? Just as I want, I just can't get to where I care about these characters. This film is effective in capturing the taste of decadence that lives in the south; he does nothing to explain, illuminate, or accelerate my understanding of a homosexual relationship, or the conflict that the protagonist faces.
