A good attempt to solve the unusual theme of the May novels in May. However, treatment is completely unrealistic. Certainly, 60s men can and do fall for younger women, but they are usually adult women with whom they share common interests and values ​​and opinions ... not a neurotic, immature underage girl. Of course, there are exceptions that are called pedophiles! Sorry RGV, but it is not credible that a sensible and perfect sexagenarian would throw away a comfortable family life and become a joke for his peers ... all for an 18 year old who has no practical idea in his head and that he acts as an unstable mental device . You don't have to have a PhD in psychology to see that Amitabha's character is seduced by sex and that a young woman has unresolved problems with abandonment and daddy. Regarding the recurring scene of Vijay, located on the edge of a cliff, considering suicide, it is about as close as it comes to having something to do with Jiah by making acts like a crazy teen boy. Positive Note: Actors have done good work and cinematography good.
