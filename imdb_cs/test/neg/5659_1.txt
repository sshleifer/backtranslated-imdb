Dressing room bra actresses - but do I think they're preparing young children to change their time? (Boys have to close their eyes on that Humongous bra scene (34C, which certainly isn't one of the actresses size) hanging and reportedly talking - oh don't worry if your son takes a bra then Stripping boys (girl pulls boy's pants) to reveal their boxers - kids try it at home and at school Hitting a girl with male panties - nothing wrong, the show likes showing underwear - panties next? bikini - mom can you buy me when i reach puberty? so much sexual allusions: eg: " I have no doubt about my ball skills. "<br /> <br />" I love dancing. With my shirt "<br /> <br />" Wet and sticky is very icky. Sticky and wet to keep mum upset. " br /> <br /> "I want to keep my face in this cake and go" bbbbbbuuuub. "<br /> <br />" When I'm wet, I come up with my best ideas. "<br /> <br /> "He cut my banana!" <br /> <br /> "Come on boys, let's do it," <br /> <br /> you will never guess where I found this fish "<br /> <br />" I'll leave you two to do it. "<br /> <br />" Carl y (about Sam): She just threw iCarly to go play with Jonahem?! "<br /> <br />" You will not have respect if your back is not erect. "<br /> <br />" How it works hangs "<br /> <br />" What can I say, I'm a great ball player "<br /> <br />" Look at my father! Spencer: That's great. Freddie's mom: Thank you <br /> <br /> "Hey! Could you keep your hands off my equipment? "Freddie: And I slept with my socks last night. Sam or Carly: So? Freddie: JUST my socks <br /> <br />" Wanted not even my fudgeballs would make me "<br /> <br />" Freddie, you know how I feel with you with tools! "<br /> <br />" You don't even need to know where the batteries will go "<br /> <br /> Spencer:" Well, he's spreading ... to places. "Freddie:" Where? "* Spencer's movements for Freddie to get close, then whispering in his ear. * Freddie:" Ugh! "<br /> <br />" Wow, it's just that you always lookedâ€¦ so willingly. "<Br/> <br />" I have to take my daughter to a special doctor "<br /> <br />" I'm sending a lot of guys, lots of places "<br /> <br />" Yeah, you're this morning they had all kinds of fun. "<br /> <br />" Looking for some cheap entertainment "..." <br /> <br /> (Mom will learn how indirectly today!) Overall very educational for young children.
