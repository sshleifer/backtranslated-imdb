Now that all the friends and directors / productions have published their reviews after viewing at various festivals, I think it's time to show reviews written by people who actually paid $ 10 for it to look at. As well as the director's "Dear Jesse" (the only other of his films I have seen), "Loggerheads" suffer from a lack of focus and too many ideas strained into India's budget. I swear this guy can have more luck making a miniseries. I waited for the various convoluted threads to come together, but they only caught them in points that were obviously for all but the densest spectators. It was like watching a lifetime television movie season made for television tensed into one, long (I said LOOONG) sketch on the old show "Carol Burnett". Maybe the enterprising male suitor could take his girlfriend to see it, and then he said, "Hey ... remember all the chicks we went to last year ... the one about the adoptive mother ... about the homosexual." Last year we went to THREE Chick Flicks, so now we have to go see Terminator 4! I think you have to do anything to send a famous actor to get the money, but what does Bonnie Hunt do in this movie? She is not exactly known as a dramatic actress, and this "performance" attempt will not send Mr. Oscar to her door. I mean (when we talk about Lifetime Original Movies), wasn't Valerie Bertinelli or Farah Fawcett available? Miss Hunt has always been so cold to me that she could play another mom? I wish I chose "Capote" to fill my weekly Gay-themed India Allowance.oh well, maybe next week. I think there is a good reason Capote plays tons of theaters all over NYC and he plays only one; Let the distributors believe in this swing, make sure they run in the opposite direction if you don't trust this review!
