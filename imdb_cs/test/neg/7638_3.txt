I'm sorry people, but these enthusiastic reviews at this prestigious site about this movie "Respiro" are very strange, to say the least. It's crazy picturesque, I ask and I didn't find an answer. Of course, the film is beautifully shot, in part it is almost a documentary. But then, the fact is that as far as Grazia women are concerned, she shows all the signs of deep illness and I am wondering throughout the movie what the hell she has. Her behavior is utterly disturbing and (shocked) the citizens of the village are really right when they want to send her away to the right institution to find out what to do with her. He urgently needs treatment! Behavior like her is for everyone around her, her husband, poor children (especially) and fellow citizens hell. We will not be falsely romantic about it! I hated this honest portrait of the mentally ill. WHY would a husband not want to be cured, or at least try? Why the horror of a trip to Milan (a big city, of course, but plenty of people capable of curing it)? Anxiety? Irresponsibility? By the way, I was inspired at this place to rent a DVD movie and after seeing it, I wrote it to others to comment on it. Honestly, I understand why the film did not go further as an indication to choose in Cannes ...
