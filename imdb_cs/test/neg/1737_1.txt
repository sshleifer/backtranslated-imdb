Worst.film.ever There is nothing more to say. Aaron Carter is totally repulsive and the rest of the cast should immediately fire his agents. It's a really horrible horrible movie from start to finish. I wish I could be more eloquent in describing movies to many (oh so many) mistakes, but I can't bother / get too angry to make the right sentences. In short, I totally hated everything about this movie and not in "so bad its good" sort of ... <br /> <br /> It was a pure dick. Gavin
