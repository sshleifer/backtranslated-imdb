This version of David Copperfield is terrible from start to finish. I knew we had gone on a wasted evening tour when it was somewhat stupid to be embarrassed by Attenborough and Olivier as two badds. After that, everything was downhill. Aunt Betsy was adequate, but she had no eccentric touch she'd learned about. Worst of the worst was the choice of producer Uriah. This was a musical version of this character, before and admirably performed by Roland Young. And what was David's self-absorbing Angst. Dickens had to roll in his grave to see how his favorite child had turned into a wolf floating in his beer. It was once when Hollywood knew more than the cheerful old England.
