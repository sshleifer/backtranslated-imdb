A real estate television crew is assigned to cover a small city high school hockey team running into a serial killer wearing a black mask and hood. Lots of interviews when crew members (and some of the local residents of White Plains, where most of this movie is) talk to themselves about the camera, the ones they meet in White Plains, their current situations, and showbizu their life. The screenplay is often sour, cynical, and caustic, and Killer Film basically sprinkles on TV shows in real estate, representing the cast of characters you could find on the real world. If this plot is appealing to you, swing out. I found tiring figures and satire is an old hat. From the cast, Paul Wesley, a director who needs a great break, meets more than he can negotiate, Jake Tanner is a nice guy who is very sympathetic and tolerant to the shame he has to struggle with, considering the prima donnas and immature people in his entourage who often do nothing but migraines. Especially uncomfortable is his producer Lee (Cyia Batten), a tyrant who constantly splits orders to everyone, her poisonous attitude creating a great deal of tension .. he's the type of producer who wants to exploit the small town's eruption in terms of the killer. the story as a queue to exploit the tragedy occurring in White Plains. Those who are familiar with Kaley Cuoco know that she now has the perfect pampered princess, got her down because it's the only role we've seen her most of the time. As Blanca, she is a polarizing way of asking attention, milking, what little celebrity status has to handle, making a lot of friction when it becomes a source of frustration, and has a pretty potty mouth (Cuoco can have part just so she could escape her usual TV sitcom roles, dared to spew profanity without limitations) Cuoco, along with the entire cast, Killer Movie service as an eye candy, but it's hard to find a character that you wouldn't want to see hacked into pieces with a meat cleaver. Jason London is a sound / gear guy, a real creep with a sour attitude, often torturing others with his foul comments that are junk. We are witnessing a lot of personality clashes that keep track of these self-absorbed Hollywood types in cast snipe on themselves. The killer's identity shouldn't surprise anyone, it's obviously obvious. Some minor gore, but most violence is shot off screen. Despite some tame lesbianism, it is not satisfying either. Leighton Meester appears in the movie as a cute victim. Director / writer Jeff Fisher sets up a pretty attractive cast, but I couldn't distinguish it from the countless slashes that the horror shelves had been supplying in the last decade since SCREAM appeared. Although I never liked any Cuoco character, I never looked at her, but in the end she had to come up with a role not related to her preening, smug arrogance, always whining and complaining.
