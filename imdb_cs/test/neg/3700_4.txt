"Haaaarrrryyy!" The amplified, scattered female voice could be Leona Helmseley in the heat, but not, she belongs to Allison Hayes as Nancy Archer, a 50-foot female title. In the most serious role of her film career, Allison's performance literally tears off the roof. In fact, make it a couple of roofs. Jaw-dropping tacky, "Aot50FW" is the story of Nancy, a neurotic, drinking heiress and her lover Lothario's husband, Harry (William Hudson, who also teammates opposite The Amazing Colossal Man). Nancy has a close encounter of the third kind, in the desert, with a bald giant from space who wears mini-skirts and gladiator sandals, and who has the thing for Nancy jewelry. What he does to her when he kidnaps her is probably the best mystery, but soon Nancy begins to grow. Pedaling into the city center on sedatives, tightly packed in nothing but sheets, an enthusiastic giant heads for a low-rent parlor where Harry has some laughter with the blazing name of Honey (Yvette Vickers). Confrontation becomes ugly. The Poverty f / x series makes the alien giant and Nancy appear transparent due to incapable transposed images. You will understand why director Nathan Juran changed his name to Nathan Hertz. Juran was no stranger to the directors of giant creatures, human, and not who also directed "The Dead Mantis," "7. Sinbad Cruise "," Jack, Giant Killer "plus several episodes of" World of Giants "and" Land Giants. " "<br /> <br /> Lots of laughter for all the wrong reasons.
