With David Arquette in the lead role, you would immediately think it was a stupid movie. Well, it's a stupid movie with a terrible scenario. But F / X, that is, eight freakish madmen, makes this film horror. Homage, though on a silly side, to the great mutant creatures of the 1950s. Arquette and Sheriff Sam (Kari Wuhrer) summon help to fight the toxic wastes caused by the giant spiders that cause a lot of their small town in Arizona. Also in the cast are Doug E. Doug, Rick Overton, Leon Rippy and the charming Scarlett Johansson.
