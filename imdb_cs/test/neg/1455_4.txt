Crowded comedy crowd. Director Demme takes the actor to break some funny lines to make the audience laugh and not miss another line. Looks strange - this director has done "Silence of the Lambs" - now there's a way to use breaks! Casting seems to be gone. Mathew Modine Too Young for FBI Agent and Pfeiffer's Love! Dean Stockwell makes Jack Nicholson's squint and gets a nomination for that! Moreover, must we accept Pfeiffer and Stockwell as the Italians? Charles Napier as a hairdresser and Al Lewis as a crowd attorney is underestimated by just one line - they should be blunt hoods. Chris Isaak's song is absolutely in place - better for a movie like "Pretty in Pink". Shoot this movie again, it's worth it, but with proper casting and director and satire goes through ... even often repeated "Forgedabout".
