I'm working on the Horror Classics 50 Movie Pack Collection and MAD MONSTER is one of the movies in the file. I'm sure George Zucco was a good actor; but it was just the second movie I saw him, the first was DEAD MEN WALK, in which he played two parts. However, even good negotiations could not save MAD MONSTER. Zucco plays a mad scientist, Dr. Cameron (who was banned from academia because of his unethical and inhuman experiments). He believes he can control evolution by introducing the characteristics of one animal into another. In this case, like many of his wolves, this is a transfusion (I suppose) that wolf blood gets into people. Its goal is to create an invincible army that can be controlled by an antidote. The subject of his experiments is his hired hand, a retarded gardener whose dialogue slows this worm-like classic to a clue. Dr. <br /> <br /> In addition to his attempts, Cameron also avenge those who have discredited him, using his transformed gardener. However, he loses control of his subject who is transforming without transfusion - yikes! Werewolf Transformations are classic Hollywood stop-action effects. No doubt they were the pioneering techniques of that time; but in today's digital age it is hard to imagine the audience doing it.
