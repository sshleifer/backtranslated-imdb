Greetings from Lithuania. This is the first question to appear after watching this "movie". You know, I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but after watching this I had only two questions: 1) It's just a parody (spoof) <br /> <br /> 2) How would could people create such a thing ?? <br /> <br /> If you've never seen this "movie" then you really don't know what a really bad movie is. I mean BAD. Script - Are you kidding me? Acting is so terrible that I am "actors" where they just enjoy in this movie. I know, this is a "B" movie, but come on? Must it be a reason to be such a waste? Oh! And what the end !!! Must be the end! Just as it seems to be the worst thing you've ever seen, wait until the end - because you've never seen the types of endings before (and I hope you'll never see them). This "movie" is at all costs and don't say I didn't warn you ...
