Steve Martin has always respected me for being a very funny comedian and a pretty good actor. I loved "airplanes, trains and cars" and "Bowfinger" - but "Bringing Down the House" is definitely not one of Martin's funniest jobs, even seemingly trying to be, which is just sad ... > <br /> I don't know; maybe I didn't like this movie because I rented it along with "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and "Telephone Booth", which are both excellent movies, or maybe because I'm used to it much better from Martin, or maybe it's It's just because I'm in a bad mood today ... No matter what, this movie was just not much fun or fun, and I never did more than smile or a faint laugh on film gags, which is a shame because the previews of this comedies were so promising! I expected "Bringing Down the House" to be a totally comedic bash, and I was expecting another grotesque comedy and inter-racial laughter from Martin. Instead, we are "treated" when we see Queen Latifah arguing all over the screen and trying to do her best with her utterly unbiased character. The funniest thing in this clunker is Eugene Levy, but neither does he get the screen-time he deserves. <br /> <br /> I'd really like to get "Bringing Down the House", but I'm didn It's hard for me to recommend to anyone but the hardest fans of Steve Martin. Skip This And Rent "Airplanes, Trains And Cars" Instead Of ... <br /> <br /> You'll have a much better time.
