I'm a horror fan first. But this production of "Tobe Hooper" (let's go, the man from the original Texas Chainsaw and Poltergeist !!) was under the standards, even for the fan. Behavior wasn't bad at all, some characters were incredible, but the front ladies were fine. The story was something we had seen hundreds of times, without any surprises or anything else. It is never exciting or intense, and there are no special effects except blood spraying. Scary zombie kids are white pale faces with dark eyes, and that's it .. This could have worked in the early 70s, but not now. Director J.S. Cardone has not done a good job of keeping tension, halfway there is a risk of falling asleep. My voice is based primarily on leading acting, but it was easy to call the Children of Corn 8: From the cornfield to the mines ... They said enough ..
