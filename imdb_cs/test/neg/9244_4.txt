Korine has now established himself as a talented and impressive image creator. Promotional posters for Mr. Lonely include all the most impressive compositions of the film (although there is one more thing in the promo that I haven't seen yet: the blue-green nun teasing the dog with a wand surrounded by a green torrential rain forest) down). The opening films of this film, Michael Jackson's lookalike (Diego Luna) on a small bike around the track, are strangely convincing and beautiful: Roy Orbison's "Mister Lonely" plays on the soundtrack, and the images unfold in slow motion. There is also a funny and amazing succession in which the same character mimes dance, without music (though the radio sits like a silent dog beside him), in the middle of Parisian street; Korine combines sound effects and jumps that evoke both a sense of futility and a persecuted liberation in the character's dance routine. The first example of a nun segment is also strangely engaging; Father Umbrillo (Werner Herzog) is an autocratic priest who is about to fly some nuns and leave food to nearby poor areas. In a scene that is both cheerful and influential, Herzog has to deal with a stubbornly enthusiastic local resident who wants to make a plane trip with them to see his wife in San Francisco. As the exchange unfolds, Herzog draws a man's confession: he has sinned and his frequent infidelity causes his wife to leave him first. This scene, short and sweet, gains special weight after you learn improvised origins: a sinner plays a non-actor who was on the scene when Korine et al. they filmed - and his adulterous ways in real life gave him a lasting, overwhelming sense of guilt. Since then, the film has been hit-and-miss; a sequence of intrinsically interesting moments that add a frivolous, confused story. While Gummo and Julien Donkey-Boy maintain their aesthetic and emotional weight through coherent structural frameworks, Mr. Lonely feels like a victim of editorial recklessness. Several films have been cut out of a film that would otherwise paint fuller images of certain characters, due to continuity errors in costume - the result, no doubt, due to the absence of a shooting scenario and Korine's tendency to improvisation. In particular, one removed scene - in which "Charlie Chaplin" (Denis Lavant) and "Madonna" (Melita Morgan) have sex - would add much more emotional conflict to the scene later in the movie (I won't spoil it, but it's there to get rid of any feeling of warmth or celebration, and as it is, only half success. The two sources of the story, virtually unconnected, are best addressed as two completely different stories with the same allegorical meaning, one compliments the other and vice versa. It is something related to the conflict between the ambitions and the reality of the current situation. However, Herzog's scenes are not enough to deserve a place in the film, so every connection between the two allegorically linked threads is inevitably tense - and inclusion, in retrospect This is an ambitious step forward from Julien Donkey-Boy, who suffers mostly, at least in the lookalike segments, from having too many characters for f The running length, the mistake that was even worse, played the big names of the stars (as originally planned). <br /> <br /> With many separate beauty images and moments of real, true connection to the soundtrack, it seems much more appropriate for an artistic installation or photo exhibition. As an examination of the moon and the nature of personification, she wouldn't lose any of her powers - perhaps it would be more impressive for me. The loneliness associated with iconic performativity (such as those encountered by the icons themselves and those who seek to be like them) is well captured in images like the one where 'Marilyn Monroe' (the gorgeous Samantha Morton) Seduces Camera with Seven Years Itch Present In The Middle Of A Forest Or When 'Sammy Davis, Jr.' (Jason Pennycooke) settles down, post-dance rehearsal, with his back to the camera overlooking the incredible, tranquil lake. As it is, moments like these, and all those where the names of randomly selected Michael Jackson's songs cross the scene, are much less devoted to each other than they should be. <br /> <br /> (For those who see it, I've lost all my faith during the egg singing scene You know which scene I mean because it stands out like a sore thumb, like a striking attempt at a new movie language for which it was Korine previously celebrated.
