It's hard to decide who or what is the target of this movie. Jean-Pierre Limousin probably had a chance to investigate amnesia problems at a serious level and instead decided to use her as an excuse to create a soft pornography movie. He saw, loved, admired and respected the Se Souvenir des belles choses, which explores memory loss - albeit as a result of Alzheimer's disease - in a profound and heartbreaking way, not least in the luminous performance of Isabelle Carre, I find that Novo is an insult to Souvenirs. I have no problem with soft porn in itself - and even if I have to give up the movies in practice, it is so today - but I have a problem with writers / directors who try to respect it by masking it as in the mask of medical research . The sad thing is that fine actresses like Julie Gayet - so gorgeous in Clara et Moi - and Anna Mouglalis - who seems to have hit the double play after last week's Le Deluge and now this - are wasting their time on such a wreck.
