WARNING! RUŠIČ VZTLAKU! This movie is absolute stupid. It's not fun. I don't have the words that describe the disgust I felt at the end. This is a badly filmed movie about the filth of society. Throughout the film, I waited to get better. No. Instead, it was getting worse and worse. <br /> <br /> When I see a movie that is just as bad as this one, I always try to find at least one good thing. In this case, it proved impossible. I don't have one good thing about it. How bad was it? Well, here's an example: At the end of Dan Akroyd stuns and kills Vincent D'Onofrio while Reeves and Diaz watch! It's not fun!
