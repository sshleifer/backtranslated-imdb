Charlie Chaplin responds to open competitions at Lodestone Studios. Rival Ben Turpin arrives at the same studio, probably another unemployed comic! Turpin tries to go to Chaplin's action after the studio heads chant, "Next!" But Chaplin manages to walk through Turpino. Charlie manages to work as an actor and carpenter. Finally, he gets a big break, but is there a star? There are plenty of jokes including buttocks. The initial scene involving the Chaplin and Turpina slapstick is a relative highlight. Note that Gloria Swanson is a remote background typist on the screen, in the movie. Agnes Ayres will also appear. *** His New Work (2/1/15) Charles Chaplin ~ Charlie Chaplin, Ben Turpin, Charlotte Mineau
