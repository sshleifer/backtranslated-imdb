The final record on the On The Buses trilogy sees the usual disasters in his business in Wales. I'm sure the franchise could continue, but Harold Pinter complained that the scenarios look bad in comparison to him, so no more has been done. It's actually less than two minutes to get to the first volume of sexism - a woman running on a bus finds her breasts out of her dress look no good. Still, Stan (Reg Varney) laughs - but then what? He and Jack (Bob Grant) spend the whole movie laughing with little or no provocation. You get the impression of getting wet. As before, the only funny feature is the really entertaining Stephen Lewis, as cheerful as Blakey. But he is on his own, with a cheesy, dated script that even wastes first-class talent like Wilfrid Brambell and Henry McGee. However, only Lewis seems to understand how to timing shaky material, wringing the laughter of even the weakest lines. Describes how her daughter fell into the river, Stan's mother laments: "I hope it's not polluted." "Well, now it will be" Blake Quips. The conspiracy - if it does exist - Stan sees a desire for a young girl, but her native mother constantly wraps her. It's a recipe for separation on the side. I'm sure you'll agree, and whether it's on a ship with thunderstorms or swimming pools, Stan and Mavis always exploit the same result ... boring boredom. Later conquests include Mary, an Italian stereotype, and an associate associate. Even Stan's mum gets to stand for one night, with Stan thoughtfully reminding her to "put her tin drawers on." When one of the comic "highpoints" is Arthur Mullard overheard Olive trying to find the light switch in the dark ("I can't find it") and think about talking about sex, then you see why this work reaches higher levels literary sophistication. In fact, why he didn't get to the top 100 BFI movies is over. Additional rib-tickling shenanigans include Olive (Anna Karen) breaking glasses. I do not know what is more surprising, lame predictability set-up, or underdeveloped pay-off. A short spotted olive follows a man in a kilt to the masters and thinks he's a skirt woman. The next shot sees her marched out of Blakey and redirected to the ladies. And that's all. Then he ends up in another man's bed and is ordered by his wife. And ... no, that's all that's on the scene too. When Holiday on the Buses was last screened on British television, there was a transmission failure. In fact, she came as a blessed relief.
