Well, if you postpone the fact that this film contains abysmal action; and if you postpone the fact that the story is confused and wanders away in five different directions without deciding which path it really wants to go; and if you postpone the fact that I didn't find any scene that would be interesting remotely in this movie; well, if you set everything aside, it is still a really horrible movie! I take it as a love story about a rich guy / poor girl. I never understood for a moment how this romance between Kelley (Chris Klein) and Samantha (Leelee Sobieski) began. The inexplicable romance is exacerbated by the complete lack of chemistry between Klein and Sobieski. The script (Michael Seitzman) is boring to the point where it is overwhelming. As Seitzman managed to write the thing without falling asleep, it is a miracle; that he would think someone would pay for being incredible. Did I mention that this is a really, really horrible movie? <br /> <br /> I'd give him ZERO, but IMDb doesn't give ZERO voices. So I put it while I held my nose.
