I never thought I'd be caught when I say it: But I think "Dog Rent Hunter" is more fun than this 90th drama drama. Walker is very melodramatic and actually sets the standard of the "High Octane" genre of cops like CSI, CSI: Miami and so on. I'm not saying that all these shows are bad, but they're not good either. I like the karate chop action that Walker gives up the enemies of justice, and the diverse cast of characters as well as the CSI science technology. But there are some elements I hate in such a show. Stereotypes / Prototypes! That's right, Stereotypes / Countertypes! Unfortunately, this is a showcase for the Red America's moderate Americans who refuse to participate in old prejudices, especially when it comes to crime. For example, there was an episode in which a child with psychic powers embarks on Dallas where he meets a group of children in Goth / Punk clothing and they begin to harass him. Now! This is exactly what Central America perceives Goth / Punk culture. Well, how often people who dress up as steals are stolen from people who just watch their own business. Whenever blacks and latinists are involved, it's always about gangs in some impoverished neighborhood. Good! Not everyone who is a minority is a desperate recruitment of a gang surrounded by crime, drugs, poverty. Again, this is what Middle Red State America sees these people. Finally, why is Trivette beating sidekick, can't you sidekick the same ass-kicker?
