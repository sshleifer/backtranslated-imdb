Derek Jarman has shown us again and again that dialogue is not his strong suit. It is a painter and a painting. His films are almost always visually gorgeous, but it is equally exciting to watch the color dry. Watch his movies fast forward, a really quick setup that you can only get on DVD. In The Tempest, Jarman does very little with screenplay or characters, using them as simple bars to hang a very long and well-built cinematic frame. He even goes so far as to contradict Shakespeare's original script to reach these incredibly slow and lifeless. There is nothing of romance, magic, fraud or urgency that the script requires, little spontaneity, and especially the character of Kaliban is limited to the quivering and mad idiot, similar to Gaveston in Jarman's Edward II. It's too bad it's just the only movie version of The Tempest.
