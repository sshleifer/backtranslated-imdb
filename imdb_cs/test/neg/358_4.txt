Despite the fact that it was a Made-For-TV movie (and the one that is obvious: ie, Cheap-Looking), CLASS WARFARE left me to get my money, and since this lame production was partly funded through Canadian dollars, maybe I should be eligible. <br /> <br /> What made me sit down was to see actress Lindsey McKeon, whom I had been watching for the last few years in my role as "goody-goody" Mara Lewis on the soap opera GUIDING LIGHT, she turned when she played a "bad girl" for a change. Surprisingly, she is doing quite well, like Kristen, a spoiled rich chin who suddenly finds herself in poverty, but with a gratifying smudge and fate that perhaps the twist of fate is provided in the character of Richard (Robin Dunne), a socially-radical outcast that finds he's just gone from having nothing to win $ 23 million on a lottery ticket. Jock-Jason (Wade Carpenter) and their fellow-friend Graham (Dave McGowan) together for a weekend in a remote cottage, cut off the world with thunderstorms and just guess what the movie is developing. <br /> <br /> The film suffers overloaded m to the story, personality and motives too much. Everyone is fairly one-dimensional and does not take a rocket scientist to see that some things, and some people will go very wrong very quickly. I don't think it's the original conspiracy, and it doesn't work out to do anything more. Acting is fine, McKeon is a spot-on as a manipulative female lead, and Dunne is very good, maybe a little too good sometimes, but no one else is worth writing at home. The only other real credit I can give to the film is the one twist I haven't seen coming to an end (but not the same end that one is so obvious it hurts). Regardless, I sat over it all and lived to tell a story so I can't say it was a complete write-off. <br/> <br/> 4/10. A film of "something that looks-when-nothing-another-is-to-" type.
