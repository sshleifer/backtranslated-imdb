If you are an average guy like me and enjoy good acting, good conspiracy, good scripts, new ideas or fun, you may want to skip this. I was honestly bored from the opening titles to the very end, but I tried to give the movie a chance and watch it all the way - just to be disappointed with every move. incredibly under par, but I'm not sure if the actors themselves are to blame or if it was a ridiculously wooden and terrible dialogue coupled with an even worse scenario. The plot is very vague and underdeveloped, and I think viewers should derive some deeper meaning from it, or look around it somehow, but honestly it would be a waste of time. > <br /> The film has some rough sexuality that serves no other purpose than to show some tattoos and underwear. No one seems to have any incentive, except to earn money from some "investment" solution that is never really explained. The connection between the characters is not terribly clear, and there is no character development. This is either some kind of subcultural film that is meant for a very specific audience to enjoy, or absolute crap, but you can decide for yourself. I gave him 2 because it's definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but probably not the worst.
