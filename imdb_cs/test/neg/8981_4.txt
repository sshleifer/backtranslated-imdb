This owes much to the CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS plot. Although quite mature, it is partly the story of a rich boy who is aboard a cargo vessel shanghaied as a crew member and becomes a man in the process. The Moran title is a boy young woman also brought up on a ship owned by her father. When the cargo burns, she and the crew are evacuated to our ship. But the captain smuggles to his mind and his intentions are not honest with Moran. Inevitable follows - our boy falls on the estate of Moran and she for him. Finally, evil is suppressed and lovers are united. Some interesting dialogue points out that Moran belongs to no one - "and no woman". (He nodded at Sappho). Dorothy Dalton is suitably sexless like Moran and not very attractive one. Valentino does well in a romantic, action role. His sexy structure and character are shown in favor and the role is quite masculine. He's very attractive. This is no big movie, but time. What really shows is Valentin's beauty and sexiness.
