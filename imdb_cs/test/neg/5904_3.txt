Robin Williams is excellent in this film and it is a pity that the material is not enough for him. This can work if you buy into "U-S-A! Number One!" mentality, but the story wise nothing much. Quite a shame, because the movie is really trying to say something, and honestly says it. It just doesn't pack up enough emotional strike.
