I just don't know how stupid it is, crap, junk, trash and good for anything movie is a blockbuster. It was so boring with a very, very weak (or not) story-line and wasn't even funny funny. The film was about 135 minutes of only a paragraph story about Prem (Salman Khan) is a love guru and helps the unhappy and romantic Bhaskar (Govinda) get the girl he wants. I'm not saying I don't like the movie because it wasn't funny or anything, I accept a movie that's not funny, but it has a decent story. The only two reasons I can say it's a super-hit are: 1. Salman Khan & Govinda are on the screen together, but for the first time together in Salaam e Ishq, a flop, can't be. But it was a really good movie. 2. Salman Khan's name is Prem and all the films with that name were a hit including Maine Pyar Kiya. So it's just luck. I heard it's a Hitch remake, I didn't see it and I'm glad I'm not. Music is OK The only good songs are Do you want a partner, Are you my love and Soni De Nakhre, but what is its use in a really bad movie, too, if you have someone like Katrina Kaif who dances with two left legs? He's totally stupid. Neither does she know acting, language (her voice is always dubbed for her), dancing and she can't always impress. She doesn't like her bit, she was even disappointed at Koffee with Karan. The overall partner is a one-time film with only one actress Katrina Kaif. It's better to be fired from Bollywood and never come back.
