Why spend a moment logging through this embarrassing and confident movie? After an hour of lengthy conspiracy and amateur play, we begin to get bits and pieces of the big band that great musicians have created Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey, especially and together. Occasionally - in a jam session with Art Tatum, with Tommy Dorsey and his orchestra doing "Mary", and standout, Jimmy Dorsey and his orchestra fronting Bob Eberle and Helen O'Connell singing "Green Eyes" - we get a complete song. Unfortunately, the movie is in the public domain and the DVD transmission is as bad as acting. My copy has only four chapters. This means you can get arthritis into your fast finger, which tries to accelerate where it is good. The swamp you drive through is a Hollywood version of the life and battles of the two Dorseys. Tommy, great on the trombone and Jimmy, excellent on the saxophone, usually couldn't stand up. They finally broke up in 1935 and Tommy started his own orchestra. Everyone had more success alone than before. They made up when their father died in the Forties, which is where the movie ends. Later, in the orchestra led by Tommy, they managed to tolerate it because the era of the 1950s broke up. Tommy died in 1956 at the age of 51, vomiting in sleep after booze, pills, and a big meal. Jimmy died of cancer at the age of 53 in 1957. Jimmy was extremely talented and a reasonable man from all accounts. Tommy was extremely gifted and often shocked of all accounts. But good music creates a lot of bugs and the Big Band sounds created by the two helped define the swing era. They play in the movie and see how they evolve from Tussling tickets (with children's actors) to adult men who fight and go on. The film is annoyed not only by their two parents, they played in these Hollywood Irish clich√©s, Sara Allgood and Arthur Shields, who simply want their boys to get along, but also with a big partial story involving a romance between Janet Blair, as a childhood friend Dorseys, who becomes a singer with them and serves as a full-time agent and employer, and William Lundigan as a pianist. Blair is not bad at all. However, if you want to see why it has never become a star that would probably happen, just look at movies like her, which her studio has put her in. No wonder she left Hollywood. Lundigan just takes the place. How bad is this movie than when we can really hear Dorseys? Well, here's a song written specifically for the movie and given to Blair to turn it around. It's called "For me". <br /> <br /> For me ... you are the rose of the rosary ... the rise of the rising sea ... the glow of the star ... the rose of the rosary? The film is no better than this, and it can't get worse. However, if you like Dorseys and if the price is fine ... well, in retrospect I wouldn't buy it. The highlight for me is Eberle and O'Connell singing "Green Eyes". You can watch them on You Tube for free. You will also find enough of each of the Dorseys. I wish I knew.
