In fact, this early film by Bob Clark ("Porky's", "Black Christmas", "A Christmas Story") didn't take my hopes as I expected. In fact, it made me angry. It's about a theater group that sails to a funeral island, consisting of dead criminals, where they plan to conjure up some evil forces and resurrect some corpses ... Their group leader, a pretentious black magic enthusiast and a possible homosexual, tries to summon Satan's help with re-animating an exhumed body that fails, so they take the corpse to a nearby, abandoned carer's house and play with it ... Nothing interesting will happen until the last fifteen minutes, when the undead finally emerge their graves and go after the desecrater. Make-up effects are fine, gore is very minimal (PG rating), and extremely irritating characters are focused on the way to a lot that really got on the nerves. I suppose a group of gruesome quarreling actors was supposed for an hour to be equal to some "comedic" state, but I didn't find any humor in that. The whole concept is just ridiculous - how are these kids willing to dig up and get drunk with the dead body as long as they did. The characters are stereotypical and bland and the movie is just boring ... Don't waste time with it ...
