The 1980s was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies. "Friday 13th." and "The Burning" can be the best, but it has always been like always a few stinkers who are not far behind, like "Don't Go To The Woods Alone" and this. But in all justice "The Booty" is nowhere near as bad as "Don't go into the woods," but it's still not very good. One thing is that it's just boring and acting is not very good, but much better than "DGITW" and this film actually has some attractive views on women, all three women doing stunning. One thing that was happening with all the unnecessary footage of wildlife seemed unnecessary, and the director seemed to have used it to fill some time. So, what did this movie like? Well, there were a few laughs of loud cheese moments - I couldn't contain a giggling fit when the last girl made a bizarre kind of backward moon walk to get away from the kille and there were a few good killer scenes the favorite is a girl who hit death with a sleeping bag ; and a false look. <br /> <br /> Everyone in All The Prey is stupid, boring and the killer I didn't find at all, this movie could be much better.
