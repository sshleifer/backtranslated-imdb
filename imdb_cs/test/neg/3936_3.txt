It happened to me that I saw this movie on a flight from Paris to Boston and reminded me of the food on the plane: generic, tasteless and obscure. French cinematography seems to have lost its foundations these days, and it is a good example of how a varied scenario can waste great actors. While some may find the "playfulness" of the scenario in line with the dictates of the euro postmodernism, the whole project seems to be rather post-mortem to the deaths of the golden years of euro-cinema and truly wonderful talents. Bunuel is vaguely remembered here, but without magic or wit.
