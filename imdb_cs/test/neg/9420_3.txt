Solo begins as a team of US soldiers who go to Soth America to blow up a rebel and join them, a Solo (Mario Van Peebles) robot that can use any weapon ever made, fifteen times stronger and ten times faster than any human being. Something goes wrong, though, and Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians that Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) doesn't like at base, and General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be shut down and reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is his own retention, so he decided to escape back to the South American jungles where Colonel Madden and his men are sent to capture him again ... This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba and one must say that Solo is terrible. David Corley's script was based on Robert Mason's 'Weapon' novel and is one clich√© after another, robots popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood and at the box office, so Solo rip-offs like Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) and the two Terminator whisk as well as have the same setting and basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual waste of an emotional robot that grows a sense of humanity while it is around people, initially does not know what a joke is, or why one person cares about another, but develops emotions to the end and people become friends as Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991). The character is poor and Colonel Madden, in particular, has absolutely no incentive to hate Solo and why he would kill other American soldiers and not obey orders to destroy it. You know I saw it on cable TV last night (thank God I didn't spend any money on it) and I looked at it in a TV guide and you know what it said? My TV guide has described Solo as 'a terrible sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels', which when I think it's the perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words, my TV guide hit a nail on my head, I think it's a sci-fi action movie, it's definitely Mario Van Peebles and it's definitely desperate. They really said really. Director Barba will do nothing special and action scenes lack any real excitement, and sci-fi elements are virtually none, except that Solo is a robot. So the army lost Solo and Colonel Madden to catch him again? I'm not funny, but wouldn't the military want to place a "self-destruction" mechanism inside Solo if something like that happened? Surely at least Solo would have a tracking device in it, so the army would at least know where it was at that time? I'm not funny, but these people can come up with a robotic soldier who talks, but aren't smart enough to realize that a tracking device or self destruction can be useful when something goes wrong? Violence is mild, there are a few OK combat scenes, but that's really a weak thing really. <br /> <br /> Technically the film looks fine and is professionally made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The action makers Dolph Lundgren action film Agent Red (2000) edited the footage from Solo into this movie. Acting is wrong, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play a helpless robot ... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years before he looked into the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). Solo is a really bad sci-fi action movie that is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action movies like Robocop, Universal Soldier & Terminator. I recommend & start and pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing the movies you want to watch ...
