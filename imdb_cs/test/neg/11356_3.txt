This review contains spoilers. I was looking for a horror DVD on Amazon when I came across Flight Of The Living Dead. I already knew from the title that it would be helplessly bloated and most likely rip-off Snakes On A Plane, but it sells brand new for the 69p, so I thought I didn't have much to lose. The music that was played over the opening credits did not fit at all, even though I liked the song itself, the pop-rock song wasn't really suited to appearing on the zombie horror soundtrack. It started surprisingly well, the opening scenes were not too bad, some of the games were a bit harsh, but not as bad as I thought it would be. Laura Cayouette (Rocket of Kill Bill: Vol. 2) enters the picture. She should play scientists. If it is, it's not very clear. Fortunately, it is very polished very quickly. Actually, I was physically laughing out loud when the camera went over passenger aircraft during several turbulences. There was a nun there. Have you ever been on a plane with a nun !? I was surprised she didn't catch the crucifix. Finally, after 35 minutes we get to some zombie action and we use the word "action" freely. Special effects are well below the standard, but this can be expected from the movie with this budget. Being covered with blood and having a yellow contact lens doesn't make you look like a zombie, but makes it look pretty fun. Using slow motion does not work particularly well. I think this movie is probably guilty of trying to add too many stories. Trying to pass on this problem as a variant of the "malaria virus" was not a particularly good move, even when considering malaria, it is not a virus. The rest of the movie is pretty much like any other zombie movie. Most of the characters are killed and eventually end up with a handful of people fighting to stay alive. Perhaps the worst part of Flight Of The Living Dead is a totally incomprehensible ending. I know it's a movie about people returning to life and feasting for a living, but the end was just ridiculous. Rating: ★★
