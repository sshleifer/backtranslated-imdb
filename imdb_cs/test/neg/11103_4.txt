I saw this movie just because of Sophie Marceau. However, her acting skills are not enough to save this film. Almost all casts do not play their character well, except for Sophie and Frederic. A plot could lead to a better film if the right pieces were in the right places. I've seen some good French movies, but I don't like this.
