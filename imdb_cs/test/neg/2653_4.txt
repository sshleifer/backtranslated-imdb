I really like Harrison Ford, so I eagerly rented this movie just to be disappointed a minute by minute. Mr Ford seemed to be going through very hot water and looking for a place to urinate. His star was very good and had a better line. The story captivated me, but the mistake - BIG MISTAKE - because everyone is identified through a driving license or passport before boarding any American commercial aircraft that left many questions in my mind. <br /> <br /> I could care less about these people. Sub-plot internal affairs investigations were actually more interesting than two homicide lovers while flying first class to Miami. I'm disappointed with director Sydney Pollack, who gave us classic Tootsie and other movies. This one is a waste of time and energy.
