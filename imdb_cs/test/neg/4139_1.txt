A total of zero out of four. One worst is Ajooba: horrible. In fact, there are more words in mind: ridiculous, third and terrible. This is one of the worst movies in Amitabhu when it is dealt in a cheap leather jacket and the same cheap tinsel from the zorro style mask with what appears to be wings on the sides. The film takes place in ancient times of Persia or Arabia and is not historically historical for Indian film. As mentioned above, the K-Mart leather jacket with Velcro straps did not exist 400 years ago, unless all of my history teachers were wrong. Rishi also makes his patented cross-dressing in this movie. Far from the fun is very embarrassing to watch. What could the son of the legendary Paradise Kapoor have to remember his house like this on the screen? <br /> <br /> On the plus side, if you want real laughter, go ahead and watch this movie. Bright irregularities in conspiracy and costumes do not match the horrible dialogue and greed.
