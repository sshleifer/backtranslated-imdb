Forgive me, but this work by director Peter Halle is terrible. If you don't get to us with a plot, why not kill someone's cat or dog. It certainly hits the audience. This viewer is tired of seeing the animals sacrificed for the film's plot. And believe me, I saw how it came before she opened the package. How predictable you can get. Take a cute animal and then kill it in a horrible way. I've never been a De Mornay fan and this performance tells me why. Overwhelmed and somewhat stagnant in interpretation, I found her somewhat stupid and definitely boring. I liked Banderas, but I felt bad that he had to play against De Mornay. He did much better in other films, namely "Philadelphia", where he had some sincerity in his dialogue. He tried to keep his character in this chestnut. But writers, Green & Rush, did a good job of preventing it with their terrible story and wrong dialogue. Please do not let yourself be subjected to this kind of entertainment. Some of us are not deceived by sketchy land, bludgeoning animals, and generally long dialogue. When I saw her get rid of it, she infuriated me.
