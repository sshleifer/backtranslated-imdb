I was watching "Gristle" mainly because of Michael Dorn's presence when I was enjoying his Worf's appearance on Star Trek TNG, but I never saw him from his makeup. Dorn seems to have a nice presence, and probably has the potential for a profitable acting career. This film, however, gave him a small dramatic challenge, except to prove that he can, indeed, use the "F" word. This film seems to have been made by someone pretending to be forward - a type of thinking, with a social conscience. Yeah - for 1965. Today, the topics are so many and sophomoric and cornball that even Spike Lee is a terrible "Bamboozled" looks good in comparison. This crime-caper film has a complex labrynth double -, triple and quadruple crosses, but the plot scheme is so convoluted that it collapses over itself in the first 30 minutes. Most of the time, I watched as every scene unfolded. There's a great cast - you'll get to know virtually everyone as an actor character from much better movies. Why are they all in this? I suspect it was 1) Work and some money, though modest. 2) Perhaps the director knows all these actors from the game classes and social relationships around LA - you know, maybe they were involved as a fighter-fighting film at the third and fourth levels of the Hollywood scene. Dunno ... but the movie was half-baked - in fact "finished." I gave him 3, although my affection for the actors involved was unchanged from my admiration for their earlier work. Hopefully, since then, everyone has moved on to more professional, careful and thorough projects.
