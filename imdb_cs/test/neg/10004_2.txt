Watching "Mosquito," I got a funny thing: on the one hand, the hero is deaf and the director is unable to understand why he does what he does (maiming the dummies ... er, excuse me, corpses) through his paintings. On the other hand, the English version is at least very poorly dubbed. So I wished there was more and less dialogue at the same time! This movie is stupid (witty, how does this guy have access to every graveyard and morgue in his city) and lurking (where would we be in the 70s without our gratuitous lesbian scene?). Not to mention the "romantic" aspect (oh, how sweet!) ... miss. (*)
