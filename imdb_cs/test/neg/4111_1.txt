This film reminds me of old B movies, but not in a good way. <br /> <br /> When I saw the first scene, I thought it would be a spoof of one of the first SF films. Terrible acting, plastic props, and noticeable visual effects gave me that impression. But no, the movie is really so bad. The story is complete nonsense, the effects are below the level of television production; i editing is a mess. The only thing that kept me in the theater was that I wanted to know the end of the story, though I was sure it would be stupid (and that was). <br /> <br /> There are better ways to spend time and money.
