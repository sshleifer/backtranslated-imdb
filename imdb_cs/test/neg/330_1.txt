Man, this film sucks. Seven different conspiracies suddenly appeared, and they did nothing at all. Special effects, costumes, and all those things were terrible. The meeting was bad. Everything seemed so forced, especially the line from a woman with huge eyes and a small child (his "Noooooo" getting buried is so excited to be ridiculous). Much of this movie is just as fun. The death of one woman, where she pushes a knife into a toaster, gets electric and magically turns into the most detailed dummy in the world with which my friends and I laugh in ten minutes. <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Look for really horrible movies. If not, go for your life.
