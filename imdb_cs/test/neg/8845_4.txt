While design and location and photography are of great benefit in this film; it is a turgical and melodramatic affair that demonstrates the boundaries of cinema to tell the truth. The case is the use of sound music: a mix of Gustav Mahler and Andrew Lloyd-Webber, who plays constantly and loudly, and would make Max Steiner grimaces at his through the use of how it instructs the audience as difficult; how ecstatic; how torture is to be an artist. And then it really counts the story of the elides details at the end. This increased and kitschy exploitation of emotions was once mocked by Peter Ackroyd on Yukio Mishima: This is not writing, this is Barbara Cartland. Exactly the same criticism this film can make: a deceptive, macaroon vanity.
