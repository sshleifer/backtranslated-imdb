Killing the screaming queen may sound like a good slasher swing, but it's very boring and very stupid. Rape them and torture them. This is a waste that isn't fun, exciting or funny. The killer has no motive, maybe just sick ... and very boring. Maybe they could give their victims their own story. Everything could be an improvement. It needed a lot more. <br /> <br /> They could have given it a little more. I love horror / slasher movies, but that's ridiculously bad.
