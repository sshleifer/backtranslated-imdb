I should start by saying that I have something of a love hate with the musicals. Some of them are fantastic, some are totally bullshit. I expected hair to fall into one of these categories. However, no, falling in the middle. The songs are not brilliant, though "Sodom" song made me smile a lot, and everything is rather old looking. But the movie didn't make me like others like Rocky Horror. Although this is a bad example because I hated Rocky Horror this year, then I suddenly got it and since then I have loved it. Maybe the hair will be the same. Although I doubt it will have as much exposure as Rocky Horror because of the language and nudity of the content, so I doubt I'll have a chance for it to grow on me. Gettit? Hair .... grow ... oh suit yourself. Anyway, I didn't get to see the last fifteen minutes or so because of a technical problem, which was a shame, they liked to see how it ended, especially after reading some reviews here. It's not a movie for casual audiences, but certainly for music lovers. I really hope they won't, because I think every such re-make would end up with a shallow, pale, PC version of the original. It is worth looking at lovers of the genre.
