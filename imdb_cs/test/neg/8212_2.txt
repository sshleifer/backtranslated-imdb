The basic idea of ​​"Dungeon of Harrow" is not all bad. But the negotiations are bad. Lighting is bad. Music is bad. Torture scenes are emotionless. There really isn't much there to recommend this movie. You know what type of movie you have when credits say "Special Guest Star" and a list of someone you've never heard of. He could also say "Rex Hamilton as Abraham Lincoln." because there is no one you can identify in this movie. There are one or two decent moments, mostly towards the end, and I think the basic outline of the land may have contained an original idea, but that alone is not enough to awaken you otherwise.
