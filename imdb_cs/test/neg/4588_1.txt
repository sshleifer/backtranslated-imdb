The game of hockey I play and watch over has something called "speed", which has never brought the real hockey scenes in this flaccid film to capture. Add to this a story that is clich√©, predictable and stupid than stupid with some of those 80's that are the weakest, and numb your senses in every scene and you have "Youngblood". Keanu as a French Canadian, yeah. Gimme Dunlop, Braden and Hansons at any time ... ONE OF THE TEN.
