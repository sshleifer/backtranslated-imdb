It is as if the editor and screenwriter had only 40 minutes of real time. This is supposed to be a remake of a Chinese film that is obviously much better than this waste. Obviously, some headless Hollywood suit or writer has decided that this film will be a mano mano, a man against a man, instead of letting the story play with the characters of the characters who were built in the first 40 minutes. At this point in the movie, the characters just don't act as ordinary people or as their own personalities. It makes no sense. It is quite clear why this film has fallen. It's not believable at all and it's too bad - it started with a promise. Don't be fooled.
