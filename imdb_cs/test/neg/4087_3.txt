If you like, you enjoyed the first movie "Bruce Almighty", my advice is not for you to keep your hopes too high; in fact, disregard any hope you have for this movie if you are over 12 years old and have a film sense at all. The story without being too far away sees Evan (Bruce's nemesis co-anchor from the first film) move home with his family in a virgin suburb to "Change the World" with a new political path. What follows is a rather appealing and quite "stupid" story that is obviously aimed at targeting young children to the main target audience. Unlike his predecessor, Evan Almighty is a family-oriented film with an ambiguous genre of "comedy", which is described as a misleading "sequel" that some would consider to be a classic of a modern day that they can enjoy a little more mature, upscale. Evan Almighty consists of terrible film values. Playing; to skip Steve Carell and Morgan Freeman, he was tough and many characters seemed to be thrown into an unnecessarily large production budget. Furthermore, the cast includes the acting legend John Goodman who makes the look as a heel and is seen only several times in the film's whole; But I couldn't buy the character and I thought that the story he was involved with wasn't for the family comedy. Every other character in the movie (especially wife and kids!) Deserves mention of their acting behavior that could fill the king's size Kiev. Be warned; it is a typical Americanized cheddarfest associated with many mainstream family-oriented movies, so I would advise you to defend yourself with the closest grater in sight. The movie seems to be worthless for now. , has - promising aspects. CGI was excellent and it was clear that much time went into ark modeling and produce water effects and computer-generated animation endings. The particles, plasters and textures used were aesthetically stellar. Although part of me wasn't able to help, but I think it was uninteresting for the film with such bad ideals, and in my opinion it was too "good" for the film, and the movie was in it. Overall, I see this film as a catastrophe when it comes to continuing what was a franchise with enormous potential, but unfortunately it wasn't enough for a bad conclusion on the Almighty series and I set myself at the end of the movie expectations on the epic. and some meaningful finale to replace the average content I've witnessed so far. This was not the case, and I was deeply disappointed and confused to come to the final credits. As I sat dissatisfied, I couldn't help but think the film was nowhere near as "mighty" as I had hoped. The film reminded me in many ways of the watered "Night at the Museum" because it had a similar appearance and characteristics, but unfortunately it was below this level. This film gives 3 out of 10 as it is observable, but it's definitely one we have to avoid! If you have to watch this movie, be prepared for disappointment, because "mildly entertaining" is the best you could hope for watching this production.
