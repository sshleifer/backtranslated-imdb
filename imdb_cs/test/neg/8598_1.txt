The biggest so-called comedy I've ever seen <br /> <br /> It's not a patch about the naturalism of the dazzling Twin Town <br /> <br /> Vegas I, as usual, but this scenario is so terrible. predictably as good as English in the worst case (in recent years English films were all terrible) Ireland at least made commitments, Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 excelled in great movies and Wales had Twin Town, Zulu, Last Days Dolwyn, Torchwood, Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood, etc. <br /> <br /> The comedy is painted with numbers, actors are dead men who walk because there is no characterization and no originality. Br /> England is lagging behind, no matter how much it is filmed in the north. It's an old class system that destroys English movies. Oxbridge graduates praise the endless clich√©s of scripts about working class people with whom they never lived. It's pathetic. Monty Python wasn't funny nor anything from Oxbridge. Leave guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay, Rob Brydon, Billy Connolly or write your own dialogue and forget about the archaic failed system that let the people's class work and the real talent that comes through the system to take over the writing and the British and English film industry will grow again, what next Prince Edward will write a modern day Oliver Twist?
