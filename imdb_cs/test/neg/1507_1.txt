I watched this movie at a party, we were very confused by the end, ended up rather poor. although the whole movie is not very amazing, I was expecting something better. This movie is a clean waste, but I recommend that you watch it if you find cheap horror movies with a faint script pretty funny. Personally, I loved the ad, it was my overall highlight, the battle scenes were basic, a knife shot, some shadows in the window, false blood. I must say that the grandmother's costume was quite scary, this film is a mixture of the joy of the joy, the blood of the camp and the marshy stream 2, except that this film has a slightly better camera and color treatment compared to the blood of the camp.
