This movie is really bad, it's not very well and it's a lack of shine attempt at something, but I'm not sure what. I watched it and I was very disappointed. It promised a lot, but nothing at all. The characters are shallow and wooden and the music, if you call it, is terrible. There are, of course, all creatures and animated beings, but they are so poorly made that they don't see it as anything but a third movie. It is really a pity that more attention could not be paid to special effects, not to make the whole film and the end of the movie that I agree with, but a very important factor in the film around them. For me, this is a very sad attempt and should be avoided.
