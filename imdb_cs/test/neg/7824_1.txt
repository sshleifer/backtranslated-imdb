This movie was terrible. I thought it would be okay, but it's worse and worse. From the early scenes, he seems to be heading for another safe predictable rom-com, but when he arrives at the house he falls apart. None of the characters have any depth, and the only person who was believable wherever they were was Tom, though the way he was so distracted annoyed me. The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost does not exist. In an offensive comedy attempt, the writer / director presents a new character or event in virtually every scene, none of which is realistic, so it's very confusing to see what's going on. The story is hardly an apology for the film: a guy likes a girl, a house sits father home to meet a girl, destroys a house, gets a girl. Full waste of time.
