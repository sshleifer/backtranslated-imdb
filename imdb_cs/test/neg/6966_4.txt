Like other films by the worst director, Ed Wood, this film is very bad, but it is also very entertaining. Maybe it's not for everyone, but I laughed a lot. It's a strange thing when you like a bad movie. How do you rate it? As a movie very low, because the fun at least a little higher. The film tries to explain what a transvestite is through a scientist (Bela Lugosi) and an inspector (Lyle Talbot) who talks to a doctor (Timothy Farrell) who knows about these things. The doctor tells the detectives two stories and that's what we and the scientist seem to see. The doctor smooths these stories because a dead transvestite, suicide, and a headline in a sex change report are found. The first and longest story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself), who is in love and wants to marry Barbara (Dolores Fuller) but never told her that he would like to dress like a woman when her name is Glenda. The film tells the same thing over and over again, especially the fact that a transvestite is not necessarily a homosexual. The film almost says that being a transvestite is not a bad thing, but being a homosexual because it still tells us that transvestite is not a homosexual. The second story is about a transvestite who really wants to change sex and not only wants to dress like a woman, but is much shorter and less interesting. A few things make this movie very bad and therefore ridiculous. As the story is presented, it is the first thing that the same things are communicated over and over again and the others are the conclusion. It's not where it ends. Acting is very bad, especially Dolores Fuller seems to be reading her lines straight from a small screen somewhere. Every thing he says is fun. The whole dialogue gave me quite a bit of laughter. There is also a sequence where someone goes to the room. The door remains half open and we see something hanging on the wall, not quite straight. Then the door, in what seems to be the same, even though we know it is not, are slightly less open and suddenly the thing on the wall hangs straight. Ed Wood didn't mind leaving this kind of continuity error in his movie. It can be a good thing because basically it's just another laugh for a modern audience. I think you understand that this is a bad movie and I think there's a good chance that you will laugh at the ridiculous mistakes.
