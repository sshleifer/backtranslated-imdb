What is Talent Wasting - Although Crudup in real life seems to be much more like a vapid, self-embedded, less character character that portrays in this unsatisfactory film. <br /> <br /> In art, sometimes blanks show more than painted or created content. What this film reveals is the unconscious and contradictory / unresolved impulses / consciousness of the director / writer of the film. It unintentionally shows the INSUFFICIENCY that a truly developed, deeply conscious person should be and tortured to deserve the empathy or sympathy of the audience OR the lack that serves viewers as a warning story. In this respect, however, this film fails at both levels. The fact that Cal, the main character (very ANTagonist, not the protagonist in the true sense of the word), has no empathy for anyone, especially those who deserve it the most (and does not include it) and has such a curse , just, sad, whiney sympathy for himself, combined with the hallmark lack of remorse and no guilt or awareness of his impact on others - all converge in this film to make him the epitome of self-embracing, developmentally arrested, narcissistic sociopath - at this moment it is now the gold standard for men on film and in the world. One of his counterpoints (James LeGros) puts a real lightning with the laser: "I bet you haven't done one good thing in your life - and I bet you won't". It captures the absolute nature of Cal's character. Some other characters appear in the film quite quickly, even though the director stacked a deck to manipulate Cal's compassion. This is a testament to the talent and skills of supportive casting. Cal's "return" has nothing to do with character development, transformation, or consciousness development. It has to do with the ultimate surrender that, until something better appears, it can also return to a comfortable, cozy status with a legitimate right where life is easy and no one will demand to grow up - something that is Is intentionally incompetent and not interested about it. The film could be pointed out and deliberately show traps and tragedies - the devastating effects of this kind of lack of conscience / consciousness, but apologizes and instead celebrates it - in fact it plunges into self-regret with arrogant, selfish, emotionally stunned by the main character. (and when I was thinking about recent revelations, he certainly sent me the chills about the condemned murderer Scott Peterson). If you want to see Crudup at his innermost and full of exciting potential, which in my opinion has never really been realized, look at the underestimation of "Inventing the Abbots". ...
