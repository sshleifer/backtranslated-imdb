Like Tinto Brass ("Caligula"), the people who made this film cannot tell the difference between pronunciation and eroticism. There is no accumulation at all, just throw naked women on the screen; No, it doesn't work that way. If close-ups of female genitalia are not your thing, get ready to look far away from the screen in many places (I often did). "All women are whores at heart" the film's mentality is offensive, and the "story" is, in turn, absurd and boring (escape is the most boring part!). But in the middle of the road is a random scene that emerges from nothing and includes one of the (female) prisoners and one of the (male) guards in a nude wrestling match that wins with several judo movements. Although the choreography of the fight is bad, the whole scene is undeniably unforgettable. In fact, this scene and nice cinematography are just two reasons why I give this movie * from 4 instead of 0.
