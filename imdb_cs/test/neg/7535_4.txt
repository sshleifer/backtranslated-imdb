Very strange. But he wanted to be. This director is his own man. Even there are tribes if Polanski, Bergman, and Kafka at least in Episode 6, peeping it one. It was all so weird and reminiscent of the above three artists was that it went everywhere, you never knew where they were going, and could end up anywhere and finally, when it was over, it could go on. The end is barely final, no one will tell you what these two characters would do in the next slide. One more thing should be said about the director: No wonder Kubrick fascinated him. In this episode, a lot of Eyes Wide Shut is somehow, in direct access to the character, realistic elements of both. Kubrick's location of the camera without any sharp effects, much more flooded and rushed, not so frayed. It said that back to the beginning, this man still has his own things and tells them well. Yet for some reason, there is not the only scene I want to see again. But he certainly didn't feel that anyone in the smallest one was watching him. But I still realized how three or four other ghost spirits were moving in the procession and blurring everything. The reservation is that it was just six episode: another nine can give me completely different things. But since this episode revolved around the peep, the view, the absolute domain of the movie, I said, didn't take any of the usual paths, he definitely went his own way and carried the luggage of many good directors.
