For me, this film was disappointing. Somehow I expected it to explain the reason for General Rommel's popularity and his success as a military strategist in WW II. But none of it is, it is the last or two years of his life and he sometimes tries to wash him. So I just have to assume that Rommel was primarily an amoral and apolitical technocrat in conquering and killing business, without any special magic or notoriety in behavior. Such real people just don't make good film material. I almost regret James Mason, one of my favorite actors, who had to be a nice wooden character. In fact, a good director and a lot of great acting talent have been wasted on this movie? with the exception of Luther Adler, who gives a truly unforgettable and strange naturalistic portrait of Adolf Hitler. There may also be a cultural problem for people like me who are part of the German-speaking world. Famous British actors who pretend to be German are simply not credible. For example, Rommel is perceived here not only as a German, but as a typical Southern-Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, who immediately thinks of a particular dialect, a kind of joke, a certain way to see the world (across from Prussian junker). I also believe that in the context of the July 20 assassination attempt, there are now mixed feelings, many of the conspirators were not democrats and wanted the German troops to join the Western Allies against the advancing Bolsheviks (and thereby prolong war). The best film depiction of an intellectual, intelligent military mind is still Patton (1970). By the way, General Patton can be spotted for a brief moment in the rich documentary foundation that was used for this film. Open case and revolver with mother of pearls are clearly visible!
