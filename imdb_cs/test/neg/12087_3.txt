The government is a moody period piece, a meandering story of a Jewish woman who, after the death of her father, goes to Scotland in 1830 and acts as a pagan to work to support her family in London. Rosina - or Mary, as she calls herself in a not very fine piece of symbolic writing - is a headless child, sociality with dreams of being an actress. He establishes an alliance with the employer and by chance solves the fundamental problem of his research by photographing. Giddy with success, begin to stop and annoying matter, while the eldest son of her lover falls hopelessly (and inexplicably) in love with her. And as a child, she can't understand the consequences of her action - at the end, betraying those who fooled themselves to make a life for themselves. Many say it is something of a feminist manifesto, but I do not agree. Whether he intended or not, this film resonates with me only if I consider it a warning story. In the end, Rosina's greatest disappointment is true - she has lied, she has been on the way to helping a man who wanted to be his father and her lover, and eventually contributed only by destruction. So the end of the film gives me the impression that no one she used hurt her for anything she did - and that's exactly how it should be. <br /> <br /> Did I need to teach me this lesson so long and langorous? Not at all. On the contrary, it would not be for excellent cinematography, a unique score, and the hope that it would succeed in getting it, I would not have gotten with it by the end of the film. Minnie driver fans are likely to be disappointed with her uneven performance, but they may still want it; I doubt that Jonathan Rhys-Meyers' young fans will be able to stay awake for the reward they expect, and I can't think it's holding too little cultural detail that might be interesting, even for photography lovers. The 3 points I give are for his visual style and score only. Based on my further work, I assume that the performances of the actors are so unsatisfactory because of the bad script and worse overhead, but in the end they are remarkable.
