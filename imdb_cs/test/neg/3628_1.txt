This show is upset. it was given on a roller coaster friday, and while it undoubtedly destroyed the running theme of Friday's programming I will judge it rationally ... I still think it sucks. It's really super lame. Zoey and her stupid friends are weak and the pot is lame. Poor continuity and pot sucks and I reckon that dialogue and connections are weak. Weak humor and lame sucky characters suck, and the whole show is frankly disappointed not worth watching. It sucks and is really, really lame. It really must be one of the most famous shows on television, it's really not worth watching. I mean, how lame weak and sucky can the show get before it gets axed?
