They can be spoilers so they don't read if you don't want to Like the TV news, everything is already happening, the big tsunami floats above the city bay and cut, nothing more to see, Tokay suffers from a major earthquake, has seen anyone over 5 seconds I saw? If you want to make a love story, make a love story, but if you want to use a disaster movie title, please be kind to show me DISASTER, pd after watching this movie watch JISHIN RETTO or any GODZILLA movie to satisfy the part that was willing to see people scream and Collapse buildings that didn't get a chance to do in this movie. Don t get me wrong I love disaster movies and I like the original Nihon chimbotsu and Jishin retto, even as the last Poseidon, not much of a story there but very good and graphic disaster sequence, New Nihon chimbotsu loses a point as many times as a pearl harbor or a day after tomorrow but at least these two movies show good sequels of disasters and also quite expensive FX that didn't show anything, give me a fake building if you like it until you destroy it properly, I know I have to sound like a sadistic madman, but I went to see Love Actually, when I felt like I wanted to see a romantic movie, Grrrrrrr i Kimpachi Sensei makes me cry and this movie did not do it: There is also a TV series called Napping Chimbots from 1975, I have a DVD and it's much better
