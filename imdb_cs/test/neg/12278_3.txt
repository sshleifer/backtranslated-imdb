Tony Curtis and Skip Homier both wear black with white hoops on canvas behind the scenes just before and after the swimming pool and the ejection of the tank. He must have been too hard on the feet of young stars. If the real Marines were on a mission, they would wear shoes. In the first scene, they took off their leggings just before they set out on their little trip to find a farmer. When they went to the area where the fox holes were dug, Tony and Skip wore combat boots, then later, when Lovejoy and Curtis run into Framer and his daughter Tony is wearing "Tennis Shoes," but hey! A film about a real story, but really need interest in love?
