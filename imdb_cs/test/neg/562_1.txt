The man with Bogart's face sets it up to make the nostalgia of the audience for the film era a reality in the late 1930s. This fails miserably for several reasons. First, Sacchi, while looking reasonably like Bogart and even speaking like him on the occasion and using his mannerism, completely lacks Bogart's charisma or acting abilities. This is really obvious whenever Sacchi doesn't imitate a scene from one of Bogart's movies. Second, the film does not have the first speed character actors Bogart was able to work with. There's no Peter Lorre or Sydney Greenstreet, people. Sure, we've been performing other performances with Victor Buaeno, Olivia Hussey and George Raft, but they're just not the same caliber (or they don't have enough time on the screen or are wrong). Third, all attempts at "modern" humor will fail. All underwear jokes, with Marlowe almost * never * remove this damn hat and trench coat (though Bogart should), etc. They just aren't funny and really pull down this movie. Fourth, I've never heard Mitchell's goofier themed song. Finally, the false respect of the film to Bogart (and other classic actors) is really irritating. Bogart almost never played a direct hero, he was a hero on these occasions. He played complicated characters. This film makes Bogart out the trigger-happy, moralistic do-gooder. While this could be true about some film characters, Bogart characters rarely fall that account. It's a movie like this that people unexposed to the cinema of the past think it's all hokey, "a good guy beats bad guys and gets a girl" crap with low production levels.
