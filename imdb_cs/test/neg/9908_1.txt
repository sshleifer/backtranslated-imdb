I hate this garbage the most arrogant attitude of filmmakers and network managers who make this public nonsense public because they really think the audience is so stupid, so uninteresting, so they deserve these disadvantages. There is self fun to see the disaster movies and the magic of today's CGI effects artists are given powerful tools to explore what had previously been denied. With this attraction we sat down to watch some chaos and destruction. Well, guess what, the only chaos we saw was in the ads that appeared on the next Wednesday. What a waste! But wait, even bigger. The scenario itself was a major disaster! And then there was the direction and flaccid behavior of anyone involved in this turkey. But did we know that before?! We knew that the effects themselves are not fun, but a network of gods who Okayed this TV movie didn't care about it because in their mantra the eternal line is "never underestimate how spectators are stupid". These guys must actually live by this password, and I'm so exhausted. No wonder the audience left the American drama in horrors and put their camp in a reality show. At least in these programs, no one is trying to make it look like anything other than what it is: intellectual pornography. Category 6 is worse than it is because it is assumed to be different and "original". Yes, it was a catastrophic movie all right, but disasters aren't what they advertised!
