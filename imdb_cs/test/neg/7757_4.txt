From what I understand, Mr. Bava left this project before completion ... AND RIGHT SO !!! If I were him, I would surely make sure that every copy was burned and if somebody asked me about this film in the future ... NEVER DO NOT AND NEVER BEEN ... the story's end. Despite some great files and a good photo it's a horrible movie ... is it to be scary? (not at least) is it funny? (puh-leese) Total waste of time ... and I really don't want to say it !!
