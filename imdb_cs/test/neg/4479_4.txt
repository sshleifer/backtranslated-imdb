The only romantic thing about this movie is the romance and anxiety. If you expect this film adaptation of another novel by Nicholas Sparks, which will follow a pattern of previous films such as "Message in the Bottle", "Night at Rodanthe" and "Walk to Remember", think again. No one will die of an accident trying to save someone, and romance will not change these characters. If anything, it's even more unfortunate than they were. Soft-spoken Special Forces Army Sergeant, John Tyree (Channing Tatum "GI Joe"), has an unforgettable two-week flirt while on vacation from the army with an impressive student, Savannah Curtis (shining Amanda Seyfriend of "Mamma Mia") Spends Spring Break in South Carolina. Savannah does not drink, does not smoke, but tells John that her head is filled with secrecy. Inevitably, John and Savannah capsize madly in love with each other and initiate endless exchanges of love letter letters that are sleep-inducing by any standard. Tyree is out in the world, serving the army in some god-forgotten corner of the globe, while she's off at college perusing his letters in the classroom. Like hot and heavy, suicide terrorists throw planes at the World Trade Center. John reenlists along with his friends in a wave of patriotism without discussing the possibilities with Savannah. Meanwhile, another guy, a hairy but sympathetic family friend, Tim (Henry Thomas "ET: Extra-Terrestrial") who has a helpless, autistic child named Alan, becomes the subject of Savannah's sentiment. It is the girl who helps build houses for the less fortunate and wants to start a summer ranch for autistic children. Delays what seems forever before finally joining Tyree with an even letter. Indeed, she will release him for a man with a disease! Later, he admits to John that she knew that the sound of his voice would break her determination to marry Tim, so the fatal call wouldn't. John predictably overflows with Savannah's lack of communication. During a routine mission, our hero takes a few terrorist rounds on his back and ends up in Germany. While all this is happening, Tyree is trying to cope with his own coin coin, Mr. Tyree (Richard Jenkins of "Step Brothers"), who suffers from Asperger's syndrome. His father seems to be on his last feet after John gets out of the hospital. The leading female character lacks respect and her tyree betrayal is quite a low blow. Tyree, his father, and Tyree's commander, Keith Robinson, are the only likable characters in this romantic long distance romance. <br /> <br /> "Dear John" gives a new sense of lethargic love stories. Ugh!
