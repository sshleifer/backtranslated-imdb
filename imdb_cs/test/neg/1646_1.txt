This movie is one of the worst movies of all time. I'm a little upset that this movie isn't on the bottom 100; deserves a place of at least 60 or 70 on this list. It's not just a movie that I think is bad in the MST3K method; it's just bad. This is one of the few movies I really hate. Freddy Got Fingered is in the same bad category. So the story in this is that the daughter (Gugino) goes to California to go to school and come back with Crawl (Shore) and he tries to learn to be a farmer. Then the friend tries to set Shore up so that the girl leaves Crawl and returns to him. That ends, and what's left of the audience can leave. The main purpose of this film is for Pauly Shore to have a camera mug and try to be funny; but I would say about 100% of the time he fails. Their terrible inaccurate and outdated views of farms and agriculture are offensive and there is nothing worth seeing in this film. If you think you see it: no. I once saw a movie that seemed to be watching him for 5 or 6 hours. If you've seen it before; You have my compassion.
