This movie is trying to rip the Predator, but the movie is much better. This movie has really horrible special effects and a mindless plot. The team that enters the forest to find the cause of the disappearance of the army and scientists is a combination of crude and rough male delta commandos and nice but hard female rangers. None of them is very clear. It seems that all the characters are more than willing to escape into the forest alone and plunge into the spear or the sword and their death. Some of the pyrotechnic materials are very large and have to be expensive. But close-ups of creation are ridiculous, just like most death scenes. Every clich√© that the authors thought was used. If you're looking for a mindless loser, it can fill your account. The night I watched was very slow, so I sat the whole thing. I have to admit, it's been a long time since I've been following something like this. This film is very little. I'm impressed by the fact that junk stuff is being produced.
