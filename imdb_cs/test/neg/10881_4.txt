Continuing the string "stalker / slasher" flicks in the vein of "Wolf Creek", "Hostel", "Joy Ride", etc., "Stop Stop." The most original and useless one of them. We'll start, promisingly, with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a dirty room. There's interest. Then we move on to a pair of cliches on our way to LA with eyes on the star. . . which, making movies such as this, they never achieve. From the sexual growling in the park, a couple of discs, arguing all the way, to an abandoned and disgusting rest area for a girl to use. bathroom. Harmless until she escapes and finds out her boyfriend is missing and realizes she is being chased by the lame version of Rusty Nail "Joy Ride". . . just ride in Mater from "Cars". Honestly, if it was ordered / written / produced / acted on by someone else, it could have been pretty good. But not. Because then comes the spirit story. Yeah. . . You guessed it. Lots of "oh, I'll help you, but wait, you're dead" to "wait, it's a stalker man, a monster, or a ghost?". But wait? Who's going to rescue to save the girl's life and maybe the movie? That's Lawerence's brother. Excellent. We're saved. (sarcasm) Oh wait, we're not. <br /> <br /> You know. . . If you want to laugh from pretty bad or if you get a free rent like me, try it. <br /> <br /> If anything, you'll learn how to make a movie. <br /> <br /> -AP3-
