Some of the films produced by the film company Roger Corman New World in the 1970s represent the best kind of film B, where the limitations of this genre actually act as a kind of liberating influence on writers and directors? from this environment, classic films such as "Deathrace 2000", "Hollywood Boulevard", "Grand Theft Auto" and "Caged Heat" were created. Unfortunately, his former companions at American International Pictures ran out of steam in the 1970s, especially in the absence of Jim Nicholson, and they often produced secondary imitations of Corman's films, sometimes featuring his self-made stars. "Black Mama, White Mama" is one of those movies. It is basically a cheaper imitation of "The Big Doll House with some of the same stars that do a lot of the same things. Yes, it's a co-production of John Ashley (yes, the same John Ashley who was a hilarious Elvis who wants to be in" How to Make a Monster ") "and pair up with Debbie Walley in" Beach Blanket Bingo ") with all the signatures of his female prisons, where everyone except maybe 2 or 3 leading characters, including prisoners and guards, are Filipino actors in predominantly non-speaking roles, where we see female supermodels which are dedicated to the roles of revolutionary militants, and where the primary enjoyment of the film is derived from the routine use of S&M. <br /> <br /> The press I saw Recently was extremely slightly damaged (good ole Will Viharo described as "Yellow Mama , Yellow Mama "), but I think that even in the best conditions, photography and direction are extremely routine. alone because he was always sufficient to at least give his films another production value by filming in free public spaces that would make the film more impressive. This movie doesn't look impressive, it doesn't have an impressive soundtrack, and you feel embarrassed for anyone who has talent. The only remotely interesting appearances come from Pam Grier as a wild whore to escape the life of Philippine actor Dind Fernando as her grotesquely self-indulgent pimp, and Sid Haig as a cowboy mercenary. The story places Grier and co-star Margaret Markov in a low budget female version of "Defiant Ones", but does very little with melodramatic options provided by that premise. It is basically just a pretext to ensure that the two protagonists can stop for a good mud fight while trying to escape from prison together. All this is in the spirit of good entertainment, but the film fails even as exploitation because there is a certain edge and stupidity that should be present in such scenes, which are replaced by such gaping predictability instead of this director's hand. So the film will have little value for fans of hard-core value use? at least in the version I saw, there is nothing more explicit than "Faster Pussycat, Kill! Kill!" from more than a decade earlier and far less interesting visually and thematically. For those who enjoy the laughter of "so bad it is good" movies, it could be fun, but it's not in the top layer. People would prefer to look for "Magic Heat" or some of those who enjoy their own brutality to the point of becoming a camp; this is more similar to the less ambitious effort as Cirio Santiago's "Muthers". The best thing about this movie is, unfortunately, the title and presence of Pam Grier, which was at the same time better in other films (especially Jack Coffy). Perhaps this film illustrates the point in the middle of Miss Grier's journey from Corman's secretary to B-Queen-For-A-Day, but other than his historical "meaning" as such will be of little value to the great Grier fans because very little work is given with this. It's worthwhile to skip if you obviously don't see many friends and a lot of beer in the cinema like I did. And then its value is questionable.
