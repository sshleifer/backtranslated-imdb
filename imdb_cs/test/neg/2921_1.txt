I'm thinking about some things for this movie: First, it's a really bad movie. That's really "Superbad". The film looked very promising in the trailers, but it fell flat ... Maybe the original idea was good, but the film became boring and empty between bad script and bad play. My advice is not to waste 2 hours of your precious time. You were warned. This is the first movie I rated 1 star on IMDb.com ... Second, none of the characters is likeable. You really don't care what happened to them ... Third, the villain identifies himself very easily. Grandson kills his father, apologizes to his boyfriend, gets a pregnant slave, poisones his grandfather ... Like JT, he says, "If you like evil without retribution, it's your movie. Nothing more to say ...
