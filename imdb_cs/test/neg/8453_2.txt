This film was totally painful to watch. I understand that Indian movies don't have the same resources as other mainstream movies. However, there are basic elements of making a movie that you usually want to keep. First jumps. 15 minutes in the movie. There are shots in which two separate shots of the same shot seem to have been adjusted together. What I mean is a character who says half the line from one goal and the rest of the line is from a different direction. Second, dialogue. I understand that many writers are seeking a very realistic and true dialogue for their films. Since this film is very specific to its location, dialogue must be spoken in a specific tone as well (example: set a movie in Boston, yet people use the West Coast slang with Chicago accent). Even when we understand it, it is still difficult to sit in some of the lines that these actors represent. These are just the two liveliest problems I have encountered with this film. There were several. I don't want to sound like a tough critic who doesn't know anything. I have many years of experience with film (especially low budget). I also understand that many directors are often their method of madness. I couldn't find this method used in this movie. This is difficult when you decide whether I see this film as an example of a unique film-making style, or just another low budget, a poorly connected film. I sincerely hope it's not the other one. If someone has an insight into why things have been done in a certain way, or has their own thoughts / opinions about this movie, I'd like to hear them. I hope I understand this film more and my current opinion can be changed.
