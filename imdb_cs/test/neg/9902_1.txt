I can't believe I actually spent nearly three hours of my life watching it. It must be one of the most incredible, predictable and cheesy TV movies I've seen for a long time. I was hoping for some good special effects and action, instead I spent all the time rolling my eyes and shouting "OH COME ON !!!" on the screen. The dialogue is shallow and obvious, it is sometimes tense and as the story moves, it's not just funny how ALL happens at the same timeâ€¦ I've seen more than my share of catastrophic movies, I'm a big fan and I think they often can pull absolutely unrealistic things as long as it's done in a fun way, but this is definitely not. That's just insulting intelligent viewers everywhere. What did they think when they did this movie ?????
