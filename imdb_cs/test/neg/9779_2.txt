I gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just because I'm a polite person. This film rid me of 90 minutes of my life in which I could do something useful to the human species or just for me. Dialogue is wrong, actors never look scared! Even if it's a horror movie. For example, the scene in which Kurt collects the bones of his former colleague. He should be afraid, but it looks pretty normal. The movie's chick is such a clich√©. One thing I liked about her was the dress she wore on the last scene. By the way, the end was extremely predictable when ginger flickered in the box. In fact, I was thinking more about the ants who walked in the back seat of a car. But I wasn't surprised.
