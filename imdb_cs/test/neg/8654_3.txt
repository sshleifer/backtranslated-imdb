I agree that this film is about sex without seduction or love. In fact, it makes sex seem so boring and I wonder why bother. In fact, I don't think it would remotely talk about how the Canadian Indian second generation feels sex. Did you know that the first hotel / drunk idea was copied from the Korean film Yopgijogin gunyo, made in 2001 or something like that? That Korean film was actually brilliant as a comedy, but at the same time forcing viewers to think about the complexity of the relationship between man and woman and the difference between man and woman in experience and thinking. I think most of the Neal N Nikki / Drunk Segment hotels have been imitated. Can't Bollywood filmmakers just try to make originals, please? Seriously, I've never enjoyed a Hindu movie that is copycat. The ones I enjoy have always spoken Indian feelings through Indian cultural means.
