Family type. When the show aired for the first time, it was fresh, original and quite funny. I stopped watching it. She has become one of the worst shows on TV, combining surreal jokes, repetitive, funny jokes, and the hope that every joke can become funny with the inclusion of "bitch". Seth MacFarlane obviously has problems with himself, and he is obviously panding on 13 year old boys audience. I just don't understand how something that started so funny, so different from everything else, can translate into this horrible mess of "comedy" shows. I really heard one of the comics instincts better. It's really sad to see the big show failing, and watch the drivel go on like this. Either Seth MacFarlane has stopped trying, or thinks the show is as cheerful as it is. In any case God will help us. I hate this show and I will dance an Irish jig when its finally canceled.
