Scary facial masks and slasher films have gone like cheese and chives for a long life cycle. People often assume that this trend started with John Carpenter, but as with many clich√©s of the genre - the Italians did it first. Films such as Eyeball, Torso and Blood and Black Lace were the cause of the maniac hood in the murder mystery. There were also a couple of American pre-Halloween slashers that need mention. Classroom Massacre, Keep my Grave Open and Savage Weekend clearly before the date of 1978, while The Town, which Dreated Sundown is widely regarded as one of the first teen-killing movies. Carpenter's semi-final film did not have to be a family-disguised nightmare, but he definitely started a competition between directors to reveal a haunted disguise for his bogeymen. Over the years, we've seen several memorable candidates, but my favorites would have been: My Bloody Valentine's maniacal miner, The Prowler's sadistic soldier, and Wicked Games' copper forehead. I am also interested in many clown killers who have appeared in the whole category. The final scene at The House on Sorority Row must be listed as one of the best, and the Clown of Midnight is also one of the greatest freak costumes. The leather mask was probably the last type to be used in the slasher movie, probably because they are widely associated with sexual perversion, which of course not exactly do for a scary disguise. In later years, however, Blackout and this ambiguity decided that fear could certainly be incorporated into the suit. Here's how later two of them? The screen lights up with a hurry of blue sirens because the cops race in the hostage. It seems that a stressed-out gentleman may have had enough to be cast as extra in low-eyed crispy turkeys, so he decided to keep his wife and child on the rifle. Detective Shine (David Clover) manages to struggle with the shooter, but unfortunatelly loses the fight to grab a free gun and seems to be the end of the road for a gray officer. Luckily, he is rescued in a moment of time by Lisa Ryder's precise shooter (Donna Adams), the hottest female police officer in California. Her heroic encounter earns a brunette like a detective. Class, and his performance, which is strongly envied by her male counterparts. Meanwhile, a maniac dressed in a fur coat kills around the city, killing hookers, and storing their damned corpses on the corners of the streets. Ryder and Shine deal with a murderous gimpa and their first call for questioning is a slim back photographer called Michael Walker (John Mandell). Lisa is such a top inspector that normal police regulation does not seem to her, as long as she is dating a cameraman, even if the numero uno suspect. When bodies continue to accumulate around the city, they decide to go secretly in an effort to wash out S & M's madness? If something, Zipperface effortlessly sums up everything that went wrong with the slasher genre at the end of its end. What began as a big stepping stone for novice and emerging filmmakers and thespians was reduced to the drains of films with flat, zero tension or shocks and talented enemy actors. With the flowering of the 1980s, splashing splashes managed to hide their lack of powerful dramatic line-ups with gooey special effects and exciting overhead flourishing. Unfortunately, at this point in cycling titles like Rush Week, Deadly Dreams and Majorettes seemed to have been made in a plot to make a category where many of the characters above had ended. In the early grave. Donna Adams is not ambiguously convinced as a law officer and her inexplicably idiotic behavior - which includes a striptease for a suspect in a nationwide murder investigation - is more mindlessly pathetic than you would ever expect it to be. Mansour Pourmand could not control the traffic and the vast majority of cast members would try to get a second reading for radio advertising. I was looking for and looking for, but I found nothing about merit or notes. On the plus side, if you can keep your TV turned on, you may be quite surprised by the identity of the killer. To be honest, I doubt you will take care of it by then. And another plus point? Well, erm .... the disc is perfectly symmetrical, which means you could use it as a matte to place a cup of tea? In addition, there is no other reason to go out and buy Zipperface. Bad bad bad and not in a good way, that's 90 minutes of my life that I could spend more constructively jerking my chest-hair. Abysmal.
