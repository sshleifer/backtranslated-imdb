"Revenge of the Zombies" is quite a weak and barely viable zombie effort. <br /> <br /> ** SPOILERS ** <br /> <br /> Traveling in Bayou, Larry Adams, (Robert Lowery) and Scott Warrington, (Mauritz Hugo) is informed that a friend has died. Meeting with Dr. Dr. Von Altermann (John Carradine) repeats the view that they have mysteriously died. While they stay there, they realize that help consists of zombies, reanimated dead people who make their master's offer. When the bodies accumulate, it reveals that he created creatures for use in various experiments, and everyone tries to stop him before it's too late. Good News: This is very little. Opening is easy, it's the best because it has some great marks for it. From where it starts, with ghostly silhouetted walks in the dark until revelation, this works miracles for both mystery and great images. The big one is really the scene where the creature emerges from the coffin in a long, slow and scary shot. All this is done before the opening credits and it's a fun look. The scenes in the middle where the reawakens creature inside the coffin is quite cool and looks really great. The last big positive is a really fun ending. With such an end that resembles so many universal attempts, this style fits into this style. From creepy reanimation to real action near the swamp, it's fun and really works with others to make it a real positive. Bad news: This one has only a few bugs, but they're the main ones. The first of them is the main boredom of the idle movie. Almost nothing happens here, mainly because of the tendency to do everything with speaking, rather than anything else. Only the occasional scenes are included in the zombies, but there is nothing there to devote to the film. This one just has no action, and that's what the film hurts. It rarely generates scenes that maintain interest, and sometimes it does so much longer than it really is. The last mistake in the film is the pathetic excuses for zombies. Those accustomed to more modern fares will be afraid of these creatures and will in fact serve only a few scenes. This doesn't treat zombies as threats, making them even less frightening. A little screen-time, nonthreatening nature and un-modern behavior from these zombies really destroys this one. This is a movie that really hurts. Final verdict: With evil zombies and almost nothing worth watching, it's a strange effort here. Those who are accustomed to modern zombies will find little interest in this and come out the same as this one, while only classic horror fans recommend it to do it.
