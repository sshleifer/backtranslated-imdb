The previous comments are so generous. This film is a waste of electricity and plastics. On the other hand, I had a lot of fun giving it to friends to watch and describe it in advance as "out of faith!" "No words can not express how I feel about it" "This movie moves you" As expected, friends took these unprecedented comments as enthusiastic comments. They were wrong. The sadistic pleasure I had on people was worth $ 5 that I paid for the film. On the other hand, one (former) friend says I owe him 90 minutes of life. Especially I enjoyed the "view from the gun" on the part of the movie. It's really amazing it's absurd.
