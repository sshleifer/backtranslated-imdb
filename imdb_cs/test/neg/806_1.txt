who is responsible for these "behind-the-scenes" things? who are these actors? climbed from under the rocks? "yuks, lots of yuks!" No. no yuks for me. only hatred and shame that I am a human being. I have to turn my eyes off the set, it's so embarrassing. I actually changed the channel. <br /> <br /> I've always had a problem with robin williams 'non-stop' I forgot my lithium today rantings, but at least it's funny once in the blue moon. Watching someone who is not funny at all releasing robin williams is like having every tooth in his head pulled out slowly and sadistically, without novocaine, for all eternity. Please stop doing these absolutely scary TV movies. Please.
