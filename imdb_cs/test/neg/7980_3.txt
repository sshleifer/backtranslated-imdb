Made by International Playhouse Pictures, it looks like it was filmed in a doll's house. Everyone is a liar, everything is like a dream, a toy-like no good reason. I'm not saying that everything in all movies should be absolutely realistic, but such incredible fantasy things and situations in one movie are too many. How did they get to these movies? It's nice to see Mii again; if we were to understand why her husband wanted to kill her, Mia did it well. It's not funny, motionless, just false. Stephen Dorff appears briefly at the end, suitable for a game, less for a movie, but this is not the one who measures things. Grapes.
