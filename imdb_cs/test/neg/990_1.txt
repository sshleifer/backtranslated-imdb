This is perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen, it was terribly done that it didn't go, it was very jerky because many people didn't understand the movie at all. I had to watch this movie a few times before I got an idea of ​​what was going on, OK it's like this guy stole someone's car and while running from the police it totals, for some reason the cops let him go and he has to face his parents who sent him living with her uncle in the wild, she meets a girl who loves rock climbing and he gets into the sport and has to beg your uncle to allow him to enter the climbing competition, and that's about how I said a horrible movie.
