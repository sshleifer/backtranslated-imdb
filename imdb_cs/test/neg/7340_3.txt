I lived in Barstow Ca. in 1968, when The Killers Three arrived at the local theater. The trailer was enough to pay my hard earned money to see this movie. I was really expecting Bonnie and Clyde and Dick Clark was playing a shy stupid kid while Robert Walker and Diane Varsi played a bad attempt to return Bonnie and Clyde. Needless to say, it never went well. Maybe that's why he never made it to the video. Even as a child, I left something I tore away when I left the theater. After all the best parts of the movie trailer. The film was boring and almost absurd. By the way, Dick Clark is killed, so it wasn't total.
