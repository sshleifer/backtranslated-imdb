I liked the underrated character Laura Linney played in 'Love Actually' and is very good at 'Man of the Year'. But wow. Robin Williams is not doing so much, with few minor exceptions, it was weak. Laura Linney may not have been wrong, but either the editing raped her character or it was just the sad performance of director Barry Levinson. And I think it was old Barry Levinson. So many poor performances, such uneven results must be due to management. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum are great backing roles. Goldblum plays a sinister page with taste and Walken's combination of manager and commentator for the movie is amazing. But the story is a clich√©, the presentation seems to be (should) be a very good picture and too many actions are half heart. Stimulation, storyline, and direction are all weak, compared to, say, the 'Head Office' (Secret of My Success).
