What's going on with Disney in recent years? Are there good ideas? Where is the magic? Where are good animators, good composers, good directors, good ... Well, I know Walt himself and the famous "nine old man" can't come back. But is this the reason to make these cheap sequels, and slowly but surely, destroy Walt Disney's ideals? I never rented or bought Disney's sequel to that movie. Because I read enough about its (absence) quality. But "Atlantis: Milo's return" was broadcast today on television in Germany and so I watch. This confirmed my doubts about the sequels. It was totally boring. Flaw animations, primitive color-rotation, simple characters, some failed attempts to simulate the famous Multiplane-Camera with CGI, moderate music and various patchwork, simple stories. It looks just like Disney! Not like Disney I know! It looks like one of countless, cheap and simple animation series like "DragonballZ", "Beyblade" etc., which are broadcast every day on TV for kids. My first reaction after I showed this crap was to load "Bambi" in my DVD-Player, see Disney's immortal magic, depth, spirit and magic again, to see Disney on top of it , see the amazing art of hand animation again. "Bambi" was the first (and still the only) movie to give 10 out of 10 stars. But "Atlantis: Milo's return"? No magic, no depth, no magic, no ghost ... He deserved only 3 out of 10!
