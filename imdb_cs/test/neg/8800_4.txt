"The Man of Utah" opens with a singing cowboy armor on a guitar on a horse. So we met John Weston (John Wayne), headed for the city and looked for work. When he helps Marshal Higgins (George pre-Gabby Hayes) thwart a bank robbery with his fantastic shooting, the Marshal offers him a secret job as a representative of the Dalton Valley Rodeo investigator. It seems that the annual winners of the big prize money in the rodeo are tight knit groups of bad boys in the employment of Spike Barton (Ed Peil), who also becomes the head of the rodeo committee. Serious supporters of Barton's top supporter Cheyenne Kent (Yakima Canutt) will end up seriously ill or dead. Even in the 1930s, Lone Star Westerns John Wayne had a charismatic presence that indicated the future quality of the stars. If for nothing else, seeing Wayne so young in these movies is a real gift. The movie itself clips together in a quick fifty-three minute pace, much of it took over rodeo stock footage from rigging, bulldogging and Indian parade and dance. In the decisive event of the rodeo, Weston avoids disaster by discovering a poisoned needle inserted into the saddle "Dynamite", formerly a bronco unridden on which he must outlast Cheyenne. The end is no surprise, because Barton's bad guys are leaving the rodeo victory and going for a total of thirty thousand dollars in the banks. But Marshal and Weston are there to thwart their plans and save the day for the Dalton Valley Rodeo. And as we've seen in movies like "Neath the Arizona Skies" and "Randy Rides Alone", Wayne's character closes the film in a clinic with a beautiful young lady, this time Judge Marjorie Carter's daughter (Polly Ann Young), who filmed for him .
