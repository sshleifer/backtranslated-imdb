It had the potential ... really. But there's so much about a movie that was ridiculous and ridiculous. I am a horror movie weenie and I thought it was stupid; just like my 13-year-old! I expected to sneak at least. And yes, the coarse factor of the vineyards that twisted in the people was there; however, the leadership to getting to the ruins is just stupid, stupid, stupid. I mean really who goes on a trip ... in the jungle ... with absolutely unknown. with a little water and a few snacks ... IN FLIP FLOPS, NO LESS?! Puh-lease! Better yet, who goes to a foreign country and leaves the tourist area without an interpreter or is able to speak a little language? Are these people complete morals? German brother not heard and not asking for help? Who won't do it? Did he find a few Greeks and Americans to search and find a little?
