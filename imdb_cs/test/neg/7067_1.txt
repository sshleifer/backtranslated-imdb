. . . and never see it. I've been watching bad sci-fi movies for years. I love watching bad scifi movies. I think that was the only reason I could watch this film all the way. I was reinforced by "Nukie", "Indian Superman", and the terrible movie "Fantastic Four" just to name some examples. I usually have to beat my head on the wall after seeing a bad movie so some pain disappears. No, not with this. With "TDB" I had to throw myself in the head with a shoe in the middle of the movie. Temporary repair. I can't believe I wanted to see it. I cried. When it ended, I cried. It was awful. It was worse than when I saw how * * * * * * * * * * * * * * â€¢ * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Besides the fact that Wesley Crusher is in his eighties, it's just so bad. But this review is about "TDB." The worst part is that someone wrote this movie and said, "This one deserves to go to film! It's great!" and Wayne Newton, Rob Lowe, and everyone else in the cast said, "That's what I want on my film history!" I will watch the "Indian Superman" until the cows return home, but I will never see this smoking pile of drains.
