It's a strange, this movie; you have the impression that the makers of this snooze-fest have spent more time in the local bars than on the stage. In fact, it is a surprise that you don't see the name of Harry Alan Towers on credits; he certainly has the taste of one of his productions of tax shelters, but the project's motivation seems to be for everyone involved to enjoy a longer stay in Provence. Despite the film being held all over the region, Les Baux and the area around it are worth almost everything. David Birney is for a magnificent colorless hero - as Michael Lonsdale says at one point you are "walking clich√©". What Lonsdale does is to guess who does it. For some reason, the most interesting character, played by Rampling, is sidelined, while, regardless of the book, she should be a central character because she clearly has the skill to carry a film (which would be boring anyway, but at least we'd have something more we could look at it. All in all, a pointless thing worth seeing as an action movie can be action-free.
