This movie was really bad, simple and simple. As a film like this gets into a wider edition, it's a miracle for me. It's a good idea, but it just didn't work out. However, Edward Burns is a decent actor. I liked his little role in Saving Private Ryan. <br /> <br /> Let's get to the big problem here. The visuals were so incredibly bad, I thought I was watching the old "Dinosaurs In 3D" CDROM point-and-click adventure demo on Windows 3.1 I think I saw the cut-scenes in console games of pro -2000 that have better looking dinosaurs than this. I mean, hell ... the original Tomb Raider T-Rex looked better than this one. The lizard-monkeys were ridiculous. I thought it was some creations of the "Killer Instinct" that I saw better sock-puppet monsters now that I think about it. <br /> <br /> You know, there's a ton made for TV movies that are better than this. How to Make a Jewel as Scifi Channels "The Shining" Get That Small Audience But This Burden "CGI, Easy With 4 Kidz" Gets Out On Open? I don't care if it's Ray Bradbury's story. Lameeeee
