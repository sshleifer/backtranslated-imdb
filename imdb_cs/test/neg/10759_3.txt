Although this series and especially the mini movie were very important at the time of release, I feel that the series as a whole was actually quite poorly written with a low cast. The problems in the heart are very well depicted, but it is difficult to connect and understand the problems in the film when the acting and the script are not convincing enough (especially when looking at a mini movie). I also don't believe that this mini movie or series has passed the test of time, because many scenes are quite laughing. Problems are still crucial, but Boys From The Blackstuff cannot fully help the cause of understanding the problems in Britain in the 1980s.
