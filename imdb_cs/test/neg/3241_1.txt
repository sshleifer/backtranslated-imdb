No words can describe how horrible this film is. It's like a director literally took it as *** in the role of a film and sent it to the public. Acting in this movie is terrible, the plot is so stupid, and by death each character is ridiculously bad. Some silly scenes include Akshay Kumar pulling guns out of nowhere to kill a hologram (yes hologram), Akshay Kumar carrying a bazooka around town, Rajat Bedi defeated poorly animated skeleton, Rajat Bedi and Siddharth double penetration Monisha Korell (How did they think it was equal?) . I would also like to emphasize that animations are absolutely terrible. The scene that supports this claim is when Kapal has a motorcycle and somehow gets his glasses. Shopping work looks like it's done in Microsoft color. The best work of this movie is Sunny Deol. This man is so strong that even God feels fear. In one scene he literally breaks the prison door by kicking it. Chuck Norris's round house has nothing! He is even so powerful that he can fly from London to India in 10 minutes! Overall, this film is perhaps the worst movie in the universe. If you've been looking at it, look at what's going on all the time (BTW this movie to be serious)
