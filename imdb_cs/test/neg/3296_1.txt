Silly show in the spirit of the rest of them with horrible music and laughter that must be from I Love Lucy. I got rid of the TV because it happened, but I picked up the first season for a lot of money for $ 3.00. They should take Van Damme instead. If I were a conspiracy theorist who believed that a small group of people was working against real families and coming up with this drivel / propaganda to undermine the family of values, I would point out this show, Married to Children, Family Guy etc , but I'm not so I won't. BTW I'm not a Christian, Love Simpsons and Peep show. I watched two episodes and thought if there were such shows that are popular? Then I remembered all the pictures of Walmart people who circled the web and thought they were! No wonder our culture is a joke around the world when it's the main time.
