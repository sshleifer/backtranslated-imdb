Take it from me as a cameraman who worked for Republic Studios from 1946 to 1950 and then Warners Bros and Paramount from 1950 to 1993, that's a bit of a crap. Surely it would be great to show it to your favorite friends at home party, but to try to sell it on DVD is absolutely terrible. I've seen a bad deal on my day, but it's not an acting performance. . The hero is almost ridiculous and he really thinks he is something he judges by his comments on specials. I hate to look at his fan club. The old films were not enough for the action in many scenes. The hell was the garden scene with three of the worst actresses. I've never seen a boat garden. They couldn't even get married. I wouldn't mind if they could have an ounce of acting once, but the only one with the Translvanian accent. I'm sorry, but it's not a smart movie, as some people say. I would think a horror enthusiast would be offended by this movie.
