I was looking forward to watching this movie, someone who saw him loved it. I was totally disappointed. Acting was so exaggerated. The script appeared that the writer had collected 25 different scripts from different movies and randomly selected a dialogue and put them together to create a single plagarized script. <br /> <br /> Spoilers: Is there a clich√© left in this movie? There was a hit mobstyle, homosexuality, prostitution, serial killer, fire, many godmother beggars, the main character in love with a prostitute, cross dressing, torture police, Hannibal Lechter style mutilation, I could go on and on. The line is like (godfather of a prostitute) <br /> <br /> - "Ben senin arik calismani istemiyorum" (I don't want her working anymore) <br /> <br /> - "Ben calismasam kirayi kim odeyecek? " (Who would pay the rent if I didn't work) Unrealistic Scenes: We never saw one policeman during the serial killer scenes, but when the main character disappeared, his father was taken by the police and tortured for weeks. The only way I can make sense of this movie is that the version I had was greatly modified from the original. I definitely don't recommend it and I would very much like to discuss it with anyone who cares about it. <br /> <br />
