I simply cannot understand how everyone who is cheering or just anyone who finds that horrible, lazy, badly written abomination, even remotely funny. She is so embarrassed to qualify as a real tragedy. The potential for it was huge, it could be great. What a shame that all that acting talent, sets, props, the good will of all involved was so pathetically wasted scenario that should be burned. There is a clear lack of any strict production and quality control. Just like those Hollywood movies (crazy insane mad world, casino royale) where the stars just hug each other and "have a great time", which basically means picking up a check for nothing. I could write better Who sent to my sleep. In fact, I am even when I'm awake. I did it in grade 10 at high school and played with a bunch of classmates. It was better, I look at it now and the gags are fun. Steven Moffat ARE NO TALENT BUM! What waste, what a missed opportunity. I'd like to cry.
