Lucille Ball tries to look 30 years younger than she really was in this poor apology for the musical. The film contains some of the worst choreographies he has ever seen and is constantly in danger of getting Lucy into the song. at any moment her voice. The complete lack of Lucy's talent as a singer and dancer sinks the film before she can start and besides Lucy's hard fans, nobody wants it. Bad costumes and kitsch sets don't help. More evidence that Lucy was nothing but silly faces. Directed by Gene Saks.
