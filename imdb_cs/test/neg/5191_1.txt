Ewe, launches zero budget. Titles that look like my grandson have been released with iMovie. The DVD box gives the impression that you will be treated for the old days' 80s boobie movies. NO WAY! Hardly nudity from a movie called Traci Lords! This movie really needed nudity. Instead, you get lots of lords perkies over your shirt, but they seem to be activated by hot steam. This is strange, in my world, the headlights light up in COLD. The story is pathetic, blind is just a joke and not funny. His opposites are so forced and predictable. He travels around things and sees him starting in the fall. She needs to work on her physical comedy. Most Frostbite nudity comes from a hot tub that looks like it was filmed a few months later and put into distribution. And nudity isn't worth it. <br /> <br /> NamoiBucks; It's just a matter of time before Starbucks sits on it. Not funny. When Billy comes to town for the first time when he hits the Namoi Bucks, he comments "Wow have these everywhere." This leads you to believe that it is a Starbucks parody, but a surprise, Namoi alone is behind the post of this place. Apparently he loves coffee so much that the owner of this huge chain decided to work in a small, cool city. The only thing this movie has for it is Warren Miller snowboarding footage. Yeah, that's all Warren's stuff, so if you want to see a great event, get Warren Miller. Let Frostbite alone. There's nothing good about this movie. There is no reason to rent or buy it, and if a friend offers you a free loan. Hit him and end friendship.
