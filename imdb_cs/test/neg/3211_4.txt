Take the secret agent James Bond, the madness of the sixties, mix in some terms from the female Sax Rohmer's wife Fu Manchu femme fatale and get upset in some absurd twisted revisionism by director Franco - you have a man who hates Sumuru lesbians or "7 secrets ... - better known as "The Girl of Rio" in the US, reminiscent of "The Man of Rio", which has nothing to do with it. Yes, this is happening in Brazil, we have to give it. Sumuru, or Sumitra, as also mentioned, is like the evil version of "Modesty Blaise" played by actress Eaton with the familiar smile most of us first met in "Goldfinger". There are numerous shots from her camera view, slowly opening her mouth, probably while watching something unpleasant (however, she is doubled in her key lesbian scene). He controls an entire army of female warriors dressed in color and manages a city called Femina, or something like that (outside of Rio de Janeiro?). These concepts, which previously appeared in "The Million Eyes of Sumuru," sound wonderful, but despite some interesting scenographic design and visuals, the same atmosphere as "Girls Do", which came at the same time, and which also featured female army. At first glance, looking at all these armed women, usually in a row, catches someone's interest, but after 15 minutes or so you realize there's nothing but a visual setting. The story follows what looks like a secret agent, a male who comes to Brazil with $ 10 million. He attracts the attention of a local criminal criminal (Sandersa, who intimidates her as an elderly Bond-type villain) who sends dark-skinned criminals in a bush hat to admire him. All this sets a three-way conflict between an agent, a criminal master, and a mysterious Sumuru (a criminal wants Sumuru's secret). Sumuru also holds various prisoners in glass cages - perhaps one of the secrets. That sounds excited, but there are problems that go beyond the slow pace; There are many shots that could use a lot of tightening: for example, one shot of an arriving aircraft, for example, will remain on the vessel as it settles to a near stop, as if it had never been captured on film. A similar approach is to a typical sunset, as if it was something unusual. The match scenes are very unusual, as if the filmmakers had to use the first one. To add some production value, there is a real carnival scene in Rio halfway. I guess there were various budget problems, especially evident in the climactic battle, where fake sound effects and smoke conceal a lot of fake actions, such as the lack of even real-looking weapons - that is the times when kids use plastic weapons and pretend that the bullets are firing, falling unconvincingly. There are impressions of sadism, such as torture character to get answers and female nudity, early depiction of such after some restrictions have been raised. But mostly you will turn your eyes.
