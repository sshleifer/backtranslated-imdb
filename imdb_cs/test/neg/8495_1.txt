This is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen. I say it without exaggeration and believe me, I've seen a lot of bad movies. It's embarrassing and uncomfortable that millions of dollars have gone into this movie and that hundreds (thousands?) Of artisans have spent so much time working on what writers and manufacturers need to know would be a colossal failure. When a 90-minute movie feels so long, stretched, boring and incomprehensible, you know something's happened somewhere. Also, Jamie Kennedy (whose work I enjoyed elsewhere) is just terrible in this role; apparently he never got a test on the screen, because no producer in their right mind would in any way consider him fun, especially in the mask mask. Simply terrible. Personally, I can't wait to see reviews of major film critics because I know they have a better job than I do when I tear that train wreck into pieces. Producers of this film should be embarrassed and, more importantly, NEVER have to do theatrical films again.
