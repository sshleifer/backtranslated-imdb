A completely forgotten movie, but an incredible soundtrack: I would have put it (soundtrack) 9 out of 10. I have a CD and guitar work (Nils Lofgren) is excellent! I saw the movie years ago and I had to check the IMDb to remember what it was about. I sat down to get on the soundtrack and had to replace it since then. It ranges from blues / soul / ballad to gospel dose. All songs written, arranged, produced and performed by Nils Lofgren, who is the "next" guitarist opposite Steve Van Zandt in the E Street Band. The guy can play! The vocals are processed by Nils (can't sing very well-too hoarse), Bonnie Sheridan (who is a great singer) and Tom Lepson.
