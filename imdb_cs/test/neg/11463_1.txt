I realize that most people don't know who Solomon Kane is and that the film is built on a much larger audience. But then why bother saying "Solomon Kane" first when the name has no business value? Characters certainly have nothing to do with R.E. Howard's character. Except she has a big hat. This is where the resemblance ends. It's always a bad sign when a superhero / fantasy / sci-fi movie persists over a story of origin, but when you invent one whole thing like that for a character who didn't do it. t have one at all, you have already missed a point completely. Kane is no longer a fanatical Christian storyteller, but rather a former evil man trying to save his soul (this part is in the opening scene). <br /> <br /> Changed or simply ignored with the most basic character elements, using Solomon Kane is just confused. It's just to be able to say "From Conan Creator" and hope to get involved in a promising series if the new movie "Conan" gets off the ground? Ignoring the complete departure of the stories, the film is competent, if absolutely general for the first half, but then decides to utter stupidity in the climate scene, which involves more super baddies (I think three "boss levels" at the same time), none of whom is least interesting or threatening. If I wasn't a Kane fan who was disappointed to completely ignore the source material, I would probably have given the film 3 or 4 instead of 1 Even for (the majority) viewers who learn about it Kane knows nothing, it's a pretty thin slurry.
