Polar Express. Director Robert Zemeckis, I love Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, Contact and Who Framed Roger Rabbit. And Tom Hanks, one of my favorite actors. The reviews of this film were almost unanimous and says it is an instant classic. Ebert & Roeper gave him two ENTHUSIASTIC inches! Even Ebert's written testimonial gave him four stars! Wow ... OK ... I gotta see this! But wait ... the motion capture used looks really weird. Hmm ... maybe I'm not seeing it like that. <br /> <br /> "Well, are you going?" says train conductor to boy in Polar Express. The boy is reluctant at first and the train starts on his course without him. The boy will soon change his mind and jump on deck just in time. Now most of you have probably decided not to jump aboard this train and wait for a television train or Express rental (hee hee, I'm so funny and smart). On the other hand, I was like a boy who was skeptical at first, but jumped to see what the fuss was about. I've just wasted $ 10 and two hours of my life. I can't even start explaining pain in my stomach. Polar Express was so painful he couldn't sit down. There's no story. There is no payout. You're sitting there through these series of events and you're wondering, "is there anything?" It would be one thing if the scenes were fun ... but they are not. This film is without any emotions, any soul, an ounce of credibility, and most of all: fun. This movie is NOT FUNCTIONAL. <br /> <br /> Let's talk about how these characters are looking for a second. Saying it's the same technology (move, sorry, "PERFORMANCE" capture) that is used to make Gollum a real shame because Gollum was credible !!! Photo-realism does not translate well in this medium. Are you using animation, why not build characters to be more prominent? Or why shoot it all with real actors? They may have. We, as people, know how we walk, talk, communicate with things. When you see it on the screen unconvincingly, it's not impressive. Caricatures made convincingly are all the more credible as The Incredibles did. The result of the polar expression is now as if they had taken the corpses of the dead children and turned them into puppets. They move and talk, but where is the heart? Where is the soul? This is what we see on the screen. UGH UGH UGH UGH! This movie is so awful! The film is a scene in which a boy takes a ticket from a train because she got up and left. He wants to give her, but you're sitting there, "why?" Let it go ... she's coming back! Of course he loses his ticket and follows an "adventure". And then there's a kid who's still trapped in the back of the train and bringing him hot chocolate, but can't come and join the rest of the kids? And then there's this annoying child "I know it all" with a voice of 35 years. It's all very worrying. And those songs! One girl goes to the back of the train, where she is a lone boy. She sings a song for herself. And then breaks and joins! The song ends when holding hands, looking into each other as if they were lovers. Very embarrassing. I won't even go into the details of the hot chocolate song while the waiters dance around the train. "keep it hot, keep it hot!" One scene where Tom Hanks slides on his knees with his arms outstretched in the air must be one of BAD's most memorable scenes in the history of bad scenes. I have to stop or kill myself. I have to look at something lousy to clear the palette. Yes ... lousy is better than The Polar Express. "One thing on the trains, no matter where you go, what matters, it is to decide on." <br /> <br /> Don't get to this place. For the love of God I have decided for you! This is just another movie from a children's book stretched out incredibly thin into film. It happened with Grinch and the Cat in the hat and they were also terrible. But who can blame them? I bet when I took the book, Too Much Berenstein's Unhealthy Food, and I turned it into a feature film, it would probably also be boring. But at least ... it will be a story and a point that is what Polar Express is not missing.
