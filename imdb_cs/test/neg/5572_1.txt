Rented (free rental thanks to God) that allegedly filmed in CT where I live could be filmed in the tunnel at all times! Dark ninety percent of the time, and just a terrible attempt at a low budget swing that can be good if done right. In short, a bunch of young adults witnessing the fall of meteors, and then falling prey to strangers on the island of lighthouses, with the help of a farmer and wife. Analysis: <br /> <br /> - playing = horrible <br /> <br /> - writing = uninspired <br /> <br /> - story = done a million times before you used different settings <br /> - production values ​​= okay (lighting) for budget <br /> <br /> - effects (creation, digital, other) HORRIBLE, VERY CHEAP SEARCHING IT. To add insult to injury, final credits have bloopers shooting - really now ...... who cares! Distributed under a universal company, shocked that it would even after display. Finally, as an alternative, try "CREEP". Low budget, but well written, well acted, and pretty, well, scary!
