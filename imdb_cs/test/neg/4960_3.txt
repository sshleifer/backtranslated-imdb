It's a terrible garbage. I liked "How Do You Want Me", "Father Ted", "Green Wing" and Bill Bailey's standup act, but I'm bringing it up with "Hippies" and "Planet of the Apes" under 'Big Family Tree' , wrong. My guess is that he appeals to the same people who like "Withnail and I". It is rewritten, but until the end, luvvie-ish air penetrates into it, and Bernard Black is simply less Withnail camp. And I thought it was obvious before Dylan Moran became a writer. But setting raidiates such a comical potential that for the first 2 episodes I didn't even notice that it wasn't in the slightest bit-worthy. Things That Say / Do * Should * Be Funny, But Somehow They Fail To Register As More Than Slightly Fun Or "I See How Someone Who Thought That Could Do It it was funny ". I try to say that the situations / notes are slightly funny and yet too mundane / subtle / self-confident that are worth creating and displaying in a sitcom. Life is too short. Avoid.
