I have no interest in seeing another horrible film that completely lacks something new, creative or funny, abusing National Lampoon. How did I get caught in the cast of this movie? I see the name Danielle Fishel I am a big fan of the boy who meets the world! But movies are terrible. As a fan, I am not rewarded by seeing her horrible bare chest movies. So this is my question. Has anyone seen this movie? And if yes Does Danielle Fishel naked in her? It would save me 2 hours of life I would never go back watching this horrible movie. Thanks a lot
