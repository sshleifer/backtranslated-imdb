I am not surprised to find user comments on this film full of miraculous nonsense, such as the fact that this film "proves that when it is destined, love finds its way. I will start in this way, not criticizing a particular reviewer, but because this quote typifies a hyperbolic, uncritical betrayal that has been spilled over this film before it hit the theaters. Even the best of the films "nothing" does not prove or intend. The best movies entertain and move the viewer, and "The English Patient" fails on both criteria. I remember how the studio promotes "The English Patient" very clearly: "From producers" Amadeus "and" One flew over the cuckoo's nest, "it magnificently announced. An ignorant or careless listener could in this shameful statement, to miss the keyword "producers" and mistakenly associate the director of an "English patient", so very badly, with a really big director, Milo≈° Forman, which is offensive to remember Mr. Forman. <br /> <br /> While the novel Michael Ondaatje, on which the film was based, is good, it is unfortunate that the film could not capture any quality of the book, and in addition to graphic elements that appear to be just the same, the film bears little resemblance to the novel. <br /> <br /> Despite the doubts that began when I heard that this blatantly misleading promotion, I went to see this movie in the theater. The novel's spells failed that the actors knew their words, but not their characters, and that their characters were flat, boring and unwavering. The film was the full entertainment of Ondaatje's novel and the ever-emerging worst-description film artifact. Those who penetrate this film are very willing to speak with adjectives like "sweeping" and "big" and "hypnotic". It's none of this. In fact, Ondaat's gentle novel could not be described as "sweeping" or "big". It could be described as "magical" and "hypnotic" - yet it is precisely the characteristics that the film could not deliver. It is almost as if Minghella, as a reader, completely left out what was valuable in the novel and could only project a pale, skeletal version on the nipple, a version that not only omitted the story spirit but focused on bad characters. He made a film transliteration that not only respected the metaphor of the story, but even the apparent knowledge of it. Minghella concentrated on Hana and Kip and concentrated on the patient and Katherine. Clifton, thus lacking the narrative footprint of the novel, as well as its "essence". Ralph Fiennes and Kristen Scott Thomas embarked on steadfast, uninspiring, non-invasive, unemployed performances that were apparently meant to be a big, driving, passionate love affair with the viewer, who in fact only brought inexplicable, perfect connections between two flat, shallow, uninteresting adulterers. Both actors are both physically and emotionally inadequate and insensitive, and neither of the performances gave the viewer a great emotional response, apparently intended by Minghell's grandiose and crowded presentation. There are no qualities that many unintelligible reviewers like to refer to this goofy movie. A comparison with David Lean ("Dr. Zhivago") positively offends one big director. Take, for example, the "Patient" sandstorm scene, which is undoubtedly such that "big, large" qualities are considered to be (or should be) resident: a sandstorm is not great - it is not even convincing. The subsequent burying of the characters in the car and their emergence after the storm, which was no doubt affecting the viewer dramatically and emotionally, completely lacked drama or emotion - in fact, because it was so obviously weak, it had air comedy about where comedy was clearly out of place. <br /> <br /> This movie has failed. It failed as a rendition of the novel, and it failed as a film. It appears to have been an "anointed Oscar vehicle" of the year (a link such an over-trumpeted film slosh as "Kramer vs. Kramer" or "Terms of Affection"). One can only thank God that the hype-led acadamia <br /> <br /> had a good sense of presenting the best actress Frances McDormand for her well-deserved performance in the truly superb film "Fargo". There was not a single performance in the executable "English Patient", which was neither embarrassingly excessive acting (Willem Dafoe), nor truly forgotten, average acting (Fiennes and Scott Thomas). Why this non-film page retains the fanatical (and unequivocally tasteless) liking of devotees who remain a mystery. Fortunately, these sands of time will bury this film's clarity permanently, and fortunately it will not have the strength to dig itself.
