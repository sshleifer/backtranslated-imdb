There is not enough room to explain the many ways this film is disappointing. Silly special effects and incomprehensible conspiracies are the least problems of this film. The film seems to have been conceived in the mid-1980s, and was only steamed until it could finally be made in the early 1990s. A "mullet" hero (complete with a three-day beard in the trendy "Miami Vice" style), a beast's slamming on Ronald Reagan, would be fun if he didn't take it so seriously. As it is, the film is just pathetic. In fact, I am sorry for the poor actresses who unnecessarily lost their subtle nude scenes in this horrible movie.
