This film fails in every count. For starters, it's pretentious, trying to be "significant" and failing. The script was banal in the extreme, nobody ever said anything remotely interesting. It was impossible to take care of any character. The Knight was a waste of time, while Sienna Miller was just a waste of time. A little about the soldier who went to war was a cliché before he was used by the film Repentance. The use of World War II as a background was in itself a cliché ... bombs, hiding in tube stations, etc., which were used to import a little much needed drama. Why someone thought for a moment that this film was worth doing is beyond my comprehension. It was yet another case of "let's make the costumes look authentic, don't mind the story, the script or the acting!"
