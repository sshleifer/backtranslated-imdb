Danny Lee's performance as a wisecracking cop is the only place of interest in this film, although it has an excellent cast including Chow Yun-Fat, Carina Lau, Andy Lau, Shing Fui-On and Alex Man. CYF plays the triad chief who wants to settle for peace and plenty, but Alex Man, the total psycho who has a big grudge against CYF, won't let him. CYF is trying to escape to Malacca, but to no avail. After his family is inflated, his dead or dead, injured and broken, CYF returns to Hong Kong to get some serious revenge. It sounds much better than it is. CYF is well dressed and handsome, looks painful, grimaces and cries at allusions, but it doesn't matter to you in some way. Andy Lau looks great, but that's about it. Carina Lau has a small, tiny little amount that was nice, but soon she gets such a bullet in her head that it ends. Alex Man is a cartoon villain he is so over-the-top that at times can be interesting, but writing here is so flat that he just meets as a garden-variety nut. Danny Lee is great though - just a little fluctuation on the screen of this dark (literally) and essentially boring movie is too bad. <br /> <br /> Rent it, don't buy it. Or just skip it completely. This is a sequel to "Rich and Famous", although it was probably shot simultaneously; it was released first because CYF's boxoffice power.
