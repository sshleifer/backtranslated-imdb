It's not as bad as some people say ... This is the unofficial film Bond and the remake of "Thunderball" written by Kevin McClory (co-producer in "Thunderball"). Cast is very interesting, Maria Brandauer is a great Bond-villain, Kim Basinger and Barbara Carrera are just like the "original" Bond girls, plus Rowan Atkinson and a really great Edward Fox who looks really refreshing in Role "M". In fact, the whole film is refreshing and giving new impulses. Sean Connery makes it even more confident and charming, except she looks a little too old. But all right, it's the original Bond and it was great to see him once again in this role. Places are also typical - Bahamas, France, etc. The only thing that really fails is the music score, the song "Never Say Never" is O.K., but the thematic song is missing. All in one, a nice try to make a difference from comic and stupid Roger Moore movies like "Moonraker". Only if there was another story, "Thunderball" was an excellent movie and did not really need a remake
