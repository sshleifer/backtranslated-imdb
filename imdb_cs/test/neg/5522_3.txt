"Happy Days" has been produced and broadcast since the mid-1970s to the early 1980s and seems to be getting ridiculous with age. At the time of his broadcast, most viewers who grew up in the 1950s were middle-aged with families, and scenes at Mel's Diner probably brought artificial nostalgia to them. Of course, Fonz was the coolest of the best (though actor Henry Wrinkler had never learned to ride a motorcycle to this day). Richie Cunningham was an all-American blond boy who would probably be elected president of the student body. Potsie was Richie's best friend - the star of the show must have the best friend, I think. And Ralph Malph was a wandering sidekick to Fonz, if not the whole group. I loved it when Fonz beat Ralph Malph on the poor. And there was Mel, a middle-aged man driving Mel's Diner. And of course, who could forget the look of Mork? Was it really the 1950s? Ironically, films made during the 1950s, such as "Rebel Without a Cause" and "Wild", have improved with age and portrayed the season more frankly than this show, which was made 20 years after the period it shows. Unfortunately, the TV show "Happy Days" is not in the same league as "Rebel Without a Cause" or "American Graffitti". "Happy Days" can capture some aspects of the fifties with their burger, juke boxes, cool cars and sticky plaid shirts, but it's more of a nostalgic idealism that happens just for laughter, rather than for honest views. "American Graffiti" had something to say about young Americans in the 1950s, while "Happy Days" seemed more about what middle-aged people wanted in the 1970s. The result was a kind of watering that had nothing to do with the 1950s. "Happy Days" is at best a comedy-fantasy case with some of the fifties' artificial culture as its background. As another reviewer pointed out, American boy Richie Cunningham would probably have been punished for associating with friends such as Fonzie. And Mel would probably forbid Fonzio to enter his Diner. Fast History: "Happy Days" was originally a "Love in the Happy Days" pilot who was refused to broadcast. Comedy pilots who had themes about sex and romance that did not that to a broadcast pilot sometimes appeared on a rarely air show "Love American Style" which was often aired on the site of baseball games that rained out or other unexpected programming cancellation and / or t changes. In short, "Love American Style" was a show-away show that featured all of these comedic episodes that never made it into the debut. "Love in Happy Days" appeared as a "Love American Style" show sometime in the early 1970s, but at that time television managers could not predict how the show of the fifties young people would be popular, especially during the hey-day of the day. comedy shows concentration around middle-aged people, such as "Mary Tyler Moore Show" (and its subsequent spin-offs such "Rhoda"), "Bob Newhart Show", and "All in the Family". (How things have changed because most TV sitcoms are about young people and the industry will avoid most shows about middle-aged people like the plague!) Subsequently, one of the young stars of "Love in Happy Days" "The Andy Griffith Show" by Ron Howard was given the chance to play in a 1959 "American Graffitti" film about young people directed by relatively unknown George Lucas whose previous "THX 1138" Bombed Miserably at the box office. "Although the premiere of the film managers premiered, the studios could not see how the film about young people in the fifties became popular because it did not" fit "with what was popular in the past, even though they did not realize it. most of the viewers were young in the 1950s, and as everyone knows, the film was a huge hit, and the studio's management recognized that they had completely misjudged their audience. "Graffitti", television leaders realized that they had a comedy pilot in their vault, much like "American Graffitti". They brought it with the original cast, plus Henry Wrinkler as "Fonz", re-titled it "Happy Days" and the rest is the history of television as it became one of the most popular shows of the 1970s. "Happy Days" now seems ridiculous. The characters are flat and cardboard, never more or less than they are superficial. The problems they deal with are trivial. And their reactions seem mindless and even stupid. Nowadays, the character of Fonz seems to be cartoon, well, Fonz. Was it thought to be a parody of the character of Marlon Brand in "The Wild One"? Looking at the show with the fresh eyes, I feel that the manufacturers have really missed a great opportunity to introduce the fifties and realism of the fifties that could be fun and fun. Instead, manufacturers chose cheap laughs for quick money. This is definitely a show that has not resisted the test of time. "American Graffitti" has many external appearances of "Happy Days" but it had the advantage. She had honesty about the characters and their problems. "Happy Days" took the look of "American Graffitti," but he couldn't catch his heart.
