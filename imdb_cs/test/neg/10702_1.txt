All I have ever heard when I was raised was gender equality, and here we have a film that not only illustrates the imbalance, but continues the whole concept that one sex is better. All the while I watched that I hoped this redeeming quality would feel to the viewer as if there was hope for the future, and it wasn't. I admit that I did not finish the film, I had to turn it off in the part where the old man whore told the genetic man Adam that it was okay to be a whore and get in, and quote: "More tail than any man in the past. I know that failure to finish is a bad judgment to me, but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to create a story that will interest the viewer and fail. This film reveals all the true feminine qualities of the quality of the parent character and the need for balance. Instead, it is an example of what America would run lesbian, and I am not against lesbians. Thank you, Director! Someone please give me a redeeming quality ... wait till I have it! There is no sequel!
