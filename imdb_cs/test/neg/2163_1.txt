The Cyber ​​Zone, as this DVD was sold in Oz, is about the worst B-Grade junk I saw. In addition to the solidified plot from Singer, which suggested that he knew how bad the film would be, the other actors are swinging about the real line delivery attempts (Swanson and Quarry) or the absurd imitations of classic movie scenes. Mathius Hues portrays the most dying portrait of Jim Carrey's dying mask. All this without real fiber, which would suggest an attempt to spoof by genre, period, or any common vein, is simply unpleasant. Don't even try to connect the points with the chart. It's Blade Runner, gently camouflaged without content, actors or scenery due to a very limited budget. "You get what you pay for" is never more obvious. There is a repeatedly annoying re-use of a limited set, with no attention to dressing settings and spewing special effects that would hit the floor of a cutting room for Dr Who in 1976. The explosion helicopter is worth rewinding to demonstrate my point. Of course there are masochists who are going to make this trip, but if you're looking at this movie for a bet, make sure you get more than your salary. At $ 2 this DVD will make a cheap and interesting beer coaster.
