Dear Mr. Seitzman, or who can be held accountable for Mr. Seitzman, who has not met his rightful fate of eating alive, for the angry werewolf; for everything you know, you give charities and help old ladies cross the street. But I have to insist that you never write another script for the common good while you live. Place your pen, step away from your laptop! <br /> <br /> If you refuse to defend your wounded brains, I have watched a movie or two in my life and I believe that my advisor will help you: <br /> <br /> teenage boys name parts of their girlfriend's body after American states. If you have to emulate such a scene, please do not include "New York" and "New Jersey" breasts; causes unnecessary speculation about which cities are taking up nipples. It is also almost incomprehensibly stupid and uncomfortable. 2. Don't rely solely on John Hughes movies to strengthen the class honors. 3. Don't let the viewer overcome his exhausted clich√©s. Yes, yes, Kelley and Sam stand out in the rain and clear them of their worries. We understand it. Yes, roses still bloom in the Kelley's dead mother's greenhouse, though every other plant has started rotting. Is The Symbol Of Their Love. It is also very painful when trauma is applied by the blunt force of the back of our heads. For the love of God, Mr. Seitzman, we'll get it. We all got it all over the country. Amish people, deaf, unborn babies - they all get it. 4. Don't require actors to perform mime sequences. At all. No never. 5. Did I mention that you should calm down on the trivial symbolism? Because viewers can draw a parallel between rebuilding a restaurant and building a relationship between Kelley and Sam without help. Really. We're getting it. <br /> <br /> 6. Review your script and discard the following lines and all the lines are: "I don't know what we are." "I do not want to lose you." "It's just like the others!" (And its consequence: "Dad, you don't even know him!") \ T7. Yes, yes, she's in heaven, running around in the field. We're getting it. 8. And in other newspapers we get it. I've seen dozens of horrible movies in my life; I never expected to suffer for your art, and I just left the theater, but the elephant with the words "DOOMED LOVE" painted on his side fell from the sky and pinned me in place. When closing, biting, writing you owe me ten dollars and I hate you.
