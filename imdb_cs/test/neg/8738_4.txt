MAIN PLAN: Prepare the winning team for a deadly tournament. One of several martial arts action shots that attempted to capture the taste of the famous "Enter the Dragon" of '73 is South African effort. The villain's fortress is a little different, appearing as a white castle fortress in the middle of the desert from a distance. The thief himself, the baron or the general, is a somewhat perverted version of "Dr. Noo" or Han's form of master villains who have strange flashes to the glorious days of Nazi Germany. On some points, he wears a Nazi uniform. His main ambition in life is to organize an illegal competition / martial arts tournament against his Japanese opponent, expanding their involvement in World War II (my army is better than your army). It sounds stupid and it is, although the design of madness and crazy machisma almost works. The central hero, Steve Chase (Ryan), resembles the white character "Bruce Lee", who has a similarly slim, rigid figure, though apparently not at the same level of martial arts expertise. I thought there was some secret government agent, but apparently not. He and his girlfriends joined the Baron team of fighters, but decided to quit (they thought they were in play). Of course it's not that easy. A strange succession of them escapes through the desert using a broken car with a rigged sail - those desert winds can do wonders for travel, it seems. The kind of plenty of meanders in the 2nd half of the hero joins the team's opponent's criminal and girlfriend's hostage to the villain in the cell, under the threat of rape by an opponent's hero. The most interesting character is Chico, the dwarf who is the helper of the villain; He is loyal to the Baron, but is sympathetic to the hero's difficulty. Much of the fighting uses the hero's ballet skills, with many jumps and slowdowns. FX sound is also amplified and exaggerated to add more blows. There are a few good fights during the tournament towards the top, but none of them really stands out. If you had to choose, I suppose the best part of it is the brutal Muscle-followers of Baron, introduced late in the story (raising the back of the car in one place). You wonder how the hero will take him out at the end because he seems to lose most of his strokes. Acting is very average, descends to the camp to a girlfriend who tends to laugh gratuitously, as if she was high on the grass, though she is very cute. Some of the training scenes are also camping, especially all those boys running through the desert sands. And with such a title, there are surprisingly few real murders. Ryan, like Steve Chase, returned as a traditional agent in the sequel "Kill and Kill Again."
