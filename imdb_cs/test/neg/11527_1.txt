It is true that you can build a model aircraft on a black background and call it science fiction, and that's enough to impress me, so if you are like that, Black Horizon will at least catch you before you look at it. The best part of the movie is when rehash some real shots from the shuttle's launch. The movie plays as a Naked Gun series, spoofing cop dramas with bad clich√©s and bad acting. Unfortunately, I don't think they should be funny, the actors are really made of cardboard, the dialogue really sucks, so they just have to laugh at them and not with them. Turning on a side note, it's rare to see a movie that takes place half in space, half on earth, and doesn't mix the expected aliens and supernatural events. I am really worried about a more realistic drama based on our cosmic efforts.
