Initially, the movie seemed to be doing great, having built character profiles ... the plot seemed to go in the right direction ... but as the movie went on, the director seemed to focus on the wrong kind of stuff. .. or just a lot of it was modified from the movie. Character identities have changed in the film worse. It also seemed to be a very implicit meaning - in other words, they had things in a movie that doesn't seem to fit into the movie itself. And the title ... not where the title fits into the movie ... I assume the title works for previews .... The actors did well with what they had ..... if they had a better director and writer, maybe it would work better. But not. So now it's a terrible new movie on Friday .... My opinion! .... don't waste your time or money.
