I just don't understand why whenever someone makes a show about one of the country's biggest metro areas (Houston, Dallas, Austin / San Antonio, etc.), they show an average person as someone who wears a wranglers / cowboy hat, has drawl interviews, has no sense of fashion, and drives the truck on its way to the "saloon" or its next hunting trip, rodeo, skeet shooting or country music concert. I've never seen a small city cop drive a police car ... anywhere in Texas. The funny thing is that it doesn't happen for artistic reasons or comedy ... they're really serious and I think the average person is too stupid to know the difference. Bad scripts and just as bad playing give up. This show makes goofy shows in the past as Knightrider look like high-brow entertainment. At least Knightrider had a talking car.
