Why was this movie ever made? They destroyed the original Caddyshack with this crap. I was able to watch only half of it and I wasn't allowed once. But at least I didn't pay to see it because it was on t.v. But I will not go back that hour of my life, which I spent watching this horrible mess.Never was the original star of the first, except for Chevy Chase and he probably regrets doing this movie. Dangerfield was in the first but Jackie Mason wasn't funny at all.Jackie Mason is not Rodney Dangerfield. If you want to laugh, watch the first Caddyshack. This movie stinks like a barnyard in july.Avoid at all costs.
