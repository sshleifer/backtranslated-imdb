Don't tell me the movie was fun or a little funny. It was a total disaster and one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Ali G is just funny on the G G Show channel in Channel 4. After watching his performance, all I can say is that he's not created for movies. With Daft's script, or more like a story, there's nothing you can enjoy. This film is full of unpleasant, unreal characters and is a complete waste. At the end of the film, Ali G will perform. He mentioned, if you hated this movie, tell people it's good. Even the speech couldn't save the film, probably knowing it would be smelly. I would like to make it 0/10 but the minimum start is 1. Overall, don't waste time on this waste.
