Code 46 is one of those sci-fi movies where the government controls who you are allowed to love and actually punishes you if you try to spawn with the wrong person. Jews and owners live in completely separate territories, power that can remove your memories, etc. We've seen it before, but that's OK - no movie is 100% original. This kind of assumption is always fun to contemplate. Unfortunately, just imagining such a future is more interesting than actually watching Code 46. Characters are boring and rarely say anything interesting. Maybe it's a comment on a dehumanized future, but it's still boring to watch. It's sloooow. Sometimes the picture is nice, but usually (along with its "evocative" soundtrack) looks just like a glamorous perfume advertisement. Code 46 also sometimes uses a kind of television camera work that I find uncomfortable. You know, two characters speak like a camera carelessly "floats" on one side. Two seconds later she is floating on the other side in a futile attempt to keep her attention. <br /> <br /> My friends liked this movie. If they tried to follow me again, I guess I wouldn't do it if they didn't agree to pay me $ 50.
