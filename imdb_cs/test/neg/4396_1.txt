This has to be one of the biggest mistakes that has ever been ... the script was nice and could end up being much better. The actors should play better and maybe make a little better. Maybe Hollywood should redo this film with little better actors and better directors. The fact that the film is bad is bad. If I had to follow it, it would be like torture. I don't want to spoil everyone's opinion, so ... I advise to watch the movie first .. see if you like it and after the vote (don't vote before you watch it!) And by the way ... Have fun watching it! Don't just peek ... watch it 'end :)))))))) !!
