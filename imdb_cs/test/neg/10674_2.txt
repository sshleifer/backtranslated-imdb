Some people could see it to look at kitschy rubber and pvc dressed bishop vampire killer who kicked some ass. If that's what you want, and you wear a cloak, put your teeth on the points and think the name Lilith Silver is cool, you'll see a fine film. If, like most people, a killer dressed in glowing, creaking rubber with a huge neckline, thick makeup and bad fangs makes you laugh, then it's one of the best comedies you'll see. I laughed so hard that I almost screamed. Ridiculous talk, dialogue and rendering help make it a better spoof than Dracula, Dead and Loving That could be ... <br /> <br /> He's trying to be cool and goth, and all he can do is make every scene cheerful. Even on the lesbian scene it's funny (how did it make those shoes get so fast? They were stuck on * here * ...) <br /> <br /> I don't see it if you like good movies. See if you like horrible movies and you want to laugh until you fall ... That's not good, it's just bad.
