I read positive comments on this movie. I suppose the people who were in this movie had to come to this site to give her a good press because it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I watch the film despite the quality or lack of it, which explains why I watched this whole movie, but I don't think I laughed again during this movie. The jokes were mostly very bad, but when the jokes had a promise, the van was gone. If you liked it, maybe you should release the buds because you have to keep the 5 or 6 brain cells you left. This film had a bad script, bad acting, poor direction, a weak plot ... nothing of virtue and wasn't funny. If you haven't seen this movie, no.
