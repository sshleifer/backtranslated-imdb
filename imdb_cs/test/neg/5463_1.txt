First, the title has no meaning for the film. It started well with good progress, but it bothered him when he couldn't tell his girlfriend what had happened to him. Even his attempt to tell the police failed, which only added to the anger. There were too many pregnant breaks in the movie that looked more like a fill than anything worth it. The plot never revealed who did this crime to him though a good plot would allow revelation. The end was nothing short of "hey, we ran out of budget let's stop here NOW!" ... If I wrote a novel that ended in this way, I'd be up alone. TRASH TRASH TRASH !!
