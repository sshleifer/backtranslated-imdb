First Watched 10/29/2006 - 4 of 10 (Dir-John Stephenson): Slightly entertaining story of a group of five children who are forced to live with their eccentric uncle while their father and mother fight and work in World War I. England entered the war. They say they don't go to the uncle's greenhouse, which they do, of course, over and over, and discover the sandy fairy that wishes them every day, which lasts until sunset. This is "IT" referred to in the title, created by Jim Henson's band and voiced by Eddie Izzard. The problem is that their wishes usually bring other problems to learn from. This part of the film is not doing very well because it is clear that the children, especially the Freddie Highmore character, have not learned from them, but instead they are still returning to "the" to solve their next big problem. "IT" is not nearly as funny as it could be with comedian Eddie Izzard really didn't give much opportunity to improvise and Kenneth Branagh is wasted as an eccentric uncle, though he is the best character. Children are all right in terms of their acting skills, but the story would be much better if they got into the realm of fantasy, but they also had a human story that probably caused confusion with the filmmakers. Overall, it was OK, but it could have been much better.
