I have always loved an account because of its big screenplay and characters, but lately I feel like it has turned into an emotional type of soap. If you look at promotional pictures / bill posters, you will see either of the two cops hugging / kissing, or something to do with friendship, while promotional pictures of the law long ago would have something to do with crime. This proves that much has changed from an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of TV soap. When I watch, I feel like I'm watching a police version of Coronation Street or something like that. I have to say that I still like the account because I'm interested in police work and that kind of stuff, but I really miss the size Bill had. I want to rate it as 2 out of 10 because you have to admit that it was totally destroyed by the people who crossed the account. <br /> <br /> As for the script and the characters that both left, most of the big characters are gone (though I still think they are few) and I'm not saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely they are not, it is just that they lack the hard looks, personalities and lines of scripts that all the old characters used to be, because most of them are currently involved in stupid relationships and family problems. Overall, he is one of the only police programs on TV. It will always be a badly interesting thing to look at, but as I say, it has lost a lot of its uniqueness (if it is spelling) and now it would be classified as a horrible, unrealistic TV soap. It is recommended to watch a good laugh over the stupidity of the cops involved - 2/10
