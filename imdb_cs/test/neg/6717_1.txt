I think this film was created backwards, first shooting a lot of scenes and actions and explosions, and then the writers tried to find a story that would bring all the scenes together. This movie is undoubtedly the worst movie I've ever seen, your average porn movie comes with a much better written and much more coherent scenario. The film doesn't make sense. Seriously, even if you're a Segala fan, there's no reason you should see this movie except you're one of those people who like to stare at accidents because it's a terrible accident and should never be released. in this world. Boran.
