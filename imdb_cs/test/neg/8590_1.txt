I just got back from "AGS". After seeing it, I am convinced that no matter how much it is written, as the film extensively researched, Stone NEVER watched the NFL play in his life. Great cinematography? Give me a break. The game's monster was almost incomprehensible and 90% of the other shots in the movie were close up. Was there something in this movie that wasn't raised in "North Dallas Forty"? Aging Player ... Control. Young hot shot .... check. Painkillers .... control. The owner who does not "get" .... check. Crazy off-field behavior .... check <br /> <br /> It's also a playoff in Dallas (ie Dec or Jan) in the outdoor stadium, but people who sit there in dances and shorts! And what about those lights? Did they play at the Japanese Kabuki Theater or at the Sports Stadium? And the strategy shown in the game was ridiculous. It's the fourth & 1 inside the "Sharks" "30. Dallas leads 35-31. KICK THE FRIGGING FIELD GOAL. Hell, tie game w / extra point and Stone could make it even 3 hours with overtime. <br /> <br /> Were lame montage "old" footballers had to be a tribute to the game? And the scenario ... ugh. More clich√© than you can shake your wand on .. oops, there's another one. <br /> 1/10. <br /> <br /> Jump at all costs <br /> <br />
