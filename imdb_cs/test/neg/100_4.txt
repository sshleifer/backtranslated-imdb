I was looking forward to this movie. Trusted actors, interesting plot. Great atmosphere then ????? IF you try something that is intended to contain the meaning of life. First. They know that. OK I didn't expect the directors or writers to really know the meaning, but I thought they could offer crumbs to steal them and treat them to add fuel to the fire - Which! they almost did it. Things I didn't get. Woman wandering in dark places and lonely parking alone - neglectful of consequences. Big puzzles that fell on the shoulder. The promise of the supply of knowledge contained in the original so-called Criminal. I had no problem with the budget and enjoyed the tension. I understood and I can find the wax lyrically about a fool and found that the role of Adrian Pauls is essential and penetrating and then ????? Basically the story and the script where it was good to the point and that point was the last 10 minutes. What? Ideas are running out! Such a pity that this film had to let us go so badly. It doesn't have to understand the meaning, and I really didn't expect the writers to understand it, but I was hoping for an intellectual, if not spiritual, ride and hit the road.
