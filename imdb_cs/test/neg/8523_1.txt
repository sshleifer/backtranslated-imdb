Spoiler with Explanation of Conspiracy: A poor family is thrown in the middle of a war between a bad guy (who emerges from nothing, and no questions ...) who went wacko, and Casper's friendly ghost tries to avenge his death. With each frame the film gets more and more predictable, a big disappointment. The end of the seam absolutely stupid, it has nothing to do with the film itself, I think someone runs out of ideas, or just getting to the point that the film is ** t this way or the other, so it can also have a stupid ending. Wasting time, resources and money. The game is very bad. If you are thinking about dialogue, you may find that family conflict is artificially enforced by poor communication between characters. Some seam scenes randomly. In short: boring, predictable, poor, pathetic. Wasting time and money.
