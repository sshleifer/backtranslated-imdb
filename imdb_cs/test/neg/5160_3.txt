I should have realized that this was a sign of what was going to happen when this trailer bored me. <br /> <br /> When I noticed a few "indie" movies about the power of reviews on this site and then found out that my view was totally opposite to the other reviewers, I started to wonder if it was possible. from these people, or are they perhaps friends / family etc. of filmmakers trying to "enlarge" their work? Hmmm. Are you interested in seeing the amateur honors Pulp Fiction and 11:14, except playing with worse actors, stupid scores (undermining different scenes) and incredible jumps in logic? If not, skip this movie. Here's my open letter to two players in this movie. Alfonso Morgan, please, please, please stop trying 'to be' Samuel L Jackon la Pulp Fiction. No one can do what he does, just like him. <br /> <br /> Director, please come with something original. It's some rude service to brag about this intention to pretend to be Quentin Tarantino. Just desperate, and I really don't see how anyone could say it, it's a good movie. It's a shame that people somehow managed to give a score of 8.5 on it, as well as movies like Pulp fiction or Goodfellas. There is no near these films; 4 or 5 would be a more reasonable average rating, I give it 3.
