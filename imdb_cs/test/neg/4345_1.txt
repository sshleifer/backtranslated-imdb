Producers of this film should be sued for distorting copyrighted material, namely the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Players' Guide. Fear and ignorance float a kind of thoughtless propaganda that inspires garbage like this film. If any of you have any doubts about the Dungeons & Dragons innocence, why don't you go to a local hobby store and see that you can meet a gaming group so you can see that D&D has nothing to worry about. .
