A plane carrying a rich scientist's daughter falls in a dense wilderness. He sets up a group to find her and the others, but the rescue group soon suspects that something is haunting them. Then the side motifs for the expedition are revealed and this only contributes to the already existing tension. The film is a decent idea and the takeover of the popular legend Sasquatch was completed on the film sooner or later. . However, the direction of the film breaks the basic rule of horror / thriller overhead and it shows too early. Of course, viewers know that there is something to chase characters, read the title! But showing what was to be a movie kicker it soon only destroys most of the tension and, as a direct result, much fun. The film also lacks a good atmosphere and almost no landscape shots that show the vast wilderness, but lots of monster shots that don't add anything. In fact, they were helplessly knocked 'Predator'. The low-budget horror movie 'Wendigo' did what this film tries to do much better. Some of the tensions and non-cliches end up in order to make this rise above a bullshit, but it is still poor and given the prospect and potential it is very disappointing. --- 4/10 <br /> <br /> Rated R for some violence and profanity, but it's pretty tame compared to most R-rated horror movies.
