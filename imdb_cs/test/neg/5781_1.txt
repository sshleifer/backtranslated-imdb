You are very afraid of anyone who likes this film. They probably inhaled too many colored chips as a child. It's so terrible that I refuse to relive the conspiracy. Yeah, there was no one! This film is a true definition of what Hollywood creates for people who don't want to think about theater. Will bad guys win? Will good guys win? Who cares!
