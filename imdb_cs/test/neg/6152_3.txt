The film has so much potential that has not been developed. Mark Hamill gives a good performance as well as Bill Paxton. The landscape is beautiful and ultralight planes are elegant. The problem with this movie is that the story is so little developed and the story goes nowhere. The movie is almost asleep at certain points. I'll make it 3 out of 10 stars for flying scenes.
