There is no doubt that in one benefit that this movie is a stupid and unfair joke, but tell the truth it is quite fun (if you are the first viewer and trying to analyze anything) Throughout the movie they have very good ideas but poorly written . The story of two losers who woke up and found that they didn't remember what had happened to them the previous day. Just to learn later that they were after angry twins, aliens, transsexual strippers, aliens, and some gangs. Isn't it like The Bourne Identity? Yeah, I know - how can I compare two movies, but what the hell? They both have no memories; people were after them and so on. Anyway, the movie is stupid and it's just for the viewer who likes a stupid movie. The reason to watch: · A lot of young talented actors, · Very stupid (after all you know it's a stupid movie, why not make it extreme) <br /> <br /> The reason is not: · If you want to analyze, then forget about it, · Talented young actors get spoiled, · Good fruit really bad <br /> <br /> Rating: 4/10 (Grade: E +) <br /> <br /> ------------ ------------ ---------- ---------- ------ --- --------- ---- <br /> <br /> 'Dude Where's My Car' - await what you expect from Ashton Kutcher. I think almost everybody got the same answer to this guy - 'really stupid movie'. Besides being a '70s', this guy really has nothing to offer to his fan. (He should thank the show for his reputation). 'Dude Where's My Car' is one of his trademark-'grades'. His film is even worst than Adam Sandler's films (you can imagine). The film is really nonsensical, no story and nothing. Mara Sokoloff, Jennifer Garner, Alison Sweeney and S. Wcock should not waste unnecessarily their talent for this waste. They even came up with 'Seriously, Dude Where's My Car'. This shows how film companies die from making money rather than quality. Max: 4/10 <br /> <br /> Recommendation: Rent it from your friends or forget it
