Although inevitably related to the decade of the 1970s, the term "cinematography" is actually almost as old as the cinema itself. In addition, Universal Studios practically invented the term with their long running monster cycles of Dracula, Frankenstein, Wolf Man and Mom. Each original classic gave birth to several sequels, at least, and even after a while they even invented the idea that they should make a real monster! The "Frankenstein House", released a year earlier and also directed by Erle C. Kenton, was a quite successful attempt with interesting enthusiastic ideas and performances, but "House of Dracula" is a bit too lengthy for me to recommend. The story suffers too much from the extremely irritating "random" situations, violent twists and dialogues and? most ?? too short a time to process the monster personalities they deserve. Onslow Stevens does not receive top billing but plays the most basic role as a miracle doctor who is asked to cure Count Dracula (Carradine) of his uncontrollable thirst for blood and correct Lawrence Talbot's disease by mutating to a furry wolf whenever the moon is full. During a night walk in some caves, they also pick up the remains of Frankenstein's monster, and the good doctor himself will eventually undergo Jekyll / Hyde metamorphosis due to poor blood transfusion. The last invitation to a messy party is a female hunchback (though not from Notre Dame). Something is very bad when you watch a movie that is literally filled with horror icons, but the only character in the whole movie who can scare you is an ordinary villager who goes by the name of Siegfried. The real monsters are boring and their once-fabulous backgrounds are exhausted. Count Dracula is a whining romantic, Talbot is sad and also a whining old martyr and Frankenstein's work? Well, his conspiracy is not worth mentioning. In this versatile film there is a serious lack of setting the atmosphere and handy photography, especially when compared to all other efforts and a sudden culmination is a disaster.
