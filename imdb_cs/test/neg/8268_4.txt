You just need to see it as a poorly executed propaganda against abortion and you realize how bad it really is. The main message of this film is that even the poorest of the people cannot commit an abortion. If you ask that it's not far from being fired at an abortion clinic. So this guy wants to kill some poor girl, but he has to convince her to make her first abortion. What a bullshit. And the worst part is that she has a convincing argument (bringing the child into a love-free environment), but that should be released because he's just as mad. And that part with bible pushers ... first throw this girl just because she explains someone stole her money (that rule must be in the Bible somewhere) and then in the end there are some kind of angel as deus ex machina delivering the killer from evil that bothered him in his front yard. Come on. Other downpoints include a very confusing scenario (and I don't think in a good way) ... so this guy is just some psycho why? Because his mother once fed the liver? And I don't know about you, but it seemed to be the most beautiful man in the world for the whole move! even when he was wearing girls' clothes, he stole money and recorded girls in his car. If you've forgotten an idiot story, this movie has really great cinematography and Bob Hoskins was really great and has one of those funny little English cars in it. If it was actually a psycho killer, I'd give it at least 7.
