How Do I Sit After Watching Wong Kar-wai in 1994 Ashes of Time ??? more precisely, 2008 re-edit and re-release with the word 'Redux' slapped at the end of the title ?? I wonder what went wrong. I wonder why the movie didn't work at all. I wonder why the movie failed to get any significant points in my book. Especially what it was about the movie that dragged him down and made him the director's worst movie of his career? Well it's not too hard to figure out. Let me just say that it is really a pity that Kar-wai went so suddenly through this hellish hole of mediocrity and poverty into moviedom, especially given the fact that in the same year Chungking Express, one of his permanent references, released a noble film. Tak ?? what went wrong? It would be worth considering the Ashes of Time as a somewhat experimental film. Our director basically puts his own inimitable style of filmmaking and puts it in a completely different environment, mood and atmosphere; what results is a catastrophic film that is everywhere and simply does not work. Therefore, it would be even wiser to call the Ashes of Time a failed experiment. Bold, bold and innovative, but unsuccessful. <br /> <br /> Let me work it out. Those who have seen the films of Mr. Kar-wai, a Hong Kong film writer who has become known in the art world since his debut in the late 1980s, will know that there is a predominant aesthetic that binds all his films; Basically and frankly, they are all colorful, provocative, welcoming, subtly humorous and meaningful evocations of life, love and loss. The same formula is converted to Ashes of Time; however, the regular setting of Hong Kong is ridden, and in its place we have placed into the settings of ancient China, and the land of legendary martial arts fighters and klansmen. Intertwined into this quasi-adventure / historic capers is a typical Kar-wai love story, this time involving an elegic hit-man who moved to the middle of the desert, and carries out contract killings. But I have to stop there; character description is a useless thing. Why? Because not a single character in Ashes of Time is worth mentioning or anything. What is a bland cast and what a waste of talent (the Ashes of Time case contains almost all of Kar-wai's regular associates). Not only that, but the film is basically an endless constant stir. horrible, almost non-existent narrative structure. One of the main reasons why the Ashes of Time critic is berate is that he seems to have no conspiracy, let alone the appearance or hint of one. You can definitely see what they get, even from the first two, three minutes, maybe even less of a movie. Maybe it's just an atypical environment of ancient China, which is unusual and inappropriate for Kar-wai's typical film style. I'd like to think, however unfortunate, that Mr. Kar-wai just stuffed great time here. One thing a reviewer can actually compliment in the Ashes of Time, although the compliment is strictly isolated, is another trademark? beautiful, colorful and blissful aesthetics. What joyful color is on the screen, what wonderful textures are painted for us, and what the breathtaking landscapes and pictures capture for us throughout the film. At least we can take it as a sign that Wong Kar-wai is still in the heart, and it's just a movie that's so atypical and burying its usually commendable nuances. Though the visuals were not enough to release Kar-wai for this disastrous project, was it enough for the film to be worth it? and at least we're not going out of the movie in absolutely absolutely moody mood, now that there's something we can think of. Basically, the film is a "wuxia art" film that follows the style of, say, the legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa. One thing, however, distinguishes the Kar-wai film from Kurosawa's best, and it is all put together in Japanese director's films and just works. There seems to be nothing in the Ashes of Time. Karwai's attempt to make a really deep wuxia film, let alone an intellectual and provocative film in general, is a futile effort. Kar-wai says that for the Ashes of Time to run out of it, it took time to clear his head. Must it be a tedious effort to his advantage, because his efforts are embodied in the film and transferred directly to us? I mean, just watching the film is an exhausting effort, and now I need time to clear my mind about this unpleasant film experience.
