Just in case the title does not - this film is garbage. <br /> <br /> Short overview? Yeah. I decided to spend so much time writing this review because Hollywood decided to put it in the script. I doubt it will be published with regard to how badly I formulated everything, but if it is and someone reads it - sticking to worshiping the first Sandlot movie. In each individual case, he completely overcomes his predecessors. The sequel is not always worth buying or seeing, and anyone involved in their production should be ashamed of destroying what must be one of the most classic, original films of our childhood.
