Terrible playing, terrible scenario, completely unrealistic. Bumblebee Flies In any case, it illustrates clich√© and sentimentalism that film studios love to withdraw the viewer's throat. Elijah Wood is unimaginably bad in the primary role, and plot points are created and sappy. Cook's and Wood's relationship is at best ridiculous. But the worst element of Bumblebee is the scenario. This is one of the most nasty bad dialogues I've ever had when I heard the disaster. Bumblebees, crawling in my ears and chopping eardrums, would rather hear Elijah Wood spat out pseudo-deep lines robotically. I wish there was a "Bumblebee Project" on me, so I couldn't remember this smelly.
