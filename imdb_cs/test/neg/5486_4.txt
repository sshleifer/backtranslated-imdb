Now I have seen some of Pedro Almodóvar's movies, but that would have been the most disappointing to date. This film seemed to lack neglect, which is usually everywhere in his films, and that story never interested me. Many Almodóvars appear in this film, so it's not like the lack of talent on the screen, but this movie seemed more serious than his films. If this movie was comic, I wouldn't be able to find it and it was one surprisingly weak film.
