It is unbearable at the tip. Somehow, I was just slightly biased, but it was because I really wanted to know what a "secret" (which I should say, it's pretty damn obvious) or because I was hoping Scarlett Johansson would dress up sexy clothes? This film is poor and, moreover, it's a shame for all the lonely, alcoholic professors of southern literature out there. Travolta wants his Oscar to be so bad that he's willing to get drunk in the bathroom after urinating blood. Sorry, buddy. . You were more believable to be "Stay alive". Not everyone can pull Peter Fund into "Ulee's Gold." If you want an anti-proud anti-hero Oscar, you must, um, actually act. . .only on the screen. Stop that director before he / she (the name is vague on sex) directs again!
