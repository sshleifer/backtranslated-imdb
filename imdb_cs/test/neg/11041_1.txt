***** Classic **** Excellent *** Good ** Fair * Tragic <br /> <br /> Reviews: <br /> <br /> Oldboy is not for everyone. It's a pervasive violence, its live octopus, and it's an unimaginable story. The film focuses on a man who has been kidnapped and jailed for 15 years, Oh Dae-Su is released only to find out that he has to find his captor in 5 days. But now the story may seem to boast, but as soon as you look at this bloody and unoriginal blood party, it develops into a slurry of dark blood and a strong film. In any case, they should not be the standards of what the South Korean thriller should be. Oldboys playing the scene are parallel to blunt humor and poorly written script. Oldboy is occasionally featured with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about. <br /> <br /> Verdict: <br /> <br /> Not for everyone but its scope and vision is not clear enough to see more than the gray mist gap. * Tragic
