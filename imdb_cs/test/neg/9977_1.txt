I almost embarrassed to admit that I saw CALIGULA twice. Production problems are almost too numerous to mention. The script is a sub-standard (it's easy to see why Vidal was trying to destroy it). The direction is worse. Most of the film consists of long inter cut shots with close shots scattered with cross sections mostly un-erotic porn (more prevalent apparently in the "uncut" version). Cinematography is particularly subtle, giving the entire production a cheaply washed out appearance that undermines some of the complicated patterns. The film should look much better. The overall concept of placing actors in what would be an easy X-rated movie (Guccione called it "paganography") wears thin after the first hour after Peter O'Toole and John Guilgud exit. Of course, Bob Guccione has made a lot of money for it, but it seems to be a big waste. If you want a much better understanding of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, watch BBC I, CLAUDIUS in the mid-79s, and if you want porn, jeez-louis, look somewhere else.
