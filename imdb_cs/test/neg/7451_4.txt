This movie started great; The first 30 minutes are very funny and clever with some interesting characters. This is good news. The bad news is that the film is too repetitive and then downright stupid. <br /> <br /> What we get to get is Santa Claus with "magic" power with lots of New Age baloney thrown into the mix. It's just ridiculous and barely such a "Christmas movie" I would expect from Jim Varney "Ernest". To be fair, he still had a decent amount of laughter and was headless, but simply not a movie I could recommend.
