A depressing black BLACK comedy about a woman (Mia Farrow) who flees her house on Christmas Eve when she finds out that her husband (Tony Goldwyn) has hired a man who killed her. She ends up with her husband (Scott Glenn and Mary-Louise Parker) and then things go wrong. Basically, Farrow is still running and constantly meets VERY strange people and gets into morbidly unfair situations. This was advertised as a good movie when I saw it around Christmas time in its very short art cinema run. I found out he was sick, incompetent and only depressed. I like black humor, but it was too dark for me. What happens to Parker's character was scary. To make matters worse, Eileen Brennan is later thrown as a nun (!!!) and continues to chew the scenery with the miracle. The only thrift that Farrow's action was - is much better than this deserves. It was also a relief when I saw a talented Stephen Dorff appear in the end. The end itself was nice, but he couldn't erase what had happened before. Sick, morbid, sad black "comedy". A 1
