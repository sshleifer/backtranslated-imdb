This program was displayed in the early morning time slot at SPACE, a science fiction station. I'm impressed that someone will pay for it or send it; is incredibly amateurish. <br /> <br /> The whole show is a series of short monologues or scene scenes that look like a wardrobe with lots of circuit boards glued to the wall. There is very little continuity and no graph between the scenes. A typical scene revolves around some lame wit or special effect and is only a minute or so long. Dialogue doesn't make sense and special effects look like Photoshop filters. Actors are all adults, but I literally saw high school games with better writing and sets. This program is embarrassing. Perhaps every scene would be interstitial; fill between shows instead of ads. Stringing all the scenes together makes the material restrictions extremely obvious.
