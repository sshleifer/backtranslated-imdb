If good intentions made the film great, then this movie could be one of the biggest films ever made. The film has great actors, a director's master, a significant theme - at least a clear theme, the undertone of the fifties of world-wide fatigue aviation scenes to inspire both the senses and imagination, and the characters to think about. care. It's about patriotism and patriotism in a healthy way. Not ten years after the movie, I met Air Force officers who taught my R.O.C.C. class. They were intellectuals. They thought deeply about their work. They have senses of humor. One was a crew member on the first plane to drop a hydrogen bomb. I wondered if any of them died in Vietnam. I imagine missions were flying there. Unfortunately, the movie is failing. The film lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling and celebration of patriotism that underlines the story. No actress was worse in this movie. Her Susan Holland is a woman someone would run away, not a hug. Col. James Stewart (who then as Colonel) is doing a good job in this role as Lt. Col (and later Col.) Dutch Holland. But the most interesting thing to play in the role is bite into a sandwich. I am not joking. Stewart was like biting in sandwiches as well as in the Spirit of St. Louis. One might think of Ted Williams, but not when I watch Mr. Steward's role. I think of William Holden as Lieutenant Harry Brubaker in the Bridges of Toko-Ri. The comparison is not good for Mr. Stewart, who seems unnecessary in this movie. <br /> <br /> B-36 shots look like outtakes from airline ads. Although beautiful, airy shots are mundane. During that time, they could attract viewers. The Greenland accident involves relentless modeling. You expect the result to be good. The undertone - subtext - expresses the boredom for the film that the flight crews of the air force had to feel during their long missions and banality that the air force used to do their business - like any other business. One imagines how director La Nouvelle Vague could explore the subject and then start thinking about how someone with imagination could make this movie. When the crew returned from long missions, crew members were shot scotch and massaged before they met the mission. It turned out it helped. Banality was the image the Air Force wanted and Mr. Mann housed brass. Perhaps, in this sense, the film works, but not for me. I am grieving when I watch a movie because I think all of us, the director, the actors, the crew, the audience and members of the Armed Services may have been looking forward to giving and getting much more than we can get here. I don't think this movie has to be Dr. he never realized it. Still, I enjoy it. I'm thinking of planes on their long missions and ground crews in isolated locations. There is a certain sense of honor celebrating here and I celebrate that honor. Certainly I understand why it is people who appreciate this film and other places. Should there be no intentional error, I would get 10. <br /> <br />.
