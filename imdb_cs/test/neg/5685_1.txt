I have no idea what these people thought when they did this movie. No conspiracy, very limited action and what's with the third person's commentary throughout the movie ???? Instead of running around the planet to shoot at all these places, they should spend some money on screenwriting and actors. What was there was miserable. That was 90 minutes of my life, I will never be able to return. I should charge the director the cost of renting this movie. Director and writers of this movie .... please quit. This film should have a mark on the front that should be careful. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the computer generation. It's OK because generation is. This film should never have a sequel.
