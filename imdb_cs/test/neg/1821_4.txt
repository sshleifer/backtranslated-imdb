Alan Rickman & Emma Thompson performs well with South / New Orleans accents in this detective film. It's worth seeing their scenes and Rickman's scene with Hal Holbrook. It seems that these three actors enjoy having fun regardless of the film. The plot for the film shows potential, but one gets the impression of watching a movie that hasn't been stretched out as well as it could be. The fact that he's overcrowded with an uninteresting subplot and mostly uninteresting kidnappers is really wrong. The film is worthwhile - if nothing more than a fun performance by Rickman, Thompson and Holbrook.
