I thought the sleeping cell was interesting and exciting to watch, until the last episode, when nothing happens, its F ****** BS, you Americans are displaying Muslims as terrorists and Americans as heroes, on the contrary. "I hate it when every American TV show ends predictable, I was hoping the bombs would go away at this stadium, but I knew it wouldn't be, it would be a pleasure to watch it when you know good guys go to save the day, Americans they are again the biggest terrorists who are the leaders of all, is to blame for September 11th, and I am P ***** off that you throw the sticks at us, which are all f ****** the same! I have a good idea of ​​terrorism, its "Whitehorse" and bush cell leader itself, its the same with 24, as ever 24 was good, sleeping cell is fake and never should do season 2, its F * **** prank! and so are American manufacturers.
