Help, I ended up in hell! This is a totally stupid movie. There's nothing good about it. <br /> <br /> Let's spit it out: <br /> <br /> 1) The story is incredibly appealing: the terrorist group against the EU is chasing a lot of boys who drive supplies of transparent xtc-filled pills in Western Europe. And the worst is: they're serious! <br /> <br /> 2) The level of games should give a great shame to all involved faces. 3) Some money guys have decided to let everyone speak English to catch the international market. Worst advertisement ever! French and Dutch native language speaks smart to make everything but sense and the result is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> 4) The soundtrack is totally wrong and wrong. 5) Camera, editing and effects are supposed to be some kind of noir road movie style. , but hardly worth anything and didn't want to accompany this story (read: anti-story). <br /> 6) Hidde Maas. Wildschut is never able to convince the hero. A real actor. I would usually give an extra point just to be around. But no, sorry, not this time, I wouldn't forgive ...
