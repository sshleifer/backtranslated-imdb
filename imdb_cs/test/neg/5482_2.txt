It's 2 stars just because they've done a lot of work to make this game look good. I played a lot of good and bad games and I think this game has the dumbest story I've ever had to listen to. The best thing they can do is to let you skip conversations (but no, you have to listen to them for 10 minutes) and do the same thing over and over again. Climb into the building, save the citizen, go kill some dude. It's all the same! Ubisoft should really hire someone with some imagination. I'm a huge fan of the Prince of Persia series (first 3). The story was good and you wanted to know what was going on all the time. Nor do I hate Prince of Persia 4. But I think anyone who was in charge of developing the story for Assassin's Creed should be banned from writing the next thing for the rest of their lives. Boring Story and Same Mission Again and Again! If only one of these two things were good, the game would be worth playing.
