Well, Killshot isn't terrible, but it's close. The production values ​​are decent and the main actors do a pretty good job (except Rosario Dawson in a wasted role), but the story is just pathetic. I don't know if Elmore Leonard's book is such stupid characters because I haven't read it, but I guess the book should have been a little funny. The film has no discernible humor. After the first twenty minutes you will be screaming at the screen, "Oh, come on! Nobody's so stupid!" In short, without any spoilers, everyone acts in a way that is appropriate for the plot, which makes no sense. A very frustrating and unrealistic movie that can be responsible for sitting on the shelf for as long as he did.
