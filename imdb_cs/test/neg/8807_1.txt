"Hood Rat" is absolutely terrible. This is the urban version of "Willard". I can't believe this movie was made, let alone distributed. Someone at Universal Studios thought people would watch this movie. The only good thing about this is Ice-T as a landlord. He was funny. One thing I hate in movies is an accelerated action. It is bad enough once or twice but WHOLE is like that. Each scene transition is a special fast motion effect. The director should be forbidden to film movies forever. <br /> <br /> Trust me, you'll never see this movie!
