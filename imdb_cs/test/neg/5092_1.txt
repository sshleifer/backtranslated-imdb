Wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ... wait ..... WHAT! This movie is terrible, absolutely awful. 1. The only reason Kiefer Sutherland is on the cover is to sell it to Kiefer fans to break their hearts. He kills one guy, gets shot and dies before half of the movie ends, not to mention that he was only in the first 10 minutes and then disappeared until he died ... WHY put him on the cover if his character BLOWS. 2. Where are EPIC battle scenes promised in the back cover preview? 3. It was too confusing, I mean, what's wrong with the girl? She had to tell the film to get her attention, failed! 4. If Kiefer dies in the movie ..... it fails. Now I'm going to watch 24 ..... THIS FILM FAULTS!
