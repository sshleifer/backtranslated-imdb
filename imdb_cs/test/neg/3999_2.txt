The emotionally uncertain Tom Russo (Asbestos Felt) reads the secret diary of his sexy wife Leez (Courtney Lercara) and is horrified to find that his life's love seems to be sleeping with every guy he meets; this shocking revelation sends the poor Tom out of his rocker and he continues to make a bloody revenge to the men he believes they care for their old lady. <br /> <br /> In my experience, really bad movies can often be as much fun as really good, and no film featuring decapitation from a machete-raised ceiling fan should never be considered totally worthless; but even though Killing Spree can sometimes entertain herself with her ingenuity and cheap and cheerful girl, I found that terrible direction, terrible production values, ugly cinematography, subdued sound, awful lighting, mind insensitive boring and boring narrations (which includes a really stupid twist story That is wired from the start, plus an unnecessary zombie finale), an ugly synthesizer score, an inane dialogue, and thoroughly amateur playing all served to make this effort from writer / director Tom Ritter a virtually clueless experience.
