A horrible, stupid movie dealing with corruption in the Louisiana Buying Lumber Company. Everyone in the Louisiana State seems damaged and awkward. A member of an English college department can only sign his name with X. <br /> <br /> When a straight lace senator (Victor Moore) appears to be investigating, everyone is trying to blame the innocent but stupid Bob Hope character. Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get part of Mary in 1943 "For Whom Bell Tolls"? corrupt officials, along with hope, are trying to show Zorina and Moore's paintings to destroy him politically. Moore takes the restaurant's head offended when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought the reason she was upset was that it was a kosher restaurant. This is the extent of humor, it's an absolute movie mess. When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, James Stewart's takeoff in "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington." In the meantime, the film is too far for a good response. The music and lyrics are terrible. The song praising Louisiana, sung in various ways, is absolutely terrible. Irving Berlin had something to do with the music of this horrible movie?
