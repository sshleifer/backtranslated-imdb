My God, how bad it is. Who is this cheater pretending to be Ali G? Avoid it at all costs. He will replace the intelligent multi-layered satire and humor of his show with toiletry humor. Br /> <br /> One commentator here declares that we do not take into account the film's merits of the show due to the media gap. While it is true that a standard show format could never be transferred to a big screen, Mr. Sacha Baron Cohen could provide intelligent use of his comic in a more conventional film story. Instead, we have this mess that in all honesty has nothing to do with Ali G except for the pack. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing. Go Search DVD's Innit, Aiiii, or Bling Bling for Some Real Ali G.
