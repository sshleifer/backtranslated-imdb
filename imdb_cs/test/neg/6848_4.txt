Three young cinema employees are given the task of reopening the long-closed ancient theater, which many years before the shocking series of grisly murders. Much more homicide seems to have occurred since then, but all three of these young ascension workers are hoping that they will eventually do it on their own. As they approach the magnificent night of reopening, things become more strange and more troubling when things suddenly begin to move around without seeing help and the frightening old man who seems to chase the spaces. Oh, that's really awful. In fact, if it wasn't for Mary Woronov's secretary, an open-minded, open-minded young woman stealing virtually every scene she appeared in, and an incredibly hot chick who played incredibly slim but totally sexy Selina, it would be a total loss. The only other good thing I have to say about this movie is that some of the cinema murders are done in a really inventive, though not too bloody (preference for me, but not necessarily for others). The rest are just rolling in constant sleaze (so extremely few rare can actually find humor in it) and going through a predictable slasher killing annoying characters from one to another routine.
