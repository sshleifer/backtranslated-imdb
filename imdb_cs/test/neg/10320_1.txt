I saw this remastered on DVD. She had a big picture of Sandra on it and said, "They play Sandra ...." and she seemed to play a big part in it. It is not so. Hardly in it. With this scenario, he does what he can, but that's not much. The sound was terrible. I mean, they didn't eat things together. The shots would be fired and the number of shots did not match the sound. People talk in the car while it's moving and the shot is from the outside of the windshield, but there is no engine noise, road noise or any other sound. Kind of weird. <br /> <br /> The score was terrible. It sounded over and over again. Dialogue is really terrible. Negotiations were terrible, I couldn't believe it. Fun scenes were like Batman Comics without "BIFF", and "BAM". They were really lame. Shooting scenes, I think firearms, were literally laughing. I quickly handed over a lot of this movie. Even then it was too long.
