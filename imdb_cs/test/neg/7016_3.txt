Who the hell had "bright" (?) The idea to throw Lucille Ball in this movie ??? It was supposed to be Angela Lansbury's child. Lucy had at least had her voice dubbed. There is some substitute in fact that Jerry Herman's score is pretty well preserved intact, except for "That's how I am young, I feel", and we get the performances of the original Broadway cast members Jane Connell and Bea Arthur. I suppose Robert Preston had to get a song, a lower "Loving". Overall, I think bad redhead was occupied in this.
