SAIMIN <br /> <br /> (USA: The Hypnotist / UK: Hypnosis) <br /> <br /> Aspect Ratio: 1.85: 1 <br /> <br /> Audio Format: Dolby Stereo SR < br /> <br /> After a series of bizarre and apparently unrelated "suicides," an experienced Tokyo detective (Ken Utsui) gains the help of a young psychoanalyst (Goro Inagaki) who believes the victims have acted on a post-hypnotic proposal. However, their subsequent investigation reveals an even darker power at work associated with a young girl (Miho Kanno) whose life has been thwarted by sadistic abuse ... Based on Keisuke Matsuoka's novel, it is dense - the secret secrets will take inspiration from a variety of sources (Italian gialli, traditional Japanese ghost stories, etc.), though some images in climactic showdown reveal a more immediate influence: Recent commercial success of Hideo Nakata's RING (1998). For all its ambitions, however, SAIMIN is a routine potboiler who, after opening a powerhouse, runs badly ("suicides" are particularly impressive, despite some weak CGI effects), though director Masayuki Ochiai - who wrote the screenplay with Yasushi Fukuda - for the extended finals in which the surprising secrets of the story are finally revealed. Ochiai is best known for her film adaptation of the novel video game PARASITE EVE (1997), which also played the leading man Inagaki (a member of the Japanese pop group SMAP) - and while SAIMIN reflects the strong visual sense, it falls short as drama and most characters are a mere cipher that undermines the emotional payout of the story. Which is a shame, because the last half hour is marked by a number of dynamic sets - especially the concert hall, in which Dvořák's symphony of the "New World" is transformed into a murder instrument! - and Ochiai is well served by an excellent production team. However, those who are attracted by the promise of bloodshed can be disappointed - the film is long on the atmosphere and short for splashes. The performances are varied due to the limitations of the script, but Kanno (TOMIE) is excellent as a young woman suffering from multiple personality disorder - which, according to the headlines in the peer-reviewed press, assures us that she is not considered a viable health condition in Japan! - Who fights for a slimy hypnotist television (Takeshi Masu), a major suspect in murders. Inagaki is insignificant in a one-dimensional role, and he is constantly upstaged by Utsui, a veteran artist whose career stretches back to the "Sûpâ Jaiantsu" series of the fifties. <br /> <br /> (Japanese dialogue)
