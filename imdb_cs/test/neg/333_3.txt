I felt the need to write a review after I saw a single review that gave this movie a suspiciously high rating of 9/10. I say suspicious because it looks less like a review, but rather a publicity statement. Maybe the filmmaker himself, or one of his friends, wrote this review? Naughty, naughty. I watched this movie on a propeller channel on Sky TV and expected it to be really awful. The special effects used were to be honest, very good for a low budget movie, and some of the actors weren't that bad, but most of the acting was really terrible, but well done for the effort I expected most. Friends of the filmmaker. I think the film director did a really good job of striking his weight. I found some movie funny because it was trying to be great when it wasn't. <br /> <br /> If you don't take this movie too seriously and watch it when you're drunk with some friends, it may have a good time, but probably not as intended. This movie is not the way to 9/10, but it is worth watching the laughter considering that it was done on a very very low budget and fairly due credit for those involved in its production.
