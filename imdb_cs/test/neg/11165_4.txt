I recently found this movie on one of my married VHS tapes (an empty variety it uses to record TV stuff). The film looks like it was last shown in the 1980s, and I don't remember seeing it since then. It wasn't (to my knowledge) it was released on DVD or VHS even though I will be passing around a copy. The film tells the story of three young people: two girls, one on the edge of puberty and another, much younger, and a young boy who goes to live with his mother's brother and his young, dumb Irish woman. His wife also has two brothers who live with them. Uncle Children is an unpleasant madman of control who forces his young wife to wear a silver collar while looking at the puppet show he wears on him and her brothers in his toy industry. The oldest girl and one of the oldest Irish girls (younger) develops love while living in the same house. A girl helps her aunt in the store while her brother helps her uncle do things in the workshop. <br /> <br /> The film has many very intrusive elements. There is an uncle's handling of his wife as some sort of stupid (literally) possession (illustrated by the collar) while Irish indulge in dance, drinking, and somewhat forbidden love. Interestingly, I've seen much more explicit themes that have been played today in other Hollywood movies. You are wondering if the British film industry and the BBC have any hidden agenda. Br /> <br /> Although it is not a children's film, there are plenty of playful, magical moments and one Irish artist makes some beautiful pictures.
