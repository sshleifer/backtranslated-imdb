I caught 2:37 at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles. It is a very well made first film (although the DV format is starting to appear outdoors) and I'm sure it has good intentions to show us the "dark side" of high school - in other words, every side of high school. However, the filmmaker does not have the talent to write or promise. There are several characters, but none of them is any more than what requires conspiracy. There is no depth to these cartoons about the machinations "I'm a problem teen X, I have a problem Y". The perceived roles of men and women in this story are phenomenally unpleasant. Let's start with men. You have a stoner boy who is gay, an athlete who is also gay, a boy who rapes his sister, and Mr. Peepants. As a stereotype requires, all homosexuals must be sexually unfulfilled and violent towards women and themselves. Naturally (or unnaturally as stereotype assumes), two gay male characters defeated women, Peepants, and themselves. With these characteristics, I would be perfectly fine if the stereotypes were turned on on their heads or if the characters crossed them somehow. Yet nothing happened, and that's all that's about the stories of these characters. <br /> <br /> Next, ladies. One young woman wants to be a bulimic housewife, another is a pregnant rape sister-rape brother and there's a girl who kills herself (I'll get it later). Again, I don't think there is a demand for political correctness for filmmakers (I would be out of work that it would be a case), but I think it is justifiable only if it is more of a character or story. If this archetype were used to reveal something other than "I'm a teenager and life is angry," I'd be happy as a clam. But nothing new is revealed! Nothing is subverted, altered, or sublimed. Finally a girl who kills herself. This is a dull and very sloppy narrative. Should we sit for 5 minutes of a girl who was forcibly killed, which we saw about 30 seconds through the movie? We've been watching all these other stories for an hour and a half and now we're being asked to torture ourselves for a character who isn't part of the story? It's cheap, exploitative and careless. Despite millions of lousy Indian movies that came earlier, you need something like EARN. You can't simply buy it on credit. Such suicide happens, we get a wrap from characters that go similar, not down, and the movie ends. What have I learned? I already knew that high school was sucked - it was there. I already knew that people have stereotypical views on gays and young women. I already knew that children with disabilities were mocked. <br /> <br /> What else is there? Smoke, mirrors and some really nice leaf views. Oh, and the worst deus ex machina I've ever seen.
