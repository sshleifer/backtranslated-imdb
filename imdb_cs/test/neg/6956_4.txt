It looks like a good movie on paper. Michael Caine plays a tough and ruthless boxing promoter who is the son of the title eliminator. It is a pity that when a story is transferred from paper to a TV screen, it loses everything. I was hoping to see how his final role was imitated in CARET's GET, and as the film progresses, it seems to take on the characteristics of a tough, brave revenge thriller, but the whole tone of the film goes so much that you will be confused about what genre it is trying to fit into. For example, Caine (Who Can't Believe Like Billy "Shiner" Simpson, He's Just Michael Caine) has a laugh as he refers to someone like "Hattie Jacques", then in a supposedly humorous moment his followers have to break one's hand. How I laughed. I think it's supposed to trigger laughter as it plays on the screen, right? But it seems to be in conflict with the way the rest of the film takes place. Irvin is not a bad director and is well regarded as his war films, such as DOGS OF WAR and HAMBURGER HILL, but is not suitable for this type of violent drama and man cannot help but feel that he might be a little intimidated. living legend like Caine. Caine makes the impression that he's just doing it for money, and well-known faces in supportive roles like Landua and Cranham are basically just portraits anyone could play
