Very un-Tom and Jerry short. Jerry tells this story that revolves around Tom's cat falling in love and losing her to his opponent, Butch. Tom is best friends with Jerry, who bothered me a little. The cartoon is also introduced in Cinemascope. Overall, I found this Tom and Jerry cartoon sad and depressed. Instead, he should put on a DVD "Puss gets a shoe" and I'd like to. This experimental animated short can be found on 2 Warner Brother 2-DVD Spotlight Collection discs. It's the last one on the scene and I hope Warner Brothers decides to release the second volume soon. <br /> <br /> My Class: C-
