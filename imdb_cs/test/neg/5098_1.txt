Set in the mid 1800s, when the British clear Newland outback wilderness to establish colonies. The daughter of British Army surgeon Sarah (Samantha Morton) falls in love with the son of one of the Maori leaders. Maori is an indigenous tribe and dangerous people for Europeans. By the time Sarah's baby is called, "Boy," his father is dead. At the age of six, "Boy" is kidnapped by his father's family and Sarah starts looking for him with a man (Kiefer Sutherland) who is deeply in love with her. Two-time Oscar Morton nomination is definitely the star of this movie. Sutherland is a complete waste. They also play: Cliff Curtis, Stephen Rea, Temuera Morrison and David Rawiri Pene. This movie is rated R for some sexual content and violent battle scenes. I found that the title of RIVER QUEEN is very misleading, and the DVD cover with Sutherland and that you think is the leading star should be a crime.
