Even in glasses wearing a geek mode, Kathy Ireland is very easy to see, but her acting behavior is not easy to follow. Most of the film's actors either do it through the top of the road (outside the "campy fun") or act slightly embarrassed to be there. The effects and soundtrack are nothing special and relatively low budget. The REALY graph line extends to the ability to suspend distrust. Catch this one while laughing when it comes to a premium movie channel or a network Saturday afternoon TV, but DO NOT GIVE YOUR MONEY TO THIS. One good mention for trivia is that one of the underground mafia plays Deep Roy. Deep is now famous for playing (and doing it well) all Oompa Loompas in Burton's "Charlie and Chocolate Factory".
