The fine lineup of actors and the seemingly nice plot - though not original - promised me a nice evening in front of the TV. I was disappointed. The actors released up to the standard (Juliette Lewis stuffed as always; William Hurt tight, but in the background; Shelley Duvall convincing as ever), but the story was too thin to entertain me in the story, and the final twist was too obvious and too late; There was only one character who was pretty to the girl, so guess what ?! Then take the ultimate after-twist? I don't know what to think about it. Friend and neighbor? A deal with the devil, or just to get inside? What! The film had a nice idea, but the idea was not elaborated. It could have been good, but it wasn't. Too many free ends to tie, Columbo would say.
