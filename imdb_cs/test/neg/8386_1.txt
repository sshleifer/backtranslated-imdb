I watched this movie last night, even though I rented a horror / scary movie of blockbusters and this one I got. The opening scenes were so long that the conversations between the characters didn't go anywhere. The story seemed so poor that she gave him HIV and then went to meet someone else, but she is killed by the man she infected (I think it was a long time) for different people Then when the body was released, it happened that he was the person she met, was in the woods, and saw the body thrown away. Then he chased them (he sometimes finished burying the body?) And they got into the car and somehow found them from another direction they came from and killed the guy. I think a separate head was the only good thing in the movie because it was pretty realistic. and then, as the woman ran, she fell in front of him to stab her with a spade! A COMPLETED !! <br /> <br /> What a relief, It was the most important movie I've ever watched ... please avoid it, it's just so poorly done, I counted only 5 different people in it and the scene where it was kills, is unrealistic and swears in it and that's it !! This is me ... <br /> <br /> STEER WELL CLEAR !!
