I was expecting a rather straightforward graphic, sexual, raw teen comedy when I sat down to see it ... that was pretty accurate ... it was just a lot more sick and disgusting than I thought. I don't know if the director / writer Gregory Poirier is sick or sexually confused, but I doubt that such a person could make such a movie. I probably took it, if it were just the only thing that was wrong, it was that it required a hard stomach ... but it is not. The movie is also very lively and disturbing ... any character that has more than one second of time on screen is extremely ... sexually, mentally or physically. I don't know if it's just a director's sense of humor, but I've found it to be ... bad. Just wrong. Even in the comedy there should be some seriousness. The story is stupid. Behavior is bad. The characters are inconsistent and poorly written ... all. There is no one likeable character in the film. Humor is disgusting and goes too far. The film is so incredibly bad that I don't think it's worth it, it's time. If you like R-rated, comedy with lots of sexual cues and graphic stuff, watch The Groomsmen, or better yet, American Pie ... or Road Trip, my personal favorite. But don't look at it. I can't describe you how bad it is ... you would have to experience it yourself. However, this is one of those times when I'm going to say you're better off. This way you can only imagine that this movie goes very close to the bottom ... without knowing it will pass, and much lower than that. Most of all, this movie looks like a group of horny teenage guys got together, putting together a film crew, and every time one of them got an idea, they shot it, and later put the whole thing together. Missing structure, consistency and taste. I recommend this to just horny teen guys who have seen every other R-rated raw teen comedy and who don't care about quality. Everyone else ... let's make a sensible thing; avoid it. It's not even worth seeing prey. Believe me. 1/10
