If good intentions were enough to create a good movie, I'd be rated a turgid, cumbersome, obvious "fokem" slightly higher than 4. Macy's doing the best, but as the earlier poster commented, Miller's little parable asks us to suspend mistrust too often. Maybe this novel gives us a little more information about Newman, so we can understand how someone who is clearly not intelligent could be so dense as to perceive the attitudes of people around him. I agree with another reviewer that if you are not aware of the great average citizens in America at this time, this film may be the eye. I grew up in the fifties and "good" pastors from my evangelical church found nothing wrong with having a church picnic on a commercial beach whose sign prominently indicated that no Jews or blacks would be admitted. It is difficult for today's people to understand that it was a norm and not just in the south. It was not until 1964, when I attended a somewhat racially integrated (but sexually segregated) public high school in Baltimore, that my classmates could not attend the traditional "father and banquet son" because they were held in a facility that was not admitted by blacks. Unfortunately, it was a device owned by a Jewish family. The subject of "Focus" is important and we should never forget, despite the persistent manifestations of racism in modern America, how repulsive the attitudes of the previous generation ("the greatest generation") are. Perhaps this film is somewhat valuable in fighting the recent wave of sentimental bullshit about the forties, such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Brokow. But ultimately, as in "Far from Heaven," the filmmakers' good intentions are undermined by the fact that the protagonist is so ridiculously forgetting the social conventions of his time.
