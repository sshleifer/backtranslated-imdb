The veteran television director Ted Post treats us with a harsh, confused and ultimately unnecessary story that is pulled out of column B of the Big Land Book Harold Robbins. Set against the smoggy Phoenix skyline, post-Charlies Angles Jaclyn Smith takes a stellar turn as a "woman whose eyes are mysteriously overshadowed all the time" while the JFK Mimic James Franciscus lounges around the edges. Mannix goes west, the monkeys are being abused, models leaning on classic cars, and Smith is constantly upstaged by Sybil Danning until the giallo style wrap-up brings the whole excuse of mess to the bitter end. Yeah, and there's Bob Mitchum. Somewhere.
