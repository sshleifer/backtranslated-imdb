I'm a huge fan and follower of Elizabeth Berkley. I bought it on DVD from eBay for my birthday. We sat down and watched and it was so boring. I remember once laughing. It's only about an hour and a half, and it seemed to last forever. But Elizabeth is great about that. Maybe it's just because I'm a big fan of Elizabeth Berkley. If she weren't in it, I wouldn't see it, but every time she got on my face, she lit up. Unfortunately, Elizabeth couldn't save this movie. Only the overall story and the horrible comedy make it a movie you'd rather miss than an hour and a half of waste. It's a very forgetful film.
