I really hated this movie and it's the first movie that Stephen King wrote that I didn't finish. I was really disappointed, it was the worst I've ever seen. What did you think you were doing for three hours? Can it be a pretty good story, but actors? No. Tension? No. Romance? No. Horror? No. He had nothing. It has a strange, crazy scientific man with Einstein's hair, a classic thing. It's not real at all. And the man keeps getting younger. Looks like they just used Stephen King's name to make a lousy, too long movie with nothing exciting. I give this movie "1 (terrible)". If they were -5, I'd probably take it instead. It was a total waste of time.
