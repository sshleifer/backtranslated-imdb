So Wynorski redoes the curse of Komodo, replacing interesting original characters with a lot of unpleasant environmentalists / anti-capitalists. And he adds Cobra. Most of the film is spent listening to self-righteous figures who have married evil capitalist pigs, while there are memories of what happened on the island before they got there, among this condescension cavalry. DNA experiments were performed, the animals began to grow, people talked together without having to behave as morally superior, etc. Needless to say, it would be a much better film if the film footage was filmed and the consecrated benefactors were forgotten. To remember, there are a few short scenes that are scattered here and there, one by one rising from the stool than you, but probably making up less than 2% of the film. The main event that will build our characters against each other takes about one minute and is as exciting as viewing previews on the latest Dino-Crisis video game. Acting is generally bad, even for this kind of movie. Half of the actors seem to be more interested in saying every last syllable of each word than speaking in any believable way. Actually, I did it to the end, but it's one of those movies I would like to record and then watch later because there are lots of parts that need to be passed on quickly. Overall, I give this effort to one star, absolutely none of the elements that would make B-movie fun to watch. It's a really sad day when you can honestly say that the creators of this movie could learn something about watching Boa vs. Python.
