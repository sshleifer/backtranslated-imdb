This demented left-wing wiping trivializes Dante's great work, distorting the author's genius from all his appreciation, inserting hateful ideology, incompetent satire, and moral political commentary on every imaginable place, and himself deserving a place in the eighth circle, tenth. Bolgie with the rest of the counterfeiters. Sandow Birk reserved a seat beside him. Casting hell with Republican political figures, Fox News helicopters and Christian Conservatives is the work of a literary sacrament, not to say anything about extreme liberal bias. But it is unoriginal, tiring and banal. Nothing in Birk's Inappropriate and Heretical Review is at least relevant to the original text, or is somehow fun, funny, or instructive, despite the fact that it is the opposite of conviction. <br /> <br /> I could eat a videotape and PUKED better film. I am sorry for the two hours of my life I have lost while watching this insult of poetry itself. Calliope will cry forever.
