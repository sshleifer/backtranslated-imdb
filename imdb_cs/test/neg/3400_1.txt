It was as if someone was trying to make a horrible video game and also a documentary. The historical aspect was great. Everything else was horrible, the director's plugs another movie that seemed to happen every second minute, the video of the real ghost hunting was edited as a scary movie, rather than an investigation, had haunted home music and sound effects that would distract you from it what's happening. Thanks for the unnecessary 2 hours of my time! If there was evidence, it would fly! Most of them were just people talking about the place. The Ghosthunters episode that went there will totally destroy how this show was. I'm so excited about the sci-fi channel that I played it.
