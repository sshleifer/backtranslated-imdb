If you're looking for a movie masterpiece, it's not like that. If you are looking for one of those horrible movies that are so terrible that they are actually good, then it may be for you. There is so much unintentional laughter in this movie that it could almost be considered a comedy. Let's start with the introductory titles that call "Jack-O" and then add the word "Lantern" as if the viewer was unable to figure out that the movie was about a pumpkin at a giant pumpkin as shown on the cover and in the opening scene of the movie. After that, the film goes in about 20 different directions, none of which make sense. Jack is everywhere, he's in folk houses, in the woods, and yet he doesn't seem to do anything. He does a few kills, but the long accumulation of these murders is so badly bred and built that you almost want Jack-o to take your viewer to you. Other than that, the plot consists of poor acting, gratuitous nudity, and a ridiculous plot line. Discussions in this film are among the worst I've ever seen in my 35 years of watching the movie. The boy who is in the film (director's son) has as much emotion as a corpse, and almost all other actors / actresses are for many reasons just as bad (especially a lady with more eyes) than plates. But when you say all this, if you take it for what it is (it's a smoking pile of dung), then you get some laughter from this movie. What I also found fun is that DVD makers saw the fit to release the "10th anniversary version" of this movie (as if the original wasn't good enough). And someone actually had the idea that he would do a "backstage" mini movie, which is also part of the 10th anniversary release (I'm not sure why) ....... I'll give it 3 broken pumpkins out of 10 ...
