******** SPOILER ALERT ************** I lost 85 minutes of my life and watched this "movie". first of all, we think it's funny that the producer in the movie appeared as an autopsy doctor with a terribly incredible incredible accent - what the hell was that, Romanian? And how is it that no one speaks Danish except for swamp creatures in Denmark? (Note, Scottish camp director ...). ? And who makes shopping for swamps? Their pants looked as if they were purchased in the Banana Republic. Very nicely dressed for 1200 years. This one was worse than the Scarecrow Slayer (we didn't think it was even POSSIBLE). Basically, we quickly advanced over 75% of the film looking for gore / death / scary moments. Was not found. Rent a DVD just to watch 2 hours "Behind the Scenes of Bog's Creatures". Who are these people? Are they serious? And the filmmakers are 60 years old. I think it's their holy grail, and that's pretty pathetic and in itself. BEST LINE from the movie, hands down: "It's not bad for a girl who never went to school." â€œMy blind grandmother, who has alzheimer's disease, could make a better film.
