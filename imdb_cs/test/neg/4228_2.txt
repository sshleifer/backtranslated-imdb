This French film is said to be a haunted, dull policeman investigating rape and murder of a young girl in a small town. However, the movie is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing. If it takes ten minutes to walk from point A to point B, the movie spends ten minutes, showing this walk, and these are "action" scenes. There are also still images that last for a few minutes, wondering if the user pressed a pause button on the remote control. The script has enough material for a 20-minute movie. The film lasts seven hours. You have mathematics. The actors were apparently amateurs and it shows. Note to self: never see Dumont movie again.
