... and in this series I was reduced to a harassing gay-haired athlete. Remember your friend Mark, who has all the good lines in the books? Well, in this series, his two-trackers put Mr. Freeze in shame. Remember our uber-evil nemesis Visser Three? He's a bald guy with unbreakable phrases. Remember Rachel, "Xen, Princess Warrior" and Cassie, my sensitive and caring interest in love? They were transformed into mindless bimboys by 10 (!) Writers who decided that the original characters were not cool enough for television. Remember the amazing alien ax that was cool, the smart and really favorite cinnamon bun? In this series it is Token Alien with an extremely unpleasant voice. Remember the funny joke our team had in the books? In this series, our dialogue is so stupid and stupid that it is evident that writers have set themselves on the lowest common denominator. So forget about everything you thought you knew about Animorphs! It was Cassie who became allergic to morphing, not to Rachel, the thought-out idea is * supposed echo, and Visser Three and Ax, rarely, if ever, appeared as Andalit√© (no, it has nothing to do with budget!). I'm not crazy. And I don't lie. They're all around us. And if you are unlucky, one of them could adjust one of his favorite books or series or graphic novels to a really horrible TV show. You were warned. <br /> <br /> "Finally ... television is worth watching." ~ (very bald) Visser Three <br /> <br /> (r # 91)
