^^ contains spoilers ^^ <br /> <br /> This movie is absolutely bullshit. Don't play. Nobody in this movie has roots, or even, except for a wife, and she wins by default. Everyone is selfish, and many things happen that make no sense. Acting is, at best, average and everyone is breathing too hard for everything. No one can even cry believably. <br /> <br /> If you leave the room for a second, then something completely out of the left field will happen and no SENSE WHESOEVER will do it. For example, I left the room for a while while Jennie Garth was sleeping with her manager. I'll be back, seriously about 4 minutes later, (I'm also sure there is some advertising) and sleeps with that guy Berko. <br /> <br /> In this movie, I gave up when Berko was the back of his fianc√© in the car because she didn't want to call the wedding. I've lost 2 hours of my life. You should not.
