- can contain spoilers- <br /> <br /> It is clear that the one who made the film had to have a lot of connections. Otherwise I don't see it. I am really surprised that no one has used the name of Allen Smithee, and more surprisingly, not everyone has used the name. Anyway, where to start. Bad dialogue, crazy costumes, apologetic-looking film, unintentional comedy, top-notch characters, and other inconsistencies than George W. Bush's college career. I don't know what was fun, the guy lost his arm because of a snowball, or a slow-motion scene where all Jack Frosts were killed. One of the great lines of all time was also spoken in this film. "How do we know it's him?" Like another mutant snowman who can talk and kill snowball people! Great movie, but very bad movie in general.
