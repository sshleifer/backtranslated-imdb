Most American remake of European films is pretty poor, but that's in their own league. In fact, it could even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I think I handed it over as another harmless Hollywood thriller when I didn't see the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The changed end here is pretty stupid (and executed with some awkwardness), but a much worse crime than the removal of all the intelligence and depth of the character that marked the original as a classic. The real horror here is that the same man who was in charge of SPOORLOOS is responsible for this crime. Will the real George Sluizer stand up?
