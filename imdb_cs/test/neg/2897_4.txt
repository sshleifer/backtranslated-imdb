I've never seen two more "Ninja" movies and for everyone I know they're known, but for some reason I watched. This one starts quite quickly because this ninja goes on a super killing spree. He is almost unstoppable because it takes quite a lot of rounds to keep him down. He is not for counting though as he ends up owning a woman and he then continues his killing ways by using her as his instrument. Another ninja enters the fight and apparently the only way to kill the ninja is with another ninja, so volunteer. This leads to a great battle at the end, because the dead ninja returns to their bodies and have it in the war. It sounds better than it actually did, but at least it wasn't boring.
