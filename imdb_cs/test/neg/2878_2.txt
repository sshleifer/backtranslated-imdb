I read reviews of this movie and were generally pretty good, so I thought I should see it. I'm a great Frankfile lover and art, but I believe it's another case where critics do something "divine" or "intellectual" in something that isn't. I will be blunt: it contains scenes of sexual perversion I have never seen. Of course, the piano teacher has some major psychological problems, but I really didn't want to see them so graphically. The film is basically disgusting. When I saw the Requiem for a dream, I was repelled by the last kind of scene with Jennifer Connelly, but that was nowhere near the disgust and resistance I felt during this film.
