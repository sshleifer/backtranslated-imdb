Let's go straight. I was raised by a Catholic and a very religious family, and I spent so much time in church talking to priests at home. This was useful for two things: to make me a convinced atheist and give me a deep, insightful knowledge of the Church and its dogmas. And I say: if a Catholic priest testifies to a murder and clearly sees the face of the murderer, he can report it to the police even if the killer then confessed to him. He can't reveal what he said to him in the confession, but he can talk about anything he sees outside, and the confession is useless to keep his mouth shut. So here we have a movie that is kept lying. And another lie is contrary to murder. According to the Catholic Church, absolution is a sin if there is sincere repentance. So far the biggest holes in this weak thriller. As people often say, this film would improve if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates switched to roles. Hoskins is naturally suitable for playing gangsters (I will never lament that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niro's weakest performances in "The Untouchables") and Bates's features would be perfect as a priest with a gray past. But I think the film would be much better if Ulster had a real life, a Liam Neeson native (then mostly unknown to the big audience) who played Mickey Rourke. Not only is his face ideal for playing tortured characters, but he would convince us that the character is real, something Rourke just can't. In the 1980s, Rourke was not a bad actor (then he seemed to lose his talent with his appearance), but he was one of those artists like Brad Dourif, who is as good as the director he works with. And as a former IRA terrorist, Rourke's performances are more like a pimp. Sad to think this movie was made only three to six years later (when Neeson reached a mild celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimi being a pleasant "Darkman", and a superstardom in 1993 with "Schindler's List" while Rourke became quite much of the forgotten has-been), Liam and Mickey could have reclassified parts for greater benefit (Rourke would be effective in supporting the role of Docherty, but simply cannot carry this film along as lead). One more missed opportunity and another movie with the potential to be a classic that has become an unforgettable fare immediately. Ironically quite often criticized score (undercovered composer Bill Conti) worked for me. I did not consider it too melodramatic, but suitably bold and beautiful. It reminded me of Howard Shore's score for "Silence of the Lambs". Here is Mike Hodges' talent who did "Get Carter", yes, but remember, he's also a champion for "Flash Gordon" ... <br /> <br /> It seems the movie was massacred by the Cutting room (it shows How some parts are really jerky and confusing, and others just don't stick) and the Cut director is waiting for the light. OK, but I seriously doubt it will be a great movie because we still have a bad casting and a false assumption. 4/10.
