That was perhaps the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. Forget it is clear that no research has been done on Detroit (Detroit Forest! Bwahaha !!). Writing was horrible, the assumption totally unlikely, and frankly the characters were embarrassing. I can't understand for my life why seasoned actors would fall to such a low level and share something that is terrible to God. I have never seen the original and I do not know if this film pays tribute to its original form. I know the original wasn't in Detroit. Why would they deviate from it without examining the details of the setup, just telling me it was more than a cast trying to pay rent. Don't waste your time on this waste if you're not from Detroit and want some comic relief.
