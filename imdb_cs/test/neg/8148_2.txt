This movie is a laugh and a half. From the first scene where we appeared to Mel Torme as a big, bad Jaguar drivin 'stud muffin gang leader (and this is a giggling-fest in himself), to the final picture of Mamie Van Doren, now a rehabilitated angelic teenager walk out of jail (errr. .loving a girls' home run by nun iron fists), you can't stop shaking your head. The cast of this movie is a cheesy list from Mel and Mamie to the talented Paul Anka (all I wanted over most of this movie was just STOP SINGING!) And a king of forty year old teens, Dick Contino. Gloria Talbot, playing a humorous teenage girl with more than a few chops (judo, not playing) The last time I saw the horrible misogynist 50-year-old Leech Woman, with such a bad haircut, it looked like a dead lumberjack who was squeezed by Mac. truck. Mamie is bad, bad girl-smokes, swears, runs wild, strikes teachers and runs around with gang leaders. He throws out his idiot Jaguar, who drives his friend Chip (whom we see in the first scene trying to rape a blonde before he falls off a cliff of a handsome guy), and takes care of Dick Contin instead. Whatever it is for her, it's up to everyone. Mel appears at a party with his new beau and accuses her of pushing an ugly Chip out of the cliff. Even though I'm sure she would like it, she wasn't there. The silly battle scene between Contin and his gang, and Mel and his jazz enthusiasts follow, with some merrily bad moves on both sides. Mamie ends up being sent to a girl's city, a reform school. ... own home for the erring girls .. Sister Iron Pants and her sister repairs. She angry nuns (and us) by dispersing, discarding annoying one-liners, and only generally showing how bad she is. She quickly falls into Gloria Talbot, playing one of those unfortunate girls who give her chops so she knows her place. She meets the lame noodle of a girl who is obsessed with the character of Paul Anka (why?). This little drop becomes her "follower". There is a long piece of film where nothing happens except St. Paul of Anka still appears and proves how holy he is. He is singing too much in this interval until you want to throw him into his huge snake to make him silent! And Mamie is a little sister, played Princess of Father Know the best of fame, calling her to tell her she's in trouble. It turned out to be you who went with Chipster and now Mel is blackmailing her because he found out. The girls broke free to save her, with the hysterical battle scene between the girls and Mel and his boys. this is after the race between Mel and Dick, which is so stupid that it beats the mind. Timeless teenagers in this crystal film have a great time to enjoy what is basically a stupid, badly written, and morally preaching film that does not reach any goal unless its aim is to make you laugh loudly.
