When I saw on the voting panel that some people gave this movie a score of 10, I assumed they didn't realize that the score wasn't out of 100. This is a real-life disaster film movie. Poorly written and weakly directed with so-called actors unable to act, but capable of grimacing in order. For the first 60 minutes, the story seems to move in one direction, then change direction and engage in power struggle, with extremely poor special effects. Unable to work out an intelligent way for a hero with limited powers to defeat a villain with super powers, "writer" scammers. Obviously, the father was added to the so-called Story-line because it was easier than developing an acceptable denouement. Not that writing even knew the word "denouement". Some movies will go directly to DVD. This one was supposed to go right into the dustbin.
