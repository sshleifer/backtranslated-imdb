As a nice anecdote to one of the above comments: In was in Mumbai about two weeks before the release of this movie, I was approached-being white-copying some lines of this movie in a recording studio. While I speak German, I kindly asked for all the dubbing scenes in English, otherwise it would be too confusing for the Indian audience ... So all the Germans actually speak English in this movie! funny enough i made more characters, so if you really want to spoil some time watching the movie again, listen carefully; <br /> <br /> All non-Indian characters are made with only 4 voices! . . . .
