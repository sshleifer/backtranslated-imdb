Corey Haim plays a boy who joins a dog to marry a giant troll and OSA hit-man (Michael Ironside) with 30/30 and home bombs (which plays a plausible reflection on Haim) in this attentive but unsatisfactory arrangement of a decent story. Corey Haim is horrible, of course, but the movie is a sheer momentum as well as Ironside's impressive presence to make it at least a modestly effective film. The plot is still ridiculous and it would be nicer to see a monster or at least more. At least it's different. Also, it's quite likely that this movie will be the last teen movie to show a teenager to make tube bombs. Matt Bronson 2/5
