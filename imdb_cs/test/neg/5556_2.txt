OK I saw Hershall Gordon Lewis movies earlier, but this one really takes the cake, its really bloody and rude, not to mention the disgusting as strippers are made, I'm talking bad deal that makes plan 9 of the universe look like a settlement, the only salvation of grace is the late big Henny Youngman as a strip club owner, yeah taking my wife ... please. stripteasers are real sexy for 1972, I believe they used the same plot again in Roger Corman; deprived of the kill in 1987.i enjoyed the former HGLewis flick 100 maniacs, which was a mini masterpiece of sorts, but poor playing, no award here, but be aware that it is a splatter film that paved the way for Friday the 13th, and saw in one disruptive scene half naked stripper has her ass licking with meat tenderizer.ugh! Morbid stuff here. 2 out of 10.
