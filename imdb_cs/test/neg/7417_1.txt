It definitely looks like an "amateur" class. When this piece of waste was ever released, it's out of me: acting, story, characters, supposedly special effects, etc. ... it's all wrong. Why Lance Henriksen accepted it will remain one of the greatest mysteries of the film. Maybe he was in desperate need of money or maybe he was under the influence of some illegal drug. It is useless to try to explain what this film is about. He deals with the legend of the big foot, but in the worst possible way. In fact, this smelly smells like a direct-to-video release. <br /> <br /> Avoid all costs! 0 * of 10 *
