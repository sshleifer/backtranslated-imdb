I have to say I was disappointed with this film. Though it is well-behaved and directed, the basic story just gets too slow. It is true that in a different mood I would like it better. I laughed a lot, but I rarely laughed loudly; and in fact it was a sense of tension to find out who won. But unlike another movie that my wife took on the same day (one of us never heard of it before), this one turned white. <br /> <br /> If you see a lot of movies, then look in all ways - it's significantly better than average fare. But if you have (just like me) limited time and want to watch only the best and fun, save it later. <br /> <br /> [Price: 7/10]
