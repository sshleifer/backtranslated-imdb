This is a painfully slow story about the last days of 1999 when a strange disease breaks out and ... I stopped worrying. It is believed that there are two people who live above or below each other in the apartment complex. There is a leak and the plumber put a hole in the male floor so you can see the female apartment. Also, since it is a crisis that takes place in much of the dialogue, there are actually news reports ... <br /> <br /> Sounds promising? <br /> <br /> Not really. I became scattered and started doing other things that are deadly in the subtitled movie. Basically, I started to watch, which made the events seem even more unreal when I looked up. <br /> <br /> This may work for you, it wasn't for me.
