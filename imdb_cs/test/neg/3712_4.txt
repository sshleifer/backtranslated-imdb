If you like bad SE, (some) bad behavior and total lack of credibility, it's a movie for you. So a really cheap movie, but I liked it anyway. Why? Because I like these movies. I can't help seeing this kind of movies ....... What did the producers, actors, director and SE think when they made this movie? Don't expect "Abyss" or "Alien", just a (very) low budget horror / adventure movie. There is one nice "splatter" moment when a man's head is shot, but for most the horror is pretty tame. The ultimate monster is also pretty cool. It's just 73 minutes long, so you can't go wrong there. Maybe you can pick it up at your local video site or watch TV. I'm sure you'll be looking at it well. But don't say you weren't warned .............
