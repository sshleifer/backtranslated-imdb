Thank God I'm fast forward. I think it's a movie about a guy who rises and falls. Anything: It's a stupid clich√©. It's not a difference. There's the guy, Bard Bard, who builds buildings or something. No matter. He's nice, it's Javier Bardem. Who cares? I think there's a car wreck, but I watched it fast, so ... who cares? The car wrecks and the handsome heroes who struggle with them smell like melodrama. Javier likes someone, but marries Maria de Madeiros instead. She is beautiful, poetically beautiful, with a heart-shaped face. Javier has an oral interface with Maribel Verdu, who for some reason washes the vulva. Do you think Maribel Verdu, with her hand-washed vulva, will be sexy. No it is not. This is a boring story about a lot of people who don't care about me. Javier, Maribel and Maria have three: How boring. This movie is annoying. I think it could be a small theme of (some) Spanish films: Rise and the predictable fall of a little boy who succeeds against a chance. Let me make this clear: this is a high class melodrama or maybe a soap opera. It's not your time except for laughter.
