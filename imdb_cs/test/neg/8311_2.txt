Just as bad as this movie, I really like it. Poor action, dialogue and action have made it so entertaining. I loved John Travis from Omega Cop and I stayed all night on the Death Machines sign at the airport, if they can't talk, he probably had to shake / nod on security issues. Actually, why can't they talk! We can't keep up with any film-making convention that makes it strange to watch - just a lot of people killed around the very free conspiracies surrounding hired killers - no "machines" as such, and those weird faces / mountain things on the front cover and trailer won't appear! I like the fact that there is no good guy in this film up to half the way and I love the many senseless scenes of this landing plane - a lot of people are killed who have nothing to do with the "conspiracy" and no explanation about anything - DO NOT PLEASE understand this movie . Instead, admire how the main good man can't even handle a random old guy in the bar - who is presented as an evil man who, however, is opposed to the bartender's decision to rent torn clothes to dance badly in the corner of "entertainment" all good guys enjoy it! Why did the old man get into the battle of our hero - and why did the random guy decide to help the old man in the fight?! Why did the hero collapse under one stroke from an old man to a bar where a stream of water is flowing in the background, so it looks like he comes out of his mouth? The definitive Top 20 B-Movie must check Part 2.
