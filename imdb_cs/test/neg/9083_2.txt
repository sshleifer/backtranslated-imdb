Again, Bronson's talent is largely unnecessary at this 1984 shock value, which is (uncut) much more intrusive than most of what is today. The fact that the "evil that men do" is very worrying (in verbal and visual depiction of torture) is not a problem. It is a shameless reward in which it is presented. Interestingly, this film probably symbolizes the second part of Bronson's career, in which he tortured many of his fans with the same hauntingly predictable and non-creative charts. One hopes this gentle actor will grow again.
