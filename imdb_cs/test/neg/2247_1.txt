I discussed this film and 2012, but I chose Inglourious Basterds because of its amazingly high IMDb rating. I must now say what a disappointment. I expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence, but I also expected a lot of funny dialogues. I got a huge dose earlier, but not enough. I felt brief. The ratio between violence and conspiracy is very important, and I think this film is totally wrong. And the plot? It's so credible or really fun. Save time and money. I can't believe what this rating says for the bloody and violent tastes of the modern masses.
