Although it is not one of Miss Davies' worst films, it is bad enough. And sadly, in revisionist fashion, recent IMDb fraudsters have deliberately overestimated the scores of some of their films to replace their past abuses - or so it seems. For years, conventional wisdom was that Davies was a terrible actress and just got the roles she got because her beau, William Randolph Hearst, bought her tour to Hollywood. This is definitely an image created in CITIZEN KANE by Orson Welles. It is true that Hearst used his considerable wealth and influence to build Davies' career. With all this money, it's no wonder she made some excellent movies and it's no wonder people got a snatch for all the extra attention she got. Sleeping with a man who finances your movies must notice. Despite this edge, however, she also made a decent number of bad movies and I think we really need a balance when it comes to the score of her films. After all, no rational person could believe that today (May 1, 2008), PEG O 'MY HEART and two other Davies films, which recently appeared on Turner Classic (FLORODORA GIRL and MARIANNE), deserved a high score - the ranking is higher than films like HIGH NOON, BEN HUR, THE BEST YEARS OF OUR LIFE AND ALL SILENT ON THE WESTERN FRONT !! In fact, MARIANNE would now rank as the fifth best movie ever by IMDb with a score of 8.8 !!! Since most people don't even know who Marion Davies was and most of her movies were financial disasters, that's a serious problem! However, she was a much better actress than suggested by CITIZEN KANE and initially broke into movies before she started to sleep with Hearst. What differentiates PEG O 'MY HEART from these two other movies is that MARIANNE and FLORODORA GIRL were nice little movies - while PEG O' MY HEART is just awful in some ways. Much of the reason was Marion's misconception. While her French accent in MARIANNE was cute, in PEG her Irish accent was bizarre - especially not Irish. Plus, and maybe I'm wrong, but her constant use of the word 'ye' makes her sound like shakespeare, not the 1933 film set in Ireland! Also there was the bizarre urgency that Marion should be the perfect multi-talented star - so she shouldn't just act to dance and sing. Singing really fits into the screenplays in some of her movies, but here it seemed like it was in place, and it really took it away from the movie. It seemed like you almost heard Hearst yelling, "He's a great actress - look at her singing and dancing." Unfortunately, Marion looked uncomfortable and in place in many of these scenes. But the biggest problem was that 36-year-old Marion would play such a young role. It was obvious that the character she played at the beginning of the movie was supposed to be similar to the character Mary Pickford played in her teens and twenties - with pig tails and a reckless attitude. Miss Pickford could postpone these roles, even though she was no longer a girl. But here, Marion took a little weight and looked at least 30. No offense - she looked good for her age - but she didn't look like a teen! Oddly enough, with the millions that Hearts spent on Marion's career, he never realized that the most important thing he needed to spend his money was a good script and one that suited Marion's talents. Believe me, I rated some of her films very high (especially I love SHOW PEOPLE), but here she just couldn't help but flop - this movie was a turkey.
