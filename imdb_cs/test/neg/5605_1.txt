I watched it out of curiosity. I enjoyed Stargate SG1 and watched many other TV shows and movies that the main characters worked on. My expectations were not high, so I was surprised to be so disappointed. The action is scary and the script is worse. Zero research into bad science, which is being burned throughout the movie, or into martial arts (which several films participate in the entire film, despite clearly no martial arts training) does) an already unlikely plot yet less credible. The same weapon (carried by Michael Shanks) when shooting at the side of the mountain will cause extreme damage, but when shooting inside the wicker wall, it creates a small firework effect without damaging the wicker structure - OK, I suppose Michael Shanks fans will sue to see that in Stargate SG1, where the weapon staff creates either surface to burn on the main character, or blasts a hole in the castle wall as needed), but still ... Bad CGI snake 'god' eats one of the believers in the way a dog would eat - snakes do not behave. The basic assumption of a cult of the Amazon warrior on a distant planet is at best stupid. Matriarchal societies have always been based on a lack of understanding that people are required in the process of spreading this species - such as the Picts, who did not understand the role of men in sexual reproduction until the ninth century - at that time, the balance of power passed from women to men. They carry technological weapons and demonstrate some knowledge of science - especially medicine, so the idea that matriarchal society can exist with this level of scientific knowledge is based solely on the original author's wet dream. Of course, several references to stellar science from this film show that the author knew nothing about it (except for a few key words he had to hear in other films). But it could be better - for example, "She" in 1965, which showed a matriarchal society with some respect, much more plausibly, and even after 45 years, it seems fresher than this fruitful exercise of stupidity. Marching a few women around in 'armor' pouting aggressively, and spitting their lines as a child looking for a fight in the nightclub ("Come on, then! I'll do ya!" Style), seems to over-simplify the complexity of matriarchal culture. Cultural mentions are so simple - "all hail snake hail" pretty much all together. Even the smallest village shows more cultural variation. There's nothing clever, provocative, interesting, visually exciting or remotely entertaining on this movie. The soundtrack is of similar quality. I can only assume that the few, over-beneficial positive reviews that this film has received, come from the blinking Michael Shanks fans who will give thumbs up to everything they do. Don't be fooled. Low budgets are not the reason for a film to fail - cheap B movies can be great. This is not one of them, and there's no reason for you to do this on your own.
