I am very disappointed because I expected a real ride, as I promised in many reviews. The script is very bad with many holes and also direction. The director unsuccessfully developed every violent scene with tension and tension. He tries to watch the thriller very hard. That is why I had to watch how each bullet was spent without making any sense to me. I always asked what movie I was watching. Then I didn't like the fact that she smoked one cigarette after another aggressively, but perhaps the film supported the tobacco industry. The end is also very disappointing. I don't understand how Jodie Foster could be nominated for a Golden Globe in this worst role of her life. Jodie, that's why I really liked PANIC ROOM or FLIGHT PLAN. This is definitely one of the worst I've ever seen. 4/10.
