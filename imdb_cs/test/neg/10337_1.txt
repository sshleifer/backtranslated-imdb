I hafta watch crap like this all the way to see if there are any redeemable qualities to justify anything, including that in my clients' library videos. Don't look at it for a moment if someone doesn't have a gun on your head. You, like me, moan and moan at least 500 times, praying that one of the one-dimensional characters who played really bad actors would turn and shoot you dead. you are the biggest fan of Sandra Bullock in the world, not worth watching two or three short scenes in which he appears. I want to kick donkeys of those slim marketing people who gave Sandra a huge picture on the face of this DVD box and let them throw in jail for attacking me or something. I really wish I had the chance to read this movie before I bought it. Please call me and I will pay you $ 10 to remove this movie from my inventory immediately. smells the whole place! (just fun - please don't say)
