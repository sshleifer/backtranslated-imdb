This movie is most likely the worst movie ever made. It's definitely the worst I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot of bad movies. There's nothing going on in the movie in this movie. You could, literally, start a movie, take a brief nap, and then wake up safely knowing nothing interesting happened during sleep. I've seen this movie three times so I'm awake. I feel like I should be congratulating. <br /> <br /> As expected, the film is as expected. Hunters catch a bigfoot baby, a parent kills him, and a nearby town gets into a crazy bigfoot. This is surprisingly boring for the release of Troma. So please do a favor and skip this movie. If you have to see it, you'll understand why.
