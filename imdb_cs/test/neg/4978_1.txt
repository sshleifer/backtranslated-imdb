When I heard that Disney has rights to "Underdog," I came to say at least that it was a great partner affair for Pixar and we would get a great movie "Adults & Kids" as "The Incredibles". Unfortunately ... I forgot how Disney has a stupid classic material for today's stupid youth. What did they think? "Underdog" was a product of the sixties, your Prime Fanbase is in their 40s and 50s, why focus on 5 years again? It was supposed to be ala "Roger Rabbit", half animated half real. Instead, we get characters like Riff Raff (WOLF !!) stupid into another dog: "Underdog" can't have an "energy pill" as we are now "enlightened" that it would of course be a steroid or drug reference. The only good casting was Patrick Warburton as "Cad" because he actually sorta resembles a cartoon version. Otherwise, old school "Underdog" fans should avoid it like it's plague. What next? Live action version of "Go-Go Gophers", disguised as a re-visionist lesson in history? (My advanced apologies if Disney jumps!)
