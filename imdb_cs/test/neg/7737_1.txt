As a native Chinese woman, I cannot accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a "better world". I said "a better world" because it is a lie that Chinese people have indoctrinated for thousands of years! I think most Western viewers don't need to know Qin Shihuang (meaning the first emperor), the king in this film is the most famous tyrant in ancient China. Tianxia (the Chinese word has been spoken by the king, means "earth and people") spoken from his mouth is absolutely a lie. From then on, one by one, the whole king spoke the same in ancient China, but very few of them did what they said. Another fact is that the Qin Shihuang Empire only lasted about twenty years ago. it was destroyed by humans. Well, I like beautiful scenes from this movie, but I can't get me to accept the idea that people should die for a bully.
