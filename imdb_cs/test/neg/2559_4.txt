Includes spoilers. British director J. Lee Thompson has made some excellent films, especially "Ice Cold in Alex" and "Cape Fear", but "Country Dance" is one of his stranger offers. The story takes place between the upper classes of rural Scotland and details of a particular triangular relationship between Sir Charles Ferguson, an eccentric aristocratic landowner, his sister Hilary and the estranged husband Hilary Douglas, who hopes to reconcile with her. We learned that during his career as an army officer, Charles was regarded as a "low moral fiber". This seems to be an accurate diagnosis of his condition; Throughout the film, Hilary and his whiskey bottle appear to be a grim disenchantment with the world, and his main sources of emotional support seem to be. The film ends with his commitment to a higher class asylum asylum. Peter O'Toole was when he was at his best place in "Lawrence of Arabia", one of the leading British actors, but the quality of his work was very uneven and "Country Dance" is not one of his better movies. Desperately overwhelming, Charles becomes a caricature of an unnecessary inbred aristocrat, as if he were involved in the Monty Python 'Upper-Twit of the Year' sketch. Susannah York as Hilary and Michael Craig as Douglas are better, but there is no outstanding performance in the film. There is also little in the way of coherent conspiracy, behind Charles's story is a relentless downward decline. A theme that doesn't dare his name. There are half-heart signs of an incestuous relationship between Charles and Hilary, or at least incestuous attractions to her on his side, and that his resistance to Douglas is motivated by sexual jealousy. Unfortunately, even in the swinging sixties and early seventies (the date of the film is variously referred to in either 1969 or 1970), there was a limit to what the British Film Censors Council was willing to permit, and the movie with an explicit incest motive was definitely beyond . (The American film title was 'brotherly love', but this was not used in Britain; was it too suggestive for BBFC sympathy?) These hints have never evolved and we never know what motivates Charles or what caused his moral collapse, ending in hollow a film with a hole in its center. 4/10
