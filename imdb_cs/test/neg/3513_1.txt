The stupid, pointless film should appeal to Southern Rednecks, teenagers with IQ bordering on retarded and average Bush followers. In this simplified scenario, Noble Willingham plays a leading role in what is and uses the generous dose of MFers, eff this and eff, and SOB. The end that I assumed was that "Save" this empty story was the biggest delay, so I was hanging and wondering, "Why"? It's a cat & mouse story or more like Bully vs. sacrifice. Don't waste your time if you don't want to ring the phone every 2 minutes and curse and shout constantly in this 123-minute dump.
