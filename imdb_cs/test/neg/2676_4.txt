"The Curse of Michael Myers" is a very frustrating piece to solve for a Halloween series fan. After a very disappointing decline in Halloween 5, the series reached almost low tide in the lines of the lines, with a silly transfer to witchcraft and a teenage cult dedicated to worshiping Michael Myers. "The Curse of Michael Myers" will resurrect ante in blood and gore, but in reality it represents a decline in the integrity of the series. It's too bad, because it's the last movie for Donald Pleasance as the character of Dr. Loomise. Pleasance has a few good moments on the screen (rare if your fan of the series) as now very old and as he says "very retired doctor". He died sadly before the film was finished, and it is clear at the end of the film that the stories of the original climate scene were never realized. Right from the start of the credits, Halloween 6 has a more sense of made-for-TV movie then that block-buster horror swing that it started as in 1978. Every loyal Halloween graduate should demand more of this movie, ... Loomis and Donald Pleasance deserve more.
