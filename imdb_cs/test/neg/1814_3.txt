Overall, the film "Heart of Darkness" was pitiful compared to the book. Anyone who has read the book and has enough understanding could see countless obvious shortcomings. There is a huge difference between them. It seems to me that the director went into a lost battle. I couldn't imagine anyone taking the monstrous task of recreating the "Heart of Darkness." The huge detail and magic of the story could not be fairly interpreted. Conrad's story had so many layers and so much depth that it would be useless to seek visual interpretation. First, capturing the details of the story is unattainable. The colossal fine points created by Joseph Conrad cannot be rightly restored by film. Marlow's feelings and emotions cannot be understood in the film anyway. If you then took on the enormous task of solving Conrad's work, you know, like me, that Conrad wrote only half the story. The other half is a series of reader connections. You, because the reader must be able to deduce and combine the ideas of Joseph Conrad. As a result, several important details are missing in the film. Also, although the film was adequate in length, the film looked short. Conrad seemed to be able to pack much more detail into 75 pages before the film could wrap in an hour and a half. The speed of the film kept the viewer from getting to know the characters. Marlow was much more unknown. The book's view takes you to Marlow's shoes. However, in the movie, you are almost watching Marlow from a distance. I began to think that the director was trying to use the same method of "reading between the lines" that Conrad did. But the connection was weak. I know that if I didn't read the book, I could by no means understand the depth of the situation and the characters. Finally, Kurtz seemed to be misinterpreted as well. His role was short and details were not included. It was impossible to understand the true Kurtz when it was shown. An important detail in the book was that Kurtz became God for the Africans. I didn't think a significant detail was defined. He also featured a mindless being in Kurtz's book. He had died long ago. I believe the director understood this detail. Instead of recreating it, he had only Kurtz around him and muttered everything. Moreover, the director seemed to be trying to make Kurtz look mysterious, but instead he seemed completely unknown. day. It seemed that it was effortlessly created and hardly at any time. The characters were stolen, key details were omitted, and the central translation was lost in translation.
