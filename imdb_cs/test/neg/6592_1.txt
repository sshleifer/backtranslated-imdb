You may suspect that the storyline of this film was written in the filming process. It starts off as a "punks versus vigilante" movie, but in the middle of the movie the story suddenly changes when vigilance turns to an honest man with his honest girl and honest gym and has to fight against corrupt "businessmen" want to work out the gym at any cost to build a shopping mall or something like that. Then the plot changes again and we have forgotten the corrupt people. The thief is now a friend of a leading man who thinks he is a Ninja. The guy becomes a "mad evil" and wants to win the Martial Arts Competition at all costs. Seeing this movie is like having a nightmare with a television on.
