Brass pictures (not suitable for them) are really grim. Their enticing visual qualities are reminiscent of expensive high-class TV commercials. But unfortunately Brass pictures are feature films with pretending to entertain viewers over two hours! In this they fail miserably, their undeniable but rather soft and flaccid than steamy, erotic qualities resilient. Senso '45 is a remake of Luchin Visconti's movie with the same name and Alida Valli and Farley Granger in the lead. The original tells the story of nonsensical love and lust in Venice and around Italy during its independence. Brass moved the action from the 19th to 20th centuries, 1945, to be precise, so there are Mussolini murals, men in black shirts, German uniforms, or torn guerrilla clothing. But it's just a window dressing, the historical context is completely negligible. Anna Galiena plays an attractive aristocratic woman who falls on an amoral SS guy who always puts too much lipstick on. She is an attractive, versatile, well-trained Italian actress and clearly over material. Her wide range of facial expressions (boredom, hate, pleasure, fear, hate ... and ecstasy) are the best reason to look at this picture and for two stars. It will endure essentially exhausted things with an amazing amount of dignity. I wish there were some really good parts for her. He really deserves it.
