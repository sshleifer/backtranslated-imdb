Ring! Ring! Have you been a horror hotline, how can we help you? Um? Yeah? Pronto! I mean hi, my name is Rugge? err, call me by my initials R.D! Well, Mr. R.D, what seems to be a problem? Well reviews of my latest film "Dial: Help" were all negative and cruel, and frankly I myself feel that even my career has seen better days. Well, Mr. R.D, and why do you think this is? With its controversial and shocking movie about the wild tribes of cannibals who engulfed the film crew and others about the relentless criminals who terrorize rich people in a house on the edge of the park, I have gained fame and deserved cult status. borrowed an idea from Wes Craven, but "Dial: Help" spins on ?? err?? Does not matter! No, Mr. R.D, go ahead and tell me what the movie is about. Um, it's about a spiritually obsessed phone line that chases a sexy model and kills people around her. I see. This assumption really sounds a little stupid and not as petrifying as cannibals or rapists, but I suppose there are deeper issues in the movie, right? Oh yeah? What do you mean? Well, isn't the phone line a symbolic for any other type of terror? Or is it all in the mind of your female heroine? No no? It's just about how the phone gets angry and murders people with a cord, vibrations, electricity or even ordinary coins. Interesting, Mr. R.D, but how do you explain all the supernatural things to the viewer at the end of the movie? You see, I thought the slow crumbling phone-mystery wouldn't be so important or relevant, so I focused on processing all the possible phone tricks I thought. Phone Tricks? What do you think? You know, like the wind blowing through the corner, the tones that penetrate the mind, and the rotary tables ejecting into the air! Very original, Mr. R.D, but not quite terrible, and as an experienced director you have to know that in the end people expect a sensible clarification of all these events. But it is! Everything is related to negative and unreleased energy, if I remember correctly! I admit it's a bit fuzzy. Hmm? I get it. Well, as they always say, a good film is based on more elements than just a story. Have you processed at least some of your regular trademarks in the movie so that your fans at least recognize your style? I tried! Sir knows I tried, but murder and bloodshed don't shock anyone! That's really a shame, Mr. R.D, but what about sex? Everyone likes a good sleaze and nudity portion in their horror movies and you thought the movie was aimed at a sexy model in danger! Yes, but ?? But what, Mr. R.D? Well, to tell you the truth, we're kind of promoting "Dial: Help" as an erotic thriller with revealing shots of Charlotte Lewis on the cover, but in reality there is no sex in the movie and Charlotte even refused to go topless. Mr. R.D! Now I'm really disappointed, it's just shameless tearing people and luring them with false promises! I know, I know, and I'm ashamed, but I wanted everyone to rent "Dial: Help" and love it! Well, to round you up, I can comfort you by saying that every major director has the right to make a few wrong decisions without affecting his career immediately, but next time he'll be more careful and do some research first, all right, Mr. R.D? I will; Thank you! You're welcome. Tell me, do you have any ideas for upcoming movies? Yeah, like a thing, me! I was thinking about doing Giallo with a murder machine! Isn't that a fascinating sound? Hi? Hi?
