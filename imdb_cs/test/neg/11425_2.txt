A rather frightening venture suggests that Welsh is an infantile artist, helplessly attracted to a violent environment he knows best, but unable to resist simple sophistication rooted in a banal imagination. The first story is ham-fisted, absurd trudge with a B-movie science fiction premise. The second achieves some honesty, but only through an excessive increase in humiliation attended by his central character. The third and most vulnerable seems to be associated with being a dislocated sequel to Child's Play. The direction is consistently helpless - the whole whirling sound and fury, the slave of extreme annoyance; suffocation in poorly chosen musical score and in indifferently acting acting. It is an absolute stupidity that goes beyond guerrilla sensibility - as arbitrary and hollow as abstract images that link three sections.
