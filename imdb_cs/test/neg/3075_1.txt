Years ago I caught quite a well done television movie called "Linda". It was made in 1973, and starred Stella Stevens in a femme fatale role title. Imagine my surprise when I saw ten years later that the same story happened on late night television. However, it was this 1993 version, starring Virginia Madsen. Don't get me wrong, I can handle remakes, even the unclear ones. But this misspelled and badly filmed repetition bothered me both Madsen and Richard Thomas. Unlike the original, there is a clich√© dialogue, so I wondered, "Why did they bother to rewrite it?" Secondly, working with the camera is very difficult and the film composition is bad. Sometimes I remembered the student film competition at the beginning of Christopher Guest's "The Big Picture". Finally, the cast looks either bored (Madsen) or suffering (Thomas). The only one who really looks to enjoy the job is Ted McGinley. Of course, with his perfectly coifed hair and closed teeth, he is really pulling himself from his previous work on "The Love Boat". Bottom line, borrow criticism from Opus Penguin in Bloom County: "This movie does for the movie Jonestown did for Kool-Aid." <br /> <br /> Thomkat
