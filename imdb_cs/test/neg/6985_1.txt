First, the initial concept of lost wealth in the gold bars discovered in New Zealand's lake, inside a downed aircraft of World War II, is a great opening. What follows is nothing but a cartoon like a drivel. Men chasing men, cars chasing men, helicopters chasing men, helicopters chasing boats, boats chasing boats, for a better part of the clock, the most boring nonsense, with absolutely no progress to the story. Particular attention must be paid to adjusting the chop shop because many scenes seem to have been linked in random order. All those involved are embarrassed. One last thing, image quality and sound quality is so bad on this DVD that you'll be horrified. - MERK
