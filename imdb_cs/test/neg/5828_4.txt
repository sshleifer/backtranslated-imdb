Overall, it's a children's film. We saw it tonight and my child loved it. My baby's excitement was so great that sitting wasn't possible. But I'm a big fan of A.A. Milne's books, which are very subtle and hide the strange intelligence behind the child's quality of their leading characters. This film wasn't soft. It's a pity that Disney does not see the benefit of making multiple story movies on this site, even though they may not be allowed to use them. I wished the theater to replay "Winnie-Pooh and Tigger" instead. The characters of the characters were very good. I really bothered Kang. Music, however, was twice as vocal in parts than dialogue, and disparate to film. <br /> <br /> As for the story, it was a bit preaching and militant tone. Overall, I was disappointed, but I would go again just to see the same excitement on my baby's face. I liked Lumpy's laughter.
