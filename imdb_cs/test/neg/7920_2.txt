First, it destroys it with a uniquely poor quality animation, then gets voices that don't sound like the original. They make sooo many film mistakes. When Sasha sings in Count Me Out, the drummer disappears and then reappears, Itchy's shirt changes color, his hat still changes position, one of the bridges is white, each in the background seems thick, halos change colors and appear and disappear. . Even the sky looks different. I have no hell, if it's a low budget movie, they shouldn't cut their horns on the animation. They completely destroyed the first ADGTH. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack.
