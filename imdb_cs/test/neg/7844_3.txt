Burt Reynolds plays Gator McKlusky, a sympathetic ex-convict who was released from prison and who helps the federal sheriffs charge the sheriff. Laid-back Reynolds were often criticized by critics only to telephone these 'good ol' boys' performances in; True, he's on autopilot. But Reynolds knew how to make a modest effort for his job. The friendly and handsome Reynolds comes as close to the audience as possible without breaking up; He seems to know these backwoods as well as all movie stars, while director Joesph Sargent provides an easy pace and sweaty atmosphere that brings south alive. Unfortunately, the story is not much, and supporting actors Ned Beatty and Bo Hopkins overact (as usual). Diane Ladd is fine in a small piece and Laura Dern, a real daughter, can be seen in the background. Reynolds returned to this character for 1976's "Gator". * 1/2 from ****
