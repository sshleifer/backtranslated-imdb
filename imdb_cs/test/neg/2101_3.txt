When I rented it, I didn't expect them to blow me out. I knew it would be terrible. It was just to see how awful it really was. This is what comes with a low budget horror movie. "Snakes On A Train", not to be confused with the serpentine summer blockbuster "Snakes On A Plane" with Samuel L. Jackson, is about a woman who is put under a Mayan curse that makes her the snakes hatch in it and devour it from within. Her only hope of survival lies in a shaman who lives across the border, so she and her stowway companion go to a train heading for Los Angelas. Comfort a few passengers and cheerfulness follows. They figured out, but the story isn't bad. He's not even half good, either. Playing in this opponent's movie, Sci-Fi Original, if not worse. Believe me, it's terrible. Another problem was snakes. They were supposed to be rattacers, I think, but most of what you get are mostly harmless garden snakes who don't attack anything and there's this hoarse sound effect that's really annoying. The gore effects on the other hand, though not at Tom Savini's level, were actually pretty good. And another thing, the end itself makes up the rest of the movie. I'm not going to talk about it here, so you'll have to rent it and see for yourself.
