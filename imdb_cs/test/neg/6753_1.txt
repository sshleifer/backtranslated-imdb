This so-called film is terrible! Actors can't act. There is no conspiracy. I believe you need to start from scratch and film again. I hope they can fix the mistakes in this movie. I'd like to see the trailer after it fires again. Maybe there's hope. I'm not from hurting feelings, but I believe that high school kids can do a better job. The cabinet could have been much better. Sorry, but that wasn't for me. I normally get trailers from this site, but ... I can't find this fun. I hope they take the criticism well because I believe they will have much more from others in connection with this film.
