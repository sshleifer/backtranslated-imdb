I rented this movie because the DVD cover seemed to be a ridiculous comedy like a van wilder or an animal house. I took it to my friend's house to watch a movie night. In the end, we stopped the movie for 15 minutes and followed Copper Mountain instead. I don't know if any of you saw Copper Mountain, but it's not great either. But I have to say that Alan Thick Jim Carrey Duo made him a more fun watch. <br /> <br /> Later I finished Puddle Cruiser. This film was slow and humor was forced. This film reminded me of some stinking substances I saw in some of my former production classes at college. I stayed wondering, "Was it a movie that made Broken Lizard do Supertroopers?" Also, how could this film suck so badly? Supertroopers was good and Club Dread was decent. Don't see this movie!
