STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh Harlan Banks (Steven Seagal) ....... aaaaahhhh, you get it) is a modern day Robin Hood (listen close, you can hear Brian Adams's music playing in the background ... no, not really), a kind of guy who steals badly collected money from merchants with drugs and uses them to maintain open children's homes. But now he was approached to run a Las Vegas robbery in one of the last things before retiring. Of course it all goes wrong and he falls for heels for big boys upstairs and in jail. Here he meets a named guy (though you wouldn't know he should pay attention to the movie) Ice Cool (Treach), with whom he fights and ends up getting out of jail. Once free, he would have to prove his innocence, find the missing money and, of course, those who framed him! Most of all, he belongs to the cinema, even with the rap star as his star as his previous films Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds. Yes, he does not seem to be making movies about how to care for the environment he pretends to be black and playmates with rappers. But TYD is not a movie and it is a luxury A big man will never have fun again until Under Siege 3 (if ever!) <br /> <br /> The film opens with a neat, polished look that commands attention but everything quickly descends downhill. Once Seagal hits the prison, the plot quickly loses consistency. Indeed, Treach's character seems to emerge out of nowhere without any introduction as his sidekick, and from there you quickly lose interest. <br /> <br /> That's it. I know I said it before, but I think I think this time. I don't think I'll give any more of these Seagal movies anytime. I honestly have no enthusiasm to watch Shadow Man at all. In fact, I can honestly say that I haven't really taken advantage of ANY of his STV movies until now, and today Die Die is no exception, an apathetic, boring effort that everyone should avoid. *
