My first impression of Saikano: Live Action trailer was "Wow, that might be one of the few better adaptations to live action". This time I was just wrong! Simply put, the live Saikano movie was a puzzle that lacked several pieces; together just enough to get a vague idea into it. The story of the film vaguely follows anime and manga, but the film story is just a car frame, rather than a complete car. It seems that many parts of the story originally in the anime have been omitted, altered, or completely changed. In fact, the end is completely different from manga or anime ending. <br /> <br /> Especially characters; many missed or had a different feeling. The connection between Fuyumi and Shuji is reduced to that of Shuji knowing her because she is a video rental company. The character of Chise was already feeling too strong and just made an infamous apology I apologized several times in the movie. The same can be said with Shuji. We've lost a shy, yet tall man's lead, a song he hums, and his frequent actions, calling Chise stupidly. Other characters, such as Tetsu and Akemi, had a different, relaxed feel to them. Maybe dropping and toning other characters was much more focused on Chise and Shuji, which he did. Too much. Do you expect a lot of sweet action scenes like those in the trailer? Oh no! Those in the trailer plus a few minutes is the only amount you get. So much film tells me that when I went through the movie before I watched it, I thought I got a regular Asian romantic drama. <br /> <br /> Stimulation was too fast. In the film, we see the famous Chise scene armed with small wings and a chain arm in less than nine minutes from the start. There is very little time to get to know the characters and connect with them. What they were supposed to do was split into two movies or even a trilogy. If it weren't so many things would have to be changed or dropped. However, the movie is like a frame. Anime was rather a complete car, because even though all the little things and such little things can really add up. <br /> <br /> * PRODUCTION * <br /> <br /> -Visuals- Visuals were disappointing. So many of the special effects turned out to be quite cheesy, especially CGI. Sadly, they were like those found on Sci-Fi movies. They are bearable and this film is not for effects. <br /> <br /> -Music- Music was average. Much of that was orchestral background music, except there were really no themes. The film dropped an addictive song that Shuji always buzzed in the anime. A visible piece of music is but the final song, heard in the trailer. It's not a bad and somewhat beautiful song. It is a pity that it was not integrated into the film itself or as an orchestral version of the song. - Saikano was like that. The main star was actor Chises Aki Maeda, who is his most famous role in Battle Royale. The actor who played Shuji was quite good, but they took glasses from the original character. Yeah, and Tetsuo looks like Lupine the third. Unlike what I've heard from several others, acting in Saikano's live action wasn't that bad. Rather, I feel that this is the way the story was unloaded and imitated in a two-hour film. <br /> <br /> * What can be learned from Saikano's live action: * <br /> <Br /> - CGI- I really wish CGI in Saikano wasn't that bad. But even with that we could get a few more battle scenes! Probably the most anticipated live action anime adaptation of Neon Genesis Evangelion is unlikely to suffer because they are currently assigned to perform effects on WETA Studios. <br /> <br /> -Modernism- Fuyumi owned a video store. Chise used an audio cassette player to listen to music and gave Shuji a mix tape for his birthday. Why? This film is made in 2006! Not only can they create such a thing as Chise in reality movies, so it can't take place in the 1990s! The future is the age of CDs, DVDs and MP3 players. Hopefully, in Evangelion Shinji will have a Sony Walkman MP3 player. It is NOT the one that plays cassette tapes. <br /> <br /> -Story & Pacing- As mentioned earlier, the film Saikano moved too fast and forced the story to release many details. It was a handy step after ADV Films and anyone else to make Evangelion a solid trilogy, allowing more time for the story to be as original as possible. <br /> <br /> -Characters- character designs themselves and let these classic quotes be said! What if the live action of Evangelion didn't have Asuka "What are you, stupid?" or Shinji "I must not escape!" Sometimes as small as they seem, these frequent quotes add and are who the characters are. CONCLUSION: * <br /> <br /> All in all, Saikano's live action has had the potential. Really. Those who are not fans and see this movie: you will be reluctant to start anime or manga (so don't watch the movie first!) People who have seen and liked anime / manga do not get their hopes up on this. Studies show that you will most likely be disappointed. It was still fun to see anime come to life in a live action adaptation, but it could have been much more. Reluctantly, I give live Saishu Heiki Kanojo (Saikano) 2 out of 5. <br /> <br /> As Chise says, "I'm sorry" <br /> <br /> ~ NekoTakuto
