What might have been a good story has been destroyed by the ridiculous time travel scenario. If something had changed in the past that would change development and people would never develop, the time machine would never have been built. If something of the past were brought to the present, it would not affect the past. <br /> <br /> I really want movie producers to lead their ideas around a real scientist before they complete the script. Even if you suspend reality and assume that you can travel through time, you have to stick to logic. OTOH, Ben Kingsley seemed to have a great time with his performance. All the other actors seemed to do their best. It was writing that let them circulate in the wind. <br /> <br /> "Back to the Future" did better.
