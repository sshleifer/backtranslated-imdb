I grew up in the 1990s; therefore, you must understand that I have witnessed firsthand the greatest DCOM prime ministers. I was there when Brink! Zenon, Halloweentown, Johnny Tsunami, etc. appeared. These films represent my childhood. When these movies came, not just me, but anyone I watched would be in awe at 1:30, talking about it for a week to catch him next weekend. I don't think words can express the amount of excitement Zoog Disney has brought. Although I watch them now, the dialogue doesn't seem so bad (in fact it's so effective that I remember parts of the conversations literally word for word, from the movies I've seen ten years ago). The characters are believable, funny, a little stereotypical, but that's what makes Disney's magic ... <br /> <br /> I put my little brother in front of the Disney Channel to try and communicate my feelings for DCOM. I enter the suburbs ... my brother asked me slightly confused if I was always gay. I feel more disappointed and betrayed than what I could compare with that? When Han Solo found out that Lando had sold it to Vader ... Half of the film, and I'm not over, it's flashbacks. There is no talent in these young actors (some of whom are older than me). The story is ridiculous; It's like a bunch of old rotting corporate people at Disney sitting around the table and asking themselves, "How can we these young people seem hip?" Well, maybe all DCOMs were like that, but at least they tried not to realize we thought we were complete idiots. And apparently this type of movie works ... Stuck in the Suburbs is rated almost as much as Zenon or Airborne. How is this possible? DCOMs are even more curly and people prefer them now? (though apparently the lack of a curse of words is enough to give it 10/10 for some people) Christ, it is a completely different generation.
