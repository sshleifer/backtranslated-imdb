Now I like Bollywood movies and I am very happy that they have recently gained success in the UK. But Suneel Darshan's last effort is a profoundly flawed film from start to finish. The idea of ​​modernly styled Bollywood on Amadeus was quite exciting, that is, until two supposed musicians appear. they look like they never touch a piece of manuscript in their life. Upen Patel is a very good looking man and the film plays to his narcissistic feelings, but he is never believable as a modern Mozart. As for acting, all he can do is stand there and tie. His expressions, hair and clothes look the same, including a scene where he is supposed to be "dying" when he actually seems to have nothing but sniffing. Bobby Deol, playing the role of Salieri, does everything in his power to revive a small wooden scenario, but, unfortunately, he just comes across a little angry when he is supposed to be jealous of jealousy. Bollywood movies are widely renowned for their stunning set-pieces and color schemes, but Shaklaka looks like a drab BBC drama reproduction. In fact, the closest thing Shakalaka comes to is Hollyoaks, as it ruthlessly hides a really bad script for beautiful people looking for, well, beautiful. "He has not yet reached mediocrity" - the same can be said about totally forgotten songs. In short, Darshan's last bid doesn't have a boom, bang, wallop, or twang. Instead, just plods along with the head held low hoping to grab your attention with a soft tap on the shoulder. And that's not good enough at all.
