Last autumn (2001) I graduated from a film class taught by the director of this film (Mark Hoeger). His extensive filmmaking skills, his ability to dismantle any movie scene and his Oscar victory in some dark categories, seemed to give him more credibility than the average independent film director. When he mentioned during one of his classes that he had just finished directing a film called "Full Ride" and was in post-production stages, my interest was impressed. But that would be the last thing I ever heard about this film project. Last week ... <br /> <br /> Last week I saw "Full Ride" on the WB network on the TV show. This immediately picked up the red flag because I can't help but connect WB with teensploitation shows such as Dawson Creek, Charmed, etc. PLUS, the fact that Full Ride is going to be released directly to TV wasn't too flattering itself. But yet I put that time down and sat down to look at the work of my former film teacher. After two hours of ending credits, I started thinking long and hard about what I had. saw. What I just saw was a typical WB show that lasted for two hours. In fact, it almost looked like this movie was made with the sole intention of just pointing at the WB network. To criticize this film will essentially be a critique of a typical WB show. <br /> <br /> Where to start? The characters are shallow, the story is cliché in every sense of the word, the scenes are totally invented, and character development is forced and incredible. This movie just screams "unoriginal". The main character, Matt Sabo, is some hot blow on the wrong side of the songs (literally) that plays solid high school football as a fullback, but then fizzles into the life of the crime. He is then offered a chance at full driving scholarship instead of going to prison. Obviously, without much choice, he agrees to play football with a stellar football team, but is not expelled by his peers because of his bad team spirit and bad attitude. Then comes the love of interest. Of course! Where would this predictable fanfare be without love interest? She arrives in the form of Amy Lear (played by beautiful Meredith Monroe). She is actually a likable character, unlike ever so harsh Matt Sabo, so we almost applauded her when she first refused him. Of course, it will inevitably happen. He falls on him, changes his attitude to everything and everything seems good and happy. But now is the time for conflict! Earlier in the movie, Amy makes it clear to Matt that he doesn't want to score with him because it would be shameful for her and her mother. That's a lot of Matt's dismay and his football friends (yes, they'll warm up to him) who bet him not to get him. Of course, Matt comes to accept these conditions and decides it's not all about nookie. Here is where the exciting plot grows. If you do not want me to destroy this surprise, then jump forward. Matt discovers some local guys that apparently Amy Lear is always trying to score a man every year from the All-Star team to try use it to escape from a small city life in a cafe (which is first confused) and get into the big city. He suddenly realized that he was being used and that his love was false, and so he tried to return to the life of the crime and leave the football camp before the "big game". Amy tries to make sure he was really in love this time, but he's too keen to buy her. What will Matt do? Will he take her back? Or will he return to stealing gas stations and be a versatile jerk? I will not destroy you super-ultra-surprising end. So, if I pumped you in some way, be aware that it was my sarcasm and not the true enthusiasm. This movie is an uninspired version of "Varsity Blues" or "Summer Catch". And it doesn't say much. It is hard to save the comedy and the characters are too shallow to care for them. So what's left? It's not a lot. What I didn't like most about the film was how much the unflattering image of Hoeger painted Nebraska over this film. He seems to have tried to capture the essence of rural Nebraska and teenage life in small towns, but his approach is too stereotyped and shallow. The high hopes of characters in the “big city” and the actions they have done are greatly exaggerated, and it just continues to cement the stereotype of Nebraskans is a bunch of pups living in agricultural communities. I'm not sure whether Hoeger's intentions were good at trying to put his home state in focus, but I think he ended up with a very shameful product. If Hoeger wanted to portray Nebraska in a favorable light, he should have taken note of two of Alexander Payne. While Payne simply decided to use Nebraska as the backdrop for his films, Hoeger integrates it into a Full Ride conspiracy, becoming entangled in the consciousness where he shoots, ending with shallow trash that seems to come from an outsider. If Hoeger really lived here, he'd think he would know better. All in all, I am totally disappointed with Hoeger's first big film and I hope that next time he can combine his knowledge with a little originality to create something different and provocative.
