Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) is a college student with some serious anger problems. His family was brutally murdered when he was a child monster, and now he took his anger at everything and everyone. So when his professor (Robert Englund) begins to show signs of monsterism, he is taught that he must control his anger and use it for good instead of evil, and fight the creatures that haunt his nightmares from that fate night. Really earns a B rating, but what was cool was that it wasn't focused on the crappy B-rated CGI graphics. In fact, 0% of the film was CGI. The monsters were actually put together, and although the story was missing, it was somewhat observable ... if only once.
