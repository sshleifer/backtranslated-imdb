What did they think when they did this really TERRIBLE movie? Arbus, one of the most important photographers and women of the twentieth century, had a fascinating and dramatic life. What did anyone possess to make this film, which explains her unique artistic vision, as a result of a (imaginary) affair with a grotesque but charismatic hairy freak (played by Downey)? In real life, Arbus broke out a traditional marriage and the role of a woman expressing herself. In this film, Arbus is the ultra-light Nicole Kidman, whose inspiration is attributed to the devotion of "Beauty and the Beast" to an interesting person. <br /> <br /> The film is really shameful for this reintegration. Regardless, it is also just dopey and boring.
