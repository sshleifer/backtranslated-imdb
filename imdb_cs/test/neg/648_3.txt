"I assume you are here to damage your mental system." - VAL <br /> <br /> Mike Nelson watched me ... he mentioned it in his book "Movie Megacheese". I asked myself, "Why would Mike Nelson make me wrong?" Now I know why the shoes never trusted Mike Nelson. Music is John Williams, who is probably part of his payment to the devil. In fact, I'm sure everyone who has worked on this film is probably in the league with ol 'Slewfoot, or is now cursed, from the executive director to the guy who ran the catering car outside the studio. Don't look ... for the love of God ... don't look !!! Even copying and showing someone else won't disappoint you ... I'm condemned now, I get it. I accept it. But save yourself ...
