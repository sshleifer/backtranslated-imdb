I had no idea that this movie was made by "WWE". The match is so weak. Why did they have to halve their name by making the film miserable because it was? I found it a complete disappointment. If I had known this movie would be as stupid as it was, I would stay at home and do something fun. Sure, I'll give them credit for great effects; but the killer didn't seem as scary as him. He misses a lot of things. But let me show them to you. The plot was a great idea, it could have been done much better. Maybe in the future, WWE will stick to its moronic struggle and stay away from the film industry.
