I told my friend how my grandfather actually chose that awful piece of crap so we could see one night in the theater. He has never chosen another! It was so bad! My friend then told me that her father had done something for this waste. I thought he was kidding. It turned out to be serious. She had never seen it and she said it quickly stopped her father's writing career. I told her not to waste time. But if she really broke down and watched, she would see in the first minute why it ended her father's days as a writer. Even for the 1980s, this crap is beyond description. Joe Frazier as Terrible Tucker? And why in the world should two cops look after a house full of ghosts? And a movie poster? Ghost with tongue out? What is it about? Nothing makes sense. I told my friend that this bullshit not only ended her father's career, but ended all those involved. Or at least none of them ever fully recovered from being in this waste. Let's say I'll forever mock my friend for telling me that her father was the writer of this movie! That in itself should tell you how bad it is!
