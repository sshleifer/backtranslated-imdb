Don't look anymore, this is the worst movie he ever made. There may be others who are tied but not worse. It can't be there. <br /> <br /> I found this movie at a check-in laserdisc for $ 3.25, and thought no movie with these actors might be worth the price. It turns out it's worth three times that - as a minimum, they should pay me to watch it. I'm pretty sure the girl on the cover picture isn't the girl in the movie, they replaced someone else, someone younger and cuter to make it look more attractive. Whatever "plot" was there for about three minutes of the actual movie, the rest is a filler. And I don't think the kind of fill that you realize is a fill when it's over, or is there some kind of eye candy that doesn't matter there, I mean the filler that thinks about your shopping list. I think "music" had to be made with a friend who once listened to the radio. It's scary. If the shot was a nice mountain, a river valley, a forest, anything, there would be something positive about this movie. It's not. Even when using the remote control's quick-control button, even at peak laser speeds, you can't get it with enough speed. After years of thinking about commentaries on movies that are tempted, but not when using IMDb, I'm finally cracked because I had to do my part to push the user down on this stinking down , if possible. <br /> <br /> Instructions to make you "focus on content and context". I can not. There is not enough content to focus on, and that is exactly my opinion. Sometimes bad is just bad, and this movie would have to be a lot better than aspiring to be just that.
