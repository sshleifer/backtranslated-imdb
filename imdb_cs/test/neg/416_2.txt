Ron Howard and his "editors" had only one job ... Follow the book's instructions, which were "rich", "mysterious", "moving" and highly cinematic in their approach! <br /> <br /> What did they do? They changed everything and I think everything! There remains something that has no right to be called "angels and demons"! I really like the book and it's very hard to see it being treated! I wonder what Dan Brown's view of "this" movie was. <br /> <br /> I really have no patience to sit down and make 1,000,000 changes they've made, it's useless .......
