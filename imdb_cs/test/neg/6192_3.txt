It is a film that sheds light on the begging of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Palestine, but does not show the real feelings of people in the past and how they were deceived into believing that they will soon return to their home, not mentioning the massacres of Jews like Der Yassine and how torturing and killing and destroying the family of any Palestinian freedom fighter who lacks credibility about a true Palestinian struggle and all that the Palestinians have, but has something about suffering Palestinian citizens have ended up as refugees in neighboring Arab countries, the film focuses on the story of a man in a coma, which is now and through our story we see a movie. The film is just telling the life of one person and has some nudity scenes that are irrelevant to the story.
