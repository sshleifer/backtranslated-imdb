this movie is pretty bad, aggressive, not playing well, it's not well directed, it seems low budget, low quality, emotionally weak and disconnected. after watching earlier comments, he went to see it, but if you try to compare it with apocalypse, PLATOON, or others, u'r really out of the way. this film looks like an old and purely filmed 60s film with the cast of grown Neanderthals, not to mention (or actually do), not paying attention to details such as changing bikes, low budget fireworks and all sorts of badly twisted features. is observable, though he would like to see it as an early development of a film document .. not come back !! <br /> <br /> p.s - Finally, the guys are fine.
