Director Jeremiah Checheck, who has brought us great budget debates such as "The Avengers" and the remake of "Diabolique", directed this ripoff concept of Die Hard, which he did - what it looks like - the Blair Witch budget. The California nuclear reactor is overcharged by Arab terrorists. But - are you ready? - terrorists are not Arabs; they are really dissatisfied American masquerade soldiers like Arabs! We will find that they do not intend to blow up the reactor. We are not sure what a statement is, but it does not matter. So there really is no threat. But then one of the terrorists decides to go alone and actually throw out the plant because it's a little crazy. So maybe there's a threat. But the army goes in and all the militants are killed. So there was no threat. And also a good kid is killed. Make it a lesson for everyone. <br /> <br /> If all these sounds are confused and a bit of a waste of time, then you got an idea of ​​what it is to track crashes. <br /> <br /> The script never bothered to introduce characters or give any personal information that could displace or emotionally involve the audience. So we stayed with one dimensional figure: expert-to-nobody-will-listen; sergeant-trigger; slime politicians; -dweeby-engineers. The story jumps from one cliché incident to another in a composition made up of virtually every action movie you've ever seen. But on almost every turn, only when we think something can be at stake, the scene shrinks and we find out that nothing really happens. As Die Hard, there is a policeman who is inside, unbenownst to the bad guys. The big twist is that the cop is ... WOMAN! Oh and he's hurt too. But not so badly, just enough to call her a few times. And instead of the radio that Bruce Willis had the cop, he has a magical cell phone that works everywhere ... even underground! When she doesn't tell everyone else, Bruce Greenwood - his granite jaw - tries to calm her over the radio. He even jokes once, but we are afraid his face might burst. After all, this is a serious thing. But mostly it is a scene after the scene of people who argue: A military expert is arguing that it will wait (his argument does not seem strange, but to be a clever guy in this movie and okaaaay); the White House people argue with him; the army sergeant also argues with him; a handsome Pakistani nuclear engineer argues with a major terrorist. Dialogue is absolutely B Film all the way and lines like, "stop broadcasting! STOP BROADCAST !!!" He may have you rolling away from the couch as you think the characters are actually referring to this stupidity. Maybe to compensate for the lack of quality camera-work production is to keep the nervous in that faux document 21 Grams style that is to lend immediacy and energy to scenes, but the way it is indiscriminately and amateurly applied is absolutely unpleasant; even pretentious. Other attempts to speed up the pace are made by including a nonsensical black-and-white record that is accidentally interrupted by the main action. But even this is a bit annoying and annoying in Blair's witch. In short, stylistic experiments look very amateurish. <br /> <br /> Music goes into visuals - it's a synthetic and inexpensive sound. A bit like a porn movie, but with less tunes and lots of other beats. The graphic treatment is also howling badly: kitschy graphics in huge red font are shouting "9:28 pm" as if timeclock really made a difference. Meltdown can act as a marketing concept, but it's clear that the script was the second idea. FX - part of Fox - put this kitsch production together and dropped a few million dollars on it. Now what I say collapse!
