During my childhood, I saw the first three "Critters" movies and enjoyed them "em.They were fun and fun horror comedies ideal for adventurous horror loving kids. I never saw" Critters 4 ", so I finally decided to look at it My the verdict: a forgotten and pretty bad movie with a strikingly low number of bodies The script of Joseph Lyle and David J. Schowe is predictable and clich√©, ripple rip "Alien" and "Star Wars" and sets look dim and dark The tone of the film seems deadly serious "Critters 4" was probably such a low budget that filmmakers couldn't afford any optical effects, those that were taken from "Android" looked serious.
