It's like a zoology textbook, given that its depiction of animals is so accurate. However, here are some details that seem to be slightly modified during the transition to the movie: <br /> <br /> - Spherical weapons never hit the giant of Komodo Dragon. No matter how many times you shoot at Komodo, bullets just don't go close to him. The best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra or a giant dragon, Komodo, is just to stand there. The exception to this rule is if you were told to stay very calm, in which case you should run away until Komodo is right next to you, and then you should stand there and wait for defeat. <br /> <br /> - Minutes from jerky slow motion credits actually contribute to enjoyable viewing. $ 5,000 is a memory enhancement tool and ample replacement for shipping / arrest licenses. > <br /> - Elite Army troops do not see giant Komodo dragons until they are one meter away from excessive beings. Maybe the computer nature of these dragons has something to do with it. <br /> <br /> - When filming a news story to uncover illegal animal tests, a single camera reporter and cameraman is all the equipment and staff you need; audio equipment, second camera, microphones, etc. are superfluous. <br /> <br /> - When you hear a loud scream of animals and one person has a gun, he should pull it out and point it to the nearest person. <br /> <br /> - When you take a gun, the sound will be unlocked, even if your finger is nowhere near security. - Reporters agree to go in the middle of the world to uncover something - without being the weakest idea of ​​what they reveal. Background research and unclear knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism. - Guns hold at least 52 rounds in one clip and then the other. Nevertheless, those with weapons claim they will need more ammunition. <br /> <br /> - Expensive cameras (also, remember that a reporter has only one camera) to be regularly left without even a moment of hesitation or regret. These cameras will return amazingly to the reporter themselves. - Blonde is really stupid. - The same girl who doesn't go to the house because the Komodo dragon can easily walk through him, making him dangerous, takes the team to the building of the same material for protection - and no one says a word about it . <br /> <br /> - High-tech devices look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets. - Genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to 100 feet long in one day, but don't grow at all. in weeks on both sides. - The army routinely destroys entire islands when people do not meet contact deadlines. Men with weapons do not necessarily change direction shoots when their target is no longer in front of them. Instead, they just shoot in the air. <br /> <br /> - The better you are, the greater the chance of surviving a giant creature. Female Intuition is Reliable enough to change Even the toughest minds. <br /> <br /> - Whenever you are hunted by giant creatures, it's a great time to hit girls half your age. Animal Sounds are a suitable camouflage noise for "swearing" in the same volume. Old Israeli and Russian aircraft are regularly used by US military equipment.
