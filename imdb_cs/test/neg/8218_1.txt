The movie starts with a lot of voice-over, bad sign. Then it just slips down the hill with silly and intelligently offensive scenes that include hunters and Indians. However, it reaches new and impressive lows when all the merry men on the mountain terrain dance on a high mountain meadow. Meanwhile, happy Indians sit down and watch them. It's a better scene than a dancing cowboy in "Blazing Saddles". There is a small error in this comparison; "Across Missouri" is not a comedy. <br /> <br />
