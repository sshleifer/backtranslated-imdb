Sherman Hemsley was great in the Jeffersons and especially everyone in the family. He was also very good at Amen, why would he do this movie? This film has a terrible script and is a waste of a very funny person. Luis Avalos does everything in his power, but that's terrible. This film was the beginning of the bankruptcy for Sherman Hemsley. I think he's very funny, but it's a terrible, horrible nonsense story. Stick to Ghostbusters.
