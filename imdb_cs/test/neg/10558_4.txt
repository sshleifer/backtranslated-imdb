What is a casting ... and what a waste. Seriously, when the film has Gabriel Byrne, Jamie Foxx, Thandie Newton, Stuart Townsend, Hal Holbrook, Melanie Griffith and Sylvester Stallone in it, you can expect some quality. But the film is one big mess with an unlikely story that couldn't stop it from spinning. Yeah, I think they thought they were really smart with everything. The story is not only chaotic and unlikely, but it is not entirely original. It uses elements from earlier and much better poker-based movies. But for me it was really a lot of nonsense twisting and turning in the movie he did. That made the story so unlikely he could watch. In addition, the script remains filled with lots of stupid poker holes and things that just don't make a terrible sense. Why would anyone want to play against a card player who is known to be the best cheater in the game. This is what the movie is about and puts on, but it just never made much sense to me. Despite the fact that the film has a great cast, it still feels like most of the actors are in their roles. I don't know what it is about Stuart Townsend. He is a good actor, but in most roles he always plays on the spot. Maybe it's his views, I don't know. That was also the reason why he was replaced by "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring". Thandie Newton is also not very good and quite uncomfortable in her "strong" female role. And what was it like that was Melanie Griffith? Oh, I think I could go about the movie of his casting and could complain that even a few others about how much limited time screen Jamie Foxx character gets, but I think you get my point now. Damian Nieman is simply not a very original writer / director, and also does not treat his own material very well. Scenes often feel discontinuous, trying to put too many characters, and everything about film is shallow and predictable. Except that the movie contains some bad adjustments at times, which also does not help make this movie look like a seamless whole. The film was also one of the main boxers and it's no wonder Damian Nieman hasn't made the film ever since. Too much mess you like this movie. <br /> <br/> 4/10
