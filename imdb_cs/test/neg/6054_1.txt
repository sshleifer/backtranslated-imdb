"Embarassing" is the only word that describes this sad horrible production. From unscrupulous disregard for source material (surely annoyed by someone who is remotely familiar with mythology) to a predictably insufficient production value, this entire mini-series is a train wreck. the actors with whom I regret provide an illogical dialogue in the same generic "European" accent that is common to bad epics. Worse is the lack of originality in almost all other aspects, from costume and scenography (blurring styles from time and space) to scores (which seems to be a poor imitation of many recognizable classical melodies and "Lord of the Rings"). Most of the attacks are all visual effects that unilaterally prove that if you can't afford to do it, WAPITE THEM OUT. cheap "adaptation". Maybe one day someone will do it right.
