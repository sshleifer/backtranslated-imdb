Man, it's lousy. It doesn't deserve much in the way of commentary, so to make it concise, Rebecca DeMornay is a highly disciplined police psychiatrist who falls on the Latin Lover Antonio Banderas in a wine shop, he ponytail and a prison house tattoo. When released, he really relaxes. Other than the annoying thing he has (and we have to admit that the matter has speed bumps) is a pretty cold fish. Her broke, the ailing father first appears after years and throws him out. He is also adept at keeping a horny neighbor upstairs (Dennis Miller) at bay. And there is a prisoner, Harry Dean Stanton, who is trying to maneuver her to give him a diagnosis of multiple personality disorders, so he won't have his soldiers nailed to the wall for the serial murders he committed. <br /> <br /> All these people, and perhaps more, are immediately suspicious when strange things happen to her. Someone will send her dead flowers. Someone is doing unspeakable things for their cat. (Next time I see a pet appearing in a parcel or slipping into a closet or cooking in a pot, I'm going to throw up.) So who does it? Guess. No power on Earth could force me to reveal the end, but maybe it will help you: child abuse. An apology about abuse is an interesting thing in itself, much more interesting than a movie. What does "child abuse" mean? Do we mean sexual abuse? Physical? Both? How about slamming a boy over his back with a wooden cooking spoon, hard enough to break it? This is what happened to me and my brother when we were kids, just as similar things happened to all the other guys in the neighborhood. Sexual Abuse? This has never happened in any of us as far as I know, although I'm not sure it would be rejected with any degree of animation. I studied for two years in Samoan, one case of a teenage boy who played sexually with a much younger girl. The girls went hell out of him. The boy's family sent him to live with another family family in another village, an exile that lasted two years. Before he returned the incident, everyone forgot it, including the baby. (By the way, the little girl we see here is less than five years old, so it is unlikely she would remember her dad's night visits in any case, because long-term memory is not really introduced until then.) DeMornay's experience of her mental the disorder can be called "social trauma construction". It's not there if we don't put it there. Enough psychiatric lecture. That'll be fifteen cents. <br /> <br /> Want trauma? I'll give you a trauma. The film forces us to identify with Rebecca DeMornay, right from the start. Then, when he has his first attempt with Antonio Banderas and the Pia Donnagio score hits our heads with eroticism, the camera gives us a shot from the shoulder of a bare ibex that crawls around us with a furry chest. Now it's traumatic. This makes any viewer feel to the viewer as if he were on the floor of a California men's colony laundry in San Luis Obispo. Don't get me wrong. I don't like Antonio Banderas. It's just that I'm not in love with him. There is not enough naked shots of Rebecca DeMornay's body in the universe to compensate for this kind of anxiety. Here's an engaging way to survive this movie. Instead of sitting there pulsating, try to choose the scenes that were shot in Toronto and separate them from those shot in Budapest. It's a challenge, really, and can, for all we know, keep your common sense.
