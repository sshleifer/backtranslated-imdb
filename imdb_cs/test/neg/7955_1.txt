Pathetic NRI Crap ..... appeal to all who are not Indians .... This is a WORST Indian movie, made the worst piece of NRI garbage ..... The story is boring and clich√© (the way NRIs and Westerners of India) ..... Go for it if you want to be bored to death. The film deals with the situation of widows in India before independence. now in remote rural areas, but not to the extent as shown (perhaps because of his period film) ..... <br /> <br /> There are plenty of other Indian films run by very talented directors who are worth enjoy. ..It's definitely missing ... Watch the document instead, or search for information on the Internet if you're really interested in the situation oppressed in India. <br /> <br /> I lost my time.
