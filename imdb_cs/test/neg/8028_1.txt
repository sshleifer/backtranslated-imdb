I rented this movie on June 20, 2001, watching it for about 45 minutes. I came to the conclusion that observing an empty screen would be compared. The cast was not the only person I should throw a tear if hell opened and swallowed their whole group. So I have all my friends and relatives who warn them, and I take the time to challenge anyone who can see this note to avoid this film as a plague! I've seen some really bad movies in my time, but NEVER as bad as this.
