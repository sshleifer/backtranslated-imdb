Grapes! Despite Ed Harris's good performance, Diane Kruger and a strong budget (3-star reason), the film is by far the worst I've ever seen about the composer and the worst movie of the masterpiece of the music. I agree with some fictional things that would improve a resume that might not otherwise be so charming. This was done in AMADEUS with the best results, but this copy of B is an error here. Beethoven had a strong personality, but he was a reasonable artist. But here in this movie it looks much more like Mike Tyson! I also wonder if, despite his deafness, he has heard all the whispering in the last scenes (can it be a cochlear implant?). I prefer listening to the ninth on a CD with some nice maestro. Most of them now lead modern Wagner orchestras. By the way: I gave Amadeus 10/10!
