I rented this movie from Blockbust because I had a title and title! Sounded interesting! This film suffered from writing, needed more tension. "Monsters" needed more time. We needed them to have some special powers and definitely more "Oh Sh--" moments. The photos didn't bother me, except for the scene where she exhales again. There were too many of them. But besides, the film seemed to pull and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom. Overall, I would say that they all gave a lot of time to writers. But this movie is definitely below average rent. <br /> <br /> There are definitely better tips. I would recommend Anacondas 1 or 2 through this selection.
