What's the meaning of this movie? It starts as a single film, then changes track, cheats us on the resolution of this film and ends up as another film that is nothing but a pale, pale imitation of so many other shocks you've ever seen. The overall impression is confusion in every respect and a great deal of arrogance. Tarantina, directed by Rodriguez, two guys who have shown talent before, but who now seem to believe their own hype and assume that everything they do must be good just because they did it. But that's not how it works. You're just good at doing good things. There are so many questions you are asking: What are George Clooney and Harvey Keitel who deal with such nonsense? Clooney initially makes an interesting bad guy? absolutely ruthless and effective? and it would be interesting to find out where it went. But of course we never do. And Clooney's vampire film is turning into a completely different character. It's not smart or funny, it's bad, bad work. Keitel looks thoroughly ill, and no wonder. Nobody in the studio learned the script before the project was put into operation? Tarantino is utterly uncomfortable as a murderous sexual deviant (and why he, as a writer, assumes that we would find rape, terrible murder and defeat of a harmless hostage). At each level? except technical? this movie stinks. Avoid.
