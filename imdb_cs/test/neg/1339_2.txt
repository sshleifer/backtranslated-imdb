He saw this movie last night. I usually do not have good or bad comments because I think movies are like books in that there is something for everyone and everyone is different, tastes different, yadda yadda. This movie was bad. By the end, I thought it was my patience. How many women really look and live like this when they hit the "rock bottom" and if I could just borrow some money from my mom and live in the fashion of dreaming - gosh, life would be great! I was on a nice chick-date movie with my girl (my darling husband likes watching movies together and I knew it wouldn't be his thing), something light and easy on the senses, but that was one bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting film observers, and this was not the film. Annette Benning is a great actress. Bad. Bad.
