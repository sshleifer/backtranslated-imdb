Okay, so I forgot to watch and catch the last episode, I think it was the first or the second. Honestly, I thought CM would have at least one other installment to solve the points plot. The Rangers are trapped in the plains ("we will have to eat horses") for one thing. The little salamander is deprived of it for the other. What ends! But my biggest complaint, esp. if this was the final, it's an episode had no tension, no big peak, no dramatic confrontations. Even the last fight between the Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was poorly staged. The whole episode had a terrible stimulation, which is what drives the Western. Steve Zahn was traceable, Karl Urban (ringtone for Johnny Knoxville) played Call as a man with a lockjaw terminal case. All glowing views and clinking spurs and protruding chin. And what about the Rangers? They spoke great, cleansing Texas, then crushed aimlessly in the middle of the city and got drunk. And how nice is Hal Holbrook to borrow Val Kilmer to Mark Twain's wig and stache! The Austin set was like a fake Rock Ridge from Blazing Saddles, all facades. I admit I was drawn into a conspiracy, but that's mainly because I had a lot of things I didn't get. If I watched from the beginning, I might not get into the third episode. Now I have to go watch Silverado to clear the palette.
