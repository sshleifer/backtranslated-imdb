I haven't had much hope for that. Before I see it, the story shouted at me "stereotype." I mean ... come on! It's such a stupid story about an innocent android who realizes that the people who created him are immoral, then he decides to change everything. I had to see it three times. The first two times I fell asleep because I was so incredibly bored. It is very rare that I was so bored with movies that I fell asleep during them. The third time I forced myself to look at him, just to warn people about it. <br /> <br /> I got a clear impression that the people responsible for this mess tried to take all things cool from other scifi / action movies and put them together to kick-ass the movie! They took an Android / robot, a lot of actions, a slim story, stereotypical characters and finally a big fight. Unfortunately, the movie is angry. The game is so wooden that you can build a house from it, the story / storyline is ridiculous, the cameraman and the cut are terrible, the direction doesn't exist and everything is clich√© and ridiculous. You're just angry with you. I stayed with the feeling that I could spend my time watching that I was doing something much more creative, such as nail trimming or grass tracking. .
