I really wanted to like this movie because I have an admiration for an Italian film about bursting (especially jaw jaws!), But the simple fact is that Monster Shark isn't very good. There are all signs that this is a big piece of garbage; we have one of the kitsch cult kings, Lamberto Bava, in the director's chair - one of the best ridiculous cult actors, Michael Sopkiwa, who has taken the lead role, and the central creature is stupid enough to give the best that kind of film must offer to run for his money, but somehow the film still manages to be somewhat outdated. The fact that the "monster shark" does not appear too often is probably a good thing with regard to the design of the creature, but elsewhere where the film could not drag without it. The plot focuses on a resort off the south coast of Florida (or rather somewhere in Italy) where several local people appeared in the water with missing hands and feet. It's not long before local authorities decide that this creature has never been seen before, and it's on a diverse crew of different marine experts to catch him alive! The main problem with this movie is that it always feels meaningless, and because there are few ways to build or plot, even the least demanding viewers get bored long. . This kind of movie is hardly known for being brilliant, although the fun element of movies like 'The Last Shark' and 'Killer Fish' is unfortunately missing most of the time. The things I love about lead actor Michael Sopkiw is that he always seems to be taken seriously, no matter what movie he is in (though only four). This is certainly the case, even though Bava never allows him to fully immerse himself, and often feels like a spare wheel like the rest of the film. Much of the run is spent watching the various vultures of American lager, and it's not very fascinating; Although Bava will eventually catch up with a fun flood of action when the central monster finally reaches its perpetrators. Overall, really not much recommend this movie for. As already mentioned, I really like such things and I even got bored on many occasions. Only for horror hardcore fans!
