This document has not been professionally or objectively processed. The whole thing happened as a conspiracy theory by IBM to win the match in question just to make some money. Garry Kasparov has a problem with the ego. He was inflated before the game and he didn't like it when he lost. I remember playing chess against computers in the 1980s, and it wasn't too hard to win. As time went on, I started to lose and I didn't like it. Today I just don't play against computers because they're just too good. Not only are games uninteresting and lack the attraction of human games where both parties are more likely to make mistakes and open the game to exciting possibilities. This documentary shows us the pictures of Turk, who is an ancient chess machine that was truly controlled by a human being. From start to finish, we believe that IBM does not literally hide human GM at the back of cabinets. I am a computer scientist and I have insisted that precisely because Garry has lost, IBM has to cheat. I know how computers play chess. It's not magic and it's not a mystery. They can be trained, have a huge amount of chess knowledge and certainly see positions and possibilities in unprecedented detail compared to humans. No wonder Deep Blue has won. Maybe it was at that time. If it happened today, given the ever-increasing performance of machines; people would barely blink. If a machine could not bring GM at least today, people would think the program was weak.
