Based on the Ray Bradbury story; a professional photographer (Brian Kerwin) returns to his modest home near a small desert town where most citizens want him to stay. The lonely boy (Jonathan Carrasco) throws his attention at him; and two witnesses of a strange craft landing in a rocky desert area. Foreigners turn into images of burghers. Kerwin has to convince the evacuation of the city and falls in love with a young boy's mother (Elizabeth Pena). Acting is pretty shallow; the story is not worse than some others; This film will leave you feeling that you have come to a decent end. The support cast includes: Howard Morris, Dean Norris and Mickey Jones.
