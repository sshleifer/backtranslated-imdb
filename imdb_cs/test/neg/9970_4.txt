It strikes me as a routine when it comes to TV movies. I can believe it is based on a true story, because the plot seems too clumsy to be written by anyone with storytelling skills. For example, good old John Ritter (now a rather bulky and bearded thief) poisones his wife enough to get sick, then accuses her of being psychosomatic, and immediately leaves behind a woman. Fourteen years before the story rises again. Why fourteen years? I would say that although the narration does not require it, history does it. However, some of the specific scenes are so kinematically appropriate that the writer has almost certainly dreamed of them. Helgenberger, Ritter's first wife, threw herself into the attic and hit an old electrical appliance and had one of those black-and-white stabs - suddenly recalling when she had discovered Ritter's shaving selenium sawdust from a rectifier fourteen years ago, carefully picking it up and putting it into shampoo and her eyelash liners (or what is called). Later on, he was also putting it into coffee. Honestly, I don't believe it. Nor do I believe that she has such a special revelation in the soil or that Ritter put shavings with selenium in shampoo or eyeliner. Selenium is referred to in the film as "toxic metal" and I assume it is in sufficient quantities, but it is also an antioxidant that is sold through the counter in the pharmacy and swallowed. Someone will have to show - like no one in this movie - that it is the current poison. Many people have tried nicotine patches and have failed. So how come selenium in her shampoo gives Marg Helgenberger immediate and drastic headaches? And her eyes are as painful as ulcers when applying makeup? I think the anthropologist E. B. Tylor called this simple idea "compassionate magic," but I'm not sure. Mais is a divage. Anyway, Ritter seems to be trying the same sensation with his other wife fourteen years later, though no evidence of fraud is ever created when he gets the same symptoms. Wife number two is taken to Mexico and apparently cured, but suddenly she falls dead after her return. Indirect evidence accumulates against Ritter, who plays all-stop criminals - when his first court is dismissed, SMIRKS in Helgenberger, who called for an investigation. You see, Helgenberger was a good friend with Ritter's second wife and terribly concerned about her demise and way. And I want to prevent the same thing happening to a rich young woman who seems to be third in Ritter's marriage schedule. (Sure.) The best performance is given by the guy who plays Detective Mauser - Lawrence Dane? Each other acts by numbers. They project emotions and thoughts with a subtlety of warning on a railroad crossing. But Dane does little things that are original. "You say you want to report murder. (A long pause, sitting and waiting), then suddenly shoves his face to the Helgeberger and asks in a reasonable and curious voice, "So who was murdered"? the bare bones of historical events, nothing prevented the characters or their actions from being drawn differently than in real life, what the hell, Ritter is still in prison sentenced for murder, and Helgenberger's character is dead, so who is I wish they were forensic things clarified and Ritter seems to have used so many poisons and toxic metals - letting me see, selenium, cyanide, a massive dose of chlorine and maybe something else - that I was confused Not that I was rooting for Ritter Here is a mathematician with a doctorate that lasts that people call him "doctor." He even fixes people who only call him "professor". behind them very quickly. "Jes' call me Whitey, though I do." know how to get a standard deviation and you don't. "Average TV price.
