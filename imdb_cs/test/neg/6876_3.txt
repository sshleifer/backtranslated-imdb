Yes, this title bar will actually appear in this movie. Why? I'm not sure. When it was actually said, wasn't someone in the crew smiling at that moment? I'd like to see outtakes from this movie, mostly because I think it would be more fun than the movie itself. Helping director Jim Gillespie, ("I know what you did last summer,") comes a teen slasher movie that seems to assume we've never seen a teen slasher movie before. Of course not to be blamed. There are also three writers responsible, and this is somehow based on a video game that is still in production. The name of the game is "Backwater" but I came up with absolutely nothing to find out about it. And so we start the movie ... I mean, before I go on I didn't expect to win an Oscar. When I am in the right spirit, I enjoy a fun horror movie. I think there is an opportunity for effective, original and clever film slasher. "Venom" is not this movie. Almost no character development is at all. It's alright. You're not expecting a lot. However, this movie, instead of a well-knit cast of several of us, decided to introduce us to the following clich√© of horror characters ... <br /> 1. Last Girl: She just broke up for her boyfriend. This means that at some point in the film, when they are at risk, they decide to reunite. Which more than likely means he will die and she will be the last surviving film. "Eden" plays Agnes Bruckner, without much enthusiasm, I can add. 2. Friend: He is just about to coexist with Final Girl until his demise. Sure, he can save her, but he's condemned and we know it. "Eric" plays Jonathan Jackson. 3. Bimbos: Horror movies usually feel the need for one of them, but here we have two. They disappoint, steal, may show their breasts (not in this case), or maybe alcoholics. Basic genre. They also roam in the darkly lit areas of their lonely place, usually saying things like, "Hello? Is anyone there?" "Tammy" and "Patty", appropriately named, play Bijou Phillips and Davetta Sherwood. 4. Jackass: Yeah, he looks nice, but he's an idiot in a movie that's just put on an idiot. He says stupid things, makes silly things, apparently never seen a horror movie and it's one of the nice kills you're looking at. "Sean" plays D.J. Cotrona. 5. The Girlfriend: She loves Jackass, albeit hardly anyone else, and she is usually the one who stayed alive for a while to scream and cry until she starts to stumble and stay behind. "Rachel" plays Laura Ramsey. 6. Creepy Janitor: In this case, The Creepy Gas Station Attendant. He said enough. "Ray" plays Rick Cramer. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think you can get the picture. The remaining characters are not so common because they are equally available. There is a "Gay Guy," (Pawel Szajda as "Ricky") who has definitely robbed when it comes to screen time, and "Whoever knows what's going on." Of course, none of this matters, because everyone always thinks he's crazy. "Cece" plays Meagan Good. There are several other characters, namely a representative who is played by the Method Man, but he and the others are very quickly killed and have even less character development than the following. cliche. So you're probably thinking, "Why does this film require such a deep analysis? It's just a summer horror swing, for cryin 'loud!" Does this question deliver goods? Yes and no. Acting is not particularly convincing, not even in terms of talent. Bijou Phillips was celebrated for her performance in Bully Larry Clark and Agnes Bruckner is a promising talent for a while. So what gore? Some. It's really about it. A lot of the mildest pieces are cut. Specifically, it is a scene that includes one's face and a sandbox that is used to remove car paints. <br /> <br /> There are some interesting scenes to the credit of the filmmaker. I liked where a part of the house literally tore to get the indestructible villain to the characters. If it all focused on a smarter scenario in which characters didn't make the same stupid mistakes literally hundreds of characters from the horror movies they created before them, it could make a more enjoyable experience. All the most interesting characters are instantly killed in the first third of the movie and then it becomes an extremely interesting countdown until we know it's just Creepy Janitor and Final Girl. I suppose I have to be a little tired, but as a horror movie fan, I was wondering why I should bother myself when I could write a better script myself. I will not mention the numerous cases of horrible CGI.
