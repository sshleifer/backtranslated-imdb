If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. Humor is the cruelest I've ever seen in a movie. Terrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered terribly without their own guilt. There are 2 plots, none of which support half the film. Where is the "depth" of others seen in this movie? That no good deed punishes you? That only a heartless one can succeed? The film starts well and black and white is very moody and well done. Acting is a very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more frightening. If you think 3 Stooges are too nice to each other, if tracking beheading the kidnapping victims with Bowie Knife is a real stehper slapper, if you thought "Schindler List" was hilarious, then this movie is for you.
