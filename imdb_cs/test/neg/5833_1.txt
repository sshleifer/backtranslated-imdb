This was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The story was about a female prisoner sent to space to try to save humanity, but what actually turned out was that the prisoner was actually aboard a spacecraft with a nymphomanic lesbian commander. All that was the story was that I had sex over and over again. There was no need to put all these shots - just create a soft porn movie. Of course we had to see a heroin movie that has sex for about 2 minutes. I don't know what it all had to do with the real plot of the movie - except that I suppose the men are watching him. I gave it 1 out of 10 just because there was no other rating lower. Don't waste your money or time - it has nothing to do with science fiction, but more with a movie for young teen boys looking to see t & a. Weaver. Bad excuse for fun.
