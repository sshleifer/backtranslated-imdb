VIVA LA BAM This "Jackass" spin focuses on the (probably scenario) adventure of Bam Marger and his friends (Johnny Knoxville, Brandon Dicamillo, etc.). This show, while having a fair share of rough comedy and crazy stunts, focuses mainly on the torture of its parents, Bam. I'm sorry to say this, Bam, but ... you are by no means as cool as you think. This ego buried show is not only painfully indecent (and yes, I like Jackass), but also narcissistic beyond faith. Too stylized intro ends with a cool Bam explanation that will do "whatever it wants". How about doing something that's actually funny? I liked "Jackass" for what was worth it. Working with the camera was terrible - every idiot could do a better show with his camcorder in his parents' garage - but at least the show was moving at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy, dangerous or simply disgusting pieces played by friends. . <br /> <br /> Not with "Viva la Bam". We watch our hero playing pranks on his friends and torturing his relatives, but he never feels anything but a lame and written comedy. Stunts and pranks are slightly entertaining, but presented in such a dull and boring fashion that you can hardly smile. "Viva la Bam" is a bad spin-off that has little good, but feeds Marger's already great ego. I do not recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone.
