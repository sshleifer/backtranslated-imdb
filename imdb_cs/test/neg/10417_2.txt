I like Steve Buscemi. I like his work very much, both as an actor and a director. You could say I'm - do- Steve Buscemi. Steve Buscemi's freak. I lurv Steve Buscemi. I remember when I first saw Buscemi's feature film directorial debut "Trees Lounge". I enjoyed the movie, though it wasn't as good as it could be. It was almost - there. It-almost-scratched that itching, itching wanted to see "little" movies about "small" people in "small" bars that are in "small" cities. It was close enough to say it was a very good movie - one that could be great with some improvements. But that's okay. I like the movie and I watched it more than once. But this review is not about Trees Lounge. It's about "Lonesome Jim." When I saw the film description and then I saw who the movie was, I was excited about the prospect of finally seeing a movie I knew could be a Trees Lounge. But what I actually experienced was not unlike leaving one of those little bars with a cheap whiskey-filled belly and a cheap floozy weapon that headed back to your Kashmiri brain-filled apartment with exciting prospects that inevitably fell into the reality of alcohol-induced impotence and regurgitation of headspinning. In other words, this movie left me flat and didn't regret it and I apologize for wasting my time and money to get into this state - the movie equivalent of waking up next door next morning shy, or when you become a goddamn awakening beside that smelly and fleeing and unshaven imbecile. The film had all the substance from a white bread sandwich (with bread of branded white bread, no less) and the dead's emotion. I am not sure what the meaning of this film is, and because it was supposed to have a point and was not an exercise in abstract surrealism that could get without it, this lack of point is a sin of omission. Sorta like the new cars that are no longer with ashtrays, though there are millions of people who smoke and buy new cars (I'm not one of them, but hey, I can sympathize). Overall, it was a boring movie about boring people who do boring things, and they didn't have any of the grains and credibility they could bear and save. The Trees Lounge was about boring people doing boring things, but it was interesting. I blame much of it on Affleck. Why do these Affleckers still throw? They live life from anything they are connected to. One Affleck was in one decent movie (and there was no reason why the movie was decent) and suddenly every butthole named Affleck stinks as many movies as he can. And Liv Tyler is no better. Being a daughter of a rock star doesn't necessarily mean an actress. He's just as lifeless as Affleck. These people just don't get out of the script's flat page. People pay to see movies and deserve to be actors and actresses with a little charisma - these two duds together don't have the spark of an old guy who handles shopping carts at Wal Mart. I always thought Steve Buscemi was the kind of guy who rises over this type of pablum, but Steve, you dropped us down. This film makes me pull you into another chipper.
