The only thing that makes this one traceable is Corey's performance as a crazy freelance killer. What remains is the hardest story of revenge and marital dissonance. During the radio, I felt that Cotten was pressing sweet potatoes and not communication equipment. Another interesting thing about this is that Alan Hale (captain of "Gilligan's Island") is still not so fat that he can still fold his hands under his waist. Other than that here is not much to recommend here.
