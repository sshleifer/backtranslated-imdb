First, nature in the movie is beautiful, and there is a bit of Mongolian music. Well, the horses looked like Mongolian and camels, but that's probably all that was Mongolian. Borte plays a Mongolian actress, although it's a lame performance. But she is pretty, who redeems a little lack of performance on her side. But I was totally unable to understand what was the purpose of this painful observation of a 1.30 hour fantasy created by Mr. Brovrov. The story completely lacked a sense of coherence. There was no logic behind the development of the land. In fact, there was hardly any story, just a few loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in "Mongolian" clothes, talking a little pidgin that should sound like Mongolian. Most of the actors were either Japanese, Russian or Chinese, most of the scenes were shot in China, Kazakhstan, or Russia, and there were a lot of worrying pathos about what it was supposed to be "Mongol". The dialogue is primitive and the scene with the dialogue is slow. Battle scenes are ridiculous. All supernatural pathos are lame and it is obviously just to replace the lack of story. The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll. this person could become a leader who could unite nomadic tribes. He looked sleepy, soft, stiff and pitiful to most of the movie. And I don't want to start with the theme of the historical significance of this film waste. To see half of Chinggis-khan's movie as a slave, see his two first children born from other men to see his wife being sold to Tangut's trader ... my blood is starting to boil. And where is the beautiful story of friendship between Temujin and Jamukha? One could make a great movie out of it. Where is the rise story of Temujin? His childhood, his relationship with his family, his brothers, how did he survive among the powerful enemies of his family? Where is Van Khan who helped him a lot? Where is the depiction of the life in the steppe, the life of the nomads, their traditions, the relationships with the other nations around them? <br /> <br /> Where is the character development? We cannot fully see what brought Temujin and Jamukha together and what separated them from each other, and most importantly, how Temujin became Chinggis-khan, how he, an outcast without wealth and military power, managed to unite the Mongol tribes and create an organized and effective war a machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history. All of this could make some interesting and dramatic stories with complicated conspiracies and deep characters, but unfortunately we didn't even see the sight in Bodra's creation.
