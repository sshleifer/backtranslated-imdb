This was shown on the premium channel, so I didn't realize it was for TV. Still, I like some movies for life (Lifestyle here in the UK), but it was horrible. The family was so cheesy, "I love you mom" "I love you even more honey" After they broke up for the second time, 10 minutes later, they were on it again, "I love mom" big kitschy smiles, etc. She calls her husband didn't bother to come home. They were just divided by a guy who wanted them to be dead, had a nutter next door who needed help? She has her teenage daughter and a cat (not long) to take care of her. However, as a comedy, I would give it a good one. the time I have them. It could be great fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10!
