Pumpkinhead was in itself a decent horror. No classic in any way, but a nice piece of fluff. So why did we now join the fourth movie in this series, which is out of me. As in the previous sequels, there is nothing that really connects movies except for the monster, witch and Ed Harley (Lance Henriksen). This time we follow the dispute between Hatfield and McCoys. Part of the film is the novel Romo and Julie as a young boy McCoy and his lover Hatfield decides to escape to be together. But soon they will rupture and the boy's sister is killed. The boy escapes into the forest and gets the witch to resurrect Pumpkinhead for some revenge. Playing is at best passable, in the worst amateur. The titular demon does not even appear for nearly forty minutes, and when its pale comparison becomes pale between it and its original design. Overall, Blood Feud can't impress. Maybe it's worth watching once, but not as a supplement to the collection.
