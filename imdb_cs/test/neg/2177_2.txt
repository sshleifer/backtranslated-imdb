Chaplin was a great quiet comedian, but many silent stars fell when the public heard their voices in the first interviews. In my opinion, Chaplin's voice just did not fit into his quiet characters, which made him rich and famous. His career never came back when the sound came to the film. Unlike most of the reviews I read, Chaplin's lifestyle and politics did not help his popularity with the average viewer who expected him to be entertained by Comedian Chaplin, and would not spend his entertainment dollar watching Chaplin's political commentary. Despite Chaplin's awards and chivalry, I would take an exception to his "contributions" to humanity. The Great Dictator was made at the same time Stalin's brutal dictatorship was to have exemplary processes, and both dictators signed an agreement that led to the invasion of Poland by both dictators. World War II began in an effort to save Poland. The Nazis were defeated in 6 years, but Poland disappeared as a sovereign country. It happened at a time when this film was made and an investigation by Hollywood by the federal government. If Chaplin included Joe Stalin in this satire, except for the Italian dictator, he might have less politicism about politics. The ill-treatment of the Soviets against Jews and dissidents overcame the time and number of Nazis. Judging simply as a movie, many gags were too topical to be understood by younger audiences who didn't know who Goebbels, Goring or Mussolini were. Classical art must pass the test of time. Classical Greek tragedy, the Mona Lisa and Beethoven's 9th are still for centuries after their creation because they are timeless. Films that rely on current political commentary or currently popular societal opinions usually do not exceed the generation in which they are created. But those who deal with issues that are common to all generations will probably live forever and get a high rating from me. Chaplin, as a writer, director, and main actor, has to blame for what I am judging the old and tiring movie. Chaplin's apologists excused their decision to leave the country that made him rich and famous. If Chaplin found that the US was so insulting, why didn't he return to his native country. Great Britain fought with Nazi blood and money. What has Switzerland contributed to the fight against European dictators? Switzerland is like a country club that selects and selects its members based on race and class and cares for people who can't join the club.
