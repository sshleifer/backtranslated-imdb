Whenever I see such a video, I have to ask how it was financed. HBO or Showtime or whatever a manufacturing company has to pay to go through the suggestions - to hire someone who may or may not actually speak English to get high and hit something close to the plot to pay scary strippers to the jobs To bounce and down on roughly waxed dudes' torsos, find people to design and light sets, buy cheese techno rights, etc. But I have to imagine it must be a vanity project for anyone serving as executive producer ... He had to nail all those girls, right? And bro is not bad about "Spanish looking" girl, but calling cops "overwhelming" is terribly generous. In fact, I would go so far as to tell them something much closer to "nasty" or "fugly." Watching how these women writhe around - sometimes brightly high on painkillers - was so far from eroticism that my testicles actually got inside my body. Gross. Why waste time when there are so many freely available hardcore porn on the Internet? I wonder if internet video popularization is slowly killing the softcore video industry ... can we just hope that?
