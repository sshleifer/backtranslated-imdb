I saw this movie in the cinema. I took a lesson in Chicago's Second City and of course I noticed that this movie was intense. It's Woodward's film about one of the other city's native sons. Everyone knew about Johns history. Everyone knew how he died. Some even knew that tradition did not make him particularly friendly to women in improvisation or comedy. But hey. the man led his life and he was loved intensely by the people who were in his world, and the tradition also states that he and all his close friends acted with love and respect. <br /> <br /> This movie. Good. Forget the idea of ​​poor Michael Chilklis (who is a really great actor), who is in a really incredibly bad movie, and really just pushed himself out for impersonation. Forget the idea that they couldn't get the rights to any Belushi job ... and all SNL scenes never happened to appear in the movie. Check the idea that half of the historical information in the film didn't go to Bob Woodworking. Kinda says, "Well ... we're going with Belushio ... now we're going to let Woodward go ..." They also decided to take over the premise. Is he a guardian angel or a devil? Is pinball a machine of an evil electronic device assistant ... how many different endings can you attach to a movie? It's one of those movies after they're done ... you look at the person you're with, and go in "great hell" to "What the hell was that?" In some circles, this film has become a cult classic. But for good reason. <br /> <br /> A good cult classic that sits on the screen and makes fun of (or throwing one of them) on the screen. The cult film is never good. And most people would never see them in any serious context. <br /> <br /> If you want to see some classic bad stoned in the late 1980s? Rent Wired. If you want to learn about John Belushi ... you can get more information from the walls of the other city of Chicago than this movie.
