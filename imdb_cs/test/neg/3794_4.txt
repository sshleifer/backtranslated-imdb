I went to see them 3 days ago in Cork, Ireland. It was a world premiere, in a small cinema at the Triskel Arts Center at Cork Film Festival. <br /> <br /> I found Strange Fruit as an excellent movie. It's a bit rough around the edges, but for a low budget movie that can be expected! In general, acting (especially from the head of Kent Faulcon) is amazing, cinematography and direction are excellent and the script is very entertaining and provocative, with nice settings and a funny dialogue. The end was a bit sudden, without conclusions about characters and events, when the finals endedâ€¦ but maybe it was what the filmmakers were going on? It certainly made the film more disturbing. I really liked the fact that the main character on the screen never mentioned her mother: letting you know if she ever will, as in real life these things never settle. It was a good choice to leave it unresolved, rather than sentimentally wrap it up! Taut and thrilling through, "Strange Fruit" is an extremely ambitious debut and I have great hopes for what writer / director Kyle Schickner will release more. He - and his colleagues - are a talent worth watching. I hope that "Strange Fruit" will soon get a wider version, as more people deserve to see this film, an above-average thriller with some originals and striking twists in homophobia and racism in the American deep south. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended: 7/10
