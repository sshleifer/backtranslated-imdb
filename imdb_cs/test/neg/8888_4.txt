Some time ago, I promised never to get another Joe Castro movie (maybe after "Near Death"), but this is the way I ended up because it was Troma's release and I didn't read the cover carefully. Oops. Well, I watched it, and that's by no means good, but I think it's kind of like a "tongue in the face" ... if it isn't, it looked like. Some intrepid people at the University of Rio Grande have decided to find out if Chupacabra exists, because camera camera shots from someone's GOAT BARN, which show this strange thing, jump over the field of view. And also because the one who allegedly killed this thing was the uncle of the expedition leader. There's a couple of cameramen, one of them whining all the time, and some former sailors called "the army" (?!), Who is some sort of ammunition expert or something. In any case, they will find Chupacabra on a guy's ranch and set out to contact him with two supposed witches on the way. The creature itself is somewhat ridiculous looking, with its back on its back and a large, long tongue for which Gene Simmons dies. In the end, after a few people did kill, he does Chupacabra, and they take it back to the university for an autopsy. Is it from another planet? Is it a genetic creature from a Puerto Rico lab? Actually, they won't tell us. It is not interesting at all, but not quite terrible. It's definitely not a wide audience. 4 out of 10.
