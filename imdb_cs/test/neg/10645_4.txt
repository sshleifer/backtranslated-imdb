There's a lot of ketchup, but not a lot of senses in the supposedly explaining third sequel that has no effect on the pile of visuals. Good Old Alan Smithee conducted this, in which various members of the same family (all played, poorly, Bruce Ramsay) are terrorized by Pinhead (Doug Bradley, brought out of mothballs for umpteenth time). Peter Atkins tries to imitate his script with poetic touches, but he does not seem to realize that his dialogue is as deep and meaningful as a plate of sick. The incoherent plot cannot fill the humble run of the film sufficiently, although it may have more to do with studio interference than the creators intended.
