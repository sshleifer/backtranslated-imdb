Richard Gere and Diane Lane are in a novel with a chick with a kind of ending that I really got angry with ... they just say it's not my cup of tea, just like a dime romance that isn't my cup of tea. > <br /> There is a doctor on the property who stopped at the inn and met a woman with whom she has a deep but short affair. He goes away to meet his estranged son and she goes back to her life. Well behaved and well done filmmakers forgot to get a real plot line. These are the things that sell cornices from the money stores that make women faint and men shake their heads in disbelief. I wouldn't be as unfavorable to film as a mindless romance, except that the film turns in the last cylinder, which is so left-handed to be absolutely incredible. Why do some types of movies have to do such stupid things? It's really ruined it for me. <br /> <br /> If you like romance give a chance even if you wait for the cable.
