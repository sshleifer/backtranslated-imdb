This is a great disappointment. The main problem is negotiation. Sylvestre le Touzel is quite poor as Fanny, and the rest is not much better, everyone is very stilted and unnatural. Also, the cameraman is a very 1980s, ie, cramped and nervous, compared to a period like P&P of 1995. <br /> <br /> The scenario is if there is something too faithful to the book, and there are some cringe worthy expressions, which should have been much less. In any case, it is much less than the recent movie version, which, although it took a lot of freedom with the book, seemed to be much more faithful to the spirit of the book and was much more enjoyable.
