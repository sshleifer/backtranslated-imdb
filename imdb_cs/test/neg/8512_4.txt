Shirley's Temple films for Twentieth Century Fox are not negligible because they are poorly made (most of them overseen by Darryl F. Zanuck); they do not retain most of the "classic" characters among cinema lovers, mainly because they are esteemed by the syrup optimism of the Depression Hollywood era. The 1930s audience was delighted to be delighted to see her mother, often a lonely girl who radiates sunshine, so adults look stupid in comparison (bothering and troubled while dancing her troubles). We saw them many years later, Temple's vehicles barely get into the story (always with the help of musical sequences to support the content), and its timing (always too perfect) and exaggerated reactions can leave most modern viewers looking through the eyes. No one could be blamed for their irritation at the temple performance (screaming lines at the top of their lungs), or reversing her dance steps, with sayaying with a crowd of sailors at "The Ball". The fantastic aspect of this particular story, which was previously filmed in 1924 from Laura E. Richard's book, is enough to captivate those who are in the right spirit of saccharin. Shirl seems to have been pulled from a shipwreck by a state-owned lighthouse owner, but when a State Council officer finds out that he is not in school, he threatens to take the baby away. It does not matter if the cut-eyes officer has the point that the temple is not resurrected (the woman is almost instantly converted to proverbial merriment); one can immediately see that the temple can hold its own, take care of itself and its elderly guardian in negotiation (as well as the local widow who has her captain's hooks). The temple is not the only one that is too trained; January Guy Kibbee is ready for wide-eyed reactions, so you are often wondering if he would have filmed them all day. The dialogue is immersed in the waterfront metaphors ("You can't rush trout!" ... "Well, don't give up!") And something about the whole business seems strangely pixilated. ** from *** *
