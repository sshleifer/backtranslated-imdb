The most general, surface biography you could hope for. Busey's personification of Holly is accurate - but who wants to hear Gary Busey's "Maybe Baby"? Typically, members of hollies are used to comic relief and melodrama (Smith and Stroud, respectively) place as humans or even characters. When Holly uses the string section, the old Jewish-looking boys who come will tell him that he uses the same techniques as Mozart. It's just such a brazen statement that makes such film biographies (and "Amadeus" about Mozart above) worthless. Any entertainment can be derived from Holly's super styles and songs made in B-variations.
