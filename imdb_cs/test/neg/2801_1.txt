This is perhaps the worst of the worst. I am a huge fan of the horror industry and I can believe that this movie was allowed. Acting was juvenile and the story was completely stupid. Camera work was also youthful. One scene that comes to mind is out of business. It's night and you can see the moon, but all the characters have shadows that fit on the wall. There was no street light. One character giggles at one point, but takes care of it after removal. Come on! It was like looking at a high school game. I expected the characters to wave their family members off camera and the mouth "Hello Mom". I can only give him two positive comments ... it's over and it was good for laughter. Don't let this movie be rented !!!!
