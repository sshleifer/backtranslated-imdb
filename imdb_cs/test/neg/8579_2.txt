This year I attended the screening of The Cooler at the Toronto Film Festival. While the other reviews I have read seem to be generally (and mystified) positive, I have to tell you that without any axes that can be taken that this film is unimaginably wrong. The very daring and honest performances of William H. Macy and Maria Bello have been terribly wrong with what is probably the least polished, most classic scenario that has gained green light in years. I don't know how bad Brown Bunny was, but I'm sure he couldn't reach the depth in the style of Dante who did it. Just as brave as their performances were, perhaps the bravest thing that these otherwise great actors did was entrust themselves to such a horrible director and abysmal scenario. The meeting room must stand up well, because it should never be allowed to be a hundred yards from the camera. The dialogue is so embarrassing and awkward that I actually flushed at the screening. I mention that Macy's talent was completely wasted in the hands of someone whose leadership is as incompetent as his writing. Watching talented actors like Alec Baldwin's work, through the appalling scenario of Kramera and the direction of the ham, was similar to watching a child's seal get to death - I felt angry, helpless and sick all at once. Although I am always happy that there are investors and industrialists willing to risk on unpredictable scenarios with interesting space, this image was absolutely fiasco. Kramer couldn't have been more cruel to these actors if he had a steel pipe on his knees. I hope they will avoid similar humiliations in the future. Macy wisely jumped out of the side door and did not catch a ride. Unfortunately, it seems that the main character's bad luck wiped out in the worst possible way. Anyone who is accustomed to the quality of the independent will probably find it totally unbearable.
