I have not honestly seen this film for many years, but I have a tendency to keep its parts in mind several times, as anyone who has seen it. I first saw it as a child at the YMCA Halloween Party in the early 1960s, and it scared the hell out of us children in a fun way. I remember the real anxiety of an unknown thing lurking in the maze. I can't risk giving up the end, except that it was surprising, at least. I remember vaguely that an entire audience of young boys is haunted by a great horrible holler, followed by laughter when a terrible secret was revealed. The end was seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally humorous highlights of film in film history, yet in a strange motion. You have to see it yourself, which is not easy these days. I do not know if it is available at home video or not, but it would still make a great Halloween feature for kids and adults.
