Okay ... she's on the boat with this guy, realizing she's gonna kill her, throw him out and then find out why she's out of her, this disc that killed her. So what would any rational person do? Maybe him again over his head to make sure he's really outside? Tie him? Look, Sandra, you have a chance to escape while this guy is out for so long. Until you know how long it will take to get away, make sure he can't come after you. I hate these stupid roles of female victims. The rest of the film was just a series of twists and turns that were completely convoluted and too incredible to remain interesting.
