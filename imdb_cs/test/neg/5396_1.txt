For the first 5 minutes, SKELETON MAN was fine, but as the so-called "Special Forces Agents" hit the screen, they went faster than a fat kid in a sleigh. Opening we think we might have a shocked but funny, horror movie on our hands, but no ... filmmakers will spoil hope when "Special Force Agents" appears. I wish the screenwriter made a different path and let the "Skeleton Man" chase some weak teenagers until one of them gets to the end. Instead, "Skeleton Man" chases some miserable "Special Force Agents" and shuts them down until their captain finally gets the upper hand. I know the whole "stalking of the dark funny teenagers murderer" Things like before, but it would be more appropriate for such a movie. When "Skeleton Man" finally fulfills his "so-called" extinction, in a building that explodes, a police officer outside the building asks the captain of the "Special Forces" for the building: "What the hell happened there? My answer to this question: "Who the hell are you interested in?"
