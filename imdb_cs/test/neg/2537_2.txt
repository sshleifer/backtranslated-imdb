Aksalski's Indonesian action film from legendary Arizal carries a triumphant template for future Cinemax pap, such as 'China O'Brien' and 'Do or Die' with Erik Estrada while burying the poor ascending action star Pat O'Brien with a shabby court script and three cans . hair styling gel for its impressive 1984 mullet. The physical prowess of this boy is more like femme to Mark Gregory, and his next credit would be Chris Mitchum's second violin as "Tom Selick". Strong. At the very least, the action is mindless and continuous with some brave Asian stuntmen risking their lives for what is basically a badly constructed teenage movie and / or a metaphor-dependent addict. One poor addition gets a gorno-ly crushed electric hedge knife and many others are killed by getting hit in the head by strange objects such as a bike or cardboard box. The classic rape scenes are tasteless and invaluable and quotable dialogue, such as: "I will rather trust rattlesnake!" Are delivered with such exuberance and zeal from the third voice participant polizioteschi. Random Highlight: Some crazy dude eating live lizards. The film also holds a record for most wall-powered cars. 2/10
