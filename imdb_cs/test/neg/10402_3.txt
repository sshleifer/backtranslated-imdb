Fear and desire is particularly interesting for Kubrick's obedience, who can grope this catchy trap for their ever-accepted size. Kubrick was right in trying to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video. He considered it embarrassing and amateurish and was correct in his assessment. It is a weak and boring movie - in 68 minutes it seems even longer than "Barry Lyndon" - yet it has a historical interest and has its absorbing moments. It's a hard movie to find (only "unofficial" copies are in circulation), although it may change if Kubrick's property runs out and is on video. Recommended only for Kubrick enthusiasts.
