"Core" meets the "crack in the world" (1965 made for TV). Negotiation is supply, tension predictable. Once you have subtracted all the torn-off conspiracies from "The Core" - basically a crew drill - you'll end up with a "Crack in the World" plot. "Crack" was a really great movie starring Dany Andrews. His team of scientists working in South Africa drills into the crust and "sets off" with a nuclear facility to provide a permanent source of geothermal energy. One of his subordinates, also a great scientist disagree. He believes that the blast will not drill simple holes, but instead create cracks in the bark. (Possible spoiler) He's right. To stop the resulting crack from destroying the earth, it must place another nuclear facility in the crack path. <br /> <br /> Although I placed a spoiler warning, I don't know if I really spoiled anything for one movie. And because "Crack in the world is only available in a very rare VHS format, if at all my decision not to show whether or not it is an anti-blast is probably academic. <br /> <br /> All in all, I rate" Descent is just below average .
