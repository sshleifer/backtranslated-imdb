Love TPB, but it was a lame episode. He didn't have the same feeling that the show or movie had. It seemed to be in a hurry. I didn't like that at all. The so-called behavior was terrible. The cast looked like they knew it was a money-catching episode to get to the market quickly. I hope we don't have another Easter special because it will be for me. Writing this episode was definitely Mike Clattenburg's worst in the history of this show. The direction was very desirable and I almost felt bad for the cast and crew of this weak Christmas special. As I said, I love TPB, but this goes to the trash.
