It must be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the Sci-Fi channel. Here's how the movie starts, women are the only people on the planet because in no up to the future chemical war is OK if it focuses only on the soldiers (in case you wonder men). fires (big shock) and all men on Earth are slowly dying. Then the entire male species is sentenced to death when Madame President is shot and killed by a man. now we are about 60 to 70 years old, two female scientists are working to clone a female child and one of them says, "Hey, why don't we bring the men back?" The other does not say that the world is not ready for it, but it ignores it immediately, and so one goes on Eath again. This film assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood. thirsty monsters. Second, the writer forgot to mention that the current soldiers are a good mix of male and female officers, so there is no real reason for such a virus. This is the biggest time pass you can find. This film has managed to offend my intellect not only with a bad story but with a lifestyle. Avoid this movie at all costs. I give it 1 out of 10, but only because I couldn't go a little lower.
