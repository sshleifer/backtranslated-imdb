Time was not silent for this film from the transition days of sound. The storyline has a gangster falling on sociality who wants to help his luck with the violinist he loves. There are, of course, complications. The problem with the movie for me is that it didn't get well. The performances are everywhere with some emotional scenes that seem to be on top to be ridiculous. One late exchange, where Carol Lombard fires someone from her room, left me howling with his singing. There are other times when the movie becomes static, a sign of microphone limits. It's not a bad movie, just that the technical limitations of the film get in the way of real enjoyment. Normally I forgive, but this time I couldn't go with the stream (Then again the copy I saw was absolutely terrible). Worth a shot in forgiving mood (and recall that Robert Armstrong actually did more than just play Carl Denham in King Kong)
