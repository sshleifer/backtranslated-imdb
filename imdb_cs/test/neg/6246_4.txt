Director: Jim Wynorski (Chopping Mall, Return of the Swamp Thing), Cheerleader Massacre is the fourth installment of the Slumber Party Massacre series. Think about it: it's the fourth chapter of the slasher series no one cares about! So how could it be good? Well, it's not! But since when were the slasher movies good? Cheerleader Massacre is fun, that's for sure. But in the amusement field, we've seen it better, that's for sure! As you can see, I'm not sure where I am to this movie. Those who follow slashes only on nudity will be more than satisfied. This movie is all breasts, but unfortunately no blood or not enough. I think I'm generous with this movie because I had a good time to watch it and I really enjoy watching a movie on a slasher, even as bad as it is. If you want me to be honest, the Slumber Party Part 1 massacre is the best and everyone else is a waste of time, so I think I have a lot of time to waste! For more fun, check out Sleepaway Camp 2 and Cheerleader Camp.
