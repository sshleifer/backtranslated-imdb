I was looking forward to watching "Wirey Spindell" since it happened in Schaffer's "Fall". Unfortunately, I found that "WS" is a wandering, devious, boring bunch of cracked pieces, along with what's probably Schaeffer's signature, a mixture of story, storytelling, and poetry. The film depicts the sexual and other experiences of a Manhattan man to marry through self-expressed flashbacks. Like the string on a string, Schaffer seemed to associate every little experience with sexual life, while neglecting the tendency to beauty the necklace. The result is a discontinuous story about a boy who grows up, unable to provoke empathy and leaving the viewer disconnected, dissatisfied and with a bad taste that feels a mechanical sense of good ending. Average India and Step Back for Schaeffer.
