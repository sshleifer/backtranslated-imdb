As a geology student, this film portrays Hollywood ignorance. In a scene where a dog grabs a bone from inside a burning house, it's less than a foot of lava that has an average temperature of 1750 degrees Fahrenheit. Again, this stupidity witnesses when "Stan" goes to save Metro 4. His shoes are melting on the subway floor while the rest of the team are just a few meters away from the flowing lava. And to complete this monstrosity of the film, they come up with the most illogical solution, stopping the flow of lava with cement K rails. Earlier in the film reporters can be heard who say nothing can stop the flow of firefighters trying out cars and CEMENT. Common sense dictates this film's meaningless and gross underestimation of human knowledge.
