As a passionate Gone With a Wind Fan, I was disappointed to watch the original movie and see that they missed many important characters. Fortunately, the movie was an amazing piece. When Scarlett's book came out, I read it in the hope that I would follow two of my favorite literary characters on their way. While the book has no true quality, it remains a good story, and if I was able to separate it from the original, it was and still is pleasant. But the six hours I spent watching the "Scarlett" miniseries are one of the worst hours of my life. This series, which discredited some of the original features so well formed in Margaret Mitchell's book, also transformed the story of continuing to be one of rape, mistrust, murder and bad relationships that even Scarlett's book did not stay. The cast for many characters refused to examine features that were so well formed in both the original novel and the film, and even in the second book, and again leaves at least one incredibly decisive character. In the novel, Scarlett O'Hara Butler follows her estranged husband Rhett Butler to Charleston under the guise of an extended family visit. After coming to an "agreement" with Rhett, she agrees to leave and continues to make contact with her relatives O'Hara in Savannah. Eventually, she accompanies her cousin Colum, a passionate leader of the Fenian fraternity, to Ireland, to further explore her family's "roots that go deep," and is eventually named "O'Hara," the head of the family. While her duties as O'Hara keep her in Ballyhara, Scarlett embarks on the world of English landowners and immediately becomes a sought-after guest of many of her parties. She, having been scorned by Rhett over and over, eventually agrees to marry Luke, Earl of Fenton, until Rhett comes in a cliché of "Night-on-White-Horse" - a kind of salvation. "Scarlett" miniseries can't do this justice. The series that raped her fiancé and scorned her family shows that Scarlett is thrown in jail after being blamed for the murder of her cousin. I highly recommend anyone looking to spend the day following this decision to review this decision.
