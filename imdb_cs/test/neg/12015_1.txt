"Problem Child 2" was a waste of my time. The original film was not very good, but its classic compared to this film. The first film went to the top with its scenes of the Devil's child, which destroyed the lives of everyone around. Here it goes even further. And one scene in this film proves this theory. The carnival sequence was too belly for me. That's horrible. This movie should not be created. <br /> <br /> 1/2 * (of 4)
