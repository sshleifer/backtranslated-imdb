The first question is: how many talented idiots do they need to make this happen? Answer: One is more than enough if the script writes and manages. The second question is: has anyone taught actors to handle weapons properly? Answer: no. I wonder if Kristy Swanson hit a hot brass face - because it was so damned! The third question is: how many times have we done a "super secret government conspiracy agency that is uncovered from within" a conspiracy? Answer: A good couple too much! The fourth question is: are Michael Madsen and Ron Perlman overestimated? Answer: In this movie, unfortunately, yes. The fifth question is: can a few breasts save this movie? Answer: even three (Kristy Swanson's couple and director / writer) don't. God ... If I see (most likely) a killer who would prepare weapons for a hit, and then morons from a prop department give her a completely different set of first bloody thing in a damn movie, "suck" the meter hit the top . Time from the start of the movie to me turn off the TV: fifteen minutes. Just a little more than it took me in the "Alone in the Dark" case.
