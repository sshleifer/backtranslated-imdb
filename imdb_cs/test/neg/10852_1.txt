Hi! I'm Sheena, African (still white!) Jungle Tribal Princess, who has the incredible ability to turn into the cheapest, most dangerous monster in the world (I think 60-year-old Star Trek aliens) by seductively rolling in the mud! When I first found myself in this terrible position, I did the only logical action: I made a torn jungle bikini in which I could play my poorly kept antiquities. I enjoy the Romanesque novels and rip the occasional African warriors. I would have liked not to mention my (white, of course) Mr. Cutter, an American ex-military man who apparently fled the US after his divorce. Can you say "duck alimony"? Anyway, it provides an occasional distraction from my hard life. How many idiotic blondes do you know who are also endangered types of non-fleshing meat? In spite of my many difficulties (playing so hard! * Whining *) I did not give up and after a long soul search I finally discovered my role in life: terrorizing insomniatic television viewers who are late at night and as unhappy as cable or satellite.
