Why did I have to go out and buy (yes buy!) JACK FROST 2: REVENGE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN ??? Maybe it was a burst of temporary mental confusion? But I think it's because I enjoyed the first JACK FROST. It was a silly, but funny, horror-comedy that had some spectacular effects when Mad George screams. That and the fact that this nice picture of this guy impaled with this huge icicle (coming out of his mouth with lots of blood and everything) was on the back cover of the sequel. So I thought: If it is so idiotic first and has nice splashes / gore, it should be fun, right? Well, I was so dead wrong! Let me first say that the film deserves some appreciation for the extremely crazy and retarded graph. I mean, a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that burns mutant killer baby snowballs that can only be killed or damaged by bananas? Like I love the premise, I really hated the movie. First: while the first JACK FROST looked like a real movie (seemingly filmed on real movie and all), this sequel has the look and feel of a third opera soap opera. This is too neat a video shot. Lighting is just awful (bright white spots for daytime look and silly colors like blue and green at night). Negotiations ... well, it's not even there. Interviews range from tough to extremely senile (that Jamaican man was just moronic, saying "man" after each sentence). And as far as the killer's snowman's voice is concerned, all I thought was that Chucky from CHILD'S PLAY from the seventh grade spews silly and supposedly funny ones before killing anyone. The best joke one man asked, "Why do you talk to the clock?" And the best scene was undoubtedly the one that jumped out of nowhere with such a beautiful Asian chick and swam in the pool completely naked (thank God for that!). Yeah, and that little scene over the end of the credits with those two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship that was badly dubbed me laughed too. But the worst thing about this movie was: Where was the gore and the spraying action everyone was talking about? There were many opportunities to show some decent bloody murders. Many people were originally killed here, but all off screen. As I read in many other comments, there were really nice set-ups to blast your head, crushed body, eyes stuck out, tongue ripped out ... but in crucial moments editor cuts some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all. The frontal shot of the British guy who was impaled (from the back of the DVD) wasn't even in the movie. I only saw that strange killing shot from behind (that is, I didn't see sh! T!). I waited for the whole movie to make it happen, and then I see nothing?!?! What a pause! Could it be that I saw the cut version of the movie? That would be a shame, because if you asked me this movie could only save a decent amount of splashes. When I saw a lot of killer snowballs reduced to a bloody pulp, it didn't bother me. Speaking of those snowballs: they were made very badly. They made MUNCHIES look like a state-of-the-art 'animatronics'. But I think it was all over. At some point, the special effects crew even turned to some sad bad CGI. Boy, you really have to see it to believe it. It's best not to see it, in fact, because this movie is just too bad (all right, I laughed at it because it was getting worse). Just stick to the first JACK FROST (1996) and you'll be fine (just think it's a stupid horror-comedy, but fun in the right one). It's funny, but writer / director Michael Cooney must have realized that after JACK FROST 2 he was a pretty bad director and then focused on writing. It turned out that he then wrote two very good thriller scenarios for The I INSIDE (starring Ryan Phillippe) and IDENTITY (starring John Cusack). So it seems that one has some talent after all. <br /> <br /> Now it would be too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest possible rating. So I say one point for this nude Asian baby doing skinny dipping and one point for those totally retarded kids snowballs. How to go Mr. Cooney!
