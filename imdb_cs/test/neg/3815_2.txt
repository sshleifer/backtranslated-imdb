A horrible film that is amateur at almost every level - a boring and derived scenario full of stereotypical characters, played by a shamed actor for a director who lacks the most basic understanding of his craft. The whole thing stinks. It plays as a slasher movie from the early 1980s, under the crappy score and SFX ketchup, but without the childhood nostalgia that is required to look kindly at such a dross. One of the worst horror movies I've ever seen - definitely the worst that got a mainstream theatrical release. I never left the movie in my life - if I was unhappy if I saw 'Hatchet' in the theater, it would be the first. Avoid at any cost.
