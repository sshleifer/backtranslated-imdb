I can't really see how anyone might be interested in seeing this movie. A woman meets a man, wants to play games, too, but only until she realizes what's missing. Leaving and it's really. It took 9 1/2 weeks for Elizabeth (Kim Basinger) to leave John (Mickey Rourke). She should have left him after 30 minutes and ended our misery.
