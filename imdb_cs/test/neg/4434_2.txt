I assumed I was expecting a Bollywood remake of "The Fog" from the title, but this is actually more of a Bollywood remake of "I Know What You Last Last", with some "Scream", a kind, and not a good one. In addition to a few very fun songs and dance numbers, it is pretty awful. It is obviously a decent budget and yet it is unnecessary to warm up remnants that were not so tasty to start. A young woman is threatened by a haunted guy not to enter a beauty contest because he wants his sister to win (fortunately she doesn't look so scary as her brother), but she enters and wins anyway and of course the creepy guy comes after her and is killed after which come the exciting game "hide body". Of course, the body will disappear and no one seems to know why, but someone knows they are waiting for the end to discover a ridiculous plot. With this tired rehash, we meet some clever dance numbers, especially a festive party dance for Simran, a girl who has won a beauty contest ... it's very colorful, well done and totally fun and totally useless. terrible movie. I'd rather watch the Ramsay brothers' old film than this piece of crap, even if someone thought it might not be available for the most part, a crime in itself. But not as big a crime as this movie. I took one for the team watching this, so please take me, don't worry. 2 out of 10.
