A group of friends receive a word from a friend who found gold in the old mind shaft near the ancient deserted western town of Suttersville. Despite warnings by local sheriff Murphy (John Phillip Law), old man Prichard (Richard Lynch), a vile hick who cheats tourists with alleged collector posters Wanted and cooky superstitious aunt Nelly (Karen Black) to stay out of mine for mine. it is a famous legend (.. that the evil miner who sold his soul to the devil and murdered the priest's daughter (Jeff Conaway) will return from the dead to kill those who remove gold from his shaft), these people see only green, not blood red that could potentially slime out of their slaughtered bodies. Finding the gold Jeremiah Stone intact, they line their pockets and briefcases, ready for clear futures that probably lie ahead. But if you don't pay attention to the warnings of those you think are backwoods loons, the obvious result will be horrible death. Jeremiah Stone, as we can see, lies in a nutshell near the alter containing the side-by-side skulls when the candles are lit up, the pickaxe waiting for his master, with dust particles returning him to the grotesque corpse with a demonic Exposure, his eyes shining with anger . This unfortunate group, hoping for some fun around a gold campfire that gives them a warm prospect of life ahead, falls for the prey of a vengeful ghoul and his average pick. Another victim meets the ugly end of the blade, which is thrown over the windshield of his vehicle, and points it straight into the neck. Another unsuccessful attempt to retreat was Stone, causing the frightened victim to go into the tree and his body swallowed in flames. Next, a local girl looking for her new friends, worried about their well being, gets pickax buried in the stomach. Aunt Nelly informs those who are still alive about forty-ninety and a curse on those who attack his eternal hiding places ... and pay the price for related information. Will anyone survive? Or is the whole group of fate to die in the hands of a zombie miner? Artist makeup effects and monster creator, John Carl Buechler directs this supernatural slasher without worrying about logic or strong storytelling, instead of allowing his zombie miner to destroy anyone and everyone who happens to be in his way. It only provides enough story, and that is at best the best for a killer that allows a special guest star, Karen Black (oh, how her career has invaded the abyss) to explain to the viewer. The story given to us by an officer of a priest's daughter threatened to execute her, as Suttersville warned of such an action. The stone plants, which surprisingly received the pickaxe directly into it, unloaded their weapons with little effect, because they sold their souls to Satan. Stone retreats into his area, into the mine shaft, and issues a warning against anyone who is trying to do what is his, prey. Typical for most slashers in general, this bunch of Twenty-Somethings are your victims of a garden variety, with little development other than some joking and word exchange provides as a filler until the undead maniac appears on the scene to beat them. They are the usual group, from a city that returns to an unknown territory, the evil that should remain asleep has been resurrected. Like many of the later 80-year-old slasher, there is a lot of off-screen violence. What is on the screen, minimal gore, is somewhat mundanely presented and becomes quite fast. Ghoul make-up for the murderer is only occasionally displayed, is mostly shrouded in darkness, the horrified faces of the victims as they catch or chase after them, they are more credible than the way of destruction. One thing is for sure, stunt men have been ignited many times. At least three times, the character is burned alive by one lamp or flaming vehicle. Martin Cove has a younger man as a former black husband, Caleb, who now lives with much younger and dense honey. Vernon Wells (.. of The Road Warrior and Commando fame) has a back story of the role of Jeremiah Stone as a human, still capturing the same type of threat he specializes in. John Phillip Law seems to be rather polite and hospitable. Sheriff, he welcomed the strangers on the forest neck. Buechler has a pretty attractive cast of actresses, all wearing tight pants and smaller shirts, showing off their sleek and athletic figures, especially Elina Madison as Roxann's easy lie, always willing to remove her outfits for a greedy blockbuster, Hayden (Rick Majeske). Stephen Wastell (The Ghosts of Edendale) is Axl, a somewhat clumsy foil, used as the ass of many jokes, including his "forest dump" and the current state of unemployment.
