I watched this movie purely for setup. It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares. The storyline was predictable, acting was, in the best case, a mediorcre, fears were all brutto-outs, not true fears. I don't remember much of the conspiracy, and I think it's because there wasn't 'so many of them to remember. They do not even use the hotel to give it the widest potential ... The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is located on the peninsula. At low tide you can walk almost 1/4 mile to the bay, which is a terrifying spectacle first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind bursts with cracks. <br /> <br /> The best way to see this movie is with the remote control in your hand so you can fast forward through the action (and I use this term freely) scenes and pause for the beauty of the neighborhood!
