Edge Vs. Michaels-Boring in general (loved sweet chin music in the chair) 4/10 Taker Vs. Heidenreich-One of the worst matches I've seen, predictable as hell 1/10 Tripe Threat WWE match -Why I'm watching them, no one ever wins the rumble championship, it's not a major event. She liked it when the Show drove the JBL through the wall. 3/10 World Heavyweight Championship Championship - Pretty OK, kind of more than Trip H than a match, but I was glad to see him after I saw crap. 5/10 Royal Rumble-Good Rumble, It was a brand showdown, things Hassan and the end. 7/10 Overall, bullshit. Why does anyone look at the rumble ???
