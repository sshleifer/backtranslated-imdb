This film is from the 80s, but it looks like it was made in the Stone Age. The effects are too hissing. My copy has Sandra Bullock on the cover, which is why I bought the movie. She was in the movie for about 5 minutes of total screentime. Most likely, he will deny all involvement. In short, there is no part of this movie that is worth seeing, except laughter, how bad it sucks. Rent it to see the worst movie ever made.
