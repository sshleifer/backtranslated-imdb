I was expecting an NVA comedy, but this is a parody. This shows the national army of East Germany in a light that is not appropriate, and certainly not true. One can do a comedy about everything if the basic facts don't change. Even the comedy about the German KZ is possible, as Roberto Benigni showed with "LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL". The NVA movie would be an "OK" comedy because the jokes in it are all right. Nothing special - not cheerful, but enough to live with him. The point is that the film makes a farce and parody of NVA. A deadly machine that was ready to attack WESTERN EUROPE with its friend RED ARMY. An institution that used everything to get out of its troops as much as possible. An army that marched to the CSPR in 1968 and was ready to march in Poland to destroy SOLIDARNOSC. You can't shoot a movie without showing the smallest piece of evil, or would you make a parody of KZ, Guant√°namo or September 11th ??? Is Osama bin Laden a funny guy? 90 minutes about funny Osama in the Taliban Afghanistan camp where he jokes and trains his soldiers would be comparable to what this movie does about NVA!
