People who were looking for bash to make it so cool and neat as it isn't. This film was supposed to be the complete opposite of Ocean's 11. It has been said by many cast members and also by director Steven Soderbergh. Ocean's 12, while it lacked the grasp of the plot, is bashed because it was different than what people wanted. If it was released before Ocean 11, it would be taken much differently, not as a failed sequel. The problem with continuing is that people enter it with a preset idea of ​​what it should be and have a lot of expectations. They should go into this movie with an open mind and not expect it to be "Ocean 11, Again".
