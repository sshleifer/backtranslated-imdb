I really hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind it. Certainly, I am in favor of making a hard and honest film about youth and youth culture. well thought out teen drama. However, what an exception I take is the infantile, grubby and sensationalist approach that the creators of "2:37" took. The main example is how it raises so many questions and yet fails in any significant way to comment or achieve resolution on one of them. My other big problem with this movie, besides his complete plagiarism by Gus Van Santa's "Elephant" (surprised by Van Sant not suing), is his "bull free in porcelain shop" attitude to relatively sensitive issues such as incest and especially suicide. In short, to avoid this film as a plague and anything that this filmmaker sometimes deals with. I have heard that his motivation to do "2:37" may or may not be based on lies. When I saw a non-standard result, it wouldn't surprise me in the least. It is a celebrated student film exercise that has no place in the cinema or DVD. Clean and simple.
