If you are going to make a movie from any book, make sure that the characters are consistent with this book. This film not only defied the biblical story, which was told to children in thousands or thousands of years in one way or another. At least the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read books than that "Noah's Ark" tried.
