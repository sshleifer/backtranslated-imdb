You don't see this movie. In most cases, such as Ju-On and The Grudge, the Japanese film is infinitely better than the American remake. However, this film was terrible. Ghosts, like a trick or fool, dressed like a leafy stalk and wheezing in an effort to be scary in the absence of good makeup or special effects and acting is just terrible. The story itself is inconsistent and confusing, not everything is explained, so the film goes from bad to worse. Don't waste your time with this movie, it's not worth it and I'm sure there are other fun things to do - just like watching the paint dry.
