Did I hear the movie is bad? They even warned me that it was horrible, but for some reason (probably Katie Holmes) I was still watching him when he came to national television. Watching Kevin Williamson's movies means torture! His scenarios are not funny, certainly not scary and not least creative. Mrs. Tingle teaches the same exciting atmosphere as her mindless series "Dawson's Creek" and is probably also for the same target audience. Before the credits started, 5 people already wanted to embrace and they said it was a scary `I love you sentence. It's not better because the soundtrack is full of unpleasant pop / rock and the story is ultra-slim. Three students on the verge of graduation caught a cheating evil teacher at school. Every high school has such a teacher, you know? To save their skin, they try to persuade Mrs. Tingle that it was not their intention to cheat, but this attempt is terrible bad. The typical high school humor is completely lost on me, the sentiment overdose is pathetic, and the acting (except Helen Mirren) is disgusting. I'm sure Katie Holmes can act? is that a fact that proves her role in "The Gift"? but she urgently needs to stop receiving beautiful girl roles. As already mentioned, the only positive comments are based on the brilliant casting of Helena Mirren as a boss. It's like Kathleen Turner in `Serial Mom '! The role suits her perfectly and you can't imagine anyone else playing her. Other than that, it's avoiding teenage nonsense.
