Carlos Mencia just isn't funny! His show is painful for that. His sketches / skits are very horrible, and that is just a feeling like a fill for the Chapelle Show, which is not a big fan of it, it is much more fun than this waste. Carlos Mencia gives stupid speeches and he too often depends on completing his monologues with a retarded voice and going "der, der der". It's not just funny. Often, when talking to others, he makes puns. They are terrible and painful. When people are not laughing, they blame them ... why would someone laugh, it's not funny. He has an immature sense of humor in everything he does at this show, it's amazing that anyone except 3 years watch. One of my favorite things to do is water on every topic and make it look like a joke! I hope that this racist idiot gets out of the air as soon as he falls to a station that doesn't have to be stupid anymore.
