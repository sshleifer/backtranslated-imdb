The Queen is trying to wrap up a complex, vast, historical story in less than two hours. There are some breathtaking battle scenes and the scenery of Wanganui is beautifully captured. However, the film suffered from some poor leadership - Samantha Morton (Sarah) especially encountered as unconvincing. It seemed indecisive about how the role should be played - like a helpless waif thrown by fate or as a strong, determined character with a clear view of her destiny. The figure of Kiefer Sutherland - the private Doyle - seemed nonsensical and largely incomprehensible. Keifer's Irish dialect needs a little polishing. On the other hand, Cliff Curtis, Temuera Morrison and Rawiri Pene (as Sarah's son "Boy") were well rounded and believable. <br /> <br /> The last 20 minutes of the Queen River came as particularly compressed and rushed. They seemed to decide to tie all the loose ends 120 minutes ago. E.g. How on Earth did Wire know how to find Sarah and Doyle? No explanation and very unsatisfactory. I went into this movie with an open mind. I didn't read or hear anything except his troubled production. What I experienced was mish mash from New Zealand's history, beautifully photographed, but ultimately disappointing.
