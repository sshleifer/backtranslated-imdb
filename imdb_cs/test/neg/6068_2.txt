I was very disappointed with the movie I was really looking forward to. I had no expectation that this would be another Amadeus, but I was expecting a stronger display of Beethovens in the past years. Ed Harris's performance was excellent, but the story was so weak that the movie simply moved. from one gloomy scene to another without continuity. <br /> <br /> The only pleasant part of the movie was for me to perform at 9 and I could finish without any problems. I left a feeling of very dissatisfaction and I still feel that something important has been left out.
