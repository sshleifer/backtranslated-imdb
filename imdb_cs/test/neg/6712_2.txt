Why does the US repeat this on Earth? the name actually says it all: the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you've never heard of and that resembles anything. <br /> <br /> You'll see ninety minutes of placement change, most of which will be fired later in the movie. Right at the beginning you can see a nice little farm typical of Berry, which is moved near Paris in the film, but then the "transport" on the Isle de France will not survive very well: it explodes 1 minute later. There are also two gangsters who have no languages, as if it made sense in the world of SMS and the Internet, let alone pencil and paper. That's how it goes, nothing in the story. my only credit goes to the cameraman, the camera is excellent.
