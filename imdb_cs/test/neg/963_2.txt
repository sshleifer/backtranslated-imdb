DANGER: Watch the falling spoilers ... <br /> <br /> The boy was a bad movie. I know they went to "true love to conquer all" kinds of things, but about all this, this movie was conquered by about 3 (which was more than 9) hours of my afternoon, which I never come back to. The film is about two young lovers named Kai and Gert, who live in a remote city in a fantasy world. Kai is a very abused bellboy in a hotel owned by his father Gerty. Initially, Gert ignores Kai's progress, but in the end he gets too warm to get him to be disgusted by Gert's father. As if this obstacle was not enough to overcome, the evil snow queen shoots the shard of glass into the eye of Kai and becomes the average person who treats Gert badly. Kai is finally taken to the Fortress of the Snow Queen (which is the same as in a hotel that is covered with ice because good people on Hallmark are out) and Gert is on a mission to return to Kai. On the way, he leads to three more seasons, which are evil in a strange way, but Gert escapes them with the help of some dull and forgotten characters he meets on the road. (You'll want to turn it off all the time, but you can't force it. It's probably the most serious and effective spell casting by the Snow Queen) Anyway, I'll save you from the end, because all you can think of in your head is probably better, than how it ended. In conclusion, the Snow Queen is an incredibly boring movie that fans a fan of fantasy.
