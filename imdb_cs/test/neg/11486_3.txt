along the history of the film, there were few movies that fooled the viewer, such as hitchcock's "theatrical fear", alejandro amen√°bar's "abre los ojos", David fincher's "play" and this one "ausentes" ("absent"). To get started, I don't like this kind of movies, I feel like someone is trying to pull a leg. next, after seeing this movie, you don't know what happened, it's such a confusing movie. Kubrick's "shining" can be a better or worse movie, but he is certainly more honest than this burden of pretentious and dubious situations. <br /> <br /> technically it's okay - photography, fair performance and so on, but the script is so bad that I'm wondering what producers saw to continue and shoot this crap. and this movie notes 3 guys who wrote the script (calparsoro, loriga and quiroga) are lost in the cinema trying to make a masterpiece - or try to do something to fill their stomachs waiting for another personal projects.
