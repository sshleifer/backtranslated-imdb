Ben Stryker's former green beret stops at Agua Dolee, where he visits old friend Tick Rand. Soon after driving to the city on his Suzuki and settling in. A motorcycle gang known as "Savages", which is led by the tyrant Pigiron to challenge and eventually take over. Stryker doesn't want to engage, but changes that become real goals. Is there anything good to say about this? A tough call, because the only basic reason to look at this low-budget wreck is a huge b-cast that has been able to postpone this project. Even though I don't think it's a complete shoe of work, it's not very good either. What a cast! Lance Henriksen (main character, strangely does not have top billing but last), Karen Black, George Kennedy, Richard Lynch, Bill Forsythe, Mickey Jones and Leo Gordon. What happened to this filthy low-budget bungle. The shallowness of the material is too one-dimensional that it borrows ideas from better films (namely, Mad Max) and comes with a complete mess of ideas that simply do not form a gel and could be thought through. The clich√©s that are used can be manipulated into good observation, even though they are predictable, but "Savage Dawn" seems to let it hastily hurry without allowing the viewer to soak it. The cast is mostly useless in nothing. Bleached blonde Henriksen is firm and even with her laudable presence, which gives his character a mysterious glow. He never gets to hell and sometimes disappears in action. Too many side actions, but when kicking some of the cyclists' backs, the good times went by. Karen Black's hissing performance is very special and is about shouting and curse. Although she gets into one memorable catfight with Claudia Udy's coquettish vixen character Katie. George Kennedy's wheelchair roams aimlessly until the last attack, and Richard Lynch looks like an embarrassing priest / mayor in a very superfluous role. On the edge of Bill Forsythe just chews it like a head honcho from a notorious biker pack. A small story (written by William Milling and Max Bloom) that cheesy comic books getup and power is influenced by the Western genre. Just look at the bad guys. As they came up with their names, it is a mystery. Maybe they pulled them out of their hat. It is quite a second material that more often goes to one bland scene after another. Unfunny comic elements are chucked in and also a little sleaze. Tacks of exploitation that is not brave enough and death is quite laughter. The clumsy scenario is full of intricate details and unbearable trite. The dirty direction of Simon Nuchtern was by numbers and lukewarm. One or two intense scenes fail to make makeup for his turtles-like stimulation and many bits-handed bits. Cardboard assemblies had a dirty appearance but lacked organic sense. Gravel-like cameraman Gerald Feil was better handled when the main focus was not on the city, but on a barren background (as the beginning and end of the film's climax) with some neat camera touches. Pino Donaggio's clumsy music of choice is drowned by his own incompetence. "Savage Dawn" is a forgotten quickie midnight movie that is the definitive misfire for most of the part. There are better and more convincing exercises of the same ilk.
