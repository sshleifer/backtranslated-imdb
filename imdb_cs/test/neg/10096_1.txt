The worst movie ever seen. The worst is also. I can't imagine a film worse than this. Nothing to see. Not acting at all. Hey (actors) should look for another job. I can't understand who was so stupid that he actually put money into this movie. I'm sorry Erica Roberts. Must Be Hard ... I can't imagine how HUUUGE his mortgage needs to be justified by accepting work! <br /> <br /> Ladies in the movie ... maybe stick XXX better. <br /> <br /> As for LEADING MAN ... what lead! You better be on the lead and stay there! I see he's more successful at barking than playing. <br /> <br /> Overall rating: DO NOT RECEIVE ... DO NOT BUY!
