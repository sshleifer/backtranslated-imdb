It is undoubtedly an attempt by someone for originality, but what we have here is art in its most morbid, grotesque form, so Begotten has my respect for it, but to be realistic, it doesn't matter what this abomination is. is about, but for the record ... <br /> <br /> In an absolutely incoherent horror, we start at an unknown time in an unknown place. Right from the bat, we are immersed in a psychotic nightmare that is Begotten, God is, seemingly depressed, mutilated with a razor, I mean, I'm really trying to make it all over, it takes a while (why would this something extremely morbid start? He's going to do something out of the corpse, say hello to Mother Earth What is he doing Well, he'll give birth to something The thing would probably stay in the womb, but that is the life. together with Mother Earth, she is disfigured by the unknown, hooded, invaders, evil intentions, which are the only clear accessibility, and from that point on, things have gone as they never touched. Don't give the impression that I do not recommend this evil because I do it, but only once, and only for people who appreciate the dark side. <br /> <br /> It may seem to me from my description Believe me, I have it, and yes, Begotten is the art of seeing it, all that is in this film, no matter how it may seem, may be significant. This is perhaps the only thing that makes Begotten art. It has been said that most of us require some form of fun value, and that comes from someone who enjoyed The Chooper. Probably the most interesting first five minutes I've seen in the movie, but let's be realistic, the next 7 hours and 55 minutes we'd have one unconscious, that is, if it's not just for some psychedelic purposes, in that case, it doesn't matter. But how would it be such a uniquely boring masterpiece? Depending on how much your attention can take, it should be either 1 or 10, no other number would make a statement. It hurts, but in terms of fun, it's not. 1/1
