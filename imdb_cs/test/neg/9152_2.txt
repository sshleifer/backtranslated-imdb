Like most other life-long films, this film is based on a rather bland "best seller" and played more than reenactment than a real movie. The only difference was that Meredith Baxter wasn't there. Women in this age do not stay after 20 years and acting in general is bad enough. <br /> <br /> The characters in this were all clich√©s and one-dimensional. The story was ugly. I wouldn't recommend it, but it's such a thing that people who loved the book and the people who have been watching this network all the time will think it's great. I just watched it because my girlfriend wanted to see it, so she wouldn't have to read the book her sister lent her. It wasn't for someone like me - my girlfriend screamed a little at the end, so she didn't think it was as bad as me.
