I enjoyed Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqatsi and I was looking forward to this third part of the Qatsi trilogy and saw the direction he was taking. Rarely did the film succeed in living its predecessors and lost itself. While trying to represent "civilized war" in the form of sport, science, commerce, and other forms of competition, it lacks the global scope and even the coherent development of its predecessors. War is chaos, but even wars have a goal in mind, and this film has little structure and unclear goals. Naqoyqatsi is flawed by being a chaotic melange of images that little develop his theme. On the plus side, he wisely avoided using some iconic images of the wars of the last century. Naqoyqatsi is also so insular that I had to remind myself on several occasions that I was not following an ad promoting an American. way of life. Perhaps this insular nature reflects the ongoing "War on Terror". When representing "sport as war" prominent team logos ensured that the US was displayed as a winner. Therefore, he missed the opportunity to portray some of the many sports around the world and show that humanity is united in its use of sport as a form of civilized struggle. <br /> <br /> In addition to the news, the footage seemed to have. He was shot dead on a budget within New York City and there was little recognition of "life as war" in the rest of the world. The Gallery of Faces (Wax Figures) gave a nod to the existence of prominent figures outside the US. The creators missed that globalization does not mean Americanization. The soundtrack of Philip Glass was just like any other result I heard (with the possible exception of Koyaanisqatsi) and best described as "harmless" or addition to, or away from, chaotic images.
