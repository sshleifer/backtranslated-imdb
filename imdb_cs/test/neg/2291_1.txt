Actually, I feel like I should review one word. My friend, whose opinions almost always trust movies, especially horror films, warned me that I couldn't rent it no matter how tempted or bored or desperate to see a new horror I was because it was a complete loss time. Unfortunately, I didn't talk to him in a while, and I was in a hurry to choose a movie, and I thought, "What the hell is that, how bad could it be?" Why don't I learn? What did I think? I think it would miraculously turn into a better film, while sitting there on a shelf of a year waiting to be rented? 'Story' refers to a guy who edits movies for a company. His boss is a jerk. The one who worked in front of him went crazy and blew up the preliminary credits, so for some reason the chief picks the nerd 'Ed' for the special Loose Limbs editing project. He never says what Ed has to edit, but I don't think it matters. Ed is angry with some clips, working on them in this house alone that the boss has decided to relocate him for no apparent reason. He asks his boss if he can stop or do another project, but his boss doesn't care. He starts slowly crazy, allegedly from watching clips, and wants to perform bloody murders in real life. Or was he like this all the time? Please note that I plot this graph much deeper, more interesting, and more coherently than it really is. We don't care about characters at all, or we have sympathy for them, or even hate those bad guys. The storyline is really boring and predictable. Splashing is not so bad or creative - it's not worth renting just to see gore, because what's not there is neither interesting nor original. All the 'homage' Sam Raimi just drop out like a really bad ripoffs, and no one in the movie is anywhere near good enough like Bruce Campbell, so you can't get away with it. I think the "Evil Dead II-Dead by Dawn" poster is only visible in one scene in the hope that Sam Raimi will be flattered and will not consider any legal action. A trained chimpanzee could write a better script. Every time I hear lines like "We've had fun ... yet?" (which even the bride couldn't pull out of the re-animator without making me blink) I'll start feeling like I'm picking up some deadly weapon. The characters reveal themselves out of nowhere, just to kill themselves. That could be fine if the movie was fun or entertaining at a distance, but it was all I could do to get the most out of it. Fortunately, I decided to pay some bills and balance my checkbook at the same time the movie was playing. Believe me, it didn't require my full attention-I kept feeling like 90+ minutes of my life were useless just by putting it in the background. Don't look at it, no matter how tempted you are - you'll hate yourself for wasting money. Horror fans will be completely disgusted at how incompetent they are. Even those who have not seen too much splatter movies should stay away because there are so many movies out there you can rent that are much more worthwhile. If you want something mindless, low-budget and fun, rent something else. Complete waste of time without any qualities. Be smarter than I was at the time, and don't be fooled by the "Warning - Not For Heart Weakness" on the box. You were warned! <br /> <br />
