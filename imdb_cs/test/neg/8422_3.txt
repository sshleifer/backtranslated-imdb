The First Fifteen Minutes is an Interesting Story of NAKED FAME: Two male pornstars in a seemingly healthy relationship over the twenties decide to abandon the Porn industry and experience the world of singing and acting. Two very buff and preening men are Colton Ford and Blake Harper. With the help of Kevin Aviance and Marc Berkely, Colton makes a dance career, which is then marketed in New York with the hope that Colton Ford will become a star - a unique disco singer who presents herself as a Porn Star for PR. The rest of the film is grumbling and fighting and commenting on Porn Producer ChiChi LaRue and the film slowly sinks into repetition and torment. It is not a bad idea for a film if there is a bit more depth in each character than to form a successful career (though one of them has been greatly influenced by the young characters they have lost) into the alternative. It's just that a one-note song wears thin fast. Grady Harp, 05.11
