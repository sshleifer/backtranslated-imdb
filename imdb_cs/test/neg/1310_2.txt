I don't really joke when I can honestly say that this movie is not suitable for watching on ITV4 on Sunday night. Underground scenes are just awful when London is reportedly under 30 feet of water, the character of Robert Carlyles is drab. Police Commissioner clothing reminds me of something Kate Moss fired and Nigel Planer looks very old, in fact I'm afraid he may have suffered a stroke during filming. Robert Carlyle's father who was 'right all the time' apparently was too much Ketamine and while he has a leading role in this embarrassing journey, he deserved to be killed off the way WAY before he was caught pretending to that is Kate Winslett (Titanic) while swinging over Thames Barrier. I'm sorry about movie lovers, but I'm avoiding anything.
