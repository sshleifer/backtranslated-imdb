Yes, this film seems to be trying to be a Conan barbarian, and what stuns me is that it is a sequel (people have asked for more?). The first part of the movie is flashback showing the original. From what I saw, it doesn't look like it's worth a try (and Ator always kills a huge puppet in his movies). Now Ator lives at the ends of the country with his muted sidekick Thong. The girl is looking for his help because this bad guy has his father in custody. Let me say that this evil man is extremely patient because the old man always insults villian and just hides forever. The evil man waits until the very end of the film and finally stinks the old guy who wondered: "What took him so long? Meanwhile, Ator and his sidekick and gal are going one adventure after another. ), leases thugs and people who worship snakes, and Ator also fights a giant snake puppet and hang gliders (don't ask again.) You'll think Conan kicks Ator's ass all the time.
