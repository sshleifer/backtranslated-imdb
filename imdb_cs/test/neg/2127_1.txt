I've seen a few bad movies in my days, many of them in Mike, Tom, Crow and others in MST3k. The same was true in this case, and although I found the film pretty funny in its own right, it wouldn't have been so fun without MST3k's commentary. The film is a prime example of really bad movies coming from Europe in the 1980s. Terrible music, terrible acting, terrible conspiracy (what's little), terrible dialogue and really, really, really, terrible adjustments. Cripes. This could be called a turkey if it wasn't for the fact that it's not unique in any way at all. It's almost the same kind of movie that almost every Italian director hack pulled out. <br /> <br /> So, try to get the MST3k version. It's a pretty fun episode with Mike and the gang in pretty good shape.
