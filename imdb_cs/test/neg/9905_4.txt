The first two hours of the TV version are full of character and exposure - after a short short sequence of Las Vegas hit by tornadoes, the event really won't start until the next two hours. However, some character relationships do not become clear until the second part. The actors turn to competent performers, but nothing special (but better than "Aftershock: New York Earthquake"). The exception is Randy Quaid, whose character is redundant and incredibly annoying. The storyline is a fairly standard mix of parts of "Independence Day", "Speed", "Day After Tomorrow", "Earthquake", "Soaring Hell" and several other films. You can predict what happens next and get closer to anticipating the dialogue, word by word. Special effects are incredibly bad. Despite the effects in "Twister", tornadoes in this film seem less realistic than the one in "The Wizard of Oz" and other effects were apparently done for less money than such a series as "CSI" and "Cold Case" spending on the summary of one episodes. If you have to see a movie created for television, check out "Day after", "Asteroid" or "Special Bulletin" instead - you get better charts, gaming and effects.
