Films just aren't worse than this. Terrible conspiracy, horribly timed, pathetic characters and effects, and yes, it's using the "B" standards. And for the boys: nothing, this movie is a terrible release, a few scenes that could be great but you get nothing, you just stand without a van. This film appeals to anyone, a horrible movie, that was bad; storyline, playing, taste "B", special effects and everything else. Plus no nudity or eroticism for boys or girls.
