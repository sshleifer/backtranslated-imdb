When I was little, I didn't look very much like that. And I think I watched only one episode that was about railways because I believe I like trains and I'm still doing it. Even then, I thought it was a children's show. Mostly I watched Arthur. The songs are strange too. And I don't think it's so educational. They just sing some stupid nursery rhymes. This is a silly show, all the adults who love it! If you want some good kids shows, watch something like Arthur, Mister Rogers neighborhood or even better Pee-wee's Playhouse. I thought Sesame Street was boring when I was little, but even better than Barney. Believe me, this show is pretty stupid, there are other kids who are better than this. I see many of the reviews that many people don't like. Now there are some mature people. I hope they'll take it soon.
