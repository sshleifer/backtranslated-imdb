This film reminds me of Harry Potter - not a style but a marketing strategy. It can be Part 2, Part Three ... up to one day when product life ends, provided that the first part has business success. so many things seem hidden and so the story looks quite incomplete. action design is boring. set design is ok but not ok. maybe Edison Chen will be one big star. It really looks charming even on the big screen. Anthony Wong is still the most impressive. 4/10 <br /> <br />
