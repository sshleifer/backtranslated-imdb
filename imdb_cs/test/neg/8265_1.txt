This episode was boring and wasn't even in the horror realm, so far this season, the Masters of Horror has produced one really good episode ... The Damned Thing ... it's early, I believe the episodes will be better. I admit that the vampire episode was fine, but it lacked a solid story. The episode of a few serial killer hunting started boring, but the last fifteen minutes were really good. Although I am simply plain, disappointed by the lack of originality and horror, that first season episode obsessed. Please save this season John Carpenter! I believe Pro-Life will redeem the entire low season for now. <br /> <br /> "You're an angry little elf!"
