Although I rarely agree with filmkr√∂nikan, I have to say that this film, although not terrible, just didn't worry me at all ... and it didn't seem all right ... it had moments ... or four that frightened me ... but most of the time I was sitting and thinking why? Why did the characters do it? even Hot Shots feel more thoughtful and complementary ... <br /> <br /> If you want to see a nice Norrland film then watch Pistvakt. It was more than random ethnic groups who were just changing tundra ... <br /> <br /> I'm so disappointed ...
