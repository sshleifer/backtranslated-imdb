Coming from Kiarostami, this art exhibition and sound exposure is a surprise. For a director known for his storytelling and keen observation of people, especially children, this excursion into minimalist cinematography asks the question: Why did he do it? Was it to keep him busy during the shore holiday? <br /> <br /> "Five, five long rides" consists of, you guessed, five long rides. They are (titles are my own and approximate times): <br /> <br /> "Driftwood and waves". The camera is almost always looking at a small piece of driftwood moving around small waves splashing on the beach. Ten minutes. "Watching people on the boardwalk". The camera is still looking at the ocean horizon and the promenade. People walk through the camera frame, their faces are too far and blurred to be interesting. Eleven minutes. "Six dogs at the water's edge". The camera is still looking at the ocean horizon with a sandy stretch of beach nearby. Far at the water's edge, six dogs don't do much, just relax. Sixteen minutes. <br /> <br /> "Ducks in a Row, Flock of Ducks". The camera is still looking at the ocean horizon by the water. Ten and a dozen duck streams in a single file from left to right. I assume that Kiarostami gradually released them. The last two ducks stop on their way, and suddenly a flock of ducks roll quietly from right to left. I believe Kiarostami has collected the ducks and released them all again. It is not the first time that it deals with the contrast between organized and unorganized behavior. Eight minutes. "Symphony Frog, oops, I mean cacophony, for a stormy night". The camera stands over a pond at night. It's black, except for what seems to be a reflection of the moon on wavy water. It is a stormy night and clouds that cover the moon. The screen darkens. We have cacophony of frogs, howling dogs and finally morning cocks. Hit my head if it was done in one round. I saw this segment as a sound composition compiled in the editorial office and accompanied by simple visualization. Twenty-seven minutes! <br /> <br /> In addition to the mildly entertaining ducks, this minimalism exercise left me cool. A significant film for admirers of Kiarostami. I thought I'd rate five, but four is what they deserve. The film is dedicated to Yasujira Ozu.
