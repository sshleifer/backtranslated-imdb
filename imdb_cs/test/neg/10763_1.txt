I saw this turkey in the theater, but I had a good time. Special effects are not worthy of production at school. A toy ship, representing a freighter, moving a speedboat on flat waters, while a wind-driven mist blows in the opposite direction. Red and blue flood lamps add extra dramatic touch. No matter what caching Vincent Price should bring as a narrator, it is completely overshadowed by the terrible production work. Calling this document is like calling Britney Spears musicians. About 20 minutes later, something surprised me. Maybe it was an excessively dramatic intonation of the price line they used "they disappeared in the Devil's Triangle!" [Cut to black; next story] As soon as I started laughing, friends joined. then he shouted, "Okay!" After getting almost as much laughter as the Marx Brothers, no one stayed at the terribly serious second "Chariots of the Gods".
