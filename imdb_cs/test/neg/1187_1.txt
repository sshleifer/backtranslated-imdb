This review took longer than I took on this movie. It's just bad. The storyline is terrible compared to TV shows. It's flat, indecent and boring. It is clear that LoG had lost ideas long before the film was green. Viewers should read this as an example of not knowing when to stop. <br /> <br /> Bad edits, bad music, bad gameplay. Zero dynamism, zil chemistry. A film that does not know what it is, made without any love for a mysterious end that leaves you depressed and feels a kind of angry that so much money has been wasted. Br /> <br /> LoG seems to have made an offer they couldn't refuse, or perhaps their egos just got better. It's a bleak marketing pressure that might be better if the LoG were fresher and more inspired. But I knew when to stop and do. <br /> <br /> Please! Someone is trying to convince me of the finer points of this movie!
