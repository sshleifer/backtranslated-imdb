I'm trying desperately to stay awake while watching the movie Solomon Kane. I have about 20 minutes. If it's better, I'll come back here and let you know, but somehow I doubt it will happen. Solomon Kane seems to be based on the Dark Watch video game, and that sounds like it's based on the Legacy of Kane video game, but unfortunately, none of it is true. I hear it's based on some comic book or graphic novel or on fiction, or something else I've never heard of, but whatever it is based on, there's nothing original about this excruciatingly boring film. The atmosphere is stolen from the 300 movie, which was not so great in the first place. Sudden overload is taken so seriously that it's almost hypnotic, and to be clear, I mean the wrong way. The plot is virtually non-existent: a violent guy trying to be non-violent meets a friendly family, is murdered by a friendly family, and a violent man becomes violent again. All characters are stereotypes taken from Waterworld or Eli or The Hills Have Eyes, or whatever, just choose another apocalyptic quarry fantasy slash magic movie you've seen and got it there. Someone, somewhere, said, is how to make a movie: use a blue filter to make everything look mysterious, add a lot of images with slow motion of horse hooves splashing in murky puddles, add snowflakes floating around while two boring figures speak to each other , and yes yes the rain is watering to distract from the fact that nothing is happening, and don't forget the black silhouettes that come to us with flame fire, and lots of burners and of course blurry battle scenes during which it is not clear going on because we don't have a budget for gory special effects, so just throwing the sound of metal, and by the way, don't let any character live long enough for viewers to understand, relate to, or sympathize with them, and cross fingers, hoping that fans of sword and witch movies dream of it, even if it is a complete doo doo, and they go straight to the video, don't go GO. . .
