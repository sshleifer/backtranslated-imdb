That's one of Crichton's best books. The characters of Karen Ross, Peter Elliot, Munro and Amy are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting, complex and rapidly changing in this impressive novel. And about 99.8 percent of it was lost to the movie. Seriously, the screenplay and direction were horrible and clearly made by people who couldn't understand what was good about the novel. I can't blame an actor because, frankly, they never had a chance for this turkey to survive Crichton's original work. I know that good novels, especially those with science fiction, are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original. However, this may be the worst difference in quality between novel and screen adaptation. The book is really good. The movie is just terrible.
