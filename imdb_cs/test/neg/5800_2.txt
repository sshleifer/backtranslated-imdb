this movie has no graph. it was SUPPORTED that a man moves with his grandmother, and everyone thinks he's defeated and has to redeem himself. But what happens when everyone finds out who they live with? They have a big pot party in Grandma's house. the film's climax wasn't about the rest of the film. the entire plot was introduced within minutes of the end of the film. I can see how this could be related to the supposed story - that his grandmother's VG redeems her skills - but it just wasn't. However, the film was fun as hell and clearly relied on jokes. "Her pussy smells like a big depression" "He just sucked his first titty ... yeah at 13 o'clock" "It's for you ... I think it's a devil"
