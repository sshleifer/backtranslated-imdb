Plot: A group of young people with ridiculous names (Hutch, Swink, Phineaus and October) is linked by the death of their equally ridiculously named friend Loomis. After the funeral they decide to divide their late friend's belongings. Among them is a video game called Stay Alive. The group decides there is no better way to show their grief than to participate in a little virtual bloodshed. The more they play, the more they realize the connection between play and the death of poor people. Production: This film is just another entry into the latest Hollywood low-budget series, PG-13, a horrible payout for a high school junior crowd. The direction is sloppy, at least with the fast, music video editing that makes the action difficult to follow. Dialogue is so bad that it really kills brain cells. The storyline itself is so full of holes that we never know where the game comes from, or why those who play it are dying. The idea of ​​this film, though not entirely original, had a promise. But poor performance on both sides of the camera makes this one big bagpipe. <br /> <br /> If you ever get the desire to "kill someone in the video game from them doing dead in real life" horror take my advice and skip Stay alive for the brilliant Brainscan.
