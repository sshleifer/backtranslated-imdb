This film brought a whole new meaning to the well-worn phrase "like watching the paint dry" because it was like "watching the color dry in the middle of the monsoon". I was attracted to the film on the west coast of Portugal I visited. It is a harshly beautiful place, and black and white has presented a whole new dimension to beauty. That was the only good thing. The story was horribly banal and, frankly, you must have a story. The film crew runs out of film and the crew has to wait. Well, waiting is waiting. I can wait for bus number 15 on Princes Street in Edinburgh, I can spend hours at a remote railway station in the middle of nowhere on a cold winter Sunday afternoon. But waiting is boring and yes, this waiting was also boring. So the leader is going to America to move away with the film supplier, who falsifies him for not doing it all in color. After a few arguments, two blessed bullets set off from where the eagerly awaited end finally gets, and not before. Yes, I would see this movie again if someone pairs me. cans of colored film so that I can throw them on the screen.
