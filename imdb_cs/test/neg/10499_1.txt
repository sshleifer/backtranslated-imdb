My friend showed me the movie yesterday, and I was really overwhelmed that someone could make a film so awful! Mix the most horrible, clich√© dialog box with the most woodworking you've ever seen, and the fact that one has the most interesting effects one knows, and you get this wonderful beast! 'Vampire Assassins' is more fun than most comedies I've seen, it's really awful! <br /> <br /> I was in a stitch during a scene where a former cop / vampire character had coffee with an internet journalist. Just watch and see what I mean! Honestly, I can't believe anyone did it with serious intentions. A tragic but really good laugh. He must be seen to believe them.
