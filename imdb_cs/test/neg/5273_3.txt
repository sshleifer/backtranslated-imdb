Kevin Spacey is undoubtedly one of the best actors of the 90s. After his performances in The Usual Suspect, Se7en and American Beauty, you expect more and more of him. That's why ordinary decent crime is a huge disappointment. Michael Lynch is the most prominent criminal in Dublin who is never in a bad mood. His next robbery becomes an obsession when his partners start questioning Michael's ability to plan everything perfectly, even if it's the only thing he does when he doesn't play a good father at home. I think it's partly my fault for not paying enough attention to thousands of conspiracy details, which unfortunately proved to be the "essence" of the film. I gave the movie a chance by calling it a parody and ... well, parodies are always funny, no matter what they do or how they do it. It wasn't a perfect parody after all. It's just another movie that desperately tries to be funny and fails. Unlike some of his "colleagues," ordinary decent crime is too dependent on story development and logical continuity, forgetting what is the main reason, the viewer chose this kind of film - to have fun. It's definitely not fun. Includes one of the most ridiculous scenes - the performance of two Michael's wives. I don't know if it's a nonsensical metaphor or strange, dark humor, but the chicks are sisters. Remember, Spacey has children. Ordinary decent crime is complex and confusing. You're not waiting for a fun scene. Instead, you closely follow the dialogue because there is a great chance that you will get lost in the boring, pale universe. Come back to Spacey. I wonder what state he was in and sign the movie. It's not bad, but something much worse. Offense to his work in American beauty, released a year before an ordinary decent criminal. The character Michael is eccentric and talkative. Spacey is sometimes almost pathetic. The only cure for that is thinking of Lester Burnham and Roger Kint. Writer, Gerrard Stembridge should definitely reconsider his screen writing skills and be more objective this time. Because dialogue is very weak and scenes are often unnecessary. And we're still talking about comedy. A common decent crime is a really bad comedy that deserves your attention.
