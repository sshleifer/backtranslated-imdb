This is beyond the shadow of the absolute worst movie I've ever seen. It's been a long time since I've seen it, but jokes aren't funny, the plot is painfully predictable, calling the main characters stupid is a huge modernization of their intelligence ... uggh! I just wanted to hit Tom Arnold and make him cry because he was wasting two hours of my life looking at this piece of film dirt. I don't even know why I wanted to watch it, but remember when you see this movie: DO NOT OVER THAT YOU DO NOT MAKE YOU. Tom Tom Arnold's character sings a song in this song called "I'm My Grandfather". Said Nuff.
