This film follows the life of a great guitarist who wants him to be big, but acts almost irresponsibly to the point of destruction. I expected the usual funny Woody Allen dialogues, sarcasm and humor, but "Sweet and Lowdown" could not be provided. The main character Emmet Ray is an egocentric, rude, irresponsible and vulnerable person. It's so unlikely that I don't want him or care about him. I wonder why you need to make a movie about him. Stimulating the story is slow, so the movie is terrible. Even Sean Penn's brilliant performance cannot revive the film to a traceable level. Woody Allen likes movies a lot, but "Sweet and Lowdown" is a big disappointment.
