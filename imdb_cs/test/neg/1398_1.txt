This is the most beautiful apology for a comedy show I've ever seen. I'm confused that this guy got his own show. It smells of complete and utter despair on the side of a comedy that tries to fill the void left by talented and incomparable Dave Chapelle. It's a tip from Ned's comedy gold bag: Isn't punching funny? Need to put that extra pressure into merriment? F *** ING YELL IT at the top of your body. Simple, right? And as a bonus .... complete half of your jokes with ... THEN YOU'RE RE-TAH-DED! or DUH-DU-DUUUUHHHH! Man. So fun. Beaner ... cheerful. Wetback .... does the laugh sometimes stop? <br /> <br /> To illustrate my point in a more brain way, I'll quote an example. Mencia jokes about how "retarded" is rebuilding new orleans because it's so close to water. Genius. The line of distinction between a big comedian and a hack has never been so clearly drawn. While a good comedian would find hidden humor in a tragedy, he found subtle ways of weaving a joke into something we can all laugh at, and into which we could dive, Ned goes for the obvious. Move the city. Great. Wait, is it funny? Ned has no intellectual ability to find the deepest sense of things. Hurricane did not flood the city, Sun. The levee project was underfunded and seriously needed federal dollars ... and lo! They broke. I think this is God's way of telling us that we shouldn't be there. After all, he has a place at the congress. What a fool. Chapelle was the master of turning the tired racial comic spin on his head. He was on it effortlessly and at all points we laughed with him. While the Mencia speaks of black people unable to swim * yawning, Chapelle took her 300 meters away with a black and blind white supremesist. You don't have to be scary to be nervous. You must be original. Mencia and his supporters' legions are such that, in a squeaked gay dude who laughs too much at gay jokes, he thinks he somehow masks his own insecurities. By the way, with Ned, they laugh too much at "retard". Du-du-duuuuh.
