I saw the movie tonight in preview and it's just a movie for kids. In no way does it improve or add to the original Disney movie. There is a corny Scottish pastiche style throughout, not aided by weak writing (where motifs are concentrated in spade) and playing it is uneven and often unengaging (despite what reads as a decent cast). I have no problem with a small dog - although there is some quality of "Skippy the Bush Kangaroo" (see below) about his footage. For those who don't know, "Skippy" was a television series of Australian kids from the 1960s, when a kangaroo was an essential part of all stories. It is said that to get a poor old Skippy to "act", they stuck a rubber band around his mouth, which he then tried to step out with his paws - as if they seemed to communicate with human actors !!! Bobby has a similar range and you just don't buy his series of heroic rescuers at all. The advice would be to take children aged 8-12. Under that they might be afraid. On that, if you love or love it, we wish you good luck, but it is a strictly cut foil for easy. It is a missed opportunity because there is real pathos and cuteness in Bobby's story and this film can't fill it.
