*** SLIGHT SPOILERS *** This installment of the Full Moon franchise changes the story a little and implements some new elements. First, a new puppet master is founded. Second, puppets are well suited to this sequel. Finally, it also introduces some sci-fi / fantasy elements. The new tenant of the infamous Bay Hotel, his girlfriend, her psychic friend and a psyche friend, came across the puppet tribe of Andre Toulon. They also learn about a demon from another dimension that holds Toulon responsible for stealing the mystery of the living. Sutekh (demon) sends totems, crazy little creatures that look like ears without shells. It is up to the puppet ensemble to take care of the interdimensional threat that is trying to kill new friends there. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget films, this movie has continuity problems. How did the puppets return to the trunk? How come no one remembers the last rattling of the killers at the hotel? Who bought the hotel? Why would a contractor in a building with a history of mass murder? All this and many other questions will not be answered ... ever. The real surprise of this movie is acting. It's actually pretty good. Actors enjoy it unusually unusually, especially for a lot of Full Moon nonames. Teresa Hill was particularly impressive as shy, nervous, psychic Lauren. Chandra West (Susie) was also a pleasant surprise. Gordon Hill was a tolerant protagonist. But Cameron was too uncomfortable on his stomach. Thank God, norse, who died earlier than halfway. Puppets are usually an animated self. With some improvements. There the emotions (especially the Jester) are much more human due to the sounds given to them. Blade's hiss, Pinhead's grunts and Six-Shooter's grief have been improved and sounded much better. Stop-motion animation is at best only average, especially totems. They seem not to move as smoothly as the previous installment in the series. Also, the Sutekh costume is absolutely amazing. How are we to fear the face of such a humorous looking. The story seems to be a bit of a juvenile for the show. I think Charlie Band wanted to focus on a younger demographic group. The violence alleviated in this film seems to speak the same way. Gore fans will be disappointed. <br /> <br /> I think the above is a major issue, this movie can't really stick with many people. She has no violence on gorewhores. The language is a little cleaner. But it is too violent and harsh. Which is why the film gets a low rating. I have to say that common reviews are mostly fair.
