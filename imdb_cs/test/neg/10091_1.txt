Maybe it was the fact that I saw Spider-man a day before I saw Duces Wild, but I don't think there could be any excuse for this movie as bad as it was. The cast was there to do it, but once they found it with a decent cast, they had to try to fit into the movie. The only problem was that they didn't fit. I didn't like any of the characters and the story was superficial at best. I left wondering why I spent my money on this movie.
