Kite Runner started out as one of the "important" films most people cried because they were told they should if they wanted to be among the elite and quickly descended into the idiotic movie of the absurdly exotic proportions. I've never read a book and never felt a need because I'm honest. Of course, I called it uninformed that I was saying it, but I really have no interest in further "pulling", copying all the other story lines, to get emotions from the reader's novel, even when set in Afghanistan. Br /> <br /> That means I was watching the movie. I heard good things about his beauty and how it was moving and decided why not? As it turned out, it was a very good reason not to. Not only was the so-called main character utterly unsympathetic (I get it, he was young and that is a film of redemption, but honestly, he was horrible. I hated him and not so well "Anti-hero") boring, idiotic, self-absorbed character I didn't feel anything k), but the rest of the story was so utterly absurd that I couldn't believe how everyone else was gliding over how beautiful it was and how they shouted and moved. I'm sorry, but I feel like I moved something that is realistic, Sci-Fi is known to move me, fantasy ... but this? Please. This has surpassed many other films for pure absurdity! My biggest boss, Hassan was Amir's brother ... really? Are you sure you didn't pull it out of a thousand other stories? Positive that this particular tidbit was not just added to an attempt to pull more tears out of the audience (y'know type of people looking for reasons to cry during the movie)? When I found out that it could only be down the hill (not to mention the flickering back to Star Wars "Amir, Hassan is your brother" "NOOOoo, that's not true, it's IMPOSSIBLE!") And certainly yes. He had cliched to the edges of the clich√© and was only planning a silly story. As a "good kid miraculously escapes a bad guy against all odds with the help of a spunky guy who, despite being cruelly sodomized and have no idea who you are willing to help with a properly placed weapon that has special significance for you". Ooh and don't forget about such an idiotic "ultimate revenge on the guy who teased you when you were little, surprised that he turned into an adult psychopath" (believe me, guys, I understand you want to live on TV through movies) You know that kid who teased you in high school ... he's not a terrorist, he's probably an accountant. Oh, and I have to mention CGI-tasting dragons! I think they were on the same level as "Matrix" and "Transformers" bravo, guys! BRAVO! This movie seems to have just been created for Western viewers who need a reason to look after the Middle East (hey, an overly emotional friendly story will work!) This is one of the noisiest movies I had the bad luck that I saw it, it's so deep ... but when you get it, it's nothing special. Unfortunately, the core of the American viewer will do what he will do. He said and followed "It's about controversial material, so it must be good!" way of thinking.
