Like many people, I believe that the 1989 Lonesome Dove epic was one of the best westerns ever made, perhaps the best. And when I realized that most of the sequels (in this case the prequel) would certainly disappoint, my expectations were low. Comanche Moon encountered this expectation with his fringe control and gaming, bad casting, and frankly, a lousy scenario. Lonesome Dove created the western heroes of Captains McCrae and Call for the incredibly powerful performances of Robert Duvalle and Tommy Lee Jones. Before we lived in Lonesome Dove, we believed that they fought bravely to get rid of Texas outlaws and savages. If I could only see Comanche Moon, I would think these two skeletons were a few incompetent, cowardly idiots. At Lonesome Dove, Call and McCrae reportedly pursued Blue Duck all over Texas and never managed to catch or kill. At Comanche Moon, the shot to Call's heel shot him to settle down and raise his cattle. There was no fistfight in the whole miniseries or a gun fight. The best punch was McCrea Suckers punching Inez Scull, a funny scene, but out of character for McCrae. Where was McCrae wit and charm? Clara's love for McCrae, a drunk, unshaven slacker and philanderer was totally unlikely. And Maggie's love for Call, a scattered and annoying loner, resists logic. Cinematography was excellent, superior to the original. This is due not only to HD technology, but also to the cameraman. The Comanche Moon miniseries was better than anything else on television for three nights, but unfortunately it doesn't say much.
