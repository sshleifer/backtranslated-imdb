Have you ever seen "Marathon Man"? The dentist part? I'd rather make it happen to me than to sit back "Random Hearts". It wasn't just uninteresting or carefree-- it was terribly, painfully and painfully BORING. I lost consciousness in one place for a moment. For the average layman, I may have seemed asleep, but the other film patrons knowingly realized that I was actually BLACKED OUT of the bordom. I thought I'd die. When the movie finally ended (I think it was twelve o'clock, but I'm not sure), I dropped exhasperated "Thank you Jesus, it's over !!" to which all the other movie viewers cheered. If I had to listen to Harrison Ford's probe for another second in that monotonous whine, I'd be forced to look for something sharp to get stuck in my eye and distract my attention. That's 136 minutes of my life, I'll never come back.
