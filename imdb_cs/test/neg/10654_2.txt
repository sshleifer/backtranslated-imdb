This movie is terrible, it was so hard to believe that Katie became a sincere teenager with the power to save the Chinese's regret. And the rest of the conspiracy did not make any effort to show us more than just reasonable common sense ... <br /> <br /> The story is ridiculous and all we can get out of it is that it shows how arrogant a person can be . Katie had to inherit her arrogance from her mother, the most savage figure I had seen for a long time. Acting and scenery were fine, but the plot destroys everything full of cheap clich√©s and hypocritical scenes, expecting to see this film again in my life. Skip this!
