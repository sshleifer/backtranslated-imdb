You'll have to take a breath for this one ... Awful special effects trying to reach far beyond the budget. Muddy and blatant plagiarism of other sci-fi movies (like Pitch Black). Terrible dealings. Endless slow motion scene figures aimlessly over sand dunes. A meandering dialogue that does nothing to support the story. Figures wearing turtle neck sweaters on a desert planet with two suns. "Freight" ship occupied by camouflage-wearing crew of weapons-toting soldiers (why exactly would you need a forest camouflage in space anyway?). Some of the worst casting options in the history of a non-budget movie-making - steroid swollen "captain" who comes more like a muscle-beach athlete than a trusted commander, and "incriminating" who looks and acts about as dangerous as a bunny. 70 minutes in length, of which 35 could be cut out if the director had a concept of "time compression through editing" ... <br /> <br /> I won't continue. All I have to say is that while some of the frightening film may be (and should) be forgiven for a low budget; Bad concepts, funny holes and snore-inducing script are unforgivable on * every * budget. The end result is tedious, boring, waste of time. Sorry guys, I hate being so tough on amateur movies, but I don't apologize for doing this kind of work.
