It is very rare to see a 1955 movie that I do not love. Noir, JD, Sci-Fi, Drive-Ins; I dug the most. Robert Aldrich is a director who has done a lot of great work and most of these games are performing well under his belt. So what went wrong? When I was working in a world of independent films, we talked about something called "actor films." Actors' films are films that are different to anyone else's. Actors as "actor films" because they see ACTing - which is absolutely over-the-top melodrama. Actors love to be completely free to "give her everything they have" and they are very happy with the way other actors watch it. In many interviews with the actors they say, "He was a great director, he never interfered with me." In fact, it's the opposite of a good director, because the whole BOD who has a director on the stage is to keep the actors doing themselves crazy (which they will always do with a chance). Robert Aldrich seems to have forgotten about it. Or maybe he was sick. Or maybe he thought there was no hope of saving the script first, so what the hell? Whatever the case, here is an example of a lesser-known film that is forgotten. The characters gesticulate, pontify, and generally notice. One thing I can say is realistic: it is set in Hollywood and everyone behaves as their minor problems are the most important thing in the world. It's not fun to watch, but it's realistic. What is not realistic is that the producer is so desperate to keep his star under contract, be out of his way to antagonize him in almost every possible way - including the requirement to engage in illegal activity. But this and other conspiracies of conspiracy only carry the melodrama, which increases the opportunity to squint and scream. I managed to get to the end of this movie, which is no worse than the "3" of 10 in my book. But why try your own endurance when there is so much else available to rent?
