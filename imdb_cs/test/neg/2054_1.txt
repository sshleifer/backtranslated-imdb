I rented this movie today ... the worst movie EVER. It was a complete waste of time and a terrible story. Acting was terrible, especially by actress "Sai". She was so bad that it was ridiculous. I can't tell if it was her bad deal or because the character was just stupid in the first place. I can't even get my mind around, how awful and senseless this whole movie was. I'm surprised by someone who thought it was a good idea to FILM this movie and bother to release it. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for a good Vampire / Horror flick .. it's not a movie for you. Move! It's a waste of time and money. Damn, I wouldn't DOWNLOAD this movie if someone paid me. This movie is so bad that it doesn't even deserve "1". I wish I could give "0"!
