I've seen all three of them. I can't believe how bad Naqoyqatsi is. Not in comparison to others, but simply on their own merits or lack. I can't understand how the average rating for this movie is over 6 out of 10. I gave the first 2 movies 8 out of 10. They were provocative and beautifully done. I gave this movie a rating of 1. If a 0 or a negative number was available, I'd give it a rating instead. What is a waste of time watching this movie. I thought I should turn it off after the first 30 minutes, but then I figured it was just a (very) slow movie start. The same thing I thought after 45 minutes, then 1 hour, etc. Then I realized it wouldn't be better. <br /> <br /> It's very tedious to watch and without any redemption features. Don't take the word for it, watch it yourself. Remember to see the first two movies before this. If you see it first, I can only guarantee that you will never want to see the first two, but they are definitely much, much better than this "piece of work". <br /> <br /> The best part of the movie is when credits roll at the end. This is when your repentance on this earth is complete and you can give up 89 minutes in purgatory, for the suffering you endured watching this "movie". If God is truly merciful, He will be more generous.
