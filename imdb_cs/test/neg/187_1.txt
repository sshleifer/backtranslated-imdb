and I still don't know where the hell is the movie going? Really, what is this movie about? Is it about Sean Connery being completely Arabic? Is it that if he could play the role of a Moroccan warrior, was it natural to play the role of Ramirez in the highlander? Why was Teddy Roosevelt even in this movie? Why was there so much sand that was so underused? Where were so many tables slapping? Why did Teddy ignore the Japanese guy with whom he shoots archery? Did he realize that the man was Japanese? Why was there no credible excuse for Connery's accent? At least Jean Claude Van Damme has an excuse for his French accent, whether it was raised by French nuns in Hong Kong (Double Impact), being raised on bayou in Louisiana (a universal soldier), or having a French mother and being raised. in Indochina (Can't I Remember the Name of the Movie)? Can anyone explain it?
