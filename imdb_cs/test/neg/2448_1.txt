Incredible. I've never seen anything like this. Everything is wrong; really bad. From photography (lots of scenes without focus) to acting (young bitch is terrible). And what can we say about those helicopters made in Paint Brush ...? Really awesome B, I think Z movie. The plot is bad, clich√© and bad he wrote. The basics of scenario functionality seem to work. I don't even think this movie is a young film student. Nothing justifies it. <br /> <br /> I suggest you don't think you could see this movie. Sleep or play alone are the best choices. ;) <br /> <br /> xxx
