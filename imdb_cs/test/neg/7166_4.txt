Once I saw pieces and pieces on TV and when my friend recommended it, I started looking for it, though it didn't seem to be around. I finally got hold of him in the antique shop and I couldn't wait to see it ... Oh, I saw it a few years ago and I could really enjoy it. I was surprised that this film was only 80 minutes long, and I think that's what made the storyline and story so little. The story really sounds like good, both on trailer and movie comments: teenager, Angus (Jesse Bradford) and his newfound stray lab Yellow are marooned on the island during a storm on a boat trip with his father (Bruce Davison). Together, they manage to survive the wilderness and wait for them to be found and saved. However, it never mentions that everything is shortened, and conspiracy events are very rushed. A love interest is possible between Angus and Sarah, but they never show more than a moment. Yellow is a malevolent dog whose parents are reluctant to keep, but in a few days it seems to be sufficiently appreciated to join a boat trip. The mother scene (Mimi Rogers), who uncertainly mentions the death of a younger boy (Joel Palmer), does not go anywhere. At no time did they learn that they had spent 9 days on the island, then suddenly it was 14, then 19. Of all the animals, a castaway could be exposed in the wild, only one species - a wolf - would attack them. Why couldn't there be something else instead of having the same type of animal - maybe the same - a strike twice? There are few insights into how Angus prepares food, except when it detects fruit and roots, and when baking a trapped rat. If he knows so much about survival skills, why wasn't it more scenes with what turned out to be? One thing that made me empty was the fact that the dog wasn't wearing much. When he is rescued and the dog remains on the island, there is no scene showing how he will survive without human help. I wished I was more open to watching, but I enjoyed some of it. The behavior was good and the score was nice. While I found out why his father looked much older than his family, and why he shares names with the main search engine and rescuer. This is a good movie for kids, but while the protagonist is 14, no one over 10 would be interested.
