All I can do is echo that some other commentators have already expressed. This is CITY OF GOD meets HAPPY DAYS. The bipolarity of a ruthless robber (one minute of a reckless killer, another minute of commercial advertising of Luv's diaper) is completely unconvincing. You can access it in one of two ways: (1) a bold, realistic movie has become a shock; or (2) sappy, ABC-afterschool-specialty with profanity, violence, and cruelty to animals. Either way, you're not going to do it? Why did she get so much praise? As indicated by others, he will get a "conscience" from the West. Show us the pictures of poverty that contrast with the fluffy, double-wide theatrical seats and the 44 oz wheels, and we clap our hands on the pulse. But - you must not forget to match it, because the bitter pill of reality (irritating as it is) is hard for us to swallow. I'm terribly disappointed that this film has received so many awards and honors, especially where there are a lot more deserving films. All I can say is: beware of any film that receives awards (Hollywood Oscars = sweeping, tripe syrups). To find real gems, you'll have to work hard on it.
