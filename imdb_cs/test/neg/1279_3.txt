Some people think about Sweden negatively: too clean, too clean, too serious, too organized and too northern. People tortured by their own religious fate and history, sometimes leading to depression and forced hardship. For filmmakers, this may not be a problem, such as the late Bergman has shown us what can be possible under these conditions. Bergman used his identity as a starting point and did not expressly address this identity as such. But Andersson does the opposite: he only comments on this identity, dividing his people into bone: in his world, Sweden is the equivalent of hell on earth. However, it does not take it further and for me it is not only an art but merely an annotation. Despite the extraordinary time this filmmaker needed to have serious restrictions, he cannot stand out. There is no progress compared to his previous film Sånger från andra våningen / Songs from Second Floor. The intention was to make it more accessible, but the difference is minimal and a few scenes that try to please a larger audience are not the best in the movie. The same absurdism and minimalism are still in place, there is one shot camera position and (lack of) action before this shot. Yes, the photos are well done, some scenes actually work and coloring and placement is amazing. But does it make an interesting movie? In a negative sense, the cinema is a step backwards. Andersson's background as an advertising creator is shining through a complicated setup, but his movies are as empty as those ads. There is a message of humanity, but it is trivial and without great depth.
