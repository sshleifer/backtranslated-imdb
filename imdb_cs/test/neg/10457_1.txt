If you're like me and sometimes enjoy watching terrible movies (I think it's kind of like a car crash), you can't do better than that! The storyline is unbreakable, special effects are cheerful and acting is one of the worst you will ever see! 4 THUMBS DOWN! WOOOHOOOOOOOO !!! Seriously, I have no idea how director and "actors" can sleep at night! It's painful, yet hysterically funny to watch and highly recommend for those who want to punish for something. If you can watch this crap without waving, you are a better person than I will ever be! I wonder if the producer of this waste had no idea what he got into (and his money) into!
