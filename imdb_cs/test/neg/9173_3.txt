What can I say ... not much to this. Pretty boring and uninteresting. The actors are fine. The only thing that shines in any case is Simmons, but it has only 3 scenes. I understand that keeping the time on the screen keeps the mysterious psychic aura he has, but I can't help but feel that his talent has been wasted. No one else has risen above average. <br /> <br /> The story itself seems to be interesting at the beginning, but then it won't go anywhere. There wasn't a single scene in the movie that would interest me, or make me feel like I just saw something special. The cinematography was quite insignificant ... I mean the desert in the kind of cuttlefish ... not too inspiring. The story of his childhood friend outside prison seemed to be only partially thought out and did not do it. Do not add anything else to the story but create an average "Twilight Zone" script for feature. Drab.
