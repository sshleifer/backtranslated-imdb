SPOILER ALERT. <br /> <br /> This movie will spoil you in the afternoon or the "small hours of the morning" observation slot. I like Marc Singer. He portrayed the good characters in the roles I saw. Until this movie. <br /> <br /> What starts as a promising movie will soon disappear alone with catastrophic cgi'd backgrounds and extreme close up to the person who dies ... <br /> <br /> Then it gets worse. <br /> <br /> Much worse. To describe it as a Hammy, they would offend the pigs. This film goes to the bottom of a ham barrel and scratches there. In addition to Marc Singer's crowded hamming, Mike Impact stomps and plods around the scenery look like he is afraid he might fall on the rocks and his wide-eyed 'manic' bad guy just makes him look like moron . He's not threatening at all. George Stults looks like a deer caught in the spotlight. He claims to have been threatened by the other two but his character would be threatened by the treasurer to offer him "paper or plastic". This is really a vehicle for Nicole Eggert as an independent woman getting her life back in spite of attracting a bad person ... She was extraordinary. This is not a remake, but it is remarkably similar to "Cliffhanger" - a seasoned wizard, losing someone in the fall, conscience erect to help someone else, missing a treasure worth the money and a gang of n'er-do- wells who use the guide. Except for Cliffhanger, there was an excellent vehicle for Stallone and Lithgow. I must admit that Lithgow stole the show. Even unintentional comedy was bad. There were times when I wasn't sure if they were using a rubber-coated model as a stand-in for Singer as he tried in vain with the weather station (no pun). Squeezing his face to the door post and his clumsy manner generally didn't help his character. <br /> <br /> Avoid. No, seriously, avoid it. Save 96 minutes of your life and do something more constructive, like watching dry color or growing grass. Or just close your eyes and examine your eyelids back for 90 minutes ...
