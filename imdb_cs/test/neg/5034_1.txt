His ten-year experience of how this movie came out and the sands of time didn't improve once again, like the other comments made by Aussie's filmmakers, should have a little more drama than the Central American riders who ride beautiful bikes. s not much in dialogue. the middle class isn't funny or rich. There is also a mash mash casting. why a young woman will marry a man who is old enough to be her father will escape me. It is such a disgrace to this movie, it looks like a wonderful place to go. Anyway, I will never be able to return his hour and thirty minutes of my life. life for a short watch this movie.
