Has he rarely seen a film that deviates from the original assumption and still remains (more or less) acceptable? Bloodline is quite short (which is a good thing in this case) escapade, which focuses on the mysterious Hellraiser box. Whoever wanted it done and cast the spell on the whole bloodline of the man who eventually created it. Introducing the 3 Generations of the Merchant Family (all played by Bruce Ramsey); one in Paris 18th century, one in the present and the last in the future galaxy far, far? Opinions on this story can vary a lot: either you think it's very idiotic and far-fetched or original and bold. Clive Barker's initial atmosphere and environment completely disappeared, but the morbid surrounding remains and several sequences are still very scary and disturbing. Hellraiser: Bloodline has a lot of beautiful defeats and Pinhead's charismatic presence (Doug Bradley) is still an extra horror value. Pinhead ?? this time accompanied by a domestic puppy? still knows how to kill? Too bad talks too much and its bad speeches tend to get bored quickly. The best aspect of this production is the newly introduced "cenobity" and the occult Parisian portrait. Giant turn-offs are a weak scenario, the absence of typical horror humor, and a lack of references to Barker's masterpiece. While Bloodline is not memorable, it is the latest trackable Hellraiser movie. After this sequel, the series went completely down. So far, 2 more sequels have been published (2 others are still in the process) and neither of them is worth seeing. Hellraiser: Bloodline suffered from a lot of manufacturing problems, and the director finally preferred to be credited as Alan Smithee, which means he doesn't want to be remembered as a director. Who could blame him?
