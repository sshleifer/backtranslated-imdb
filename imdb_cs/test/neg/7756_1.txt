My only regret is that one can't rate an IMDb movie with 0. "The price ..." would certainly deserve it! U LEAST. <br /> <br /> SPOILER? * The film begins with a lot of people entering the crypt to wake the old Vampire. When a person cuts out and his blood drips and falls on a putrefying and dried corpse to be a bloodthirsty, a metamorphosis occurs and a vampire in the ANIMATION effect (believing it!) More human form only to reveal that he is wearing a tuxedo and butterfly! BOW-TIE, yes. Red, if my memory serves me! I tried to randomly jump through random scenes, but it was no better than the opening sequence. That's the point where I turned the movie off, I cursed him for hoping to see the Vampire movie. It certainly doesn't matter if you don't have 5 and you could take such stupidity seriously. So if you like vampires and don't want to feel rebellious or even disgusted, learn from my mistake and not. Don't even try to see this waste!
