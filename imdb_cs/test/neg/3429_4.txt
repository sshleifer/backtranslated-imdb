This World War II film, which takes place in Borneo, tries to work so hard on many levels, it is a pity that they will not succeed on all of them. his comrades the Japanese. It goes deep into the jungles of Borneo, lost. Cue Nigel Havers, who finds Nolte's adoptive tribe. Nolte, now looking like Robert Plant, has become the new king of his tribe. In a bloody battle, he defeated a reliable warrior and had a tattoo on his chest. Now, before you go out and get a painful tattoo and a one-way ticket to Borneo, Nolteland is not doing well. Havers wants tribal help to fight the Japanese who attack the island. He teaches natives how to use machine guns, and starts a lot about filming. As the tribe becomes more successful, they flee the new Japanese squadron, who are not like others. This group can demolish the villages that conquer to maintain their strength (talk about your sushi), and go through the jungles even faster than the tribe. Since we know the outcome of the war, we know that the tribe finally triumphs, but with heavy casualties. Here come spoilers: Havers is hurt and returned to "civilization". He gives the location of the kingdom and Nolte is captured. Havers then goes through the problem of releasing Nolte, and the end of credits. Milius' direction is certainly sufficient, but the script is rather unclear in his motivations. It presents story ideas, then leaves them to get into the next story idea. Nolte is terrible when the soldier turned to the king and desperately tried to direct Colonel Marlon Brando Kurtz's spirit. They talk about the freedom and beauty of the jungle and the wealth of their people, and for one second you won't believe the words they pronounce. He is often unintentionally humorous, especially his initial mistake in the jungle, and he spends the rest of the movie sounding hippie. Nigel Havers spent the film looking at Nolte as Raquel Welch. Unclear homosexual undercurrent between both people goes beyond friendship, not entirely sex, and settles into an unspoken relationship that had to have speaking natives. Havers often stands around and has an inner conflict, repelled by tribal tribal hunting, but heated in Nolte's attention. His fellow British troops ride faster than the Bounty landing in Tahiti, but all I have seen about Borneo is that he is very damp and has lots of greenery. Away Nolte location is completely without any reason. There's no idea why Havers does it, except for the film to continue. I was upset when Havers and Nolte ended up on the same boat going to the Philippines, the boat ran to the ground and Havers ran to the holder to free the freshly trimmed Nolte. No goodbye kiss, but Havers and the King say goodbye, explaining the title. If you were to fight the war and the enemy squadron ate your allies, would that not do you? This elite Japanese group is not sufficiently proven, although their eating habits are so terrible that I would immediately witness conscientiousness. The same type of ghost enemy was handled much better in "The 13. Warrior". <br /> <br /> Other interesting ideas are omitted. And what about the fact that modern technology causes the death of so many backward people? Why did King Nolte let the British use his items without too much hesitation? Why can't Hollywood find a decent actor to play General Douglas MacArthur? Finally, "Farewell to the King" is a breakdown that is not anchored by strong leadership and is trying to be too much without thinking and exploring its possibilities. I can't recommend this. This film is rated (PG13) for strong physical violence, strong arms violence, some gore, some profanity, some sexual references, and adult situations.
