I thought it might be a value for this movie and it was all right. I can sum up by leaving a bad taste in my mouth. The film started fine, I think the initial characterization of Herc was true for myths. Both the baby and the young adult began a very strong but brightest light bulb. But later, somehow, it turns into a charismatic spokesman that everyone loves. Huh? Another problem: horrible CGI. Satyr looked fine, but the rest of the animals looked terrible, especially hart, the most interesting animal in the movie. And how was Leelee Sobieski's skin ever golden, sometimes normal? The worst part for me - and everyone should cover - was twelve Hercules' works. Because manufacturers probably didn't want to cover all of them; Maybe they thought the primitive heads of the bolts that were following this waste couldn't count that high. Instead of TWELVE's Hercules, we got Hercules five. Yes, the five works! WTF?!? He didn't finish last, so it was really 4 1/2 work! Just awful. I take Hercules: The Legendary Journeys through this piece of crap every day of the week.
