I think if you like snow, you can enjoy some nice scenery and nice tricks. but that's all the movie has to offer. the story line is non-existent and some jokes that could have been in the movie were not funny, even on the level of sympathy. I also didn't like the characters, the main actor (Adam Grimes) tried the best and for a comedy that doesn't have to be much, but when he is surrounded by so many other bad actors, he had no hope of making this movie good. but I shouldn't be too harsh on them, I know for all that they could have a great skill, but with a script that I could write in ten minutes, what skills they were running and hid the fear of appearing in this movie. my advice is not to watch it, I wish never!
