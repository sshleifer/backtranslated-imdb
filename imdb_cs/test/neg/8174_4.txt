All right, here's a little ... this film is full of whimsical dialogue, despite the best performance and the script that should be overwhelmed. because over the upper playing and poorly written lines. I couldn't help laughing in moments that were supposed to be very serious. The bright place in this movie is circus. To see the circus in its heyday was certainly a delicacy. There are times that go through as well. But then it nosedives back to B-film territory. I was tempted to stop following him several times. Of course, I don't know how best it was. It had to be a slow year!
