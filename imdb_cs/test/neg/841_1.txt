Okay, so one night with me and some friends, I decided to get in and see the movie. Unfortunately, we chose Ernest Goes for Africa for us. I've never laughed in my life. This movie is wrong. I literally chose better films than 'Ernest Goes to Africa.' (I poop movies) <br /> <br /> The highlight of this film, at least for me, was the opening sequence, when Ernest makes silly faces. When they showed him the size of peanuts, I lost it. Maybe I found out that it was so fun because at that moment I was the highest. Maybe you're right. If I had to guess what George W. Bush's favorite movie is, I'd guess that Ernest goes to Africa. I've never seen a movie that relies more on the stereotypes of people's fifties. There were times when the words escaped me and I just stared in amazement. <br /> <br /> When I watched it, I couldn't help but the movie was designed for children? Are literate adults looking at it? How could there be a whole series of "Ernest" movies? Is it really my life? Is it real? I hated this movie.
