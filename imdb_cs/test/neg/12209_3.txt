Like I love David Copperfield's story, I can't say I enjoyed this movie. It was probably the second worst movie I've ever seen. One problem I see is that the size of a novel requires a few hours rather than a regular movie. It is impossible to capture a large number of events that take place in the story in two hours. I do not like the flashback format meditation. That was incoherent and it would be impossible for someone who didn't know the story to fully understand. I also don't think the creators correctly interpreted Copperfield's personality. The idea of ​​walking on the beach moaning about his life seems to run counter to the proactive, forward-thinking nature that Dickens gave him in the novel. Agnes also worried me. Instead of a strong woman hit a ditsy household. But Dora was perfect. This movie was full of trouble, and I waited impatiently for someone to make a decent screen.
