My blurred childhood memories have retained the echo of the iconic Belphégor series in the 1960s ... and so I wanted to see a large-scale adaptation. I should have kept my money and went for a walk in the Louvre. The idea of ​​the screenplay is still very interesting and interesting (the phantom Le Louvre), but the adaptation is ridiculous. Dialogues hesitate between French irony and serious "American business" without reaching but not sounding asinin. The worksheets are desirable in some way and the special effects are weak compared to what can be expected (low budget)?). <br /> <br /> There's nothing left of it. Not much beyond a few good shots from Paris ... which is rarely disappointing. Belphégor was worth more. <br /> <br />
