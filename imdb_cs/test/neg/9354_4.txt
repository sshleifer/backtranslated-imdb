"Helen of Troy" follows the story of Helena and the outbreak of the Trojan War. Rather, it is a love story between Helen and Paris, which is wrecked and falls in love with Helena without knowing she is a queen. The film shows the couple as loving and wants nothing more than to be together. (Other movies and books have different ideas about characters, but they're just hopelessly in love with this.) The movie is quite slow in some places, but the scenery and detail are pretty good. There are also some good performances. I thought the slave was doing a particularly good job and was one of the most popular characters. Overall, this is a good adaptation if you can look behind a slow story of places and look beyond some kitschy romanticism and dialogue. In my opinion, the perfect movie version of Iliad has not yet been created, but it is fun and has some good pieces.
