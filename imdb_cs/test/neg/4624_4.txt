This movie started with some promise: a big name cast, a good looking set, but then it broke down. Most of the time it can't tell if it's a serious movie or a comedy. One minute there is talk about how no joy is in killing, and another is a fighting scene designed for fun music and humorous joking. Some of the games are very bad, especially from Patrick Swayze and Piper Perabo. She also gets some hoarsier lines like, "When I marry, it will be about love." T Ugh. But the worst thing about this movie is that it's just boring. Lack of action, not enough humor, not enough plot, nothing really really. Just a lot of clichÃ©s and cheesy moments. Also, the movie "Dragon" in the title should contain much more dragons than the few (and pathetic CGI dragons) that appeared in this movie. br /> <br /> Can't view the SciFi channel * any good movies?
