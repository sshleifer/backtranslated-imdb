Noire is a genre that requires a certain level of tactics, cleverness, intellect and images. This film has none of it, even if it really tried with the paintings. It's a kind of movie that your cousin Marky's dumper driver who always talks about how it will make a big one. movies once, did. The dialogue is wooden and lifeless. The visuals, although of course expensive, are the work of a director who has tried to be clever and has failed miserably due to a serious lack of brain skills. Negotiations ranged from subpar to simple bad. The story could have been saved by a real writer and director, but I think such people wouldn't touch the boat with a pole. About 1/4 of the way I noticed that I noticed striking similarities with the scene in Sim0ne, where Viktor, desperately trying to get rid of his actress, is making the world's worst movie. I thought I'd check the IMDb to see if there was a similar effect in this movie and my surprise. I would almost be tempted to put 2 out of 10 just because it is exposed to demanding groups, but I am not. It's so bad.
