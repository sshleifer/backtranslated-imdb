As other reviews have said, another of the myriad of Alien clones, this time with the great The Terminator, embedded, add a bit of the classic SF Story "Who's Going There?" Andromeda Strain (the apparently blinking red lights make the murderer killer demons unable to detect the frightened people three centimeters away). and we kill each other. <br /> <br /> "25 years later". The crew of the Mars-orbiting relay station, scheduled to be released in 48 hours, will reveal a giant spaceship on the collision course. It's Siberia, the ship we saw in the opening sequence. It is not a good time to connect anything that is useful to the relay station and make some repairs. The approaching ship does not deviate from its run and broadcasts "NOT THAT ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ENTER THIS SHIP!" Warning. After a lot of screaming, the crew of the relay station is stacking up and getting out of the way just when it's time. However, the ship is changing direction and colliding in any way - it charges one of the crews for a spy thing that is at the top. The satellite will begin to "release integrity". The bits are depressurized. Lots of other shouts and runs in which only two crew members are sucked into the rear. (Why are they ALWAYS sucked back?). After a few keystrokes, a wheelchair user connected techy (which is called "Wheeler" - the only recognizable joke in the entire movie) that Siberia was exhausting them and needed to go aboard and shut down the engines. They all go aboard and take off their helmets. "Don't enter this ship!" apparently means getting aboard a ship and exposing yourself to any fatal infectious disease. One team heads to the main computer room to find a dead frozen guy who touches what looks like an American Express card, but it turns out to be a minidisc. The second team will find some switches. Surprisingly, it turns out that the dead guy is the father of an attractive female crew who will most likely survive a clash with a furious alien. They shut down the engines, but that means the reactor reactor will explode. Haunted Point of View Shot kills people. There was some stupidity in Siberia when she discovered a new ore, a petite energy source worth millions, which means that the more venals the crew members were in danger of getting to her. POV shot returns with horror! Hey! walking sounds on the soundtrack. Unfortunately, it gives you the idea that the killer is wearing corduroy pants and the effect is unnecessary. After it's all just running around and killing ugly and acting as long as only the distinct survivors survive - along with a cute dog who managed to lead at least two crew members to their death. It is precisely because space hardened veterans are wandering into the jaws of certain death looking for their pet cats and dogs for a long time a mystery of this kind of film. Other silly highlights include all those who forget to deal with falling oxygen levels until they remind them of the on-board computer's voice (not that low oxygen levels somehow dampen any of the impressive fires of this idiots load). If the Killer Droid id is so clever that it can drive a boat in a tight curve and have another go to the relay station's upset, why didn't it turn out "NOT BY ANY CIRCUMSTANCES Enter this ship!" warning sign .. I'm sure if it was looking for more people to kill then scream GO AWAY! It wasn't a good way to go. Musetta Vander is the only person who gets to do any acting - everyone else just burns his nostrils all the time while they tear their teeth and scream and aim at guns. each other. It's such a script; full of exclamation marks - the only thing that followed me to the end was the hope that the script would require her to take off her clothes or get wet when she wasn't wearing enough. Unfortunately, no. One of the things that is wrong with this movie (besides having more cyanas on screen than in any other movie) is that there was no gratuitous nudity.
