This is the first porn I tried to review. It requires a different approach than usual because the allegory will not reward an autopsy. "I'm an American. I'm a virgin." "We are Europeans. We are cultivated and sex-insane." "It's nice when we all screw each other." A lot to talk about! Well, there is in fact, compared to the average 60s volleyball without numbers. And the charming patina of the "class" brings at least clean, detailed compositions. But what the hell is that about porn? OK then: the only scene I really (rhetorically) got out of was the first time Brigitte Maier entered. There is an effort to fit into the nice diversity of race and age while leaving no two men anywhere close together; one black man suffers from premature attack of editorial coitus interruptus. And multiple shots or not, one perhaps indescribable act on IMDb seems to have been partially simulated by a surgical hose. Still, I stayed awake and it was eight in the morning ... but what does that mean?
