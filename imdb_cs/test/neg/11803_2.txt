I was surprised that the creators of this film actually came out and said that this film was a real story. Most of the scenes seemed fake to me. For example, when a girl ate a sandwich and there was a roach in it. While she was eating a sandwich, the camera on the opposite side showed that there was a fence on it. It's funny how the camera just shot on a sandwich when the girl ate it. The next scene is when the gang went to open the wardrobe and the cat flew out of the closet, or I should say it was thrown out to make it work. This film wasn't realistic at all. It is very doubtful that the events that happened were true the evening of the "St. Francisville Experiment". I believe the house can be scary, but not the night the movie was shot! The end was fun when Tim and another girl were strapped into a cellar. Paul and Madison found and saved them! I'd rather watch Blair's witches' project again and then have to go through the film again. Francisville Experiment. As I said, if filmmakers didn't say that this is a true story with real events, maybe I like it more. Your Better To Get More Fun From The Blair Witch Project (Although It's Not True Story One) !!!
