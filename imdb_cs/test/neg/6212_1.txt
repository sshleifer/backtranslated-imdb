This film is widely encouraged as a copy of Will Smith Hitch's feature. The movie was boring. This film is not as boring as unbearable. Govinda looks at the path around his prime. He's not on his best roles like that. This is similarly unconvincing as his performance in Deewana Mastan. Salman Khan is on his eye-aching "best". And that is in several scenes where she recalls how to wear clothes. It could only be because of the nepotism that scenes from these eyes could be saved from the trash can of every floor of the film. Another case of most Bollywood spectators who find themselves embarrassed in this quarrel.
