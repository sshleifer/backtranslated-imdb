I got a kick Reynolds, who told his lawyer, "Look, I've done a lot of things in my life, but I've never killed anyone." Apparently he forgot his career, which slid down the hill after he started making silly movies like "Cannonball Run." Physical evidence was originally supposed to be a sequel to 'Jagged Edge' that Glen Close honestly refused. The verdict is in, to avoid physical evidence.
