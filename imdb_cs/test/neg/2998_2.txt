First a simple part: this film is a crapola! That made me think "Magnolia". And then I thought, "Wow - someone made the film even foolier and more exciting than" Magnolia ". The film school does not know anything about telling the story. Fly conspiracy elements and toboggan symbolism are bad enough, but dialogue is just pathetic. Not, the "elegic" parts are nice pictures of the coffee table with average music, the "emotional" parts are simplistic. br /> <br /> I still can't believe that some people have given this picture.
