The only Riddle in this movie was how it happened. the British film industry needs movies that people really want to watch and not look for taxpayers' money (a'la BBC) to keep Luvvies in their lifestyle they've been used to, and have done nothing for it. The film was totally wrong with British films, relying on stereotypes, it had to be about London, where people were either Posh and corrupt, Gangsters, Luvvies or gawd blimey-type entangled eels; Weak, to the point where the policeman pulled the phone and the ring tone was the "Sweeney" theme I was expecting. The whole movie was a happy sweeney / minder rip off shopper. the unforgettable manuscript that I noticed, left behind and lost on several occasions and it is something that I have not brought with my limited street wisdom in my breast pocket to everyone, to the beach and fighting, etc. Say that Vinnie Jones is nice, which is probably the only thing in the movie, a poor guy. When Derek Jacobi walked into the water at the end because he was Dickens, oh my god, what a load of crap, and I'm here positive
