Okay, they say it's real. They do not write any screenwriters or directors, but they will show one of these films to everyone - it is not real in the way you hoped. Talking rarely sounds like a real natural conversation ... but also not the sound to be written. (maybe written freely). For me it sounded a lot more as if they were always trying ad-lib. (which almost always did wrong). They knew because they were making "film", not just collecting real natural shots. So I'm sure these people knew what was going on, they knew they had some places to look for things that had been set up ... and they were told they should notice. <br /> <br /> ************* 'main spoilers' **************** ********* ******** ************************ <br /> <br /> Okay, it's so lame. Every object, place, or thing that might be strange or used as fear is staggered by these people. Let me list ridiculously obviously fake things that happen to remember: <br /> <br /> 1) Less than 2 minutes after entering the house, turn on the light switch - the light of the sparks and chandelier almost falls on the guy. 2) They came to find an old medical bag with a bloody butcher's knife * and explore the cellar at the same time. <br /> <br /> 3) He hears the noise of the armoire, so the door opens slowly - BAM - the cat is there, he jumps and jumps straight into the camera while shouting. 4) Then they notice that there is a hole in the wall, So let's hold your hand in ... wow, they pulled the baby doll wrapped in a mummy tape. 5) Let's go to the attic, uh-oh it's 'hard' up here .... BOOM - the chair flies over the room. 6) Time to Eat. Oh no ! The girl who was afraid of the bugs had CESTA in her sandwich! LOL! .... ridiculous. 7) Let's get out of the Ouija board ... oops one of the feet on the planchette fell off the side of the board. Couldn't that be because people were pushing it? (finds out there is a ghost named Charles) <br /> <br /> 8) Wait! What was the noise in the chimney ... CLINK - oh my shackles dropped out "I think you left people here". <br /> <br /> 9) Now the fool looks at the chimney shaft. ... oh what he sees ... and asks people who aren't looking for a chimney what it is. SWISH - Drops directly on her. (perfect camera) He's just in time. It was more of a chain. 10) Now we have to separate and each "clean" our designated rooms - it wouldn't be something if things started happening one by one to those people now ... all right: <br /> <br CHICK # 1: Wow, suddenly her room shakes ... but no elses does. DUDE # 1: Actually, he says, "Charles, it's you Charles ... it can't be you, because you're just a figment of my imagination that you're not Charles. Well guess what, he's knocked over and dragged over the floor Another shot of a happy camera. <br /> <br /> CHICK # 2: He hears things ... he tries to communicate ... and stands where the abrasion gets or something. <br /> <br /> DUDE # 2: He was in the attic, reached his arm through a hole in the floor and got a chip .... I don't remember what else. <br /> <br /> 11) Dude # 2 runs, gets Chick # 2. screaming and dude # 1 screaming ... they find them strapped to the wall and strapped to the table Cut to black The final text tells us that they have escaped safely, they have been treated for small incisions. we found out that the next day the 911 call was made by naming someone named "Charles". <br /> <br /> ************ * 'Major Spoilers' ***** *********** * ***************** over ********** ********** <br /> <br /> Okay, when I am for the first time he heard that the movie was made, I couldn't wait. I thought it would be real. REAL, REAL. - and more professional, with more professional people. I like the idea of ​​this kind of thing, I'd like to see real mysterious shots. Before the release of this movie, I saw a few people reviews online. They both claimed it was false and how stupid people were. So I found out that it went straight to video, rented it ... found that every brutal review was absolutely true. It's too bad, I really wanted it to be good. Random thought: The house seems to have no televisions, radios .. kitchen appliances I remember ... which would make me think no. man lived there long. Especially the house is really known for being haunted ... pretty sure nobody lives on them. But it looks so clean and tidy ... and what was the cat doing there? The property is not close to neighbors .... <br /> <br /> All-in-all, you'll just want to rent it if you and your friends want to sit back and make fun of it ... they heard a long time ago, and you were intrigued. (you will be disappointed if you expect a good movie ... or a real movie) <br /> <br /> Random thought: I believe the producer says the "shots" you see are real. Well technically it's real shots, right? Real shots of false ghosts? Maybe it was his loop hole. I gave this movie one star - just to tell the story of Madame LaLaurie. The real story of New Orleans. The best performance was the one who, in the beginning, teaches participants about ghost hunting equipment. He was obviously a real ... or a good actor. <br /> <br />
