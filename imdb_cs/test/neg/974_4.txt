With all the humbugs around the stars of the movie, this movie let me want. I was expecting a much better film with regard to the inclusion of Murphy, De Niro and Russ, but he found the film fell on the face. The comedy sequences were exaggerated and the excellent performances of the stars, especially De Niro and Russo, could not save this song! <br /> <br /> ** outside *****
