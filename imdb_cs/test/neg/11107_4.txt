First let me say that this film is nothing spectacular. Cast is like a rescued bell meeting, a monster is a guy in bad clothes and as always; the army is useless. It seems that the more training you have and the bigger your weapon, the more likely you are to die if you're in a low-budget, kitschy horror movie. People in the film business seem to have little respect for seafaring seals, marines, and ninjas who get the worst. The storyline is a thin, cryptozoolog of nuts named Dr. Pena catches Chupacabra. Then he smuggles him aboard a cruise ship where two crewmen left her. You can do your taxes and watch this movie and don't miss the rhythm. The most remarkable part that really does it all is worth revolving around the captain's daughter. Towards the end she goes all the martial arts to the monster and kicks his ass. Let me go straight, the monster wipes the entire Navy unit while using ARMOR PIERCING !! OK, can his movie be right? But here comes the captain's daughter, who can't be older than 19 and kicks the crap out of chupacabra with front and side kicks. It was hilarious. They should get a medal for coming up with it.
