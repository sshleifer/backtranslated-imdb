undoubtedly one of the most racially biased films I've ever seen, with prejudices against Hayden Panettiere, because they have to move to hard school. She is constantly called the "white girl" and other curses based on her color. First, would it be permissible on the other hand if the black girl were the ass of all abuse? and secondly, the stereotyping of ethnic children from the inner city school is also a shame. Writers an apparent desire to show that they were "hip" also expanded to the missing point that the inner city school win the cheerleading competition, not through talent, but intimidating their white rivals !! these stimuli for the film took it away from the anticipated direction of a harmless merry comedy suitable for a family audience in the vehicle, which none of the participants give any credit. Hayden Panettiere is of stellar quality, but I would be surprised if any of the rest of the class got even further. All in all, it was a dishonest film that was a waste of time.
