People! is a "comedy" about a man whose parents begged him to kill them because they go senile and want to be knocked out of their suffering. He tries to kill them several times and then changes his mind, saves them from deadly traps at the last moment and loses one of his body parts in the process. It seems that the film hates its main character, which is the more painful to watch. There is also the usual tack-on love-interest and predictable ending. This movie was also the first time I saw Tom Selleck without a mustache, and I remember his shaved top lip looking weird and making me feel a little smooth. But that could be just because of the terrible assumption and lame of making the movie.
