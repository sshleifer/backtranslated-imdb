Most likely "Cleopatra 2525" will have little interest if you are looking at the series when it was broadcasting; and I don't think many people do that. But if you're still a little biased, it's "Buck Rogers in the 25th Century" premise without spacecraft and no budget wardrobe or manufacturing design. <br /> <br /> In this case, Buck Rogers plays part (Cleopatra) by Jennifer Sky. Which could expect to be a good thing because Jennifer is very beautiful and very talented; and has a nice comedic touch. But a quick look at the promotional material turns out to be somewhat worse for having a bad cut and the Salvation Army salvation wardrobe. If you remember how Jennifer was "Xena" during her time, her great look at Cleopatra would be a huge disappointment. With a target group of "teenage boys trying to burn eyeballs and looking at" hot fetish girls ", it's not good to save on the exploitative value of your heroine or her costume. Love or hate" Buck Rogers "has warmer costumes and much better two other exploitative elements are Cleopatra's two female associates, Hel (Gina Torres basically playing her stock "Firefly" character) and Sarge (Victoria Pratt-next "Xena" link - extremely wooden Torres does a good job playing off Cleopatra's character, providing most of the comic relief of the show. /> <br /> Torres sings a theme song, a somewhat lame parody of Rick Evans "In 2525 (Exordium and Terminus)" (1969 ) You remember the one that opens with the words "In 2525, If a man is still alive, if a woman can survive, they can find ..." suspecting they gave t he series his title so that they could butcher this catchy little song though who knows, maybe the title is a homage to "Buck Rogers" and they thought of using the song later. So the prerequisite for the show is that the Earth's surface was taken over by aliens called Bailies (not one WKRP one) and people were driven underground. Our three heroes are fighting the Bailies under the guidance of a demodulated (probably) female voice (suitably referred to as "Voice"). Unlike Buck Rogers, Cleopatra is a bit of a gloomy third sting, still dazed and confused by cryogenic sleep, or maybe just disoriented from a haunted hairstyle. There are plenty of nice Sky details wide and confused. Like "Buck Rogers", the running gag is Cleopatra, which uses a common 21st century expression, and they all consider it utterly deep or confused. Unlike "Firefly", this action is more than what is adapted to "Xena" waste, which is neither realistic nor particularly entertaining. One good trick is that girls travel the "Spiderman" fashion, a spider web through tunnels and shafts in the labyrinth of their underground world. Strangely (or maybe not budgeting) it's only half-hour episodes, and there is not enough time for any subtlety and nuance in addition to one two-part show. Then again, what do I know? I'm just a child.
