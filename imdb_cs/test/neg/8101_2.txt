I probably have to blame myself, but I certainly expect it to be more of a movie that comes out of the title "Black Dragons" and revolves around secret World War II conspiracies, Nazi plastic surgeons, and revenge. This film is a blunt failure with an unintelligible structure. The real plot (which is basically rather ingenious and interesting) will only clear up during explication near the end, but the problem is that you will stop worrying long before. We see Bela Lugosi's horror infiltrating the society of prominent American politicians and killing them one by one. The story is timed just before World War II and? especially after he witnessed the end? This is certainly an assumption with a lot of potential, so it is a pity that it is not elaborate more self. There is, however, one big dialogue that I can't resist sharing! The man towards the woman: "Do you want to marry me?" "Why?" "So I can beat you? It's the only way to leave this place!" It's the only highlight in the overall very boring movie. Bela Lugosi is beautiful? as usual ?? But his creepy performance alone is hardly worth buying this movie. If you are interested in seeing another ghoulish performance of his (in movies with decent scenarios), check out "Invisible Ghost", "The Corpse Vanishes", "White Zombie" and of course the 1931 version of Dracula.
