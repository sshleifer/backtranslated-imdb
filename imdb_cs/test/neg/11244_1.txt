I watched this movie last night. Within 30 minutes of the beginning, I was hoping it would end. He had a promising start; first 10 minutes. The premise of this film (a friendship that never happened after spending days (and years) together in "separate" beds in hotel rooms is simply incredible. She kisses her somewhere along the way and feels Ohh, so awful. <br /> <br /> Very small fabric that will interest you. They simply do not hold negotiations. It's very passive. No matter how much of the movie is displayed, the viewer never develops any type of care connection with the characters on the screen. You will learn that her next speech will be boring as her previous one. ("Do you have a cigarette?", No smoking, wants to stop smoking, he doesn't know it anymore.) <br /> <br /> He calls him in the middle of the night to visit him after a year's absence, comes through the door, doesn't even kiss or express any kind of emotional connection . She didn't even lean forward to help her with her suitcase to help her. It's not how real people behave. This is not how the best friends behave. When she receives her phone call in the middle of the night (she is in the city for a day), he shows little interest in seeing her face, behaves more like she will be the burden of the night. At this point they know each other for two years and he hasn't seen her for a year. Not credible, not real. He probably wrote a book on entropy and enthalpy, but we never saw him write or read or discuss his interests in physics with her, not that she could handle this discussion. We learned that a L. melon costs $ 50, (it wasn't Silicon Type for you). We also learned that the airport shuts down when a couple of really really fake snowflakes fall from the sky. I'm sorry, but it was also in L.A. We never see these two characters survive, we never see them at work. We never see them fight, they're always on holiday. They have endless time, they have no worries. <br /> <br /> Nice life. Unreal life. Unreal characters. Bad name. Bad movie.
