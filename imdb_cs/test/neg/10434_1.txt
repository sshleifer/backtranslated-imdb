I do not agree that I call it a Stoner film just because weeds also look. I can't imagine that it even approached the "classic Stoner". That would be like calling singles "grunge film". The movie certainly plods along with a dark plot. Sometimes I wondered if the script was either dropped or shuffled, or lost it altogether and just tried to wing it. Watching this movie reminded me of watching children playing and playing the story as they go on. The characters are wooden, the dialogue is taxed, and the whole story seems completely disconnected. Who was killed? When? What? And this is how you act when your friend overdoses? A complete lack of emotion and total detachment from reality. <br /> <br /> As for the soundtrack that accompanies every scene: enough! It was like watching the opening menu screen where the same track was infinitely moving in the background without moving forward or backward. I watched and hoped the conspiracy would go down in some way. dialogue would improve or something, somehow focusing this mess on a coherent film. It never happened after 112 minutes.
