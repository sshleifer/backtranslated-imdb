The First Watched February 25, 2002 - 4 of 10 (Dir-George P. Cosmatos): A predictable action thriller where every frequent movie visitor could guess what's next. Charlie Sheen is a good old boy to the president, who just won't be liked by the rest of the presidential staff. Of course he is involved in a situation where he is framed again and again and has a friend in the White House, who is played by Sutherland, who doesn't stay that long. His next friend is the reporter, Linda Hamilton (who has little to do or say in this nonsensical role), and of course the president (Sam Waterston) is his greatest and best friend, despite being all his friend. otherwise they killed him. Brainless but action-packed senseless trife through loads and lots of game talent (all to a great extent waste).
