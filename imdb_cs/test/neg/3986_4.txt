Poor Shirley MacLaine is trying to lend heavily to this gravitational, gag-inducing "feel of good" movie, but she is trampled by the film's sentiment, which is not a bit rooted in reality. It was directed by Curtis Hanson? Did he have a lobotomy because we last heard about him? Hanson can do an effective comedy drama as evidenced by the "Wonder Boys". So I don't know what happened to him. This is the kind of film that does not want to accept that life is chaotic and foolish, and that neat, tidy ends (however unlikely they might be) could be a nice final shot, but would come across as totally false if people Watch the film was remotely over anything, like what the characters in the film went through. My wife and I made a game where we could dial the points of conspiracy before they happened - "Old man teaches her to read and then die." Bingo! This is one of those movies where characters give little speech that summarize their emotional problems, so you wonder why they still have emotional problems if they are aware of what is causing them. Toni Collette (a great actress, by the way, and one of my favorite personalities, if there's not much work to do), talks about why she buys so many shoes and never wears them. the film is an unpleasant connecting motif. At that moment, I knew what I was in, and the film was a downward spiral. <br /> <br /> Level: C-
