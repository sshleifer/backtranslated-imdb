That was unbearable. (SPOILER # 1) The protagonists avoid the unreasonable revelation of the torturous truths to their loved ones to give up this state and assume the role of antagonists. (SPOILER # 2) Writers would believe us that exposing multiple offenses by a misdemeanor poses a threat to the primary victim's offense. (SPOILER # 3) I expected a score of 6 to 8 out of 10 in the last 15 minutes; instead it was like discovering that Lieutenant Columbo is a REAL dog killer. The story was simply not credible and I don't think the best world director could save him without massive adjustments.
