It started as a good comedy. The first few shows were very good and I was looking forward to a long run. What was really funny was the imitation Mariah Carey and the Beverly Hills 90210 fly-off. Delta Burke vs William Conrad's heavy battle was also good. Unfortunately, the following shows have fallen quite quickly. Writing became uninspired and so predictable as if the show had won a cult following in a young term. Nothing fresh was offered and the repetitive parody was boring. One example is the gun family (or what it was called) which became a weekly feature. This sketch wasn't that much fun when it started to be a common feature. An example of a rapid promising start then a sudden fall.
