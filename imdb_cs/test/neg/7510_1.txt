I work in a video store that leases this video in Lexington and I must say that it should never be done. I even know that some of those who worked on it regret it. Bad consequences, frightening behavior, especially bad scenario. I swear that dialogue would not go through for the original PSX Resident Evil; it's so bad. If you want to know how not to make a movie, check out this movie and learn something. If not, don't waste your time. And even the director knows he's angry because he's still trying to pick us up. No, sir. I looked at two-thirds of the horror section and these rates were even lower than Plan 9 from space. Even Ed Eood would say, "No. That's too stupid for me."
