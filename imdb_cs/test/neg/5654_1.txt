iCarly is all that is wrong in the world. All the main characters, but Brother Carly and Freddy are morally bankrupt. Sam hurts other people on a whim. He breaks the children's locker and he is forced to pay $ 100 to fix it, and all he says is "Tough luck" and goes to Freddy's cell phone. She just caused at least $ 300 worth of damage and she is more focused on getting some food. What the hell ?. The only time everyone is guilty is when Freddy attended the show. And that's just the reason Carly blew her crap out of her. Carly is "I'm perfect, everything I do is nice." type of girl. All she does is for her own benefit, and she is often shown only to have remorse for herself. Worse, it encourages Sam's crap. Sam destroys some Freddy's clothes? She is smiling. Sam destroys kids grade? She's shaking her. Don't let me start with humor. The laughter composition is played at any moment. Sam: Not so hot Carly: Yes, it's Sam: Yeah, you're right * INSANE AMOUNTER OF LAUGHTER * <br /> <br /> shows that humor lies in humiliating other people and in that in similar things, sometimes we talk about unknown words and sometimes argue about them. <br /> <br /> Not to mention all the "cool great special techno effects" they can do in Windows Movie Maker.
