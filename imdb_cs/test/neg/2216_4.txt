Of all the E.R.Burroughs screen adaptations that Doug McClure played in the 1970s, it's the most stable of all. It's so rigid, you can taste the dust from the kits and feel the heath of the lamps above. The thing looks like a very, very big budget school, or really a very low budget action movie that actually is. It has been said many times that it was the last of the genre recordings, and I hope it was. The genre did not die peacefully, but in terrible suffering, amid plenty of smoke, fake blood, and lousy sound effects. Peter Cushing had to feel the boy again, like a shabby professor whose shirt remained white as snow after the gentlemen dragged themselves into the slimy holes of the underworld. What kind of sport it was, to take part of this mishmasha and carry it so bravely. Filmed entirely on the sound stage and accompanied by a modern, now unbearable soundtrack synthesizer, the main countermeasures of this film are cardboard monsters. Yes, there are always such monsters in Burroughs' adaptation, but they rarely manage to be so ridiculous, helpless or without any credibility. Several times during increased action combat scenes, where Mr. McClure is heroically attacking creatures, you can almost hear an empty, hollow sound as his head slams on the side of the triplodactocryptosaurus. Fortunately, the animals explode and go up in flames for a minute when they go out and fall. Indeed, there is a large number of unmotivated exploding as the film (and genre) draws towards the final. And the beautiful Miss Munroe loses his underworld accent. The triple account that is currently on the market presents this film plus two more - a country that has forgotten and warlords of Atlantis. The first two are quite strong records, especially the first, with lots of money invested and sometimes a fascinating scenario. Do not expect any of these qualities from this movie. Drunk with friends and laughter not ashamed of what you see. After all, the creators had no shame.
