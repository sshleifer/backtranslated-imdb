This movie was offensive to the PC, predictable and clich√©. I can't imagine a film that better captures the myopic narcissistic pulpit of today's Hollywood. If you haven't seen it, you don't mind watching it. If you have, show them courage and tell people how much it really is. My wife, a minority in her own right, was offended by the natural and infinitely racist message of the film. This film has nothing to do with the real world and has little, if anything, to add to any discussion of racism in that country. Instead, it's a kind of cheap, sensational crap that's supported as deep and challenging thinking. What kind of bubble do you have to live to think it's impressive at all?
