For native Mongolian speakers, the film lacked emotion and emphasis. Used too many non Native speakers especially Jamukha. Too many deviations from real history. Terrible terrible headlines !!! I wonder where and who did the headlines. It was both English and Thai. I wonder how bad the subtitles in Thai are if English subtitles were soooo bad! Described one of the greatest life leader very uninteresting. There are better films from Mongolian directors with a very low budget from the 1980s. Honestly, I wonder if the film criticism of the academic award is so forgiving or what? Just a good thing was some good CGI in some combat scenes only slightly ... not over the tip of CGI
