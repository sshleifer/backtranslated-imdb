That was a poor movie. The stranger was decent, but the film itself gave a new sense of deplorable. The storyline is something that happens over and over again! But this is doing the worst! Negotiations were c ** p, scenes were often too dark to make what was happening. Nobody cared about the main character. The movie was too slow, and the murderous scenes that were there were foolishly created and ended up looking no more interesting than the rest of the film. There are some movies that "suck" but can still be enjoyed because there total sedition, but it doesn't even have it! The one who made this film thought they could do something good and failed. There is nothing that this film offers except headache. Avoid it!
