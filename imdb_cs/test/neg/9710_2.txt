This movie is just bad. First of all, the story is just strange and it's not good. When you're done, he leaves you with questions. Sometimes it's okay, but not in this case. Acting is nothing you should write about. Adults have a good job, but children, because they are children, don't have a good job. I thought the lead role, Ian Costello as Mickey, was the worst. To be honest, I'm not sure it was the lead role. I never understood what the movie was about. Mickey or Pete. There were some shots that stood out, but despite all there was nothing to come out of cinematography. But the sound was better. There was a nice score. A little adventure kind of score, though it didn't look like an adventurous movie to me. She had some elements of adventure film, but it was more of a drama. However, it was difficult to determine for whom this film was intended. Children? Hardly. There is too much language and violence for that. Adults? I don't know. It had many elements of children's film in it. It was like an adult movie in a children's film cover. The story was just strange. I have little idea of ​​what it is all about. You were worthy of it without knowing anything, but there were references to something you felt you should know. The fact that the parents of the children were, for example, dead and that Mickey blamed Pete for that. You expected to know what happened, but you never got. Overall, this film was bad and a waste of time. There was no drive. Nothing really move the story forward. This is not what you spend Saturday night.
