This film is pathetic not because it's badly directed, acted, sung, danced, filmed, etc. But because it's really hard to destroy the movie with the ABBA sound track - but unfortunately it's the only thing that thrives on the film. The music presentation in the movie, SouthPark, was much better than in Mama Mia. Director Mama Mia is proof that you don't need talent to become a director - all you need is ABBA songs. Just to show you the horror: aging Meryl Streep is shot close-up in the harsh sun singing and just destroying the song with all the distracting wrinkles on her face. Why is she one of the most talented actresses?
