Where to start? I saw the screening a few weeks ago and I was shocked at how bad this movie is. Certainly, if you love Beverly Hillbillies and Green Acres and think they are the best TV shows in the air, then you definitely love this movie. Personally, I really like George's work and is very talented, but comedy isn't his strength. Some people are natural in comedy and I'm sure it's great and fun to work with in person, but a comedy you can't pull on a big screen. Was it a cute movie, but would I pay $ 12.00 for that? H&LL no !!!! Now that I saw it, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who would spend their money. George, buddy, I love you, but please don't do another comedy? This scenario lacks a lot, a great concept, but it just didn't.
