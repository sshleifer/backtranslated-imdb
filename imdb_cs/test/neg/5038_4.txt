Not only is the Great Rock N Roll Swindle inaccurate, but when it comes, it's not very interesting or fun. Apparently, Malcolm McLaren has wasted most of the Sex Pistols earnings on this film waste, making him much more uncomfortable. The intention, from the outset, was to create a memorial to "genius" McLaren, who to date has taken full credit for punk music creation, the creation of the Sex Pistols, and sometimes even the writing of all songs. Viewers follow McLaren to the different environments where he tells his story to his sidekick, a female dwarf, and simply takes one thing after another. One particularly irritating scene has McLaren in a deserted aircraft hangar, waiting for a plane, being haunted by reporters and giving them their "big story". The funniest elements of the film are animated short pieces, including those of McLaren's prevailing self-esteem. This film does not even work as a farce. Little is funny, except for Steve Jones, who is surprisingly decent as a pseudo-detective person. 20 years later, Julien Temple, who wrote and directed this film, also directed the Sex Pistols documentary "The Filth and the Fury". While this movie is much better and more interesting than "Swindle", it is still full of "artistic flourishing" temple that just don't work like conversations with band members in the shade as if it were some crime witness trying to hide their identity. An interesting piece of trivia: The film critic Roger Ebert was one of the original screenwriters of "Who Killed Bambi?", Which eventually became "Swindle".
