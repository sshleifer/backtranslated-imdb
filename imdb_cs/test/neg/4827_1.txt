They must say something about the state of our nation that this program is one of the most popular currently being screened. 'The Square' is surrounded by such a miserable, untrustworthy, amoral, mischievous, unreliable group of characters as you can imagine. Everyone is stabbed in the back, everyone is trying to commit adultery, everyone is trying to cheat. That or they are stabbed, bent or cheated. Nobody's happy. Nobody laughs. No one has blinding happiness or a really nice day. It's hell with cockney accents. I suspect this program must be sponsored by the Samaritans. It's a perfect depiction for depression. They are not happy. what it does is to introduce the entire community of such unpredictably sad sorrows that viewers are convinced that their much may be worse - they could live in 'Albert Square'. <br /> <br /> Except above; as a representation of the East End of London, it is pure hokum. The programmakers were probably never in town. The first thing you will encounter on the Mile End Road is the colossal mosque. And it pretty well defines the racial majority of the population. White British London residents are dispersed and a rapidly falling minority. The big advertisement, which is currently near the Bow Road overpass and sponsored by Tower Hamlets, boasts that "eight out of ten community members can now see their doctor faster". Ten healthy, smiling faces to the observer in confirmation. Eight of them are dark ... <br /> <br /> What's more, I worked with a bunch of Anglo-Saxons - the courage to say 'pukka' - a cockneys a few years ago. And I can tell you that I had an even more annoying racist experience I never had. Every day he was like Oswald Moseley rally. They could not pass 5 minutes without slandering any other race or nationality than their own, and in terms that were repulsive and obscene. 'Fackin' Pakis 'and' fackin 'Maceroons' was a small conversation change. In fact, their entire (and extremely limited) genital supply of adjectives and their application. Alf Garnett was a comparable sign of liberal virtue. Any program that allegedly represented the Caucasus natives of the East in their true nature would be totally unsuitable for broadcasting - even after a nine-hour divide. Imagine the Ku Klux Klan script written by Quentin Tarantino and you'll be near the brand somewhere. But when they were not infernal fanatics, they were at least very happy. I don't know how such a soap opera came out. This imaginary defeated island of white misery has absolutely no influence on real culture. And if you have a relatively sanguinal disposition, it will quickly reduce you to tears of grief. Quite ordinary actors pretend to be quite ordinary chronically depressed with cockney accents - what's the point? Blunt, harsh, inexorably disillusioned and ethnically absurd. The most popular program of a seemingly ill and dying nation. <br /> <br /> Avoid him as a plague.
