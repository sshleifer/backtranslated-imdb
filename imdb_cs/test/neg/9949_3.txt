As I sit and think about Poison for fairies, I realize that I may not be fair with the film. My 3/10 rating may have more to do with my film disappointment than its true quality or entertaining value. Based on the plot description, IMDb reviews, and IMDb 7.6 rating, I was sure I came across a little known gem. Sadly, it wasn't much for me. For any reason, Poison for Fairies all all to sleep. Poison for the Fairies is the story of two young girls in Mexico City in 1965. One of the girls, Veronica, is a compulsive liar and tells her friend she is a witch. The other girl, Flavia, is so trusting that she believes and is frightened by what her boyfriend tells her. It's really about it. In fact, nothing happens and the film goes on and on, as Veronica tries to terrorize and control Flavia. One IMDb commentator described it as "the scariest movie in the 1980s of Mexican cinema". My comment? if so, there must not be many horror movies in Mexico in the 1980s. Another commentator wrote, "Watch if you want to be scared." My comment? Are you sure we're talking about the same movie? My opinion is diametrically opposed to these examples I have mentioned. For me, it was boring, uninspired, and wrong. The framing of the scene is particularly unpleasant because director Carlos Enrique Taboada never shows the faces of any of the other characters. Veronica and Flavia continue their long talks with their family members and their teacher, but we never see the faces of these people. It's an annoying trick.
