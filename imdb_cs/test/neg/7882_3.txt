While it is true that the film is somewhat interesting, execution leaves much to be desired (similar to Blood Orgy of Leather Girls, I Spit on Your Grave, and Born in Flames, all superiors). I don't think it is porn, but porn is in the eyes of the viewer: if it works as a porn for someone, who I say is wrong? I was somewhat confused by the statement in Winkimation's generally thoughtful review ("Such a Pity") that "we once see the faces of men when they come." A few years ago, I occasionally made free reviews of the adult magazine and I remember seeing a lot of men's faces when they came. I think it's probably more common when a movie appears on several male porn stars (and especially when the man is a director). Although I was not surprisingly able to refer to any particular titles, I know that in Ron Jeremy's work, there are, uh, jobs. I also don't know that I would agree that the man comes when he comes.
