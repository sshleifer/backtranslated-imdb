...first? Killjoy 1. But here is a review of Killjoy 2: <br /> <br /> (includes spoilers, so readers) <br /> <br /> Oh my. My, my, my. I'll start telling you that I had no hope that the movie was good. Given that Killjoy (the first film) is undoubtedly the worst movie ever made, the sequel wasn't much promising. As expected, it didn't. Death was even more grim than in the first film. There was no eye candy at all, and each of them looked so fake that it wouldn't surprise me to have them in the kindergarten classroom. <br /> <br /> Look, I don't even know where to start. Um, for starters, the movie wasn't even long. It was only an hour and eight minutes (68 min.), But then again, it was a determination. In fact, this is the only reason why this movie wasn't as bad as the first one because the first one was longer. I don't usually give spoilers in reviews, but because I don't want each of you going through torture watching this wasted movie, I'll spoil it. Not that much could go wrong. <br /> <br /> Let's start with the end. KILLJOY IS A PUSSIEST KILLER EVER. It takes explosions, fire bombs, weapons, etc. Kill all normal serial killers in horror movies. Guess what took Killjoy? F *** ING WATER GLASS. No lie. Finally, the girl lifted a cup of water and threw water at Killjoy's face. Then Killjoy started screaming and trying to make it look like his face was melted by putting dried rubber on his forehead. Then he laid there and the people went to bed. <br /> <br /> Now let's hit the actors. Very heavy. Even in one battle, neither man was believable. I don't even know what to say before they seem to have hired a few hobos living on the streets to act in this movie. Seriously, I sincerely doubt they have spent more than $ 100 in total to make this movie. They had nothing. Most of them took place in the woods where there was nothing to be filmed. The actors made no effort at all, so it is blatant that they seem to have "worked" for free. They had no special effects or nice props and apparently used blood ketchup. Hell, who am I kidding? They probably didn't even spend $ 100. They probably spent $ 3.29 on a bottle of ketchup and that was it. A movie with a movie created with a $ 3.29 budget. They couldn't afford to rent a cop's uniform for Bob. Finally, after Killjoy dies, the girl wakes up and says, "Where is he?" and the wife responds, "She's gone." Then suddenly appears a fat goofy guy with scars on his face from nothing, with a cell phone that says, "You have a call." The girl replies and says, "Hello mom!" and smiles. Then that fat hairy guy walks to reveal he's a police officer. He is wearing khaki pants and regular buttons with a green shirt, a lace badge on his front pocket. It was probably the badge the director got when he was in security guard in the third year. Then everyone got into the sun jacket and drove away as the credits rolled. They couldn't even get a police cruiser, so they only had a jacket. F ** dude. Killjoy didn't even have the ice cream he had in the first movie. <br /> <br /> Killjoy is undoubtedly EVER's most beautiful gay slasher. If there was a slasher who was wearing a hot pink spandex and carrying a rainbow flag, he wouldn't be as gay as Killjoy. Killjoy isn't even fun (and believe me he was trying to be). The only good thing about this movie is the very lame threat posed by one of the offenders. Someone will make a comment to a boy about not having gone through the third class to which the boy says: "I'll show you a third grade!" threatening way. That must be the worst threat I've ever heard. "I'll show you the third degree!" <br /> <br /> This movie doesn't even work "bad, it's good". It's dirt. If you haven't done something wrong, and you feel so guilty of wanting to punish yourself severely, don't watch this movie. Just remember; If a burning gay clown with a huge black afro tries to give you a gay joke (and try to kill you at the same time), just throw water at him. Case closed. <br /> <br /> FINAL EVALUATION: .1 of 10
