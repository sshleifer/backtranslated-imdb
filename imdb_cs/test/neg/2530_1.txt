This film is a waste, because for many reasons it is based on Mark Furman's book, which is also a waste. Let me say that Mark Furhman is a racist pig who is just looking for another way to get into the spotlight - and others who have this kind of garbage are in jail. for the film itself, being based on the book, was terrible as well. The only reason this murder case became such a great book and film was that the guy was related, through his aunt's marriage, to the Kennedy family, and it was ridiculous that people still believe that this family has some ability to do and cover up murders - They are just family and Central America needs to get over the obsession. this poor man and his family had been persecuted for years by police officers, they couldn't get to the grave, so they went to Micheal. his amazing that he went to jail with all the evidence that he did not do it, in addition to the fact that the statute of limitations, among other things, was to keep the process before being brought to love by God after twenty years, do not look at this waste
