I saw a preview in Femalien and thought it might be a great movie. It turned out to be a terrible waste. There is not much nudity in the movie, not to mention that I don't have much sex. There were only some silly and korean dialogues along with some uninteresting dance you usually expect during the audition. In our case you can see it in real movies. Conclusion: I have nothing to do with it. Let it be.
