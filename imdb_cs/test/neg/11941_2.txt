Catherine Zeta-Jones and Aaron Eckhart play in the "romantic" drama about the excitement of chef Zeta-Jones, who is ultimately carried by a niece when her sister is killed in a car crash. While she is out taking care of family affairs, she is replaced by Eckhart. Unfunny maudlin story without chemistry among science (she's dead fish and he's okay, but not much of it). I watched why anyone wanted to see it, because the character of Zeta-Jones is so incomprehensible. Come on, he's so obsessed with cooking, and the best he does is cook for his therapist or talk about food. Ugh. I will not use any of the numerous words that come to mind. I couldn't finish it.
