It's amazing that this talented actor Chap did not get all these famous stars to appear in this dismal, poor, kitschy and elongated movie about a low-life gangster who looks white but is half Mexican, most of the games are bad and much the famous stars in this kitschy movie get a script that looks like a 16-year-old, I'm sure this film is the lowest point in the career for actors like Dunaway, Wagner, Keach, Tilly and Busey. very embarrassed to have ever appeared in this turkey movie. I doubt many people have heard of Chap and after this horrible movie I'm sure they will disappear into oblivion where they belong.
