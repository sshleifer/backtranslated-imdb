Snakes on the train is a movie I rented for the pure amusement of the thoughts I had about the movie. Snakes on the plane was a nice action movie, so filmmakers wanted to make a profit with this low budget effort. For 85 minutes, Snakes on the train is almost unbearable to testify. I had to pause the movie to do something to keep myself entertained, because of the lack of events in the movie. Throughout the film, it is never fully explained why this girl has this curse or why she still coughs up that green / purple goo constantly. Not only is there an endless boring dialogue between the two main characters, Brujo and Alma discuss how to get rid of the curse. I appreciate the low budget movies. I'm not really picky about movies, I'm open to any genre or budget, but Snakes On A Train is really one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. Were the writers on Acid or something at the end of this movie? Why did the woman suddenly turn into a giant snake? and most importantly, how was it able to eat a train on Earth? <br /> <br /> Bottom line. Snakes on the train is a movie that needs to be avoided at all costs. Don't be interested in how I was about the title, it's a movie that's really bad. Put these snakes to rest <br /> <br /> 0/10
