A gypsy girl, played by Myrna Loy, comes into a happy home. With amazingly wild hair and a voice that sounds very high and strange, it's hard to believe it's Loy !! She has no resemblance to the sophisticated and humorous character of Nora Charles she has played in Thin Man films. Instead of doing so badly, you would almost expect to be in the movie Ed Wood. What a huge difference a few years in quality movies she has received as well as her acting skills !! In addition to the zealously silly character, the film also fails because it's just not interesting or exciting - just very, very stagy and stupid. The only good thing about this is the Vitaphone sound system, which makes the sound quality of this turkey the best I've heard since 1929. Heck, it was even better than most of the 1930 movies, so the sound engineer has at least something to be proud of - all the others, forget it. This is a movie that even host Turner Classic Films referred to as "guilty pleasure" because the film is so bad! And after seeing it, I disagree ... slightly. The movie is just bad.
