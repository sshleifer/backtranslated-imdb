The first word I can describe this film is Terrible. This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. First, it is a plot of a very thin chart (Wont comment on this section) and a plot that lots of movies from this genre is following. This makes the film so bad because you know what happens. Secondly, the film contains a lot of questions that are never revealed. One of the questions (and not a spoiler) is: WHAT ARE BEAUTY CHILDREN THAT IN THESE ANIMALS !!!!!!!!!! Third, the characters are very bad, not only because the film is bad, but also because it is sorry for the actors. They are as bad as they can be. The last thing that makes this movie bad is that its a horror movie. You should be afraid of murder or sudden shocks, but you are not afraid, you are not appalled because you know what will happen. Conclusion: The film is as bad as the movie about killer ants! I was hoping it was a very great movie, but because the story is bad, the actors are bad, the film raises a lot of questions and because it's not scary, the movie is the best invisible.
