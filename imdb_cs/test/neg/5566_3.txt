The actresses are cute and sets, while simple, pretty fine. Besides, there's nothing to save on this movie. Incredibly bad behavior, stupid dialogues, much-anticipated conspiracy, lots of shocks and discrepancies (for example, a beautiful young girl gets hits in the head by the morning star and not only she survives but barely scratches)!) To make it short because it's not worth More, even fans of the genre can avoid it.
