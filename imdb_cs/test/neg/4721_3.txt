Cult buyers are undoubtedly familiar with the term "video nasties". This was a notorious British list containing all the films that could bring "harm" to society if viewed by irresponsible viewers (dramatization). For gore enthusiasts, this is an excellent checklist because it contains inhumanly cruel and worryingly realistic movies (Death Faces, Canalibal Holocaust, Driller Killer) as well as outrageous and ultra-sick horror movies (The Burning, Nightmare City, The Toolbox Murders). To keep this in mind, it is quite unusual to see "Night of the Blood Monkeys" listed among other "nasties". Is it definitely bloody? But blood and violence are so poorly presented that I can't imagine it. And the stupid conspiracy (about a desperate doctor who shifts the gorilla's heart into his dying son's chest) isn't exactly what you would call disturbingly real, nor. All that is left is a pretty fun pulp-horror flick with horrible acting and senseless sleaze. The effects of the human monkey are ridiculous and no tension or atmosphere is revealed anywhere. Pleasant only when you're in the right mood, in other words. Several sequences that show detailed wrestling match matches (which one of the leading actresses does for a living) are very cool.
