Looking at all 29 years old, Rob Lowe is the detective who is in charge of the murder investigation. When a woman's husband (Leslie Hope) is found dead, the police suspect that a rich cat may have something to do with it. Enter Rob, who immediately falls on a pretty widow, though she claims to be just trying to be "helpful". Rob is such a good policeman that he is able to slip some of her incriminating love letters into his coat pocket before he throws them into the fireplace. Monotonous dark drama with endless hum of background music. <br /> <br /> This is a good sleep replacement if you run out of Sominex.
