I felt that Skammen, directed by Ingmar Bergman, was very dry. This shows what people will do to survive the war and shame that emerges from these actions; but I feel that it was not complete or attentive possession. He has never fully reached a conspiracy or deep into the nature of the emotions or reasons behind it. All I watched in the movie was the transformation of the two main characters, John and Eve. Many times during the film, there were only two main characters who were sitting around or doing their everyday work, not even conversation. I understand that it was to show the reality of these people, but I feel that there are other ways to show reality and be fun. I think Ingmar Bergman could have made this movie in a riveting way.
