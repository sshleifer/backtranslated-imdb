This film is about a young couple running away to start a new life in LA, which ended in a desert. Actually, it's just about a girl (Nicole) because her boyfriend literally disappears in a few minutes. The movie gets very fast, and soon you wondered how it could stretch your story into a feature of length. It's not long before you realize that the film does it by simply wasting time with useless scenes going nowhere. The story is not only paper-thin but unstructured, stupid and discontinuous. A minute after her boyfriend's disappearance and car, Nicole finds a mobile home on the landing. She sees the flash of the camera, and she KNOWs people are inside, but she easily gives up trying to get her help when nobody answers her door. After being informed by the killer that her boyfriend is in danger, walking around the rest of the stop, doing all kinds of stupid and useless things. This includes turning on the TV (and even having fun when he thinks he's on a porn movie, even in this terrible situation), sitting, wandering and drinking from a bottle of liquor for hours. She does everything she knows that her boyfriend was kidnapped, that the killer is still freelancing and chasing her without taking any steps to ensure her immediate security (she doesn't bother to lock the door or stay alert). Yeah, she's trying to use the radio to call for help, but why bother when there's a mobile home with people inside the RIGHT THERE, where is the stop? Indeed, the writer seems to have forgotten this important fact when writing this part of the story. There is no sense of capture or ever present danger in this story. The heroine wanders freely in and around the various buildings for the rest of the stop, and the killer only occasionally moves to frighten her before she resumes. There is nothing to stop Nicole from just starting (even though the rest of the stop is far from anywhere, it's better than sitting), but she still decides to stay. At one point in the movie, the main character even RECOGNIZES that he can escape, but not. The story goes nowhere and just jumps from a nonsensical segment to a nonsensical segment. Nicole finally gets into a mobile home and it turns out that residents are a family of protected, probably inbred or psychotic, religious fanatics. They seem to not intentionally know or recognize the actions of the killer (but there is no indication that they are connected to him in any way) and then after a few minutes Nicole sets out. <br /> <br /> In another irrelevant segment, the main character travels to the bathroom. He finds one of the previous murder victims (a young woman named Tracy) who is still alive and locked in the closet. For some strange reason, Tracy starts throwing up a ridiculous amount of blood. Nicole sets off to open the closet door, and when she returns a minute later, both Tracy and her pool of blood disappeared without explanation. What it was? Nicole finds a message board with many missing persons and sees Tracy disappeared in 1971. So Tracy was a ghost or something? The writer never bothered to explain. Furthermore, a policeman appears in the middle of the night to stop at a police station at a rest stop that was comfortably left unattended throughout the day. Nicole tells him all about what's going on, and when the killer runs out of his office in his car, the cop goes out to face him. What does a policeman do, knowing that something is really wrong? He goes upstairs and talks to the murderer (who even pointed out to Nicole that he was the man who followed her) and buys a murderer lie that he just passes and in the necessary directions. Seriously. The cop then talks to Nicole outside, completely unaware of how the pickup is turning and running. The cop quickly starts telling Nicole that he's a goner who's "lucky to breathe", yet he doesn't strangely die for some time. Two of them do more unnecessary talking, and all that is important is that it has been mentioned uncomfortably or too long. When two of them finally tried to use the weapon, Nicole foolishly throws out most of her bullets, which she blindly shoots at the door when the murderer was behind them. When there were two bullets left, the policeman tells Nicole to use him for euthanasia. He shoots him into his mouth and puts it down for a few moments, with a torn piece from his head. Then suddenly and inexplicably shouts, "You missed!" and he must shoot him again. Totally inexpensive shock attempt. Nicole finally confronts the killer? and fails. The film ends with a scene that has not been going on for a long time, and the woman arriving at the now strangely much more active rest stop. In the bathroom building, she hears Nicole crying for help in the closet (closed like Tracy). He gets a cop to go in and check it out, but he finds it a normal and clean wardrobe. The cop is leaving because he thinks he was cheated. From behind some of the boxes in the closet, Nicole can see that she was easily seen if the cop spent all ten seconds, which was probably too stupid to say when the cop was there. WOW. This movie is probably the first in a new line of "high quality" movies on DVD that are sold as too extreme for theaters. In fact, it's just another clich√©, garbage B-Movie.
