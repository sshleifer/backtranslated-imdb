When HULK hit the theater in 2003, it wasn't long before the DVD of the old incredible Hulk TV show popped up in pursuit of money for the crazy. We saw a similar phenomenon a year before Spider-Man cartoons appeared on the DVD, which coincide with the debut of this great hero. Companies jump on the opportunity to ride on the hot brand financial coattails. So the fact that this image never surfaced on the Wal-Mart shelves as its heroes featured at the box office a lot of summer says. I think everyone involved would have forgotten. To be fair, FANTASTIC FOUR is not as bad as everyone says. Let me reformulate it. It's not as unusual as any of his negative reviews might suggest. Veteran television actor Alex Hyde-White (no, you don't remember any of his roles) leads the way as Reed Richards, a great scientist who, along with his crew, gets bizarre forces after the universe's disaster. He stayed with the possibility to stretch and twist his body to hideous lengths. His future wife, Sue Storm (Rebecca Staab), can suddenly become invisible while her brother, Johnny (Jay Underwood), can now light himself. Then there is poor Ben Grimm (Michael Bailey Smith), a nice tail whose body morphs into the mass of rocky, orange rock. Just as all friends get used to it, they are called to save the world from certain chaos. Reed's old colleague Victor von Doom (Joseph Culp) seems to live by his name, and that villainous jeweler (Ian Trigger) doesn't help even old ladies cross the street. Can our heroes save the day? Of course they can; Like any superhero movie, it's just a matter of how and when. What is striking about FANTASTIC FOUR is how it is amateur in virtually every aspect. The dialogue is so weak and tired that it sounds like a junior class has written it. Acting is so undamaged that the third grade afternoon soap opera looks like Shakespeare. The special effects are surprisingly good in terms of tiny budget, but there are still some positive embarrassments. When a human torch lights his body, for example, the entire movie turns into a cartoon. I hear the production meeting. "Oh, no one will notice. They will be too impressed by the action!" Really, cartoon? At least give me a mannequin for fire raised by a chain! Before that, the scene in which the foursome comes to Earth after their spacecraft crash is a clean teen-in-the-backyard fare. The crew simply found the field and lit a fire-like object that resembled a spaceship. Is that the only remnant of such a major disaster? Of course there wasn't much work in the script. There's a fairly comprehensive story, but it's all so simplified. When Reed and Ben decide to go into space, they simply find themselves in the Storms house and ask if they want to join them. Is it really that easy? Do not require these things, oh, do not know, years of training and expertise? Not in the world of these writers who seemed to be inspired by an underrated genius appearing in the FULL HOUSE repertoire. But just as badly as it can be, there is nothing to compare with how painfully clich√© Dr. Doom is. He was pulled out of those horrible superhero cartoons from the 1960s, except for the evil laughter and banged his fist on the table to cut off his notes. No comic book, at least all of the Fantastic Four, has ever shown such a criminal who is so obscene one-dimensional. Finally, FANTASTIC FOUR is rescued from being a complete turkey because it's so damn innocent. You can tell the people concerned, as little talent or experience they had, they really tried. They didn't know that the end result would be so embarrassing. They were under the impression that it was their big pause that people would have thrown into the theaters. It repeats that they had virtually no money to work with (and I'm sure half of it was eaten into a cool Thing costume). All things considered, done well, and for its many shortcomings, the finished product is a fair amount of fun for comic fans.
