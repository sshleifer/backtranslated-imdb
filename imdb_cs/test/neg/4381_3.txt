"Hero and Terror" is a rather boring thriller - la: no real substance of substance, a predictable plot, and ... Boring. For the thriller, I found that this film was working slowly until its pitiful climax, as it seemed to be dragging on when the child of Chuck's wife was born ... and then pulling out until she reached the end - which I can hardly remember Even though I only saw the movie 10 minutes ago. This film gives 3 out of 10 - the first 10-20 minutes.
