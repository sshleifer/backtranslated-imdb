That's one special movie. It seems to be aimed at a younger audience, but is filled with sexual allusions. The whole premise is somewhat absurd, not only the idea of ​​some shrunken heads of three dead children doing some fighting crimes, but the same said that children who take gangs of hard older boys are a little fetched, but then again parents. they are mostly missing in the film and there is a lack of authority numbers to keep children alive. The cast is good, but Meg Foster plays a very torturous mafia leader, with handsome AJ Damato as a chicane leader. Aerky Egan and Rebecca Herbst are well cast as young lovers, though for the comic actress of her talent, Leigh Allyn Baker is notoriously wasted in this movie. Overall, the movie is unusual, but I'm don. I don't think that's enough to make up for bad quality and mess. The scenery is somewhat boring and "special effects" are quite disillusioned. Sit this one if your mood.
