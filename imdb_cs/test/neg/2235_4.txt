For one thing, he produced this movie. It has the feel of later international cast movies that are dubbed. The opening headlines tell us it was filmed in Vienna. Bey was a pleasure in Universal Adventure's 40s. He was also excellent in the movie I saw maybe a decade ago but never heard since: "The Amazing Mr. X." Maybe it was Dr. X. I remember it as a thrilling and scary movie. Unfortunately, this one is very nice. The storyline is not easy to follow. When I got it, I was just as disappointed. Francis Lederer looks like a concert pianist great. He was a very handsome senior man ten or fifteen years ago. He had never really seen himself as the main star, though he should have. That's not terrible, but it's pretty hard.
