I went to this movie with little expectations because I knew that Uwe Boll was a film director and screenwriter, and I was still disappointed. Uwe Boll finds a way to make every film worse and worse. The overall concept was not bad, one was bored with his life as a broker becomes a serial killer. But the problem with the film is that it is not in between, going straight from the broker to the serial killer. The film does not have an actor without a name and I see why after watching the movie I don't see why a career actor would like to join this movie. Anyone who has refused her has made her career a favor. And if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and don't. I give Sanctimony 3 out of 10
