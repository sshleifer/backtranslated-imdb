The storyline for Black Mama White Mama, revolves around two female inmates, at a female prison in the Phillipines. One black and one white. These two women are thrown together in jail. Pam Grier's Lee Daniels Lee is imprisoned in a hellish female prison, for dancing as a harem girl. Lee's friend owes some of his profits from his drug-related activities. Lee is mainly interested in getting out of jail to seize his beau drug money to leave the Philippines and assume a better life. Margaret Markov plays Karen Brent, a white woman from a privileged environment who is also a revolutionary. Karen joined the group of revolutionaries, determined to change Phillipino's corrupt political system. He is captured by the Philippine authorities and is held as a political prisoner. Story Story When Karen and Lee break out of the prison they were in. They were also strapped to their wrists. They also fight together as they run because they have different goals to be pursued. Naturally, they hate being strapped together. But they also realize that they must postpone their differences to help each other survive when they avoid captivity. <br /> <br /> If this movie seems very similar to The Big Bird Cage, it's because a large part of the cast two movies are the same as well as their placement in the Phillipines. Roger Corman has always had a consistent actor team he used in all his 70s. In addition to Pam Grier, Sid Haig, Roberta Collins, Claudia Jennings, Betty Anne Rees, and William Smith, they were also among many actors who were often cast in Corman's AIP movies. Black Mama White Mama relies on excessive bloody violence to make it tasty. In this film, Pam Grier communicates his usual harsh cub and shows his ability as a female action hero. Margaret Markov has less influence in her portrayal of the revolutionary Karen. She seems fragile and well-formed to be a committed political partisan. With the exception of Sid Haig, as the colored Ruben, the rest of the cast is forgotten. This film has little entertaining value if your thing is excessive, nasty violence. Just a performance by Pam Grier and Sig Haig to make this film worth watching.
