Within about 5 minutes of the movie's first combat scene I watched, I just could help but point out the lack of tension in the camera crossing scene back and forth really showing that he had no idea what he was doing, actually the soundtrack shows the best. I have no low budget movie and your will not get the top 40 songs, but at least get the music that goes with the scene that is not really that hard acting, well, when I saw some I'd like to let you know. The script was so badly written that I would be surprised by one piece of the director who wrote this piece of beep, I give one to 10/10 and it was for the DVD cover, because if I actually saw "before I see" the store and it was Like 10 15 bucks I'd buy it, why well, if you look at the front cover it actually did well you turned it on your back and you see it actually won awards. now it is a very misleading thing, because even in a small film festival I would never believe in my life that it would win all I can say is "wow, if it was the best I wouldn't want to know what the crap in the movie The festival was like "<br /> <br /> Films that are so bad, have only one good use and that is for aspiring filmmakers like inspirational films like this, there are better tools than good movies because with a good movie, which you almost know from a bat is a good chance that you won't make a movie so good, but if you use a movie like this, you can look at all the things that the director or writer did wrong so you wont make the same mistakes and you have another plus looking at this movie and saying that when a piece of beeps like this one can do, then there's someone's hope out there
