A low-rent, cheaply made police thriller that is maintained bearable by some fair humorous bits, nice chemistry between the two, especially, James Remar is a satisfying turn as a narcissistic, psychopathic (and indestructible) villain. Obviously, a low quality image, both visually and dramatically, with somewhat resigned Burt but not unnoticeable. (**)
