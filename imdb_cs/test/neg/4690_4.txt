Hip, distinguished doctor James Coburn (as Peter Carey) comes to take the position of pathologist at Boston Hospital. Almost instantly, Mr. Coburn Beds a beautiful nutritionist Jennifer O'Neill (like Georgia Hightower). While sleeping with Mrs. O'Neill, Coburn wakes up in a distress that involves an abortion - a 15-year-old woman who is bleeding to death becomes the daughter of a big hospital donor, Dan O'Herlihy (like JD Randall). Coburn does not believe that the man was arrested, Doctor Palace James Hong (like David Tao) committed this crime; Although, Mr. Hong admits to performing illegal abortions on the side. While trying to clean up his friend, does Coburn plunge into a condensed conspiracy? **** The Carey Treatment (3/29/72) Blake Edwards ~ James Coburn, Jennifer O'Neill, Michael Blodgett, James Hong
