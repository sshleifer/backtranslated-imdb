1989 was a year since Eddie Murphy wasn't so hot and started making movies that he soon forgot. It was also the year when Murphy directed his first film, but also the first and last experiment. The "Harlem of the Night" wasn't exactly what you could call success, though it was great to see the two best black comics together, namely Murphy and Richard Pryer. Don't blame the actors because they all played their roles as you expected, even if you face (again) the typical Murphy. The worst thing about "nights in Harlem" is both the script and its horrible decors. Everything takes place in the 1930s, and everyone benefits from forbidden clubs. Sugar Ray (Pryor) and his adoptive son Quickie (Murphy) easily collect $ 10,000 per day, but of course soon the crowd and corrupt police will come around the corner to request their part of the cookie. Sugar and Quickie are not boys who give their money for free and have their own plans. You can look at "Harlem Nights", that's for sure, but if you turn from the moment you hear the name Murphy, you better avoid, because after all this movie is nothing but a lame excuse to see some good jokes.
