Michael Bassett's film 'Solomon Kane' (based on the eponymous character created by Robert E. Howard) is a disappointment with the Fantasy Action-Adventure, which, despite several genius scenes, falls on the surface with its unpleasant stimulation, poor characterization and general numbness. Solomon Kane (James Purefoy) is an army mercenary fighting with Queen Elizabeth in Africa, where she comes face to face with Devil Reaper? a demon who collects the devil's debts, ie the soul? refuses to go to hell anymore, avoids Reaper and begins a new life in the English monastery. With this new life, Solomon has left his culture of violence and bloodshed and instead now includes values ​​of peace and non-value. But once he is expelled from the monastery for fear of murdering the devil's murderers, he must return to his home in Devon and follow a path he befriends with the family of Puritans traveling to the New World. On their way through the British lands, the family is attacked, and their daughter Meredith (Rachel Hurd-Wood) is kidnapped by the evil wizard Malachi's army, who is led on the fronts by a mysterious Masked rider. Solomon, a man of peace, must return to his former life as a man of relentless violence and destruction to save Meredith. Despite having a great resource for work and building on a potentially exciting and enduring medieval action adventure film, the film fails in three key areas. Stimulating this movie is terrible, which can have a lot to do with an incredibly short duration of only one hour and forty minutes (which is most likely due to the fact that they want to turn this film into a trilogy). Constantly jumping between drama and self-characterization to that action and muddy carnage, somewhat kills the excitement of action sequences. Instead of keeping viewers at the edge of their seats frothing the eagle's expectations, the film feels incredibly subdued instead, and it follows up with further criticism, boring. Despite being an action adventure movie, or in some circles an "action epic", "Solomon Kane" is almost certainly not. The event is mundane and boring, and is usually done before you have the opportunity to admire the beauty of decapitation. Finally, apart from Solomon himself, there is very little characterization in this film. For example, we know little about it, and therefore a young woman who Soloman is embarking on his journey has little to save. And I imagine that the filmmaker would reiterate this criticism to the fact that he is most likely to be the second film that will hopefully touch on those aspects that this film has certainly missed. It's not a horrible movie. James Purefoy gives a fantastic performance like Solomon, a mercenary who has to decide whether to return to his conscience or his blade, and how his decision affects not only himself but also his surroundings. While respect, admiration and recognition must also go to Bassett and his crew as well, for the creation of vivid places that beautifully reflect the period in which they are filming. Sometimes it is hard to get carried away by admiring the beauty of places, shot compositions and mise-en-scene at the show. Which certainly shows that a lot of time and effort has been put into this film, but unfortunately it is not the same for the story and the characters. "Solomon Kane" certainly had the potential to be more than just an "action epic", but it seems that the lack of real depth in the story and characters resulted in Michael Bassett creating more than just one. dimensional view of swordplay in the Middle Ages.
