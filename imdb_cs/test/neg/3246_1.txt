Hi, This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The day I watched this movie, I had a high fever. But I was still watching a movie with lots of patience. And after watching the movie, I felt like repentance. Because I missed 3 hours for that stupid movie. I could rest rather than watch this movie. And I was really surprised that actors like Sunny Deol, Akshay Kumar Aftab, etc. played in this movie. <br /> <br /> I don't understand if directors find a good story to film and why they stay as directors? Why can't they sit at home and spend time at home? <br /> <br /> I ask all directors to be good for them if they ask listeners, whether by post or by media, newspapers, radio, etc. to send them a nice story, if not. Find some good story to make a movie. I ask all the directors again not to do these films.
