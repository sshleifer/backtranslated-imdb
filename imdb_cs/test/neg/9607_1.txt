As a parent of two girls (14 and 11), I have serious doubts about this show and all the additions. First, I am always surprised that the living conditions of Drake / Josh, Zac / Cody, Hanny, Carly, Derek, Sunny etc. Always make most of the houses tiny and cramped. Most people work hard all day to pay less than half the size of their living space, but no one goes or comes from work, does not pay utility, rent, mortgage or insurance, mops, sweeping, changing bulbs, toilet fixtures, etc. They go in and out (and down the ubiquitous wide stairs that only exist on TVs) popping jokes (most of them include lying and merry results) and shirking work. I believe that the children who follow them will have unrealistic expectations about how hard they will work and how luxurious their lives will be. Secondly, there is never an untouched family, always mom or dad, but never both who always go headless data, but never seem to have any disadvantage in divorce (alimony, support, arguments). Again, children may have the impression that if mommy / dad divorces, fun fun (actually, mom or dad is not often if it helps conspiracy). Needless to say, there is no mention of spirituality (forget the specific religion). Finally, there is a subject that bothers me. There are "nerds" that are good at school, "athletes" good at sports, "goody two shoes" as well. The protagonists are not good at school, sports or charity, but they do wisdom about those who are. The message is not good at anything, just one of the "nothings" who mingle in cracking jokes. Needless to say, I give all these shows zero and turn them off all the time and I'm just a little to disable them in my house.
