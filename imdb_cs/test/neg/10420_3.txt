I'm pretty sure Poe would think it was a mess. The first two stories are decent, nothing spectacular. And then there's Toby Dammit. What did Fellini think? It's a surreal, random, boring piece, with little recommendation. One should feel frustrated by the lack of backstage or conclusion, but it's just a relief that it's over.
