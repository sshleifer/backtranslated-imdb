I rarely see a film with such a cast, such a potentially powerful story and based on a bestseller book that was so weak and to some extent unnoticeable ... The idea of ​​the story sounds like Brent Easton Ellis's novel - a lot of drugs, hopelessness and a self-confident tragedy as young Elisabeth Wurtzel (played by Christina Ricci) tries to cope with a suicidal loser who cannot admit that she really lives a good life and is basically pathetic to being such a child ... <br /> Christina Ricci is not just a tragic personality, but also a tragic actor whose sobbing and screeching of most of the movie you actually want to scream - kill yourself and let us get to the credit ... The director has no help because he absolutely has no pace and the story feels so disjointed that you have no idea what a damn girl is. The director apparently was on Prozac when he was running this imitation of the film, so he let the film go to autopilot, making it an unbearable mess. The only redeeming feature is Jason Biggs, a friend of Wurtzell (who, fortunately, chose to launch a self-confident egocentric egomaniac and incredibly good Jessica Lange as a children's mother. Pure class. <br /> <br /> I don't know if it's really who Wurtzel is or was, but the movie I didn't really care about her writings. <br /> <br /> I finished watching this movie and I immediately started thinking: OK Time to watch something that is actually about REAL issues ...
