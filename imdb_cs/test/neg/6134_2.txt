I noticed a DVD in a store at my home, and since I am addicted to "horror horror / foreign movies," I wondered how good it was. She even had two awards on the cover (I don't remember the festival he won), so I thought "Hey this could be good". So I bought it (for five euros) and I came here to IMDb to see some reviews. Here, either people bashed a movie to say it was bad, or people said the movie was an amazing feat in india movies blah, blah. Then I played on DVD, I didn't think of any review I read, with an open mind, and I didn't expect anything at all. <br /> <br /> Man ... I don't want this to be critical, but the movie was really bad ... OK, I just give away some pointers to what I thought: <br /> <br /> 1 -Play / Dialogue: Acting was so confusing ... Ever Actors Made a decent job, but there were scenes where I couldn't see any effort from them! The dialogue was even worst ... I think it was probably the most popular aspect of the film. Talking between the characters seemed to be gone. It's not just bad, but far from the real storyline. Female character monologues, though well delivered, are bored and annoying in a moment ... But of course the most sensual aspect was ... "aliens" or "infected" ... I didn't even comment on this one, just say that it was absolutely ridiculous and took the whole mood away from the picture; 2-Visuals: the most powerful aspect in the movie ... if you forget the horrible FX and the light flashes they used to simulate explosions or the hell they were supposed to be. In fact, the "camera in the car" aspect was pretty cool, but they didn't even use the environment to inspire fear or fear. They left it with cheap FX and FX and three "infected" characters. The film becomes boring in so many scenes ...; 3-Sound: Talk about editing ... this movie has no problems with how poorly edited it was. From computer sounds imitating forest animals to "extraterrestrial dialogue" ... ah ... <br /> <br /> So what I like in the movie ... (SPOILERS) the only thing I really liked and that was actually, quite scary, it was a succession of two scenes where the car is still and you notice something that walks in the far space. At first I really thought I saw things, but when the character realizes that the "characters" that came to her were her own reflection, I was surprised! Pretty haunted idea did well! Besides ... I had a terrible time. And I don't recommend it to anyone ... or "teen together" because you can't even laugh at it. . I give it a solid 2. Only some technical achievements worked here ... except ... yeah ... nothing
