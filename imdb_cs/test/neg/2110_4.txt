So, during my Snakes weekend, I was even more energized, after the film we wanted, even more. Why not Snakes on the train? How bad it could be, his snakes probably kill people on trains. The snakes were supposed to be rattans. At first, my friends and me thought snakes were harmless garden snakes and pet snakes with the same cheesy rattle sound clip. Actually, we sat the whole thing ready to turn it off (we're too lazy to walk and hit eject). Another thing we knew we didn't know what the hell was going on, but something amazingly funny would happen in the end. It is one of those endings that you will rewind several times to laugh because you have suffered so long. <br /> <br /> Last 10 min and "8", rest of film and 2.
