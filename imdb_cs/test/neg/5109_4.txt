From the brilliant mind that brought us "Exorcist" ... and "Cruising". Unfortunately, "Rampage" is the other one. It is generally a chaotic film that makes it the main atmosphere for television. The whole film pretends to be concerned with the question: "What if" Boy Next Door "was a serial killer?" but instead it ends up being an uninspired courtroom drama and meditation on the madness plea and the death penalty that makes little sense. The film is very loosely based on the case of Richard Trenton Chase, who spends several facts here and there to create a false character and another result. One of the main points of the film seems to be that the end of life of a terminally braindead child and ending the life of a murderer are somehow anal. "Sometimes just select," says the lead character. Yeah, sometimes you have to decide to pull out the plug ... on the TV!
