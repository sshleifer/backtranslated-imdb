It seems to be two films in one. At first, ZaSu Pitts is a renegade in a small town. He wants to help Marjorie Woodworth's romantic life. OK: I've never heard of her before. But she and Pitts are in both parts of this mixture. <br /> <br /> Before we know, Pitts is no longer Miss {Polly. It's Emmie. I had to go back to see if I slept somewhere. I did not have. She no longer in a small town but on the way to the title Honeymoon Destination. The movie has some cute moments. The first part is better with a role for what seems to be every third-character actress working in Hollywood at the time. And what about Mrs. Woolworth? Sounds a bit like Betty Hutton. Sounds a bit like Marie Wilson. She sure is beautiful. But it's not a comedy. Pitts was often used in very small roles. Here it has the biggest role. She's always entertaining, even though I was wondering if she was going a little long out of her. (Like a comic. When she was a tragic actress in Von Stroheim - "The Wedding March" and "Greed" are two I saw - she was brilliant.)
