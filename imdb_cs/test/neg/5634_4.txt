What a pity that some good talent has been wasted. This is a boring and overly confident movie that could tell your story in half the time. Is it Derek Jacobi under that beard? Gosh, who would guess. The emotional reward at the end was weak and unsatisfactory. Surely it is not worth taking the film. I felt quite let go. The sound was terrible. First they used stock music. Secondly, during the dialogue, it was so loud that words were difficult to discern. Only three sound crews and an intern? There were more people listed in credits for either accounting or legal. Some of the camera work was pretty good and the actors did a good job with the average scenario. It's not a good use of tracking time, at least for me.
