It starts out as a very serious social commentary that makes you think of other Clark movies like Kids, Bully, etc. But then it quickly breaks down. Who is the main character? Is it a serious movie or some Gregg Araki-esquire over the top movie? Is it a skate document with embedded moments of dialogue? I have no idea. I found myself watching the clock and wondering when this turd would end. I was thinking that there would be some big shock that would never come. I sculpted 20 minutes from the movie by quickly forwarding useless skate scenes. Yes, it illustrates the changing landscape between what it does not. At the beginning I came back. Children and Bully were made so that I actually felt like watching the reality of this group of friends. Wassup felt very staged, poorly designed, and getting worse. The teenage Caveman, who doesn't write Larry, but did it, was horrible. But at least it seemed like a horrible movie that didn't take seriously. Wassup Rockers was just bad.
