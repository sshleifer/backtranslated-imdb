I like all the different types of movies, so it's not bash for romantic movies from a guy who just likes Matrix, etc. Etc. <br /> <br /> I felt it was a lousy movie. I don't feel like characters get into love. They were there for a few days and when they were dealing with a heavy hurricane and major issues in each of their lives, did Richard Gere and Diane Lane fall in love with love hopelessly and helplessly? It's not realistic. This movie didn't make me buy and feel it emotionally and that's something you're looking for in a good conspiracy. Some emotional connection. If someone can get in touch with them quickly, fall in love without being a real substance, that's the way it is. You're not right or wrong. Different strokes for different people. Another very incredible part of the movie was the very rough teenage daughter Diane Lane, who became pretty and nice at the end of the movie. Does a teenage girl who is so unhappy and worse with her mother that she didn't come back with her cheating husband to have a switch on and be pretty? This movie, in a nutshell, had a few big names, but it was a great disappointment for me.
