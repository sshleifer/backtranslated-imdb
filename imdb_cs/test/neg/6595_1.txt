That's the worst movie I've ever seen. I hope the REAL family and other depicted characters have lawyers who have reached the VH1 hell to see it. Acting is horrible, writing is worse and showing characters is scary. It was supposed to be a drama, but it was a comedy for me, no choice but to laugh at bad acting. I usually like Flex Alexanders playing, but this time completely missed the brand. You could argue that he took this role for a few laughs alone, because it was so awful. If you really want a dramatic movie for the night, DO NOT CHOOSE THIS ONE. But if you're laughing at bad acting and silly writing, Tune in.
