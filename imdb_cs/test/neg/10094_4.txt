In short, the film is about gang war in the fifties. Le√≥n, the leader of Deuces, begins a gang after his brother OD on "junk". He promises to protect the neighborhood. The opponent gang leader is just getting out of jail and wants revenge. The movie didn't really do that for me. "Good Guys" was no better than "Bad Guys". Very little has been shown to indicate that Deuces really took care of the community. I think the writers went to realism here, but I didn't care which party won. None of the characters were sympathetic or able to draw my sympathy. On the plus side, the courtship between Anna and Bobby had some elegant dialogue, and the actor was well done.
