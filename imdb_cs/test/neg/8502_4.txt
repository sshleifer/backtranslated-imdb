Other reviewers seem to have taken this film to a high degree. For something an 18-year-old film student did, I'd say bravo, but that's not the case. If you want to watch a good movie about graffiti, stick to documentaries. It is shot in the same quality as digital home video. The two main characters are desperate actors and once again it would be okay if it were a student film. The storyline follows a lone artist who skateboarding around Portland writing graffiti. He associates with him and creates art together. Then comes a useless scene of gay love. Then there is a dispute between them that has never been spoken about, because this film has so much dialogue as Charlie's chapel is. This film shows that gravitational street artists give their form well, and the music is nice, but overall I wouldn't say the movie.
