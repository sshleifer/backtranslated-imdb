sorry my spelling. That's probably the funniest horror ever. You think it's bad dead * 1000. Acting is awful, you can see makeup makeup on the face of a certain lady. there is a lesbian scene that makes no sense. And the end, haha ​​ohhhh end ... be prepared for your stomach to hurt from laughter. Now that you are watching this movie for over 5 minutes and are still expecting something, look at yourself and ask what the hell is wrong with you. This is a very bad movie that wanted to laugh and enjoy its pure stupidity. Don't forget to check out all the outtakes after the movie, you can see how low the whole budget really was. Overall, this film is a rare gem in that it demonstrates a clean and defective lack of talent / care / ability / money and anything else you would ever need for a successful film. But it's definitely worth watching.
