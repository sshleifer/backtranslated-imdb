I suppose it could be said that this film has a bunch of potential, but nothing more, because the guys filmed it. The plot is virtually incomprehensible, stimulation is lethargic and acting is pathetic. And what the hell is a business rat? The worst of all, however, is that the top of the film is the anticlimax of all anti -limaxes; plus the title doesn't seem remotely accurate. The only redeeming feature of this movie is a beautiful dark-haired woman ... but the blond girl was also pretty, but she was uncomfortable and not as good as a brunette. Anyhoo, like many movies, is one that is only visible on MST3K.
