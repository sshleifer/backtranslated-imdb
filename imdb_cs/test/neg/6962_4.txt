I came to this movie with the understanding that it was one of the worst movies he ever made. I sat down to watch, and I was pleasantly surprised. It's not great. It's not so good; in fact, it's pretty poor. However, it is not as bad as I was led to believe in long shots. It is quite awkward, and apparently, as a measure of cost reduction, many tracks of footage are pushed into the tracks, many of which have no apparent relationship to narration. But what it is is an intensely personal movie created by a man who obviously did not have the skills or the financial resources to make his idea of ​​justice. Before you discount _Glen or Glenda? _ From your hand, explore your own artistic skills. I, I would like to be able to draw, but anything I try to sketch is like a stick. I'd like to be able to sing, but all I do is scare the little kids. Wood had an idea, and unfortunately it didn't have what it meant to make it work. However, it was an incredibly bold film for the 50s Puritans, however exploitative or discontinuous it may appear at first glance.
