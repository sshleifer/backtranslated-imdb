Certainly I expect more after seeing the cast list but WOW! I think the first director could do a better job with this project, and the fact that a veteran like John Buechler did it, puzzles me to the end. Surely the budget allowed them to secure a flock of D-List actors who were embarrassed for an hour and a half. Unknown actors were just terrible, less Steve Wastell, who does a decent job like Axl. The story is so bad that it doesn't really need any mention. The overall production value seems to be standard, with some above-average cameras, if you can go through the scenes of a godly "sloo" and painful "fire sequences". I knew it would be stupid, I just had no idea how stupid it was, and unfortunately it was a time I could never return. I suppose if you like really bad "B" movies, it can work for you, but if you value a story at all, this is just awful ... Full waste of time.
