That must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. We should love and be rooted in the arrogant, know-it-all, cruel robber who plays Dale Robertson and coy teased played extremely beautiful Linda Darnell in the red dress firefighting. She had to be sewn into the bodice! The film's senator thinks Indians and whites should try to understand, but bigots will win this day. I could barely sit in the endless dialogue of fanaticism that came out of the other mouths. In addition to Wounded Knee and Dances with Wolves, there are few films that give a positive view of American Indians and very few old westerns do. This one is extremely bad in this respect. The romance between Robertson and Darnell set her teeth on the edge as she appeared in her, forcing her to kiss her while she played an old hard match. There are scenes that are unintentionally funny, such as characters that apparently do not appear to be accompanied or on stage in several shots. The Mysterious Witty Incident in the Screenplay is Linda Darnell's character will have a great deal of time to buy stagecoach tickets, only to ask the horse to ride a few minutes later, for no apparent reason. Another funny scene is when a stagecoach comes to scrape to stop looking at a cowboy hat lying next to the road, and not just that, but then all the passengers go out to look. <br /> <br /> 1 star.
