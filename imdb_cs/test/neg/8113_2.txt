Traveling couple (Horton and Hamilton) hit the city of Gatlin where children beat adults and are always eager to defeat more, following the way they separate, and Peter Horton of course must save his wife from these tiring er. terrible tykes in this very bad adaptation of one of King's best stories. In the original story, the King managed to create tension and draw the personality of his characters, but all that was involved in production and all that was left was a repetitive boredom that was too predictable to be so exciting. Also, the effective ending used in the story is in favor of dumping for a happy ending that makes the overall impact of the mute. There is some atmosphere and stylish direction, but no conspiracy to back any of it up. Children are also woefully unconvincing. Matt Bronson
