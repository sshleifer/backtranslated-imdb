You can see that if the film isn't driven by his brother, it's the best he can do. And it is sad to say that his best does not reduce it. "Ice Cream Man" is a very bizarre horror movie that is a real blast that looks to see if you're in the right mood. In a bad mood, it was known to cause people to forcibly go to loved ones, so please watch with caution. Clint Howard stars (Does he really have something like Clint Howard?) "bad" psychotic "bizarre" (Yes, all in quotations, it's none of them at all, but he's coming) man ice cream that tortures local kids with bombs that are really melted and ice creams that have been chopped up by people and dogs. Ick. By the way, the plot is really just an excuse to show ... well, um, it's a conspiracy. Wait, I know! It's an excuse to show all the losers! There's Jan Michael Vincent and Lee Majors II (continuing?) Like cops watching the elusive ice cream. And even Doug Lleyweln appears to be a supermarket salesman. Better yet, some of the bizarre movies in the movie are. I really like the fact that, for some reason, instead of hiring a fat actor to play an unhappy "fat" guy from a group, they just make it one kid wearing padding under his clothes. And the whole assumption that everyone would scoop ice cream from a man of ice cream. Who buys ice cream scoops from an ice cream man? Then there is the whole scene of the psychiatric ward in which John Michael Vincent's work ranges from mild interest to a boring state of consciousness. These are the cops who also clear the Ice Cream Mana spot for the tracks, but they can finish the ice cream shine (where different bodies are kept, of course). Well, better luck next time soldiers. Howard himself exaggerated, as if making sure that the people in the two cities saw and heard him. It's all just stupid. And quite fun to laugh in the gentle tradition of Pumaman or Gymkata. You'll have a good laugh with the right sense of HUMOR. I love this one. <br /> <br />
