Firstly, it is one of the worst soft-core wiring for an erotic thriller I've ever seen in my life. Of course, like all the erotic thrillers they want to do, it's about a madam brothel and is set in a brothel. This, of course, makes softcore simulated sex that appears every 10 minutes seem "in context." No matter what. Forget the moment that it never meant a win. The actors are terrible and their line reading has made me cringe. The woman who plays the female cop is so bad that it's out of description. She must really be a really good friend of the guys who prepared the film for this terrible adventure if you know what I mean. Production values ​​are slightly higher than porn. Other than that? I suppose if you are really drunk and need to laugh, it would be a perfect movie. And if that is the case, I recommend a quick redirect to all the scenes with the female police. What's the accent, Brooklyn? Hilarious!
