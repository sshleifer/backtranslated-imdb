This movie is so bad that I missed the way to a lot of time already talking about it. So bad ... really ... ... BAD ... and I'm not so critical ... ..I'm almost shy to admit that I saw it ... Sandra will show you a few minutes how far she really did. ..I think really next to it is really an Oscar worthy of it ... I suppose the only way to look at it is that there's no way after that. start somewhere ... but really ... soo bad ... ... terrible really ... bad is too good a word for this ** t ... but i don't want to mean ... but really how you do you can't waste 90 minutes ... 90 minutes of your life never to return ... 90 minutes I could spend something better ... like sitting on my ass and staring in space ... which would be time better spent ... (leaves shaking head)
