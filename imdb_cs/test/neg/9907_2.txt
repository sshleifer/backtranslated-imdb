The only reason I know that this movie exists is because I wanted to see what Nancy McKeon has since ended. When I was looking for her name, this relatively new television movie came. After a long investigation, I managed to find a copy and I was completely disappointed with what I saw. D Grade Acting, Bad Scenario, Horrible FX - It was like watching a toned down, more overwhelmed version of Day After Tomorrow that went on for 3 hours. Despite the long running time of the character, they remain relatively underdeveloped, and we do not care about them in the least, and in most cases desire their demise. Combine it with terrible lighting and cinematography and have a real film disaster. How they managed to convince so many "actors" (ie, Dianne Weist, Randy Quaid, Brian Dennehy) to appear in such waste is overwhelming. In short - I want those 3 hours of my life back !!!
