Even if I didn't read Anne "Rice" the Queen of the Damned "Vampire Chronicles," I would have thought that this movie was just awful. It was tasteless, no plot, no sense at all. I sat down and wondered what was separated from the book, and the longer I thought it was, the worse it was, if you want to link it to the previous movie Chronicles, it's ridiculous because it's ridiculously inconsistent with this movie Bare a few ideas taken from Rice's genius in "The Vampire Chronicles" have been defeated and ridiculed. She is an absolute insult to Anna Rice's fans everywhere, and a pathetic excuse for heritage in Aaliyah's latest film. it's an insult to Aaliyah fans anyway. <br /> <br /> Probably the only compliment can be paid for sound effects as well as some of the graphics. In fact, I subscribed to this membership for a single reason to communicate with people who bother to look at this film (7 years after release, how it can be) to not waste time or expect much disappointment .
