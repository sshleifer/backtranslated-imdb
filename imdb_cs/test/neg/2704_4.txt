Although this film is generally inaccurate, there are some items that can be true. Sure, he was a wild character in his youth, having played practical jokes on his fellow cadets at West Point, almost eliminated several times, passing the last in his class (34), and often ruthless in his leadership during the Civil War. Br /> <br /> But history might have made him a goat of Indian wars. Sure, he made his share of cruel things, but how much was he under orders? There is also evidence that before Congress (with great risk for his commission and command) he testified that he was arguing about the fairness of violations of the Indians and that if he were an Indian he should fight rather than live on a reservation! As the character said in play 1776, when asked what will be said about the British about the loss of the revolutionary war, the character states that "history will do what it always does ... it will lie". Who knows how bad Custer was. He was certainly not sympathetic in the way he was portrayed by Errol Flynn and later by Ronald Reagan. But I also doubt it was completely evil, as it is later shown.
