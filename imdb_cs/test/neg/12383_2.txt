That's almost Ed Wood Territory. Yeah, that ridiculous wreck of a flying monster looks like a cross between a turkey and a bad day in the office. And the screech sound effect makes nails across the board sound like Mozart. And why Giant Claw when a goofy creature engulfs its victims with a mechanical jaw. We get big shots of ugly chicken feet but nothing more. I think the producers thought Jerry Lewis's comedy might be a better name for Big Mouth. Speaking of comedies, all the "anti-matter" gobbledy-gook is more fun than anything in Lewis. I think the dogs were trapped because of the fact that an ordinary duck hunter couldn't take care of a flying threat from the fifties, so they made a real horror - an anti-mass from another galaxy. It is believed that this KFC refugee arrived from another galaxy behind the anti-matter shield, as explained by the intolerable detail of one of the film's resident genes. In this case, Jeff Morrow, the pilot I am collecting in his off-hours, advises Einstein about the secret of the universe. Unfortunately, it is also Morrow, who keeps the ridiculous behavior of the bad movie Hall of Shame, because he actually adds his lines with a straight face. What's more, it even sounds like he trusts them. This is a movie that triumphs first order. For the hell with the Oscars, Morrow deserves a combat medal for performance in the worst case. Watch the leading Lady Corday, then you can measure his courage under fire. It looks like she just woke up in a bad dream, and maybe when she is standing on her arm, no one will notice her. I hardly did it. Well, when I first saw this disaster, it was through the beer haze in the back row of what is now a housing estate. I should have learned my lesson and split another 12-pack of this a second time.
