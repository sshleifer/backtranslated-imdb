Mixing small city sheriffs, high school students, fake rock music and some weirdoes who kill, well, no reason in particular, this movie is basically a re-make of "Giant Gila Monster" - in addition to the Gilead monsters, of course, anyone who really Seeing "Giant Gila Monster" knows it's one of the worst movies of all time, often so slow, it's not even funny. And I can't believe that in 1967 the "giant Gila Monster" earned such a reputation that young directors were dying to work on a sequel, let alone a remake. So will someone explain to me why this movie was made? By the way, the dance sequence is historically interesting, even if it is out of date for about three years; but it is spoiled because it continues ... and on ... and ... on ...
