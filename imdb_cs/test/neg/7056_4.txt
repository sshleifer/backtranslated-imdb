Said Nuff. A secret police officer from the state capital is sent to a small county where the moonlight runs uncontrollable. He ends up getting run off of the road by some local hicks who have no idea that he is a secret cop (so they just drive away as blissfully dopey as always). He is soon to be a cared woman and her three daughters who all wear low-cut tops and short shorts (I must luv the 70s). He falls in love with one of the girls, but has yet to find out who is doing the whole moonlight and driving it to all the local bars and restaurants. He also has to deal with a fat sheriff and his incompetent representative who thinks it's a moon scroll because it's new in the city. Living in a small town of America, in the 1970s. YEE HAAAAAAAAAAA.
