The only reason I watched it is his stars, CASPAR Van Dien, Micheal Pare and Eric Roberts & Catherine Oxenburg * & Jeniffer Rubin, All capable actors & have done well in the past. NOT THIS TIME, the weak story of a serial killer, you can guess who the killer is on the first scene. Very invented in all aspects there is nothing to recommend in this disaster, my rating is * 1/2 POOR
