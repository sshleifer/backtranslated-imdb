I think I'll be the only one to say it, but yes, I was lil bored during the movie. In fact, not saying that this is a bad movie is a very good attempt to portray the innermost emotions - dilemma, sorrow, love .., esp is the director's debut (is he reading it, is that true?). I felt something was wrong, maybe it's just me, I'm not attracted to characters to plunge into their world. It's a simple story about ordinary people, ordinary lives. Through simple and short dialogues, the director tries to combine the life of a simple boy and how he can cope with the news of his illness whenever he laughs. Oh y his laughter was initially a little cute, but gradually it got to me, such a deep hearty roar for a gentle man! I must say that I did not feel the impact most readers have, in fact I was more attracted to trivial scenarios such as the spitting of watermelon seeds with its sis, which clearly shows that they are happy with the other, grandmother, who came back for another shot - This is a bit of a melancholic, thoughtful gesture of writing procedures for his father - hmm, but it is predictable .. I did not understand that I am an action lover, independent movies are my cup of tea! Maybe I have really great expectations after watching many deep movies that have stronger frames. Some Asian movies are worth watching: Tony Takitani (depicts loneliness) Wayward Cloud (1 dialogue only) My Sassy Girl (I like it!) 4.30 (loneliness as well) 15 (gangsters live in local environment)) Before sunrise and before sunset (I have to mention, even if they are not Asian movies. Fans will understand!)
