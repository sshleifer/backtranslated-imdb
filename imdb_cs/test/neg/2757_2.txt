It could have been much better than it turned out. Tom Pittman gives a good performance and some older actors do well with what they have to work for, but it just doesn't work. First, the actors are too old to play high school students, especially Howard Veit (Vince). Looks like thirty. Second, it's hard to sympathize with poor Marv, especially since Betty isn't so hot to get started. ******* Spoilers ****** The end is so special. Looks like a director designed for a Pittman character is shot, but there are no shots ... he is just knocked on the cement where he lies there until the ambulance drivers pick him up and put him on a stretcher (face down). . What were his injuries? Leather knee? Goofy! Vince had just shot his girlfriend dead without any remorse, yet he simply pushed Marva to the ground and rushed away, despite the fact that he wasn't making any secret of the fact that he hated the boy. And to make things even stronger, Marv begs the police to tell her father that he is sorry. (Duh! Hey, Marv. You just knocked down. I think you'll have plenty of opportunity to tell your father that you're sorry ... in person). And the writer didn't get an Oscar nomination? Skip it if you don't look at MST.
