What a shock. For starters, I couldn't stand the constant shouting and noisy panicking all the time. I wasn't afraid of it, horror or sympathy for the characters; it was just unpleasant. The camera's sharp motion was also unpleasant. The storyline was the same as any other cheap horror movie. There were several pathetic attempts to give the figures some depth, but it really didn't work into the rest of the plot. And then it's over. I'm still not sure what to do about it. I think it was supposed to be a clever twist, then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid. The case had a few of those little winners of prizes / nomination symbols on it, so I figured it couldn't be bad. I was wrong. If you see it, you should just leave it on the shelf.
