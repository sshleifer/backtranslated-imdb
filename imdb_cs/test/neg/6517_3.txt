This movie is about meeting 7 couples at Hampstead Heath on one sunny Wednesday afternoon. Shows 7 different types of couples: married, divorced, broken relationship, gay, older, blind day and escort service. In addition to geographic location, they are not interconnected, so it is disappointing. The film is a collage of interviews, without any recognizable plot. The film passes from pair to row without logic. It seems to me that this film is boring and pointless. The only redeeming feature is great weather throughout the movie. Sadly, talent like Ewan McGregor and Sophie Okonedo is lost by this film.
