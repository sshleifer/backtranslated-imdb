What a waste of great casting. I thought I'd check it out because it looked like a good comic comedy with many pretty well-known actors. It turned out to be a nonsensical collection of dull interweaving stories of several characters with minimal interconnection. Characters that start to look like decent people but end up with them not just a likable or interesting character between them. The comedy was also a stretch ... the only thing that made me laugh was Jack Black's song that was basically Tenacious D. I was expecting something big to happen, but I ended up nothing more than 97 minutes of my life. .
