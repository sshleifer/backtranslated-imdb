OUCH, No real need to say anything else. Actually, this film was thinking about suicide. As a huge fan of the beautiful zombie genre, I found it to be the worst attempt I've ever made. The movie never seemed to look at all! What mattered, I felt hopeless and lost. Damn it was so bad I can't even justify bashing it anymore. I'm just going to hang in the closet. OK now I tried to post my comment, but the server will only accept comments that are ten or more lines. So here it goes ... Bad, awful, not where it's close enough. NO TITS !!!!!! How can you have a movie Zombie without goats. In fact, the woman's plummet had one hell, and the only reason I watched the movie was to look at it by chance. NO WAY! Of course there was one line that deserves to be mentioned, the line I look forward to once I use (when I feel the need to get my face) "This pig won't smoke alone" bad.
