In fact, everyone who is responsible should be whisked, drawn and hanged! If that's what the great drama Eugene O'Niell is like, I never wanted to be a victim to see it again. There are so many things WRONG w / this feature where one starts? First, Elmer Bernstein's bombastic score is present throughout the film and in the quiet scenes where background music reflects the character's motivation. Second, these characters are NOT pleasant people, and while some reviewers might enjoy having personally disliked every scene in which Ives ate the scenery, but that was the way his characters were written: to be unhappy. W / Loren's just never clear if he's good or bad? and all of her babbling about how things will change back to the way they were before the baby arrived? Okay, I saw what was clearly coming. Perkins is wrong and then plays the role of a warm-up for Norman Bates (who played two years later), although at the end he wanted to be blamed for murder. Hockey! Thirdly, this film is a studio soundstage and suffers from it. The story would benefit from filming a place to create a "place" sense for the farm (which all the main leadership is fighting). As it is filmed there is no sense of the value of the property because the film has a studio sound-stage feeling that it is not compelling. This is a really horrible movie.
