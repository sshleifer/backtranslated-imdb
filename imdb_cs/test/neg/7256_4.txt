So you are a giant mantis and you hung in the arctic for a while and you are tired of the Eskimos who beat you with snowballs. What do giant mutant insects do? Especially the big city! Check out the sights, maybe play a show on Broadway. But wait! When you find a nice cozy tunnel that will call you alone, attackers will attack you !! Argh! Time to break! Anyway, this movie is a step up on most other giant movies because it has quite a decent FX for 1957. But that's about it. Avoid if you really don't need to see other things that could break, or see another actor Perry Mason in the movie B. <br /> <br /> 4/10
