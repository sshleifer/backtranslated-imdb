'' Queen of the Damned '' is one of the worst edits to the movie book I have seen. The only thing I like about this movie is the soundtrack, something else besides (because I'm a fan of Korn, Marilyn Manson, Chester Bennington of Linkin Park and Wayne Static of Static-X) There are so many mistakes and so many bad decisions that I don't even know how to get started. There were so many stories like the twin legend (one of my favorite ones) of Armando and Daniel's relationship, and even Louis wasn't there to mention a few. (The story was dead) First, they were supposed to make Vampire Lestat '' because it is the second book after '' The Vampire Interview '' and not the '' Queen of Damned ''. They tried to squeeze so much information in one movie that you wouldn't finish a scarcity of almost nothing if you didn't read the Vampire Chronicles. <br /> <br /> So many meaningful characters are not really meaningful in this movie. . This is, for example, the case of Pandora. The actors who decide to play all the characters do not agree with many of Anne Rice's descriptions, namely Marius, which is allegedly a beautiful, tall, formidable blond with blue eyes like Lestat. (Stuart Towsend is also far from Lestat) I didn't understand why they changed Lestat's creator to Marius instead of Magnus. '' Vampire Interview '' was an amazing movie I Loved Actor and Tom Cruise because Lestat was PERFECT and much better than Stuart Townsend (I'm sad that Tom Cruise refused to play Lestat again) Jen Antonio Bandeiras as Armand did not match Armando's appearance, but anyway, far better from this movie, the crap called '' The Queen of Damned ''. Anne Rice was so picky about Interview that I didn't get as she just sold the rights for this terrible production.
