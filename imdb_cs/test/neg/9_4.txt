The nearby surroundings of David Bryce are extremely well written and informative about how to almost say everything I feel about DARLING LILI. This massive musical is so peculiar and burnt over produced and had to cause rupture in Paramount in 1970. It costs $ 22 million! That's just irresponsible. DARLING LILI had to be green at the board meeting, which said, "Hey, we got that pink panther and the Sound of Music gal ... let's leave it too" and hand over the empty check. The result is a hybrid of GIGI, ZEPPELIN, HALF AND SIXPENCE, several songs and dances of MGM 40s in style (daisies and yachtsmen!) So hopelessly old-fashioned that they are like musical pores and playwrights MATA HARI. The production is colossal, fresh, breathtaking, but the rest: ridiculous romance, Julie looked confused, Hudson dead, bad comedy and incredibly boring songs silence this amazing movie. LILI is like a mega musical of the twenties with some vulgar pieces to spice him up. STAR! released a year before the sad crash and is now finally appreciated for a great movie is really ... and Andrews looks noble, mature, especially in the last half hour ...... but LILI is POPPINS and DOLLY believes he really killed the mega musical binge from The 1960s ..... and Andrews looked like Poppins again ... which I believed was not the intention of Edwards. Paramount had to collectively faint when they saw this: with another $ 20 million festering in Catch 22, and $ 12 million in ON CLEAR DAY and $ 25 million in PAINT your car .... they had a financial gap of CLEOPATRA's share of $ 77 million t bound to 4 movies with very uncertain futures. Maybe they should ask Daisy Gamble viewer from ON A CLEAR DAY ...... LILI was very popular for the immediate first release in Australia and ran in 70mm cinemas for months, but failed once in submarines and sticks and only ever after spending one night with ON A CLEAR DAY as a double night on Sunday. Thank God Paramount had his simple $ 1 million (yes, one million DOLLAR) movie LOVE STORY and that $ 4 million dollars gangster pic GODFATHER also ready to restore all $ 77 million in the next two years .... for just $ 5 million . ... incredible!
