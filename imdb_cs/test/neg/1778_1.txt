At the very beginning, a look at the control panel that reads "8 miles out of California costs" and no, I didn't overlook it, but really didn't realize it cost the place instead of the coast. These people had to be ants. It's good to be in scary movies, but the mere fact that they couldn't catch a simple spelling problem convinced me that they really didn't put any effort into it. making a movie at all. Navy uniforms are by no means correct at all. Wow, absolutely ridiculous, but good when you're looking for something insanely stupid what you're looking at. How these people made some money out of it is behind me.
