Robert Aldrich's brutal, quasi-black comedy "Grissom Gang", a reworking of the 1948 British film "No Orchids for Miss Blandish", has the 1920s heiress Kim Darby kidnapped by a pack of clumsy thieves; Soon, this gang will be posted, and the poor Kim will be taken to the clutches of another crooked game - gangster gangster brothers with sweaty, pasty faces and a mother who looks like Buddy Ebsen on the move. Initially, Darby (not very clever and not very clever) tries to escape this drooling fetus but is on it. In the end, he just gives up the effort and there is a problem with the story. Should we sympathize with the audience? Is her growing interest in the family half-humorous? These are disgusting, assholes and I wanted to see as few of them as possible. But since the side stories (the case of the police officers on the case and others concerning the floozy-singer Connie Stevens) are somewhat boring, the director has no choice but to keep these sweaty faces on us. Soon, nervous Darby also starts to sweat, though her haystack scene is sensitively carried out and Aldrich's climatic moments are provocative when confused. ** of ****
