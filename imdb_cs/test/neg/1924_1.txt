*** This comment may contain spoilers *** Warning: It includes spoilers I have seen some pretty lame movies in my day. And it's just worth seeing how I see about 80 movies a year. I have to say that of the 80 movies I see in the theater, maybe 5 are really really good, 15 or 20 isn't so great, 40 or 50 is fine and then maybe 5 or 10 is absolutely awful. Here on Earth falls into the category. This is one of the most predictable, fierce, nasty movies I've ever seen. It is loaded with unlikable characters, maudlin situations about after-school-special kinds of themes and plenty of fluff here to make YOUNG AND RESTLESS look like American BEAUTY. And I'm not unfair. That's a horrible movie. This is the story of a rich guy, a poor girl, a poor boy, and a small town that produces fresh cookies every day for all of his townspeople. Are you still warm and fuzzy yet? Let me continue. One day, rich snot comes to waltzing the city with his new graduation present that his father bought for him and he offends a pretty girl in the dining room, almost gets into battle with her longtime friend and then races him and destroys a little dinner he works on . So he's sentenced to summer in a small town where he and his boyfriend have to fix it with a guest. This gives us plenty of opportunity to see shirtless Chris Klein so we can understand why a girl in the dining room would fall for him. Has abs !!! Oh and he is rich !!! And ... it's the biggest hit without respect to anyone. It's James Dean, he's a rebel who doesn't give damn! He is rude to everyone in the city, he does not want to associate with anyone who tries to be nice to him and acts like a spoiled rich brother. But Leelee Sobieski still falls on him. There's no reason he does, he just does it. Oh, sorry, it's true I forgot to mention that he likes the same poet he has. Well, if it doesn't get wet, then I don't know what it will be. Here on Earth there are also some of the most predictable moments I've ever heard in the movie. When I left the theater to take popcorn and read graffiti on the bathroom wall, I said one point and told my fianc√© exactly what would happen in the next ten minutes. After my return, she just laughed and said I was right, even though I said there was a dance scene. In addition, the disease she suddenly shuts down is cancer. This is the most beautiful cancer patient I've ever seen. Have you ever watched a cancer patient die slowly? Losing weight, losing hair, their gums begin to rot. It's not a nice picture. Sobieski lights up after she has cancer, as if she were pregnant. What an insult to people watching love slowly dies from this disease. And how do you contract a knee cancer from falling in the field? Now I realized I saw the way too many movies, and it makes my cynicism run uncontrollably occasionally, but that's ridiculous. There was nothing I liked about this movie or Chris Klein's character. He is a jerk, he is uncomfortable and never seeks peace with anyone around him. Here on Earth is not just a bad movie, it's irresponsible. It received 4.2 on the IMDb voting table, and it is too high. They are embarrassed to write on the screen, and the one who has made the green light should not only lose his job, but he or she should promise that he will never have to approach the script again. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, and it's generous. This film should be presented at film schools as if it were not to write and manage a film. <br /> <br /> If you are bored and you really need to do something and your choices are cleaning a farm full of cow dung or watching this film movie, choose cow dung cleaning. It will feel better and you will feel that you have done something good with your two hours.
