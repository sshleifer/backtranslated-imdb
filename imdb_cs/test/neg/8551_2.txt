Many actors have a lot of good film roles in their souls. Some, a handful. Others, maybe a couple. Then there is Linda Blair. "Ejector". That is all. When you see "Chained Heat" and look at Linda Blair, you have to wonder what happened in her mind, if anything. Certainly not, "Oh, boy: Oscar for Best Actress, I'm Here!" Only other women in prison film, like they did for cheap in the 1970s, this actually has names you know. . John Vernon plays the Dean ... I mean, the warden (with a hot tub in his office, wondering what he told the supplier?), Stella Stevens appears, even Henry Silva and Louisa Moritz show how bad they needed it. And special mention, of course, to our heroine Sybil Danning as a bisexual prisoner who moves to poor Blair. To paraphrase, Sybil is like Sybil and everything Sybil does is perfect. You forget what horrible movie you're watching. <br /> <br /> Almost. Two Stars. One for Sybil and the other for trying to pass Linda Blair as a sex symbol. Anything he could have (get it?)?
