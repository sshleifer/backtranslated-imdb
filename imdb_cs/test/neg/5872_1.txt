First, this movie is rude to the point of nausea, and my advice is to avoid at all costs if you ever wanted to eat ice cream again. I tried to watch it because it looked like it might be funny, but soon it was quite worrying when an ice cream made from body parts and surprisingly graphic effects. It opens with a boy named Greg to testify the terrible murder of an ice cream man (Greg subsequently goes crazy and grows up to be a title character) what seems to be a murderer crowd. There is no explanation for this murder, which is WTF's greatest moment throughout the film. Other, smaller WTF moments include surrealistic asylum Greg goes to (featuring evil clowns), a woman speaking languages ​​because she was obsessed with the Holy Spirit (what it has to do with something I don't know), and the fact that Olivia "Holy crap has a career in this tank career "Hussey is in it. None of these reasons is good enough to look at it. The only reason is for a tuna character who is a skinny kid with pillows stuffed under his shirt, so he looks like a fat boy. For some reason, it surprised me. I stayed much longer into the night before watching this movie just to see if there was any reason they couldn't use a real fat guy for this role. Although I fell asleep before the end, I gathered from other reviews that the tuna ends losing weight. Okay, so they didn't have the budget to pull it out realistically. Suggestions for the director: how to make a figure ... not overweight? <br /> <br /> That's it; if you are not interested in the tuna prospect, there is no other reason to recognize the existence of this film. If disgusting horror movies about ice cream are your preferred source of fun, look for much better things.
