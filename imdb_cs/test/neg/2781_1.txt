Another stupid "movie". Image quality is correct. Sound too. Music is in the middle. The guy's trying to make music like Halloween. For a rare time, a producer / director chooses non-anorexic girls. That's why this "movie" lasts one week and costs $ 10,000. Does this mean that when a producer has money, will he choose all the anorexic girls? Good question. But girls in this "movie" are physically correct. But they're not good actresses. Neither guys. But maybe it's just the cause of the "story" of this "movie" has no value. I'm sure we're giving $ 10,000 to some teens who like the movie and can make a better movie. Don't waste your time watching this "thing".
