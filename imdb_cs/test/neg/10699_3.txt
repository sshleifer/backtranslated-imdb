For the most part, I thought this movie was unworthy, but the last 10 minutes made me write one. You see, then we learn (SPOILERS ... if we can call it) that the devil's envoy does not have a chance to properly prepare the world for his master, because he is not experienced in martial arts! "Prosatanos" lies in the hole for centuries, waiting for "human greed" to release him, just to be defeated in a simple one-on-one game against a 54-year-old former karate champion Chuck Norris! Imagine what would happen to him if he married Jackie Chan ... (* 1/2)
