It was really necessary to include embarrassing footage of non-participants in the document. And why all those silly dog ​​scenes, and then repeating all the same stupid dog scenes? The film begins with a great promise - to reveal international politics and trade in wine. It started great and included all the right characters. But production is a mess. The points started and developed most of the way, then they never finished or stayed with hanging ends. Very poor and disorienting camera and editing work. They should use headlines for a British mumbler from Christie's. Too much fluff and not enough facts for the document. Probably honored in Cannes because of an American assault (though it was too little in my opinion). We left at 2:00 am - I have no idea how long it has been running.
