Ron Hall threatens a triple threat as he writes, directs and stars in 'Vampire Assassins'. Derek Washington (Hall) is your clich√©-police mission that finds itself on your neck in some nasty vampire action. He threw his badge to look for the last vampire (not Buffy!) To return to the streets and beat the bloody back to the grave. 'Vampire Assassins' is a horrible movie. He tears so many other movies (can you tell Blade?) That he never tries to find out his own identity. The script does not exist. The action is terrible. Who says the micro-budget stimulates creativity? There is nothing interesting here. You won't get any of this, except for headaches. Stay away at all costs.
