Hi everyone, I just wanted to give you a few crazy facts about this movie. I was actually one of the FX makeup artists who helped create "beasts" for this movie and I have to tell you that the original creature looked absolutely amazing. I remember when we got the first photos from the set, we all talked about how much shame this creature was in a movie that would be pretty poor. What actually happened was that Jason Palmer made original makeup for Sasquatch, but for some reason they had to go back and re-shoot much of the creature. The sad part was that Jason had died a few weeks before, and so the re-created creature was not where it was as wonderful as the original. <br /> <br /> For me it was quite sad because it was Jasons final movie, and he got a little cheated on his last fame due to bad re-shoots. By the way, I thought you guys might find that tad is interested, and if you like, you can go to mmmyeah.com and look at some backstage photos. <br /> <br /> Later Jeff
