First, Ed Wood Jr. not the worst director ever, Plan 9 couldn't resist the outer space. Coleman Francis deserves the title. I present exhibition B, Glen or Glenda. The first half of the film consists of a surprisingly sophisticated crossdressing survey, especially since it was made in 1953. The last 15 minutes of the film are also not bad as well. This does not mean that the film has no problems. Bela Lugosi was totally alien, intoning the odd lines. Poor Bela looked as if he wasn't sure what was happening. Acting was definitely wooden, though not worse than the period universal film B. The long dreams that make up the center of the film were completely bizarre; rather like a vaguely threatening deer film than a succession of dreams. The story of Alan / Ann, the anticipated original focus of the film is of quality. No, Ed Wood Jr is not the worst director ever. He was, at least for part of this film, able to make serious social statements. When Coleman Francis tried to do it in the Night Train to Mundo Fine (aka Red Zone Cuba), he just ended up in chaos. Glen or Glenda is at least observable without the help of Robot.
