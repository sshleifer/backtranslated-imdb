Director Nico Mastorakis has created a cynical cash-grabber that is too cynical to impress someone rather than a sophomore fan. The most extreme, confrontational genre images that paraphrase VIDEODROME, "have philosophy"; that is what makes them dangerous. The DEATH ISLAND philosophy is to throw many "shocking" elements into the movie mix and mix slowly. The result is a tasteless but ugly appearance. Don't be fooled by the brilliant Serrador, WHO CAN CHILDREN'S CHILDREN? (sometimes called DEATH ISLAND), Mastorakis' effort is deployed on a Greek island, which is a stage for various forms of defeat, a small rumor, and some large-scale perversion. <br /> <br /> Everything is moving at a fast pace and violent sets are badly directed. <br /> <br /> Titled as a "movie that the censor doesn't want you to see", I would risk estimating that the censors never saw him, just read the presskit until their knees jerked up.
