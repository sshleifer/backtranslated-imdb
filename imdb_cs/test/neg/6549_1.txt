The only positive thing I can think of when it comes to this sheer piece of waste is that I finally have a good answer ready if someone asks me what was the worst movie I've ever seen. it took so little effort to be more observable ... much more effort and it could be brilliant. Why would anyone want to produce such waste? I refuse to believe that a director might be so ridiculously blameless. The creation of a totally unbearable film must have been in place. Nothing else makes sense.
