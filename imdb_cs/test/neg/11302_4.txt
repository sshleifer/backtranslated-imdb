Typical old b & w movie. Sometimes dialogues are good, but too often - especially in the second half - they are naive, sometimes terribly naive, sometimes close to where they are unintentionally comic. The first third, whose basic information on Ladd's Gatsby has shown a number of interesting flashbacks, is the best part of the film. But as Gatsby moves to his new villa and moves to Betty Field, the film becomes too melodramatic. The end is yet another cop-out end; I don't know whether the novel itself contains this stupid, cliché, or whether the film's producer has made any changes, but I've always considered car accidents as a bad way to add drama to the end of the story. I've seen this plot-device a million times (or if it's not a car, then it's a fall from a horse); The writer does not know how to end this story, but he knows he wants it to be dramatic and so adds a car accident. Lame. And to make matters worse, the accident is extremely random and meaningless, both ground and time; the fence-wise because Field's wife's mistress (Winters) gets killed by the Field, and the fact that Winters kind rushes from the gas station to the street as if she hasn't noticed in those years that she's been living in that there \ t her house - and of course the moment she went out, she would see Ladd's car and, by mistake, it was because of Field's husband's car and then shouted, "Here I am! this tragic end! “; time-wise because Ladd and Field are involved in an accident the day they are about to tell Field's husband about their affairs. Basically, there is too much forced and artificial irony in this accident. It also does not help this film, as Winters' husband Da Silva goes on mission revenge to kill the guy who ran over his wife; Basically, he does it by walking like zombies, moving from car to car looking for scratches and very badly. Both Da Silva and his behavior throughout the film are terrible and confusing, respectively. Scott Fitzgerald was annoyed several times by how his novels were adapted to screen by Hollywood screenwriters. he was dead long before this film was made - he could be right to complain, judging from this movie's naive script. Or maybe his novels are even stronger and more naive than this movie, and they have actually been improved by adjusting the screen. Or the films are similar to novels. Of course I read this novel to find out, but I just can't bother. Fitzgerald's name doesn't inspire me to read his books (and I don't mean the way his name sounds). Definitely not Heller, Clavell or Twain. More Like Hemingway ?? lots of noise about nothing.
