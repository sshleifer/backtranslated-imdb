The only reason I watched this movie - because it's about ten years since its release - was due to Ian Holm; I was fascinated when I saw his display of my second favorite character in this game. In any case, this film is as bold as anything that old Zeff created from "Jesus of Nazareth". But some of the best parts of the game have been omitted. I understand the choice of directing / editing, but I don't think it's really fair. Maybe I'm too puristic. I would have to direct the people (who have read so far) to Branagh's version if it were not that I despised his tendency to excessive dramatization. Likewise, Hamlet is better than Gibson. But then we all didn't wait for Gibson to show up as an actor? All he did is prove he wants to make movies in extinct languages. Perhaps the only acting performance of Shakespeare is Scofield as a Ghost.
