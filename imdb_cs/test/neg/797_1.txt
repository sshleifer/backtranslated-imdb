Be warned the next time "Richard Kelly", who is involved in any kind of production, appears to escape. Fast. Kelly has proved to the world after his latest film "Southland Tales" that he is one of the leading directors. It was forgiving and convoluted. The "The Box" hasn't changed much. I can imagine what had to be his Warner Bros course, and I bet the studio executives were eating it right: a feature film based on one of Richard's "Twilight Zone" Matheson's old stories. <br /> <br /> A big mistake! You won't read further unless you want this movie to be perfectly spoiled for you: Norma (Cameron Diaz) presses a button. It turned out that Arlington Steward (Frank Langella) has an Alien who uses his body as a vessel to perform "experiments" in which the fate of mankind rests. His face is scarred because he was hit by Alien lightening who killed him, but then brought him back to life to do all this red testing button. Since Norma pushes the button because she knows that someone can die, she must suffer the consequences of not taking into account someone else's life instead of her own. Eventually, she and her husband (James Marsden) decide to kill Norma instead of growing up on deaf and blind. Kelly dances around the "message" of her film and tries to find out what the moral story is. Apparently every person with a brain at the beginning says, "What if I'm the one who dies?" Richard Kelly will not allow his character to have normal normal conversation. In fact, they avoid it together. They seem to be educated, working in a prestigious school and also for NASA, so why wouldn't both have a better SEARCH BOX ??? <br /> <br /> If the main characters actually have this conversation, the whole movie could end up right here! Instead, we have to watch weddings go on forever, NASA and NSA are happy with Arlington Stewart, who will take over these government programs, teleports to show Marsden's life outside our world, so it will be "easier" to kill his wife and drone. A steward who can be anytime, anywhere, anytime. <br /> <br /> The most painful part of this movie is stimulation. Nothing really happens. It's confused mish-mash ideas that are ridiculous. It is unbearable how this movie is sold. Ads make it look like "Saw" and even use the music from these movies to sell. In fact, what you get is slow, boring, ridiculous (yes, half of the theater laughed at acting and visual effects) and a chaotic film that is neither imaginative, interesting, nor cohesive. At one point Cameron Diaz and her son are kidnapped and then suddenly returns to the big black NSA car with her husband on their way home. Where did she go? Why did they take her? Do we really care? No longer. <br /> <br /> You don't really care about what happens to any of the characters. You'll be rooting for everyone to die, so the movie will end. Go see something else he plays. Don't waste your time or money.
