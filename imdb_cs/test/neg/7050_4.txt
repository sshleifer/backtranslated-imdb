I haven't seen it in many years. The behavior was as good as I started this time, I thought, "Great! Another movie that I mistakenly considered a stupid young man." But then the topic became clear and I felt the same way. This was Hollywood, the seat of the glamor; so the concept should not be a surprise. But it is such a condescending concept that I feel like I have to shower after I have watched it. In short, it tells us that even physically ugly people may seem beautiful to each other and even appealing. Dorothy McGuire is like a homely heroine. She seems to be filmed wearing minimal makeup. Robert Young is wounded in the war and feels scarred. Even his parents can't bear him. He seems to have all his abilities, and in part, the concepts of disability are outdated. Herbert Marshall is at hand as a blind pianist. His character speaks of muted tones and is omniscient. <br /> <br /> The best performance is Mildred Natwick as the headquarters owner. It is bitter and dour, but not from ice. Her story is much more interesting and credible than the story of McGuire and Young.
