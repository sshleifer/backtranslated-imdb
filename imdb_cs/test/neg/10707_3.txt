... but he had to see how badly he could get it. The beginning of the conspiracy was thin, but it was getting worse. A female genetic engineer uses her research to accelerate mitosis to artificially create a man, because a WW3 biological weapon killed 97% of the world's male population. Surviving men are either high prices of gigolos in the back of aisle clubs, or crazed lunatics in running down plot stadiums to overthrow a 'lesbian plot'. The whole process resembled a microwave of a large bowl of jelly. Press a few buttons and ding you get a baby. Not only that, but he will age until the mid-20s a month, and then he starts to age normally (as comfortable). Finally, the poor Adam is bored with a secluded hut in the woods where his creator resurrected him and stole her car to "see the city." a few subplots we never see. As Adam learns quickly, what men survived is considered an outcast / criminal because they are dangerous beasts that cannot help genetic predisposition to violence. Propaganda machines were in full swing, and women were frightened that all men were rapists and murderers. This has led to lesbianism being the norm, the fall of Christianity, the reproduction of women only by cloning and world peace among other things, implied results. All this is unlikely given that only ~ 30 years have passed since the war. Adam stumbles from one bad situation to another while being genetically programmed to be non-violent and unable to do much in his own interest. With the FBI on his trail, madams looking for fresh meat, and his creator trying to capture him (for himself it looks), he learns that violence is not limited to the male species after all. <br /> <br /> All in all, I wouldn't recommend this movie. However, I enjoyed Veronica Cartwrights showing 'love to hate her' FBI director, and Julie Bowen did not do badly as Hope the 'hetero' wardrobe geneticist.
