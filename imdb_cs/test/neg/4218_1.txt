But not this! I always wanted to know what happened. We'll never be sure what happened because GWTW was Margaret's child. I am a lifelong fan of Gone With the Wind and I couldn't be more discouraged. I compared "Scarlett" with the original GWTW because every film worth watching GWTW had to be the first to be on the same level of quality. Rhett was cast beautifully, though NO ONE never coincides with Mr. Gable. I'm also a strict Vivien Leigh fan !! She was Scarlett. Looks at the bill. Not another actress in this life or another never fit the same shoes, but with "Scarlett" work could be done better. The lack of thoughts went into finding the right Scarlett, it was obvious. Overall, something to look at, but if you want to know what happened to Scarlett and Rhett, I suggest you write it yourself or find a fiction fan. This movie has no time.
