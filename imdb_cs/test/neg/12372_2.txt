This horrible moovie is fun on many levels - the most obvious of which is the lame, fake-looking bird puppet that floats around cheap trains without waving its wings (like on a string, maybe?), Attacking model trains and toys cars. "Science" is an asinine - Masonic atomic weapon? And what happens to the huge amounts of Brylcream in everyone's hair? I think the 1950s was Slimeball's decade! Well, this bird puppet probably comes from "some tired universe of the universe," and it's here to build a nest and a nest in New York. Seriously. It is almost a shame to kill a puppet. I give him 1 hoof of 4 - it's stupid and stupid but funnier than Armageddon. : = 8)
