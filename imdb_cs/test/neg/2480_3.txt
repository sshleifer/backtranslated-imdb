I have seen every episode and all the characters have remained the same self-forgotten, how little little brats have made up, it's not a 5-year-old development (not getting pregnant if your daddy's a girl, only now Delinda beats Danny) because dad isn't around) it does not change or grow, which makes it boring, repetitive and just unpleasant to be after Season 3, Danny is a typical soft character that everyone in everybody's life (not having any moral principles) owns, especially Mary and Delinda. Old boring clich√©s will be used to that he and off relationship get bored very quickly really. James Cann can act and his character is okay to watch, only he is just another hack writers wet dream, ex cia man who has huge contacts and training etc so he can stop any thief or a cheater who is known to a man, even though the cameras can't do half the thing they do for a while, but in 5 years the writers behave very stupidly, why? Because they have all these expensive and advanced technologies, but no simple walkie-talkies (communication is quick and easy), you will never see security when you walk on the floor only when the situation is fine, and suddenly everyone is there. The lands are moving very quickly from cheating and robbing the casino one way or another, to terrible typical American boys, a relationship related to girls, the same thing happened with the death material seen around the world, having sex, but I hate you, I always loved you, I think I'm doing it, but I love it instead, but what if, maybe one day, blah blah. <br /> <br /> I recommend '' Hotel Babylon '' to people who like Las Vegas, it has a lot more to go for it simply because the characters are interesting engaging and not forced down the neck for 6 months of the year. <br /> <br /> I'm glad the British ?? I'd rather see the same actors at 5 different shows than at the age of 5, which would be the worst in the same case.
