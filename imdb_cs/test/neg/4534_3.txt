This movie had some funny moments. Louie, the main character was well occupied with other decent characters. The opening film of the movie set the tone, but the direction and story descended from there. In addition to the twist at the end (interesting and funny), I wish this film had a better direction and a more developed story. Without land being postponed, the whole idea is better! I wish this short movie was better executed. The potential was there, but he simply didn't deliver the goods.
