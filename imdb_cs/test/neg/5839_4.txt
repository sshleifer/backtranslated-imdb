I am no lazy to find "redeeming social value". Whether a book or film wants to suppress people, from Huck Finn / Heart of Darkness to, I don't know, Deep Throat or the last hostages that behave, I sincerely wish not to. I am not a lover of porn or violence-like-fun, but what I have a chance to see slope cameras, cuts, pans, lighting, rhythms, almost to eliminate fear or titilation, sometimes even lack the intention of creators or actors. Even from records that sensible people could argue, there should never be, I always imagine that we should learn something. I wonder how the movie does than what it does. Maybe it's wrong with me. Wiser, but harder than deconstructing an unpleasant cinema, could be seen cuts, pans, etc., on one with and inseparable from any content. I ask myself what horror makers and church architects have in common. Add political filmmakers, fascists and not. They all manipulate light, space and sound to change their perception and mood. How different are their goals? How different are the goals of those who film real atrocities for use as propaganda? <br /> <br /> When the original All Night Long trilogy (ANL) appeared on my shelf, I left it for almost a year without a trace. Curiosity made me buy. The sample I had a few minutes of "1" on the day it arrived, until the annoyingly sound-influenced street stab stings that seemed to be really an attack on movie viewers' sensitivity, found it clumsy, but effective. I would definitely have to go back to it, but don't enjoy the prospects. Apparently it was not the noble horror of Kairo, Cure, Angel Dust, Lain, rawer, but still traditionally framed by the horror of the first Evil Dead Trap, apparently the political work of Koji Wakamatsu, or even the brilliant crunchiness of early Cronenberg. br /> <br /> Perhaps the word "attack" is crucial. Matsumura does not attack his characters but his audience. I can't follow them at this point in history without thinking about Abu Garib (some of whom I think I remembered the video) and the hostages, but also about Godard's torturers (in Le Petit soldat?) Is just a work, a fraction of a working day . And then there is a long-running newspaper story from Northern California, whose details I hardly remember, but I can't forget completely, because it also means "cinema", a duo of notorious serial killers, if the design doesn't play games with my memory because the video itself recorded torture victims . <br /> <br /> All three ANL records are vengeance revenge, vigilante exercises, but I'm attaching these ANL3 notes because it's the most ambitious and can be a turning point for director Matsumur. (I did not see the records that followed ANL3.) During the first two offers, I imagined that the camera would fall into the hands of one of those high school or high school children who obsessively draw war scenes or other atrocities. (Or as if one of Matsumur's vengeful characters turned to the director. Anyone who watched those who didn't see Michael Powell Peeping Tom would see it well.) But ANL3 seems to be striving for mainstream. Matsumur's protagonist grows carnivorous plants, allowing some typical Japanese shots of nature. There is also the first time Matsumura movie, traditionally erotic sequence: Kikuo's female boss sneaks up and starts stroking it while he is peeping at the hotel customer's love. Kikou found himself unhappily among them. It's a voyeur mediator. Short excitement comes from the layers of voyeurism. There is even a philosophical / poetic garbage sifter, a garbage voyeur that somehow thinks of a poem that is repeated in Wakamatsu's not-at-all-what-it-sounds-like, go, go, secondtime virgin. I didn't get anywhere with this and it's in the way of my comments from other movies. I can't escape the suspicion that a few years after I go to Matsumura's retrospective in my local film archive, maybe a learned person who has caught on something I miss. How much does it matter whether the director is or simply "gets" his mortally confused protagonists? Do they even have to understand them? Perhaps the director's work is just to spew it, then to leave the critics, sociologists, and the rest of us hash things. Perhaps directorial or artistic responsibility is a false idea. My last match with this thing was wondering what a woman thought she was following these tremendously male exercises. In this way, we are putting women over and over again, from Star Wars to et cetera and et cetera and on and on, and on and on, but it is something that, like a man's leaning, is all night long.
