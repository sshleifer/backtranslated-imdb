To summarize in a nutshell, this film was disappointing and could be shortened by twenty minutes. Acting was subpar, the only decent actors of Trisha, Killer and Molly. The music was slightly lame, but the special and special effects were too exaggerated. The story / scenario was bad, unnecessary torture / romantic scenes were dragged too long and unsatisfactory ending. <br /> <br /> The beginning of the movie was a bit slow, the false look is not very interested. Trisha came to the house, and there was some assumption for a good story. Trisha began receiving threatening phone calls that increased tension. This momentary tension, the best feature of the movie began to build, but then friends crashed the spot, destroying all potential tension / horror in the movie. The story then becomes blunt from here on. Chemistry sparkles between the two pairs and then the killer selects Frank and the other girl. This scene was dragged and wasted. The killer then sets off for Trisha and joins her. There is an exaggerated scene of torture that lasts at least ten minutes. Since Gore is doing badly, it's not fun at all and bored more than shocks. In short, the first thirty minutes of this movie sound promising, but then a badly written dialogue and a general lack of conspiracy will destroy this movie. <br /> <br /> 3/10.
