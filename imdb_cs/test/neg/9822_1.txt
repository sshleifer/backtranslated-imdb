Where do we start with such an offer? I almost told the movie, but it would be a step too far. The only thing hellish about this movie is that it's definitely a marriage in hell, between nothing and nonsense, balloons and balderdash. These films should have a physiological health warning to avoid harming one's spirit to the point that one could believe that all the good filmmakers left the planet and their sources were passed on to the wanders who just like the sister of this classic garbage trite in the "League of Extraordinary Twaddle" weapon. They are neither science fiction nor fact, fun or provocative thoughts, funny or hard, but lie in the twilight zone without any and all accessories that attract people to give up their precious time, sit in a darkened room and generally have more enlightenment, recovery or happy at the end. If we could appreciate the "Turkish" points for films like this, it would be turnip as we go through turkey, ham, potatoes, sprouts, sauce and all the other ornaments before we reach the bottom of the rock.
