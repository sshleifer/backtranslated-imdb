The first review I saw on IMDB says Vince Vaughn is a much better actor than Anthony Perkins in this role. I wonder if he saw the original. It's hard to review Psycho unless you have an idea of ​​how revolutionary the movie was in 1960. You have a heroine who is not very likable and is killed near a movie and a criminal who is scary but makes you feel for him. Add some graphic violence to it and you have a blue print for some slasher films of the 80s and 90s. <br /> <br /> Where does this movie go wrong? Let's start with casting. Anne Heche is fine as Vivian Crane, but as Norman Bates Vince Vaughn is wrong. First, he looks too young. Second, he has no idea how to play the role. His nervous laughter reminds me of Ron Howard, who is trying to play a tough guy on Happy Days. Everything he does screams. The original film, even to those who know everything about it, still worries you about the influence of mother on Norman and turns into a true, independent character. And what about the shower scene. When I finally saw the 1960 movie on the big screen, I was surprised by his power to scare me. Bernard Herrman's score is incredibly steep and loud and goes on to scare than Danny Elfman's synthetic interpretation during the scene. This shower scene serves only to show us the naked body of Anne Heche and the nice blood color. Which brings us to the choice of film in color. It did not work. There's something about rebuilding classic movies that hardly ever works. Some may see this as a noble experiment, but honestly, if Gus Van Sant had nothing to add to this film, he would have left it alone \ t
