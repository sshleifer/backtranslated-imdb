I decided to watch this movie to sleep. He kept me awake, so it was interesting; however, it was quite bland. Acting was good. I don't think any of the actors would do a bad job. Mickey Rourke is as trustworthy as a man who is on top of a hill. The dialogue in this film does not provide these actors with many opportunities to show their full potential, but still shine. <br /> <br /> The atmosphere was great. The music was good and the colors matched the mood the director wanted to paint for the audience. Even the weather improved the mood of the film. Everything was alright. The defects of this film are in his story development. Mafia vs. Act Blackbird doesn't get enough attention. The storyline for divorce Carmen and Wayna is not explained. The FBI seems to work here very fast. Is there no paperwork for all these processes? Is it really so easy to dig his brother's body out of his grave, burn the corpse and identify it as you? There are too many loops in the story for me to make this movie something higher than 4 out of 10 ratings. I wouldn't recommend this movie to people if they really get bored and do not smoke some really good weeds. While WoW is up for maintenance, go find something better than watching this movie.
