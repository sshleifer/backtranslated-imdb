In 1984, the Karate Kid had some magic on it, though it was a little more than a poor man Rocky. Unfortunately, producer Jerry Weintraub did not realize it was best to leave the story where he left off, and persuaded Ralph Macchio and Pat Morit to make further efforts to make the film a trilogy. Part III was definitely low in the series, but someone had to think that the show still had some potential. What other explanation could be for the existence of another Karate Kid? <br /> <br /> Wait a minute. Other? Yeah, Macchio's gone (at least he was smart enough to stop himself), and his replacement is Hilary Swank (!), A troubled teenager (what else?) On behalf of Julie Pierce. Now the girl has family problems. She also gets problems at school. The school has a sadistic gym teacher (Michael Ironside). But as it turns out, one of his students is actually a nice guy and Julie falls on him. This, of course, gets her into more trouble than before. Fortunately for her, he currently lives with Mr. Miyagi (Morita), her grandfather's old friend, who will learn how to return to the bad guys. All these factors advertise up to seven times. clich√©, and that's just a general summary of conspiracy - imagine what the detailed scenes must be! From start to finish, The Next Karate Kid is a tired, flat and boring marathon of idiotic lines and sets. Fortunately, Swank likes Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby to redeem the disaster, but why did Morita decide to return? He could have received an Oscar nomination for his first film, and was in the sequel entertainment, but he has nothing to talk about - even the revival of "wax on wax" is still dead. As for Ironside, he is slightly better than Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith in Part III, but it is hardly a stretch. So is this image really so awful? Inaccurately. There is one succession that can achieve a strange beauty, but when the best piece in the whole film includes a group of Asian monks who dance when they hear pop music for the first time, it does not suggest a recommendation. see rest.
