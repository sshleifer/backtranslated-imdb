In the early 1990s a "step-by-step" came as a boring combination of an ultra-cheese "full house" and a long-defunct string classic hit "Brady Bunch". Of course, the differences between the "Step-by-Step" and the two above-mentioned programs were better writing, excellent comedic timing from almost all of his actors, and many more fun situations that weren't as sugar-coated as it is a very popular predecessor. It is true that even with the great rise in the basic dynamics of the show, and all this has not been exactly spectacular, it was not really so unforgettable in the long line of corny family programming! It could be said that it was a much better time than compared to the cutey "Full House", which raises random migraines and which coincided with the "Step-by-Step" neck and neck running in this time period. in terms of overall popularity. The show, now in syndication of course, is certainly a suitable family-fare, but be sure you don't expect much more than watching.
