It must be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe that people actually a) write scripts like this b) have a budget to make movie c) actually expect to be successful. Words can't even describe how awful the movie is. I like my fair share of teen movies, but it didn't even come close to being funny. In fact, it was fun just because it was so awful. I can probably count one (maybe two) parts in a movie where I even managed to squeeze out laughter (other than laughter, how bad it was). <br /> <br /> Renting was one of the biggest mistakes I made it. It was a day since I saw the movie, and I'm still shocked how horrible it was. Avoid at any cost. <br /> <br /> 2/10
