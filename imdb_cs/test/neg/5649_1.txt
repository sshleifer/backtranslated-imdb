What more can I add? This is undoubtedly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Terrible gaming, conspiracy, boring slow pace - even visible microphones hanging from the top of the screen. I could go on, but I really can't bother. I watched it for 90 minutes before I lost my sense of losing my will to live. <br /> <br /> I can only assume that the first set of comments and voices were from people involved in promoting the game. an insult to British filmmaking. And worst of all, I had to buy mail on Sunday to get it :-) The only reason the DVD wasn't relocated as a track now is that it now boasts a place in my Top 10 worst movie ever collection. Definitely one needs to be avoided.
