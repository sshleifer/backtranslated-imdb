Turd Pie: <br /> <br /> * Take x2 franchises * Par-boil for 5 minutes * Stir in mixed cardboard figures (work best without actors) * Add 2 tons of cliche and then bake in Plot-Hole microwave until you get bored. * Serve with Dawson's Crack Spray (not typo) Voila! - Money spinning Brain Rot for Emo Generation / World of Warcraft <br /> <br /> Looking for Keys in Runoff was the Best Bit (?) <br /> <br /> Except for the first 5 minutes, one of the worst movies ever was made. Utter, Utter, Nonsense.
