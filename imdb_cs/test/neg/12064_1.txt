I'm a fan of slasher movies, especially Scream 1-3, but this is just one kill after another. To my astonishment: Part II is much better and the whole story of a bunch was summed up! So don't waste your time on this one and move directly to Part II, you won't regret it because Part 2 actually has PLOT and is quite self-ironic. First part: 1 of 10 Second part: 4 of 10
