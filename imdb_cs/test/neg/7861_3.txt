During the 1990s, several attempts were made to revive the old Matsumoto series. Yoshinobu Nishizaki tried to revive the old Yamato saga in the form of the ridiculously bad "Yamato 2520", which was completely abandoned for just two episodes. Captain Harlock suffered a confusing and meaningless "Harlock Saga" while the Galaxy Express 999 suffered that this hack movie stitched into his name. <br /> <br /> If you've seen "Queen Millennia", you'll remember that it was an amazing movie in its own way. Maetel Legend tries to say the continuation of this already closed chapter, and also to find a way to suck on it. This film has all the annoying aspects of generic sci-fi pulp movies, mingling with the bad tempo of melodrama, and adding insult to injury, throwing in some of the most famous characters from Matsumot's universe. The only aspect of this movie is a good work of art, but the rest is so amazingly bad that it can't save this film from total loss. <br /> <br /> If you enjoyed the Queen Millennia or Galaxy Express, do yourself a favor and skip this movie. You will thank me.
