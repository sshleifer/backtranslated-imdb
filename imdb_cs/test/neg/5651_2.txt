Flatland is one of my favorite books, so I was looking forward to this movie. Unfortunately, the film is absolutely terrible. Dialogue is so bad that it sounds like improvisation. The new story makes me think that they took a book and a few newspapers, threw them into a blender and used what came out on the script. It's a shame on the book and independent filmmaking. The only reason I managed to get through the movie all the way was my hope that it would be better. Unfortunately, it's just worse, the peak in a really retarded end. That doesn't mean everything is bad about the movie. CG is acceptable, in 1990 it is a "Reboot" way that I suppose is what they were going for. And I think you can't go wrong with "people" who are stuffed in half and blood flies around the place.
