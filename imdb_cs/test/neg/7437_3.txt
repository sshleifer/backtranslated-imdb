That was all right, but really a little disappointing because I was expecting more laughter. Given the storyline and lead actor (Bill Murray), it should be much more fun than it turned out. Only a part of it really made me laugh like Murray lost control of his semifinal and accelerated down the road at a strange angle. (You must see it, appreciate it.) <br /> <br /> The support cast was something other than sympathetic people. Just look at the sample names: Matthew McConaughey, Janeane Garofalo and Linda Fiorentino. Yeah! McConaughey's role here as "Tucker Tip" was simply downright unpleasant. He was the worst. Other that these people, the movie had some charming moments, but overall is not recommended. It's another Disney flop.
