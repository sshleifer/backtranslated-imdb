Bhagam Bhag was a waste of money and time of great time! I wonder how Govinda did this movie? Govinda ... dude ... m your big fan, u have to make the right decisions now when choosing a movie? I was wondering that he had a role in the movie. Johnny Lever could give Govinda's role. Akshay Kumar steals the show! Akshay ... dud u rock! u have created a space in everyone's heart all over the world! Lara Dutta, Tansuhree .... the guys deserve better. Paresh Rawal is good at his funny! overall there were few scenes where I laughed ... otherwise I was just wondering, "yh, did Priyadarshan such a stupid movie?" By the way, wait and watch the upcoming movie.
