Where to start, where to start .... hmmm ... well, how about the hardest, unnatural, incredible and camped shows you can imagine? How about stereotypical "characters", situations and locations? Or what about a manipulative, stupid, utterly miserable scenario? I can't think of one element in this movie that was original, worthy of observation or interesting. Note for you all Josh Hartnett / Chris Klein / LeeLee Sobieski fans - enjoy their collective fifteen minutes, people, because they won't be more famous much longer
