Producers Golan and Globus should be ashamed to publicly publish this piece of waste. I know it will sound clich√©, but compared to the first "Hercules" of 1983 it looks like a mature and exciting epic! This "sequel" is moronic, cheap, invariant, childish, fake, awkward and BADLY ACTED. A landmark in the wrong movie and one of the few movies I've seen that deserves the lowest possible rating: no stars!
