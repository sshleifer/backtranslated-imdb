Telly Savalas has deployed a powerful (but not better than) performance like Pancho Villa, a notorious Mexican bandit / revolutionary in this list of Villa raid on Columbus, New Mexico in 1916. The villa is not really a historical figure I am too familiar with team, so I will not say much about the historical details of the film. It's not great as a movie, though it has both action and humor. The performance of Chuck Connors as Colonel Wilcox, US Army Base Commander near Columbus has surpassed me a little and Clint Walker as Villa Gringo sidekick Scotty didn't do much for me. The film seems to be a very low budget effort of limited technical quality. For a film with a run time of just over an hour and a half, I have to say that this film has dragged in places, especially in the last 20 minutes. Villa's raid on the United States was interesting (if in the overall scheme of things, not particularly important) historical sidebar and probably deserved better treatment than this. 4/10
