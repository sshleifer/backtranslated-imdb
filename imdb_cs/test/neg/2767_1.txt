This movie really sucks. Just try to stay up for 5 minutes while watching this balloon for a pretty girl (Joan Woodbury) who joins the 'underworld' because she needs money (and because she's also lazy to take work from friends after they offered it to her). Alan Ladd was supposed to be the star of this thing, but he's not the first to find him for the first half hour and when he appears, he stands around like a constipation mannequin. A real fool with plenty of fantastic scenes and improbable (as well as stupid) characters who want somebody to shoot someone like he's really fast. Bring your pillow.
