This film is one of the redeemable qualities (except for Ator's barely-covered loincloth), a hilarious performance on the side of a bad guy, Zora. This marvelously overblown villain has a certain ... oh, Shakespeare presence that has made this film bearable (2). I just giggled every time he pirouled, raising his eyebrows incredibly on the followers or hero. A real example of not getting enough. (A to BEARD!) Now, really, what was the 12-minute scene? Really, really, really bad. I can't emphasize that point enough. So, seriously, if you even offend to see this movie, watch the version of Mystery Science Theater 3000. With those expensive silhouettes many horrific movies were tolerated.
