I'm sure any legitimate submarine could happily go to USOS Seaview (yes, SOS ...) Why would you play a torpedo basketball in a torpedo room, it's so big. And how come the bay windows in the bow, the better to see giant squids or minefields that appear out of nowhere? Did I mention the colorful mess with the parrot on the shoulder? And Admiral's quarters with what seems to be an attic? Great bleeding beneath ... <br /> <br /> OK, OK ... never gets any prizes for authenticity. And if sub is laughter, the plot is even worse. Van Allen's belts of radiation, hundreds of miles in space, have "taken fire" and will cause global warming to look like weenie roasts. Pompous Admiral Nelson (Walter Pidgeon), along with his sidekick Lucius (Peter Lorre, looking suitably uncomfortable), hatches the system to fire a rocket firing in the middle. There's a lot of intrigue (sic) along the way, with a reborn survivor (and his little dog, too!) with two "dames" who can never leave enough alone, a passel "red shirt" who They are expendable, and the plot of the hole big enough for Godzilla passes. The excitement of Seaview chasing what looks like 60 miles per hour, another sub - no need for advanced sonar when you can watch 100 feet back. The film takes care of one reef on another cliff; the payback is so anticlimactic as being absurd, definitely not worth 1 hour and 50 minutes waiting. A technical adviser for this shipwreck had to be a 14-year-old boy with a stack of popular mechanics magazines. It is worth watching if just a riff.
