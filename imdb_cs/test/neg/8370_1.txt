it's really a big deal that people are easily able to shoot movies because of cheap digital video cameras. I usually appreciate this option, but if you see movies like this, it's a great pity. and it's also a great shame when people like h.p. lovecraft is abused by similar ones. I rented this "movie" from a drop of "h.p. lovecraft" on it. and I'm a big fan of many of his adaptations, especially those performed by brian yuzna & stuart gordon. this movie has nothing to add! cheap scenery on the beach and in the old wine cellar. digi-cam effect "red light" throughout the film. No actors, just some stupid low-grade models who don't know what they're doing, tough as wood. and so must be the director. Obviously, he was trying to create an atmosphere. but as the whole thing is so ridiculous, it just doesn't work. and no gore-effects, just some blood in the river (you drink = become a demon) and fall back and forth. oh yeah, story: a thousand years ago some "great old" colonized the world and took people like slaves. then humanity gained independence, so the "old" tried to destroy them. and now there are some survivors in the post-apocalyptic world. the only way to save mankind is to find NECRONOMICON, which gets to LOVECRAFT. so these soldiers fight some undead and demons on their beach and in their wine cellar. incredible - the whole thing! But as it is dubbed (German title: "Armee des Jenseits") and you can find it in most commercial video-stores, it seems that you can make money with such things.
