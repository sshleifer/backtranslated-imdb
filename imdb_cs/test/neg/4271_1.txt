total crap. I was so excited to see it because it's the only movie version I've seen in Mansfield Park. During the first four episodes I suffered, but when he came to the scene with a proposal between Henry and Fanny, I barked and had to turn it off. Whoever uses this Sylvester Le Touzel lady must be blind and deaf because a woman is the worst actress I've ever seen in my life. The whole thing is just bad, bad, bad. I don't know. I just don't know why the people who write Jane Austen's script seem to be unable to give her the work she deserves.
