No Holds Barred is the movie that when you were nine or ten was the best movie of this party, arnold schwarzenegger. But then, when he grows up and watches, you feel embarrassed that you were so trusting that you liked it. You feel cheated, embarrassed and stupid. If you have a little brother and you show it to him and he tells you he is gay, give him a five and take him to the bar for eleventh birthday.
