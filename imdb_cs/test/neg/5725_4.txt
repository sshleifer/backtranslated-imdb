This film was released shortly after Conan's films, a kind of female Conan, Red Sonja starring Sylvester Stallones ex-wife Brigitte Nielsen. Not a very good actress, unfortunately, as it turned out in Rocky IV and Cobra. The whole film feels cheap, but strangely Arnold Swarzenegger appears in this movie, but not as Conan, even though he looks, acts and fights like Conan from two Conan movies, I don't know what it is about. Anyway, it only appears about every twenty minutes and doesn't stay long. Maybe Arnold was filming in his free time from shooting Conan Destroyer or something? The film is so slow and boring for an action movie, skip it and watch Conan barbarian instead.
