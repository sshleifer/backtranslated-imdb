If you've seen Atlantis 1, then you know that what made the movie really great was brilliant animation and a good script. This film was so carelessly drawn and animated. The story is also dopey. I was so disappointed with this half-baked drive that I couldn't do the first hour, and I tried it! One thing this film had was the fact that it extended the character of "mole", which made it both sympathetic and three-dimensional. Take it from me, judge this waste from the video box packaging. The envelope is poorly drawn by Disney schlock, clearly grabbing for easy money from an unsuspecting parent. If it were a separate film, it wouldn't be so bad, but riding a jacket of a brilliant piece like Atlantis is absolutely inexcusable.
