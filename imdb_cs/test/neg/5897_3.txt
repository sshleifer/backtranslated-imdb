I tried. Sir, help me as I tried. But there are only some people who are unable to create quality. Brett Ratner, Uwe Boll, Britney Spears and Asylum. To their credit "The 9/11 Commission Report" seems to be an honest attempt by the company to advance into a more sophisticated storytelling and filmmaking. But for all intents and purposes, it comes as another really movie in their gallery. When opening a disclaimer, the audience will be alerted that all names have been changed, but the names of the terrorists remain relatively the same. A man named Mussaui is trying to learn to fly by plane. With a stone cool grimace that would immediately make anyone worry, this "secret" agent is able to learn to fly on a small computer. And you have to wonder not how he could get into this program so easily, but how these people didn't even ask; because this scene is so far out in its presentation and the actor playing this man is extremely above the top. And you can see that director Scott is trying to emulate Paul Greengrass with a clear grainy photograph, followed by a terribly dizzying and irritating manual lead attempting to take off from the gerilla techniques of the Greengrass gangs. . Scott can emulate Greengrass's technique for realism, but he becomes somewhat grim in the middle of the road. Meanwhile, the film reflects less than "takeoff" and more "back" Order "in which we have a statement that tells us that the names have been changed, the logo almost resembles the" Law and Order "logo and then ninety minutes of actors who draw chest and discussing politics. Neither of them is as convincing as they are trying to be, and then when the film seems to be trying to be an adult drama, Scott relies on his old security, the sex scene Scott's new film seems to really want to be thought of as a low budget "Munich" but it's not, and it will be overwhelming on any such opportunity possible. flat, because it's limited by its efforts to imitate other movies. <br /> <br /> Although I appreciate the ambition behind the camera, this new view of the events leading up to 9/11 is flat and boring. Hard as it can to be a low budget "munich" is just as fun as the normal Dolph Lundgren movie you find on Cinemax.
