He laughed at my ass, but probably because I was stoned. That aside ... this is by no means a horror movie, there is no horror at all in this whole movie and the plot holes are so vast that even a below average IQ person would think it was stupid. Besides living in Denmark and I'm a lifetime and I can assure you that Denmark is too small a country you need GPSS and maps to find your way back if you are lost. I estimate that if you didn't really hesitate, you could never be further away from the city or other people than a maximum of 3 hours on foot. Secondly, I don't think any part of the film, apart from two shots from Copenhagen where none of the actors were, was actually recorded in Denmark. Swamp woman speaks Swedish not Danish. The helmet on the first body is completely new. The girl they find in the forest is hidden under a rock that does not exist in Denmark. That's just stupid.
