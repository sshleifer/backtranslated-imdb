What I came up with with this film was guilty of conscience. The film itself has a somewhat interesting plot and premise line, but unfortunately it is a movie that you can't watch with being bombarded with pornography. If you plan on viewing this and have a moral problem with degrading your marriage act for viewing audience pleasure then you're making a big mistake. This is not a movie type with token sex scene that you can skip on your DVD player. Near the beginning of the film, Baldwin's character is a video recording of his sexual abuse without his partner's knowledge. This tape and more like that still appear throughout the movie in unpredictable times. It seems the film is trying to make a statement about the dignity of women. Ironically, they did several women in prostitutes. I just gave it 2 instead of 1 because it would better handle Baldwin's promiscuity, it would be an interesting movie.
