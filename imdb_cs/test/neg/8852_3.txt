I was so excited to finally watch "Pulse" after receiving it from Amazon, and I must say that I was totally disappointed. Maybe I think I was too excited. I had expectations that his fans couldn't meet. After loving other Asian horrors, I thought I knew this would find a place in my heart. The story was slow, painful. I'm a diverse fan of horror. I love the brutal, bloody insanity "The Devil's Rejects" and I like the equally stable, growing macarade "The Story of Two Sisters". "Pulse" offered only a few of the two spectrum, unfortunately. Along with the slow progress he was also very confused. I had no idea why the characters were doing what they were doing and how they would help their problem. The director seemed to have shot a conspiracy in a sentence or two and the rest was unprofessional from our actors. Unlike the "Two Sisters Story", which also has a relatively hard-to-follow plot line, "Pulse" at the end makes very little and leaves me feeling frustrated, confused and uninterested in the characters' efforts. My final conspiracy statement was his mismatch. At first it seemed that the story was that the world of spirits was overflowing and their medium of escape was the internet. That's a damn original idea. I like it. But as plot conspiracies, conspiracy holes, and inexplicable events that behave in their heads, the director seems to have switched to an apocalyptic story (as is clear from the end) that was not clear enough throughout the process to be made. I realize the roughness of the shots and settings was deliberate to make the viewer feel bleak and isolated, but the film's numbness was only amplified by a grainy, dark environment. I admit that there was a sense of surrealism with the film, but that may be my attention that disappears in and out. The actions of some characters are also a bit ridiculous, and maybe if I were fascinated by the story, I would be able to suspend more infidelity, but I was also unmotivated as well as some characters. As I mentioned, the logic of what some characters did was lacking and contributed to the conspiracy mismatch. Maybe it was the result of a conspiracy mismatch that makes the characters questionable. To be honest, I don't care. The meeting was decent. Definitely nothing special but also terrible. No outliers that could be mentioned brilliant or obviously terrible on both sides. Now I will stop sounding so sour and mention that there were a handful of ghostly moments. One towards the end, especially that if it were more, I would have enjoyed this (almost) movie. I thought whenever the website turned out to be quite worrying, as were some scary encounters with our two main characters. Things that continued between these spooky run-ins were just too bland, confused, and "WTF" for me to really appreciate. Now for something about the DVD itself ... Magnolia's release of "Pulse" comes with subtitles, yes, but subtitles are off. "They don't say character at the right time. -picking, but that bothered me a bit and it can bother some others. I think it's the only American release in North America, so either you have to watch or watch dubbing (NEVER DUBBING !!!) I tried to love the movie, really I wanted this movie to live with hype ... but unfortunately it fell for me If you are looking for other scary Asian cinema, I can recommend "Audition", "Shutter", "A Tale of Two Sisters", "Strange Circus" "and" Marebito "- it's all my palette.
