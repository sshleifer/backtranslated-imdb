I won't spoil your surprise by mentioning any of the nasty plot lines, I'll just say that this movie suffers from poor animation, through acting, obvious brand lines? These are some good features. If you are abandoned on an isolated island and the only connection with the civilization you have is to throw this fish on. I can't tell you how sorry I saw this horrible horrible movie. Speaking of this, this movie is a horror film that cannot be classified as such for the simple fact that the only horror in the film is the playing ability of some actors. <br /> <br /> Be careful.
