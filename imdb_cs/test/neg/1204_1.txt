A teenage boy who is not in the army and is not trained to be a jet pilot, starts in a foreign country to save his father. If it's not ridiculous enough, he talks to the Colonel in the Air Force to help him get his hands on the nozzle [wow!]. To make the picture even more absurd, the Colonel risks his career and life by giving his slave boy his hands to help. It doesn't mean the Colonels won't do that anymore, but they never did. This handy, corny film should be thrown into the air and blown away by MIG.
