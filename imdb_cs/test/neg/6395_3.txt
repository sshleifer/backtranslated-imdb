This film should be called Blame it on the Script. Directed by: Stanley Donen, Singin 'in the Rain of Fame, this cellulose midlife crisis is not all bad. There are a few exuberant scenes from Rio de Janeiro and various innumerable accessories that meet each other and run around the beach to the stifling sounds of samba, but there's just something about how to look at something fifty something of Michael Caine. you feel ... well, lean. This story is also a complete story. No one but the perverse and futile old studios in Hollywood could have covered this embarrassment in green. Perhaps they are so accustomed to having young bimbo-like sweets that forget that it's their thick wallet that keeps the key to their attraction, not their big Larry King-style sunglasses, and the yellow cigars. Is it one thing for a young good-bye to take care of an older man, but about the father of his best friend who becomes married? And then shamefully stand up to him? Ugh! There's nothing funny about that. It is rather pathetic and grotesque. Notice the hopeful young Demi Moore * coughs *.
