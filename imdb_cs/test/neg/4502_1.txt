After many years as a fan of Godzilla, Gamera was a cheap knockoff for me, who took advantage of the success of Toho's # 1 kaiju. ATTACK OF MONSTERS was at that time (1975) an almost painful viewing experience. Last weekend I attended the annual Godzilla Festival, known as G-FEST, where Carl Craig, one of the world's most famous players. stars vs. GAMERA VIRAS, appeared. Of course, this movie. It was one of the strangest bad movies ever made. Of course, you have to be in the true spirit to look at it. In one scene, for example, boy scouts have held prisoners aboard an alien spacecraft to escape by scattering not too bright aliens. When they realize that "they have been deceived, one of them says," That's funny ... I think the kids lied to us. "Even this PLAN NINE FROM THE EXTERNAL SPACE can't boast such a dialogue. It doesn't have to be GODZILLA or even GAMERA 3, but this is a decent enough time if you look at it in the right mind." br /> <br /> However, if you want top quality Kaiju entertainment, check out the recently released GAMERA 3 game. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** 1/2 of *****
