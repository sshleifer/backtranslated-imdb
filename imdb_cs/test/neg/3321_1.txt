I remember the hype about this movie when Aaliyah was killed. Being a fan of Mrs. Rice's novels, my first thought was "how can they do Queen Of The Damned without first making Vampire Lestat?" <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I see how they did it. it. If you have read these books, imagine removing the bloody parts of Vampire Lestat, cramming Marcus and Mary into one character, and removing everything that starts with Lestat (wolf hunting, his violin play, the Vampire Theater, and Louis, Claudia and Gabrielle), then in the last 15 minutes they're stretching in Queen Of The Damned. What we lose is a very important piece of Lestat's character. His inner suffering that he had to kill, live, the fact that he was carefully trying to pick killers as his victims, and his love hate relationship with Louis, Armando, Gabrielle and all the other vampires. It is also important that we lose the "Twins Story", which is Genesis of Mrs. Rice's vampires. And while I'm sure that cannibalism should be showing intensely on the screen, they could do something closer and show us more ancient Egypt. Worse yet, this love interest is thrown between Jessie and Lestat. Vampire Chronicles is essentially the American story of Yoni. For those who do not know, Yoni is another form of Hentai (Japanese porn comics). But in Yoni it is a homosexual male relationship that a woman has said. Although I'm sure many men object to the "homosexuality" of the characters, they went to the opposite end in this film. Instead of pursuing murderers, Lestat goes after young female groups. And other shortcomings in logic and story are huge. Initially Lestat emerges from a hundred-year-old sleep, and later asks Maria how to get red velvet over the 1950s. Marius has no idea who Elvis is and says he was asleep at the time. You are wondering how Lestat knows about 50 years of fashion and music because he was alone in the same time period. And nothing about Louis, Claudia or Gabrielle. I think it's a great pity. It's like seeing "Snow White and 3 Dwarfs". <br /> <br /> Overall, I thought the movie was really bad. The only good thing about it was the soundtrack. Most of the games were bad, the accents led me to the wall and all the really deep parts of the book were removed, leaving us with a hollow shell like Enkil after being sucked. If you want to see a good modern vampire movie, get the Lost Boys, the original vampire interview, or even some old Dark Shadows episodes. Leave this one rest in a piece, with a nail over your heart, a clove of garlic around your neck, and a bottle of holy water in your mouth. When you finish, remember that before killing Aaliyah it was intended to go directly to the video, no theatrical release was planned. It is now clear why this was the case. It is only sad that someone who is so talented that he will be remembered for this dog movie, instead of where he could really shine. <br /> <br /> I rate 2 on a scale of 1-10.
