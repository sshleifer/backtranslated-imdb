If justice were in the cosmic universe, director Lewis Schoenbrun could never re-enter the film set. It would seem impossible for anyone who has spent two decades in the editorial office, where the LS started his film career, to be so completely free from any sense of stimulation or dramatic production, but this film is a damned proof. How bad it is, it's fascinating. From the opening scene, where the nurse is dressed in a suit suitable only for a porn movie or a parody on a Mexican variety, the viewer is forced to see how low it can go. The answer is not far away, as we move to a funeral parlor in the next scene, where another stunning fashion message comes in a sexy black dress worn by one of the mourners. <br /> <br /> Aggressively inappropriate costumes are not the only film shortage. Dialogue is a pleasure for bad writing experts. "You turn my tears into wine," is an example jewel. The actor deserves an Oscar for having a straight face. <br /> <br /> The director reinforces every scene with a cheesy style that is perhaps the most beautiful soundtrack he has ever recorded, which is reflected in the embarrassment of dialogue scenes to cheesy. groovebox wannabe rocknroll in transient scenes. <br /> <br /> The script introduces characters without rhyme or reason, and the beats of the story spread out as if it were a broken ladle. "Horror" movie. Our characters find themselves in the woods where Dr. Chopper and his two "scary" henchwomenky are supposed to be some kind of Frankencreatures, but they look exactly like the Valley Fake Blood Girls who wiped out under their Supercut Shards. I honestly saw a more frightening make-up on eight-year-old children on a trick or treat on Halloween. Again, we get a whiff of a stinking costume designer, like Valley Ghoul One prances around in a pseudo-Victorian polyblend cloak, while her friend wears a non-writing set that could be almost fashionable in almost the 80s. Dr. <br /> <br /> Chopper makes a great fashion statement though, looking like a Crisco cowboy who got lost in the woods on his big black Harley, dressed from head to toe in a black S&M leather zipper. <br /> <br /> If it sounds interesting, check all the resources. There is a lot of lateral distribution and dialogue (like the rare scene of the "ivory cemetery" or "intellectual" discourse on Ginsburg). To be fair, cinematography is good, considering what has been inserted. in front of the camera, and the actors are trying (with wildly extreme results) to make some of the scrap pile of clich√©s and inanities. You have to wonder if they were really stupid or just blindly desperate not to walk out of the set after grabbing one look at the ridiculous looking bad guys with 99 Cent Store guns.
