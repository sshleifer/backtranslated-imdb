Maybe it's just the format of this movie, the documentary, but I believe the film would be much better if good actors and a more solid dialogue were served. The fact that actors are also entrepreneurs is a double-edged sword. They know better than anyone else, the emotions and complexity of the business they were in, but because they are not professional actors, they do a very bad job of passing on these emotions and the document suffers. There were really unforgettable scenes and lots of good lines in this movie, but they were delivered so badly that they disappear with time and the only memory I will have in this document is that it has some good scenes I can't remember. Watch this if you want the bust of the .com to come first and find out what happened to 99% of the people in the industry who didn't become instant millionaires. However, be prepared for some naughty work with the camera, bad behavior, bad dialogue and a bad film overall that embodies the internet boom era.
