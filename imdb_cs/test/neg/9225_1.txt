If there's anything worse than this movie, I don't want to see it. I remember so many wonderful things - a nun fell out of her coffin and made a raft for a little blond boy; the little blond worshiped like a god; plenty of footage from Peru as an ideal vacation spot. Shining Path and Alberto Fujimori should omit any idea that Peru is a holiday paradise. The whole thing is so terrible that Plan 9 or Robot Monster is compared to aesthetics. This film should be bombed and beaten and bombed again.
