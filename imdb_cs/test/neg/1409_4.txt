I was aware of the critical masters of Man of the Year and the extraordinary rude, but I was prepared to give the film the benefit of doubt, because I know that good photos may fall under the radar during a crowded release program in the fall months. <br /> <br /> I found that the movie is surprisingly unspspired. The surprise is underestimated when we consider Barry Levinson's gift for political satire (demonstrated in Vietnam Good Morning and Wag the Dog) and the obvious comic gifts of Robin Williams. In fact, Robin Williams is mysteriously underestimated. On "Making Of" featurette, which comes with the DVD, Barry Levinson talked about how he ever let Robin Williams improvise from the script as if it were some of his naughty secrets. Are you really such a big fool, Barry Levinson? Whenever you have Robin Williams in your movie and want to use it for his comic abilities (basically any movie that was in a movie other than Insomnia or One Hour Photo), don't put it in the script. Let him ad-lib what he wants because he is more entertaining for him than anything else he can write for him, and his uncomplicated comic screams can instantly raise the bar to some average movie like RV or Patch Adams. What I found to be even more confused in his failure to avail Robin Williams was that in 1987, Levinson used this exact formula to perfection in Vietnam Good Morning, injecting Robin Williams' bursts of comic zaniness into a war image to make a loud political So The movie is not as much laugh-fest as it could be and feels embarrassed lost in its tone. If the film had the chance to work as anything, it could be one of those mid-1990s thrillers in The Pelican Brief, The Fugitive, or one of those films by Jack Ryan. His conspiracy centered on Silicon Valley employees, which revealed a system malfunction that reveals that the country has chosen the wrong president and CEOs' efforts to remove it before the secret site gets out, so if you replaced Robin Williams with some Harrison - The Ford-type actor, or perhaps Harrison Ford himself, added a few more blasts, and maybe that's where the movie tried to go. I never really know, and it's not worth trying to find out.
