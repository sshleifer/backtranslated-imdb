they (dueringer, dorfer) are good stand-up comics, young, not ugly, have money, girls love them, viewers appreciate everything they do there <br /> <br /> and then make this movie ... <br no story at all, some jokes were old in the fifties, acting is terrible. save money for something useful as a gift to your girlfriend.
