This movie amused me with a lot of laughter on the actors who kept the movie moving in all kinds of crazy directions. If you like the suggestive language and sexy looking girls were all in the picture and the girls and guys all look burned out before they even graduate from high school. There is one scene where teenagers drive their car into a very fake deer and then continue to toss it into a lake or ocean that repeats over and over. There is no horror to this film except the word Horrible for the whole picture and Arnold, who plays a plastic cop is really one sick character. Don't waste your time watching this movie.
