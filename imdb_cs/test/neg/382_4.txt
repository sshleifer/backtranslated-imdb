Starting with Fulci playing version of himself, writing some ideas on how people could die. There was a fake-looking cat that is probably the brain. The copy I watched was dubbed in English, which I always hated, but I was particularly disappointed that I hadn't heard Fulci in his own voice. Fulci is in a kind of feverish state that works on his latest horror movie. His stomach turns when he sees things that resemble his film, and begins to hallucinate that he is witnessing acts of horror. She visits a psychiatrist who hypnotizes him and unfortunately does not have better mental health. I was alerted to a psychiatrist playing David Cronenberg in Clive Barker Nightbreed (1990). The collision in this game is played by David L. Thompson, who is pretty bad. Probably the real life friend of Fulci, he has a big toothy smile when he kills people, although it may be Fulci's black humor at work that I thought was pretty poor too. The film is made up of lots of Fulci movie clips, either as if Fulci is on the stage of directors, watching TV recordings or witnessing acts. I've never been a fan of TV show clips, and I also think that things like Full Moon Entertainment by Charles Band, who have cut their old movies down and put together three such cuts as new anthologies, are lame. I think they need to make money? The collision in Cat in the Brain refers to the theory that violence in movies produces violence in real life. One of Fulci's collaborators talks about having a documentary staff that follows Fulci to see what his life is like. Lots of self-reference things like this. Finally, some characters sail on a ship called "Perversion."
