The limited views of the scenery were the only saving grace for the otherwise uneven and boring film. The game was borderline absurd, which I blamed for the script and the script. Nicole Eggert did not look at the part, did not do the role and was utterly unconvincing as a mountain guide. After watching I stayed with the feeling that some friends had some free time and decided to make a movie. It had to be created from the pocket change budget. The storyline was thin at best, and occasionally asked the question to be asked with a low gaming calibration: "Why are we doing this?" I managed to sit around the movie, but I also asked, "Why?"
