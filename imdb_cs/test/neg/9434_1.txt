Can there be the worst movie? Even Ed Wood couldn't come up with something so bad with his terrible worst. Cheesy, stupid, long-lasting, pointless ... and that's good points. I saw this waste back in the early 1980s when I was incredibly bored that I started, and actually I sat the whole thing without getting my brain out, though it was probably a more enjoyable experience. I actually remembered it because it was so bad. It is sad for me, because some of the best directors got their start by making TV films (ie Spielberg) and it was a wonderful way for them to get their original material out of the public, but bullshit like this was completely killed the whole process.
