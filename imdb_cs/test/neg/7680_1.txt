There are bad movies, movies that are horrible, and then there's a small, spoiled body of movies that are so terribly bad that even if they saw them only once, sheer horror makes it impossible to forget them even decades later. This is exactly such a movie and it's hard to believe that the original movie in this series was actually pretty good. Let's see, George Kennedy, a mechanic of the smoldering "hard guy" of the original, has somehow been promoted to captain of the airline, and after the Concorde is under rocket attack (not asking), he resorts to pieces like gunpowder from the cockpit window despite (probably) flying to Mach 2, under all circumstances, doing wild high G evasive maneuvers that would tear the wings off any real airliner, regardless of the effect of the passengers! But the absolute worst part of the film, at least aircraft enthusiasts like me, is that this cruelty "played" one of the most amazing, most sexy and technologically distinctive aircraft ever to fly. The Concorde (or, simply plain "Concorde" as its pilots refer to it) deserves much better, this outrage is equivalent to taking high class beauty like Audrey Hepburn and putting it in "Porky" sequel. Fortunately, the release of the ever hilarious "Airplane!" The following year brought the entire "airport" franchise to a well-deserved stop, because someone even contemplates a fifth installment would laugh at the death of the studio and movie fans alike. <br /> <br /> 1/10
