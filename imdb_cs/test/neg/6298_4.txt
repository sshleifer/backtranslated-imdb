Terence Stamp can take anything, but it's still a shallow one-dimensional film. It's nice to watch - so are the actors - and if you're in drag queens, I think you'd like it a lot, but the storyline and characters are just as thin as cardboard. It is one of those politically correct films that distort everything else so that the "minority lifestyle" seems warm and cuddly. He gets a lot of miles from a bitter dialogue that is fun in this disinfected form. Ninety per cent of the action is marching in gaudy costumes in disparate situations. Dramatic content is a symbolic pendant - hardly trying to get you to take it seriously.
