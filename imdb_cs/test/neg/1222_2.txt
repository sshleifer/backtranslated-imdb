It would be a shame if Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval have ever seen this film because they are likely to be associated with it in the coming years. "Oh yeah", the public will say, "Comanche Moon" is the Texas Rangers mini series and the Comanche Indians who played Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duval. I think it was a comedy, but not a very funny comedy, I don't really understand why they agreed with her. That would be such an injustice that the original "Lonesome Dove" was a real Western classic and this Turkish bomb is a real bomb, and Jones and Duval will remember it.
