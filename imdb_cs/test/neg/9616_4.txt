*** SPOILERS *** *** SPOILERS *** What's going on here? Barbara Hershey, who is definitely unsexy - as if she had stolen her grandmother's spare wig - puts her in unconvincing performance as a woman who killed a man's wife with whom she had a self-defense affair after hitting forty odd times with an ax. Like Lizzy Borden, she is also freed, but after the most unconvincing argument she has ever given to a jury representative of a supposedly "innocent" defendant I have ever seen. Lizzy Borden took the ax and gave her father forty shots when she saw what she had done - begging self defense <br /> <br /> I don't think it's so <br /> <br /> Defendant I find guilty of examining an unconventional view and have no choice but to grant this movie sentence 4 out of 10 (which would be lower, but because of the good behavior of some of them) <br /> <br />
