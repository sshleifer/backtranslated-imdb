I was quite excited to see this film in a competition at the Montreal Film Festival. Together with Elephant and a few others, I thought that the issue of American violence / culture would be solved intelligently and in a fashionable spirit that would be convincing for the audience. The press release promised (not so many words) a "Red Violin" for a crowd of armed violence, which would make us think about our NRA-shoot-em-up attitude in this country. After we waited until 9:15 to sit on the 9AM screenings (which technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me), we were finally released to the venue to see a movie on DV (where 35MM printing was advertised?. I think I just answered my first question. <br /> <br /> The result is a nasty mess. We'll get a "gun" in the vignette with the most realistic "biker" I've ever seen he saw (and I know more than a few) the film then disappears into an irrelevant "character development" simply because the characters are either stereotyped, b. losers, c. stereotyped losers, and / or d. they get into the conspiracy movement, and once we are there, we wish to be among the couples and / or Cyclists and Infantry Brokers. Inexperienced minority characters should immediately order NAACP to cry l and all these people would chase after a gun because they are at the bottom of the social waste and are looking for an opportunity where they are. at least he would provide a little soul on the side of the characters. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem is the unfulfilled promise. The plot of the plot was great. In the hands of P.T. Anderson or Gus Van Zandt could have been a powerful piece. But either because of the wrong script, direction or both, the thing is an incredible mess that must be ignored at all costs. <br /> <br /> My bigger question is who at the IFF thought it was a competition material. Better Burying at Showtime at 3:00. <br /> <br /> Art Blose
