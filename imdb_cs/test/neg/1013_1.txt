Naked Deanna Troi! Richie's brother Chuck (from "Happy Days") with reverse mohawk! Death of Wish 3 has all this and more, including one clever scene where Chuck Bronson stands up. a mousetrap as a device that punk your brain when a window opens. Chuck also places a plate of bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles as he returns and sees the bloody traces leading away. All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it's one of the most sensible "serious" movies I've ever seen - loaded into the handle with chaos and almost no police response, despite the use of military Weapons To Cut Punks Down By Score. As I understand it, Bronson denied this movie, but happily passed a check from Golan Globus. <br /> <br /> If you like quality movies, avoid this, but if you're in for a cheap "Jackass" kind of excitement, check it out.
