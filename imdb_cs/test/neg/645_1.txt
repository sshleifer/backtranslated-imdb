The first thing that hit me in this movie was a terrible deal. The whole cast was so unanimously unanswered that they got their lines that I started laughing in the frightening dialogue in the middle of the movie. An even bigger problem with this movie is that we will never find out what motivates the actions of each character at any time. One somewhat redeeming aspect of the film is the innovative visual effects of Halfdan Hussey. However, as eye-catching as they can be, they do little to cope with the gaping shortcomings mentioned above. A horrible scenario mixed with community theater acting does not mean enjoyable watching. I was sincerely shocked at how bad this movie was.
