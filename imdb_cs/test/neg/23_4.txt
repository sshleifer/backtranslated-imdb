When people say that kids are annoying u think ya my little cousins ​​can be annoying and I said LITTLE. These kids turn 10 years and are no doubt the worst fraternal children you'll ever meet (in the movie). Let's Get Started With Blond - Debbie - She's a Whore Girl, I Think She Comes Wearing a Mini Skirt, She Has Silly Curly Blonde Hair and Freckled Red Bunny as a Face. It works so innocently. Next we have a second child - Geek - who thinks he's so cool with his long distance shooting and using a muffler (a coat over the gun) and most of his evil brothers smile. The next guy is the quiet one you don't care about, so it's all on him. This movie annoyed me with the intelligence of the children, and the only joy I got was from my cousin, who was still biting about them.
