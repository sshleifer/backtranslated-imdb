I saw about five or six episodes of this silly show and most of them I was forced to watch. And I didn't like the episodes I saw. What happened to Dan Schneider? After giving us such amazing shows as Drake and Josh, why did he decide to make such a stupid show? My problem isn't just with Dan, it's also with the guys who nominated this Emmy show, were drunk that day, or what's the problem? Drake and Josh were not nominated for Emmy, but it's better than Zoey 101. The creators of this show should be ashamed of the existence of this show, hopefully the pregnancy you know will affect the show, or better still cause it to be canceled.
