I understand the draw and appeal to such a different type of film and I am a huge admirer of films with little dialogue, but the same is absolutely awful. I was in the Scottish Highlands and found that the lack of Scottish accents in the characters failed. This storyline was strong enough in theory, but cheap sets and the lack of a single realistic character kept this film from leaving the country. I feel that the use of silence to create an atmosphere only works if you have actors who can radiate a presence without speaking, and these actors will surely outweigh. If you want a silent movie that captures the present, try it (Le Dernier Combat). There were very few movies that I couldn't even handle to finish, and it was one of them. Absolute dribbling!
