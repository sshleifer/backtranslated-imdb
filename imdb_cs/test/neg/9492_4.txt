Douglas Sirk is an inaugural "female image" crying for Universal, based on the preaching, dogmatic, didactic novel by Intolerable Lloyd C. Douglas (author of that other beloved piece crap, * Robe *). Rock Hudson, in a role that catapulted him to fame, is played by Bob Merrick, a drunken playboy, behind countless millions of people who are more interested in chasing skirts and racing boats than completing his medical degree. In the first scene, he scrapped his ship on the sumptuously photographed lake. The accident almost kills Merrick, and so requires a somewhat mysterious "resuscitation machine" to keep him alive. . . Meanwhile, through the city, beloved surgeon Dr. Phillips finally falls dead from heart condition. Since a local hospital can only maintain one resuscitator at a time, Phillips dies to live. When Merrick learns about it, he tries to make an apologetic overture to the Phillips families, especially the widow (Jane Wyman, dressed and dressed in hauteur graduation), but to everyone who knows the surgeon spits in Merrick as a cobra brace. One physician on hospital staff even calls it "utter waste" that the Playboy lived as a surgeon like Christ. Hippocrates could say something about it! These early scenes are typical of the typical Sirkian iconoclasm: the director shakes his face so much in the middle class inconvenience, mid-century America that man finds himself rooting for a playboy garbage to put irritated pillows under ramrod fannies of these moral hypocrites. But, unfortunately, no: the terrible plot of the novel must continue, and Merrick will soon find himself transformed by God, in the mask of the inflated Otto Kruger, an artist who claims that Phillips made him a better man and even better. painter. (Why don't we see any of this amazing art?) We'll learn that the unbearably ubiquitous Dr. Phillips would often refuse to pay for the medical services provided (though he is never clearly stated for these "wonderful exceptions"). This is to give our hero a whole new perspective on life and an example of personal behavior. Kruger even tries to make it all very illegal in an exciting way: "Once you start this thing, there's no way! It's an obsession ... CAUSED by obsession!" So Merrick tries to try to make the widow annoying, but somehow causes her to get into the car. He loses sight. It seems that Merrick will have several other stations - on-the-cross to crawl around before he can be a decent colleague. However, Sirk is still creeping when the film grows more and more. preach. The most obvious piece must be the presence of Agnes Moorehead as a nurse and Wyman's friend and an unrepeatable lesbian lover. Notice the disappointment on Moorehead's face when Merrick, finally redeemed as a doctor, shows that he will save Wyman's life near the end. Hudson's homosexuality, an open secret in Hollywood at the time, is also used to great ironic effect. He and Wyman - dowdy and fifteen years older - generate absolutely zero erotic warmth in their scenes together, which, by the way, is deliberately little, presumably because other star scenes would hopelessly reveal this whole business. (One thing we feel confident about: if Rock Hudson was obsessed with something, it wasn't Jane Wyman.) It's a chronic case of tea and sympathy. Sirk seemed to enjoy the tuning of all his noses by letting this gay actor, who was attractive to the innocent ladies of that time, flew coldly through these beautifully colored "feminine images". In fact, the director worked with Hudson 6 or 7 times, best following this film, * Everything Heaven Allows * to reconnect Hudson with Wyman but was also accompanied by realistic conspiracy. Meanwhile, we must endure God / Kruger, who is looking out of the observation window at Merrick and his medical team as they prepare to save Wyman's life, in tandem with the sword singing score of the Hollywood choir cheesy. But to see why Sirk is considered an author, look at the scene where Wyman explains to his adult daughter that he can actually make a difference from night and day. The whole skeleton is black here: the daughter is barely visible and Wyman's face is faintly engraved against the faint light. He says he hates the night because "I know Dawn will never come again". A great, cool moment that deserves a much better film than the * Magnificent Obsession *. <br /> <br /> 4 stars out of 10.
