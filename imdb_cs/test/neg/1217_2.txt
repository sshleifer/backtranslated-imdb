Zzzzzzzzzzzz. This one came directly from the "Cutters" form that appeared in "Jaws" with some other bizarre clichés. I was wondering when there was still something in the book about Italian horror movies, and wow ... I think I got what I deserved! The very slow moving and powerful movie of the killer shark takes place on the ground, which is not so surprising. The shark's only method seems to be through shark shots in the aquarium. Shark is never in the same frame as any of the actors, and it's too bad ... most characters are so annoying that you actually want them to eat. "Storyline" refers to a group of four children who someday meet a mysterious Indian on the beach while weenies roast. The Indian, for some reason, gives them an ancient artifact that allows them to follow the ancient evil that took the form of a monster shark attacking their tribe ... reportedly because they were too good at fishing the ocean and the ocean god \ t . Or something like that. It's also a good thing because you don't know ... a few years later, a monster shark appears and begins to devour people in a sleepy coastal community. When one of the four boys eats a shark, the other three are determined to kill the thing ... especially because (big shock) the authorities killed the shark and thought the threat was over. Yawning. Mandatory death scenes are incredibly tedious and you can see they come a mile away (my favorite was a girl who fights with her boyfriend while sitting in a van, then jumps up and says, "I'm going to swim," immediately waiting for the shark). They had a lot of nerves that called this movie "Deep Blood" because you barely see any, just overcast water. Actors handle their cliché roles, such as all inches, and there is even a jolly subplot involving greasy rocker bad boy who threatens our good-natured heroes and eventually fits to help kill the shark. It took me a long time to find this movie, it's a bit dark, so I don't think too many people are at risk. However, if you are to be tempted ... don't say you weren't warned!
