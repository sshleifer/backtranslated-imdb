The movie is annoying. <br /> <br /> Technically, there are many times that you see fuzzy and very sharp scenes. You could easily get a cleaner movie using a decent amateur camera and 100 $ video editing software. On the ground, a man on the street doesn't mean sloppy haircut. Unclassified scenes that do not contain an important statement should be deleted. The same applies to ensuring that the object's head / hand / others remain in the frame. My eight year old son knows now. <br /> <br /> The movie is too long. The main point (against globalization) is understood after 30 minutes to bother with everyone else. After talking to James Suckling, I pressed the "stop" button. What time pass. <br /> <br /> The main theme doesn't work for me anymore. I have seen too many small wineries that produce average, commercialized wines and many large wineries that produce excellent and unique wines. The film identifies small producers like those who produce more Identity or Terroir wines. Most of them are accused of producing "internationalized" or "commercialized" wines. The film tries to make a black and white statement in a world full of gray tones. However, the film did not prove this. They look at some sporadic examples, "tie" some of the big producers (Frescobaldi) with fascism and provide "interviews" with key people. Well, all the little producers spent WWII in resistance? Is it important to see that Parker has something to do with Bulldogs? The film is very manipulative and unconvincing.
