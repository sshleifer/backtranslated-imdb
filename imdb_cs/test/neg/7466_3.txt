Antonio Margheriti, director of the merry cheese cult horror Cannibal Apocalypse, helms this gothic flavored giallo starring with a gap of 70s icon Jane Birkin (as well as her massive French lover of the day, Serge Gainsbourg). Unfortunately, despite the fact that such medicines were included among the tasty bi-sexual French teachers and the terribly unrealistic orangutan murderer, Seven Deaths in Cat's Eye will end in a bleak mess that endeavors to endure. The pretty schoolgirl Corringa (Birkin) returns to her family's Scottish estate after many years to find out that the maniac has murdered her relatives one by one. With a whole series of "haunted old house" tricks (hidden doors, dark corridors, creepy cemeteries, candlelit rooms), Margheriti combines a confused story that sometimes promises supernatural events, but ends up with a lame cop. The end, which is extremely unimaginable. "And where exactly does the cat fit into all this?", I hear you ask. Well, a somewhat squat tycoon testifies to every murder, which justifies the somewhat cold sounding name of Margheriti. <br /> <br /> 'Gory, Style Entertainment' says DVD is a cover; "Boring Pile of Dung" says I.
