First I have to say that I enjoyed the first Underworld movie. I was fascinated and curious to learn about Vampires and Lycans and so on. In this last part of the (hopefully) series I'm sorry about how poor vampires are. At least in the first part you had tight leather clothes ... now the vampires look like a siege of a bad pest control problem. They look and behave like proud white trapped people. Some ideas were clean ... the whole thing about human nobles was interesting. Too bad the meeting was meaningless. A slave thing was also possible. Other things struck me as miserable. Spoilers. Castle walls that can be skipped in a few steps? Enemies who do not attack during the day? Great bad old-time vampires who join age in battle, and then run away from the start of the Lyceum leader from the skans? Werewolves that day close to their enemies? Lycans who attacked arms ... for what? Do not use axes and swords or armor! A Vampire leader who is so incapable of having anyone against him? Romance is so unconvincing that it's sad. So I don't recommend this movie if you don't get it online or buy a very cheap movie ticket. Some actions are good to OK. The armor and weapons are certainly interesting. Otherwise, a very weak scenario that has been poorly assembled and uses all kinds of inan twists.
