No! no no no! My whole being defies this terrible remake of classical film. I knew that from the moment Meg Ryan appeared on the screen with her ridiculous hair and clothes, she was heading for trouble - she literally looked like a scarecrow in the garden she was digging for. Meg Ryan Plays Mega Ryan - How Tiring Is It ?! And it was worse ... much worse. The fearsome clich√©s, stock figures, the growing feeling I watched, like the spin-off "The First Wives Club" and the ultimate hacks in the delivery room. How many times have I seen this movie? Just once, but feels like a dozen times - nothing original or fresh. For shame!
