Koyaanisquatsi is simply the best movie I've ever seen. It is a masterpiece where everything is in the right place. Some scenes are not "nice" or "beautiful", but the camera never looks or hits. That's exactly what's going on here. The camera is used to penetrate, shame and ridicule. There is no magic flow, no sense of size or respect. Instead, some scenes are tiled together without much purpose or plan. Music is disturbing. Like I rated Koyaanisquatsi the best movie ever made, this is the worst. It is also a "pure" movie, but it is a negative form, exactly what should not be done.
