Imagine you: four teenage students have the task of spending the night in a haunted house in St. Francisville, Louisiana, to check the existence of a paranormal. If you watch it in the dark and late at night; you may have several times hair on the back of your neck. Otherwise, this fake document is very lazy rip off BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. What is supposed to be dialogue is very poor and the actors are pleasantly looking, but they seem to lack a real personality. It seems to last forever before something ghostly real happens. This movie is great for 'sleep' when both eyes are barely open and all are yakin 'and snackin'.
