I remember that Darwin had a key experience in the Galapagos Islands when he saw a huge range of animal life and a trainee, he wrote his evolutionary theory. Not according to this film, it was inspired by the British countryside. OK, and as John Cleese-Right- said. I also didn't think Darwin was a man suffering from a deep personal conflict and someone who suffered from dark awe and anxiety years. According to this film he was. Sadly, he apparently lost one of his daughters to illness, but I don't think he would lose a family member, which would greatly affect a person's scientific capabilities. Well, not by ... you get a picture. I think there is nothing worse than when science turns into a fable, and to that extent this film is reflected in an attempt to reveal an evolutionary theory by coming from a man who was emotionally unstable, which is just rude to me. I think Charles Darwin was the soul of scientific research, cool and calm, and always thought logically. This film seeks to dramatize undramatic and sensational distinct scientific research. It's like Canterbury's story. I wouldn't recommend it.
