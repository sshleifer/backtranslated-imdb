I'm not sure who should be blamed for this debacle - in fact, acting isn't so bad and the story isn't as bad as the movies made for Disney did. The story itself is shallow and undeveloped, but it is not surprising in this type of film. Acting is more than a little two-dimensional, but I give credit to actors for doing whatever they have to do with the material they have to work with. However, in my book it is inexcusable to base the whole story on the theory that they have created a "perfect" pop star and then cast an actress who can't sing to save her life. If a girl can't sing, have someone who can record music! This actress is TERRIBLE singer - she was so flat she usually sang in a completely different key!
