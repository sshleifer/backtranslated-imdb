I'm a big fan of "Aunt Mame" with Rosalind Russell. She really was the perfect actress to play this character. I heard Angela Lansbury was very good on stage at "Mame", but it's hard to imagine anyone picking up Rosalind Russell. Lucy was such a great comedy that her comic pieces saved her performance in this movie where I thought she was wrong. Indeed, they should dub her singing voice - to hear these songs sung at a faster pace and with strong voices they really change the whole effect. I just saw the revival of the stage in Washington DC and I think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame, Harriet Harris - the ugly chain smoking agent on Frasier - played Vero and was particularly good. Both would be a good cast of the show's TV movie. Maybe if the production is on Broadway, they're going to think about making it. I also think Tracy Ullman would be as good as Agnes.
