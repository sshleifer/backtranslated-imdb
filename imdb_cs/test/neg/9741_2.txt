Stanley Stupid (Tom Arnold) and his wife, Joan, like to sleep in bed with their heads under their covers and their cushions. They have two equally demanding children, Buster and Petunia. One day Mr. Stupid notices that their waste is gone again .... there must be someone to steal it from the sidewalk. On a garbage truck, he sets out on roller skates. When he finally gets to the dump, he is surprised that he can learn not only that other people's waste has been stolen, but that a secret organization is missing in the landfill. He seems determined to beat the garbage cans in the world. Meanwhile, Petunia and Buster are visiting a police station and a Chinese restaurant where they are looking for their parents because Joan is missing. Will they stab their problems? That's just a stupid, stupid movie whose culprit is a terrible scenario. Allard and Marshall's books are hysterical and only a few book situations end in this movie. Actually, Arnold is pretty nice, because Mr. Stupid and the other members of the congregation are trying hard to make a film. The production values ​​are very high, with the Stupid dog and cat adding a little oomph. But it's all for nothing, because the plot is wandering and weak. Maybe one day someone will take another sting to translate very funny allard books into a big screen. Therefore, if you like laughter, you rent something different when you are waiting for a new production, and in any case also go to the books. But stay away from stupidity, because anyone who follows this film to the end could hardly be called intelligent.
