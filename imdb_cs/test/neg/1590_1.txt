This movie played on the Lifetime Movie Network last month and I decided to check it out. I watched the first 20 minutes and then turned it off b / c I'm sorry, but the plot of the holes that are an integral part of the movie plot makes the film nothing but garbage. The movie is about a woman who accidentally launches a baby on a bike off the road, leaves to get help, returns only to find that it is called hit and run and there is a hunt for a 'monster' that hurts (eventually killed) her. This is a movie about a affluent neighborhood woman who has 2 school children and who is an active, social woman, and yet, to make this film work, she must be credible not to own CELL PHONE. We're sorry, but this is a complete BS, especially when everyone else seems to have one - they used their 911 call when they found a girl lying on the roadside - when our leading woman left the crime scene to call the number 911 payphone. When the leading woman returns, the ambulance is already on the girl's side and talks about how awful it is who hit her and left her. <br /> <br /> DUMB only. I'm sorry, but I'm not willing to buy that this woman doesn't have a cell phone that's necessary for the movie. Please insult my news movie, thanks. Maybe if it happened in 1970 or 1960, I'd buy it, but it's definitely today's film (at that time 1999). ... but wait if she had a cell phone, there would be no movie. Pfft. Woman clearly knows about technology because she had computers in her home, the ones that kids played games, so the whole movie had to make her cell phone dead in the car, leaving her resort on a different way call the cops .. skipping the cell phone together just created a ridiculous plot.
