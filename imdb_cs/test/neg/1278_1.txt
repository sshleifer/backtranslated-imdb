Do you live? OK I think I'm intelligent, educated, liberal and really into movies. I really like and have a great sense of humor. I was under the impression that it was a bleak comedy. They paid for it, gasoline was used, electricity burned, food was consumed, kits built ........ why? Blame the current state of the world in this film and all those people who are associated with it, even include the public. We are all to blame and deserve anything. It's not funny, it's not going to happen, everyone seems bored or boring. There are no conversations, communication is minimal. If I am aware, there is no conspiracy. In fact, I lost 89 points from my life. I'll never get back. The only message I came up with is perhaps too short a life to sit while watching movies of people who don't do much ..... and then die!
