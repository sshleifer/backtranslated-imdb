This movie is horrible. Acting is raw and ridiculous. If you know anything about Rugby, the action is boring. In fact, every Power Rangers episode contains more realism than this movie. 'Action' consists of no more than one passage and a shot of a landing guy over the test line or being engaged without a ball, and hectic hands held shots who knows what. It's impossible to say. There is nothing that excitement, skill, and construction would do that the real Rugby contains. As for haky, he's a bunch of yan who's trying to emulate a tradition they know nothing about, just like the white rasta character who was supposed to be left out of the movie. Next time, Rugby will only hope that people who know Rugby will do it.
