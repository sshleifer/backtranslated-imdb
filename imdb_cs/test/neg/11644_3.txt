Jim Brown plays and produces a story set in the Philippines just after the Japanese invasion. The story has a Japanese with several navy prisoners men, including some divers who use to get gold that MacArthur dumped into Manila Bay. It's a messy movie to make a statement about war and racism (the film uses the Edwin McCain War in a not so fine fitting). The performances are at best only reasonable. Jim Brown is fine, but in his performance he really doesn't show any extent that would just get him angry. The kits are usable, but they seem cheap. The film has suffered from the beginning because of the large amount of footage, including many of the most famous shots of the Japanese attack in Tora! Tora! Tora!. Using such a large budget sequence effectively makes the rest of the film positively anemic; it also recalls that there are better films there one could be watched. It seems that the film has half of the real plot, the acquisition of silver and half of the plot, which is just to fill the time. None of them are particularly exciting with the explosive final.
