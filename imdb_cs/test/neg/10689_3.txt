Given the budget and inexperience of all involved, Livin 'tha Life could be worse. Jamal wants to be Chris Tucker (whom I always found very uncomfortable), as noted by the previous commentator, but Peanut (Edward D. Smith), while some of his (over) responses are going on too long (director's problem), some have some subtle and funny Moments like trying to teach Jamal about the proper way of smoking with a friend. Throughout, he is usually more prepared and self-possessed than Jamal, which could have been the fetus of a nice exploration of contrasts in the relationship but was not developed very far. But inexperience writer / director / cameraman / etc is not an excuse for his inattention. Has he ever seen a movie? Faces are important! Has he ever heard of detail? Even Ed Wood could do detail. I don't think it's a budget issue. I could just give a general description of what each of the actors looked like, not just for any detail, but the lighting ...! Outdoor shooting lights can cost too much, but you can create a spotlight with pieces of paper! This would require moving the camera closer to remove the reflector, which would also help solve the problem. If it's too technical, you can turn the actors so they're not in the shade, or you can reveal the shadows, and if they weren't filmed in L.A. I'd say you can use overcast days. It goes without saying that the films that steal this are all, with the possible exception of Bernie's Weekend, better than this, but Livin 'tha Life would leave a much better impression if it didn't disturb the viewer. a journey just to see any human element. PS The barber shop scene is just stupid.
