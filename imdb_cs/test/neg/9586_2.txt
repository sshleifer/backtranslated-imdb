If you live in the suburbs, they are fairly financially, and they don't really have a great deal of contact with urban life in England, then it's a comedy for you. It's not something a mass audience would do, but if you're like these characters, you'll show that you will love it in pieces. Overall, it is a comedy that the BBC snobs will sit and laugh for their pleasure and just a few of them. Comparing it with BBC Comedys as Single Fools and Horses, Fawlty Towers, Black Adder, and other classics, this series tends to move away from the regular BBC product to the audience and deliver to a somewhat folk culture.
