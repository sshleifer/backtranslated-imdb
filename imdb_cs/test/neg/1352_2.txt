To say that I was disappointed is underestimation. Amateur movie professionals. I wanted to leave the theater on two or three occasions (something I never did) I was really stopped by Cloris Leachman. She rings the truth, the only one I should say. These new women are less modern than George Cukora's 1930s. They are "acting" for us who are trying to be, but their "conflict" is as always in movies. Entertainment from the original was based on sharp, vitriolic and very funny script. Master direction and unrepeatable cast. All elements missing. TV actresses mingle with models and nominated for an Oscar. There was nothing organic about it. The whole thing felt as if it was the moment he was objective, without an improvised goal. 2/10
