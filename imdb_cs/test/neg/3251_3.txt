I usually give a continuation of benefit of doubt and go easy on them. But that's very bad. Exactly the same thing happened in the first movie, it takes place here again. Exactly the same. Only they wanted the younger children to see it (this is responsible for Bugs Bunny's repeated presence, but why they threw one 'f * ck' behind me). They didn't even bother to change the character of Jackie Mason from Dangerfield's. Let me explain in CADDYSHACK Rodney Dangerfield played a boorish Real Estate owner who enrages the exciting members of Bushwood Country Club. In this movie Jackie Mason plays a flashy property owner who enrages the exciting members of the Bushwood Country Club. Great efforts were made to change the content of the script? No, I don't. Very Rude Dan Aykroyd shamefully copies Bill Murray's character. He even goes after the gopher (now more like Gremlin) in a similar style to Murray. There is no laughter. "Comedy" in this movie: Jackie Mason is preparing for a hot date with Dyan Cannon. He's in the bathroom, it's his robe. She moves to the door to dress in her bedroom as the door handle clicks open. Wow!?! That's the best they can do. Eight years to invent a completely new sequel and that's all we get! I could have pulled a better scenario out of my ass. <br /> <br /> You only see it when you are a fan of the original. It's the only way you can find some laughter in it. Everyone else is avoiding.
