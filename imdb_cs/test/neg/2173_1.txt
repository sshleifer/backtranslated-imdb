I don't normally write reviews, but this "movie" was strange. I couldn't turn it off. I don't believe I've ever seen a worse movie, but I was sitting there watching. It was like a terrible wreck of a car with blood flowing across the highway. It was disgusting, but I couldn't turn away. Where should I start? The film seems to think it's a sports thriller, but it's so ridiculous, it can be just comedy, but it's not funny, even in a stupid way. It's like watching your cousins ​​try to find parody at family meetings. It's painful to watch, but at least it's a minute or two. The second String continued for over an hour. Whoever participated in the creation of this film would not work again. Writing, directing, playing and everything was just terrible. The problem is that I can't describe how bad it was; You had to see it. And I'm sure it will never reappear, so if you haven't seen it, you're lucky. I mean, it was worth seeing just that he gave me some appreciation for every other "bad" movie I saw in my life. And for every movie I see in the future that I can't stand, I'll think of myself, well, at least it wasn't as bad as the Second String.
