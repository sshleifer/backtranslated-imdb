This (supposedly) story-based TV movie concerns a woman on the run from the FBI and * seriously * a stupid guy. First we have Roger Paulson (Tim Matheson), a type of "ordinary guy" who has a dull mind, an ex-wife, a child who hardly ever gets, and some cats. Furthermore, there is "Elaine-Lisa-you" (Tracy Pollan), a clever, sexy, good-looking woman whose tongue flares up if she ever told the truth. Roger and Lisa meet to answer the lonely heart adverts. Roger is one of those poor sages who can't manage to live alone, so after his wife has fired him, he places his ad. Roger doesn't take long to figure out that Lisa is not * a good man, but she has no idea how to get rid of her. He doesn't even have enough sense to change the locks on the door of his apartment after he throws her out. <br /> <br /> Watch and follow if you have nothing to do. <br /> <br />
