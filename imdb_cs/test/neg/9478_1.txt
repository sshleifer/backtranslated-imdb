What the world needed - another superficial cookie-cutter Mary-Kate and the movie Ashley Olsen. This film gives girls everywhere terrible news, complemented by a stereotypical "junior high" experience. Learning seems to be absolutely taboo at all. I can't stand the fake French accents, or the boys on moped races who eventually "fall" on twins. Why do I put everything in brackets? Because it's all stereotypical. The twins even complain that they have no stereotypical grandfather. They should be happy to have grandfather at all. How does it fit in the form of Mary-Kate / Ashley? This one gives them a single guy who (gasping!) IS NOT her question !!!!! Yes, people, in fact, have a mother who appears for five seconds. I didn't even sit for over thirty minutes and I can tell you how it will end. This film is so woeful that it makes Miss USA as an academic bowl. Really.
