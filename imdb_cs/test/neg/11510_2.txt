For the first time I saw an advertisement for this show when my sisters watched Kim Possible. Advertising showed Sadie and her boyfriend discuss the meaning of the word nothing.It is one of the dumbest ads I've ever seen. Basically they go back and forth with lines like "Nothing is a thing, so technically nothing is anything,". When I saw it, I found out that it would be another Lme Lizzie Maguire that Disney would hit. But I had no idea how wrong. Fast forward for about 3 weeks when my sister turns to VV. What I saw must have been one of the most unintentionally entertaining shows I've ever seen. How did it go? Something like this: Sadie, a vegetarian hugger, has an incredibly unhealthy, obsessive foment on Owen's very monotonous and poorly performing. For some reason, her friend Margret has decided that Owen must be "tested" to see if she is as good as she seems. What exactly do these tests include? One thing they do is put a cockroach on their notebook. Why? So she could be ugly and ask her for a monotonous knight in shining armor to get him away. What is this test? Because when it is silenced, it is a serious and unwavering person and does not believe that the errors, as Sadie states, "are also innocent animals". WORLD DISEASE AND HEALTH! WANT TO BE INVESTED! But, of course, Owen clears it out of the window and Sadie is still in love. But that's not all! Margret says he must be questioned once again, on something "no man can go through". He involves pulling the scarves down their pants (yes, read that right) and walking to buy him to see if he notices their big butts. He does not notice foreseeably, and we see Sadie in her bizarre and strange notebook world. Sadie decides she wants to be with Owen forever, to raise a family with him, and, as she says, "lives like wooden ducks with their chicks,". That's just wrong. The Bottom Line: This is the strangest, craziest show I've ever watched. For those who like to make fun of stupid things, you'll love it. For anyone else, skip this show.
