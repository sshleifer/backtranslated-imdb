That would probably be a good movie to see ... provided you have already seen every other film in existence, and thoroughly examined the abdominal keys yourself and those around you. God, this movie was incredibly crazy, with some of the worst (or it's non-existent) writing ever captured on the film. There is no saving grace for this film; Even animatronics is a bit lame and it's just a complete waste of time and money. <br /> <br /> Running. Fast. It's scary. <br /> <br />
