Don't be fooled by thinking that this is a remake, because THE TIME MACHINE is based on an earlier movie this year. It's not because it's a pointless movie. It is the director used the original camera script shot for a shot similar to the "remake" of The AWay a few years ago. The scenes are identical to the original, the dialogue is identical to the original, the camera angles are identical, no attempt is made to decorate or restructure the original scenario, (but with a director like Van Sant, we should be grateful for sure) In fact, I could even correctly say that the costumes can be the same because the private eye wears a pork hat. Were they out of fashion in the late sixties? <br /> <br /> Bottom Line: Avoid
