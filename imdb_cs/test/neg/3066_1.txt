I rented this pile of sewage waste and hoped it would succeed. With a title like "Zombie Bikers from Detroit" and Dead Alive productions on the front cover, you think it could be a funny movie, but no. This is the worst movie I've ever seen (and yes, I've seen all the films from the Police Academy). The story (it's a joke in itself) and dialogue are cruel. Making so-called zombies seems to have used one of these two dollars `Make yourself look like Zombie kits' that you buy at K-Mart. I'd rather watch Beverly Hills 90210 while listening to the Backstreet Boys and flogging the 400lb novelty than sitting the next minute of this pathetic apology for DVD. Honestly, I could make a better film with $ 3, some sticks and slinky. I feel as if 90 minutes of my life have been postponed and taken to Suckdom. I know that tagging on Dead Alive does not guarantee a great movie, but you expect to pay off your money. The only thing that made me happy (save, return the horrible elephant flesh) was that it wasn't named `Biker Zombies from Pittsburgh '. I feel for the people of Detroit who have wasted their money. If you haven't been lobotomized? Don't buy, rent if you have to ?? Ale ??. You'll regret it.
