A protected young woman, taught at home and possibly gifted, hides a disturbed, overly emotional side that comes to the surface after her absent father pays her mother for a visit and asks for a divorce. Directed by famous cameraman William A. Fraker, this sick psychological thriller falls into the trap that most of the directors' films take: each shot is made for maximum style, but in sacrificing liquid stimulation and tight motion. , breathtaking narration. Fraker (and his cameraman, László Kovács) very much like whitish white and gold tones that give the picture a polished, tableaux feel. The lock at the center of the action looks like a funeral parlor, and Fraker walks on a wheezing yarn just like a funeral. Robert Shaw and Sally Kellerman (as Shaw's fiancée), two of the most interesting actors in the 1970s, overcome the plastic overlap and are quite persuasive despite jagged editing (which turns their scene into small pieces of half the business). Sondra Locke, another interesting personality on the screen, seems to be "repulsive" for her resemblance to Catherine Deneuve. Locke is pale and irritated, with incredibly dense and long hair, Locke is a curious human riddle and is initially quite intimidating and dangerous; however, this role is so old-hat that Locke can find nothing fresh to bring out of the deep frost, and she flounders. Fraker allows Locke's tricky scenes to go on and on, while Shaw (looking immensely careless) is placed in an impossible position to touch her. All these nonsense could pay off if the scenario were littered with a modicum of modesty (or at least some dry wit or witty relief). As it is, Lewis John Carlino and the crippling scenario of Edward Hume, adapted from Stanton Forbes 'novel "Go to His Deathbed", overlooks the viewer prematurely and only the players' charisma gets us to the finish line. * 1/2 from ****
