Tonight I went to see this movie and tried to keep my mind open. I was hoping I liked the movie I expected to be different from the book. There have been considerable differences from the book, much like the changes in the DiVinci code. I went to see DiVinci Code with the same thought process and enjoyed the movie despite the changes in the book. It was still pleasant, full of action and the process of deciphering the symbols was interesting and mentally stimulating. Unfortunately, angels and demons have failed at almost every level. During the film, the symbols are found and quickly lost, without the viewer's interest. They blow around the various symbols of Immuminati so quickly that we have no chance to look at them and appreciate how they work. The final symbol of the Illuminati, which was most interesting and creative in the book, was replaced by a symbol of crossed keys. In my opinion, this was a missed opportunity to focus on symbols and spend a little more time on them, which is what Langdon's character is about. Overall, this movie is a very bad interpretation of the book, and fails when attempting an action movie / thriller. 4 out of 10
