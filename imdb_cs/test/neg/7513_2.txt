This is a polarizing film. People either love it or despise it, it seems. I, I despise it. The film comes from the same context as Lindsay Anderson's Oh Lucky Man, but while it's a masterpiece, it's just horrible. Both films take Kafka's unfinished novel - America, for their inspiration and overall ideal. America is an incredible story of youth travels across the country. Kafka uses this character as a pure observer who doesn't change over the course of the journey (although the book is about 300 pages long and seems to be only a quarter, so we'll never know). To allow Kafka to concentrate and comment on the absurd / surrealistic situations and surroundings. Oh Lucky Man follows the same template to show England with Malcolm McDowell's eyes and Weekend did the same for France. Both films are also extremely Brechtian, using various tricks and techniques to point out that this is not REAL, this is confabulation, etc. But the difference comes where Oh Lucky Man uses a constructed film to expressing the absurdity of life and class system, Weekend uses a constructed film to deceive us to death with ideological controversy. Since Godard goes beyond Anderson in his Brechtian principles, we will end up with two main characters in which we have no investment. We are forced to spend 90 minutes with them, but we didn't care about them. Intentionally. In this way, however, Godard leaves us with a film that is entirely about his own message, which is provided in the first half of the film by inexorable and predominant symbolism, and in the second half by a series of long speeches directed towards the camera. . Combined with unpleasant and unnecessary scenes, such as a truly horrible murderous pig, much worse than any of the camera's off-camera attacks. The end result is that you listen to a student political apparatus that moves on and on its views while repeatedly kicking you in the head to get a message. The problem with Brecht is that if you have alienated viewers too much, then you have alienated them from what you are trying to convey. What always seemed obvious to me. The parts that really hold on to this film are the contrast between the extremely sexually explicit verbal description of the trio at the beginning and the off-screen comic rape, which, though it might be considered allegorical, will completely destroy the faith the film itself and its character, which few of them were in the first place. It's so French with F capital, it hurts. Watch Oh Lucky Man instead. This is a brilliant work. Weekend is a preload work. Two stars, only for the congestion scene and the piano scene, which are only signs of genius, though they actually make the end result frustrating and unsatisfactory. it is a bad movie of the worst most demanding director in the world, with them, and it is obvious that this is a damn good technical director who makes the intellectually most demanding film in the world. Somehow it is much worse.
