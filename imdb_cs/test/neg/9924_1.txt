It includes some spoiler information, but the movie doesn't worth watching as well ... Why Ellen Barkin and Peta Wilson agreed to be part of this debacle writer-director Damian Harris is behind me. The story is full of unrealistic police investigative techniques, which include going to a party with a suspect and inviting them to suspect into your house and intimate with them. The story also includes a male psychiatrist who seems to have nothing but female clients - and everyone sleeps with them. Even more over-top is the idea that women victims of the terrible S / M crime belong to a large but secret group of lesbian managers S / M. errors and continuity errors, the film is sterile in all its ritzy locations - including Barkin's detective salary. And the lame dialogue is good enough for someone to sleep. Damian is a bad writer and a bad director. He tried and failed miserably to occasionally create an atmosphere in which no one appeared. Moreover, Ellen Barkin could not give 110%. I firmly believe she realized that the film was pathetic and gave up on the trials. Standouts was Peta Wilson, who wasted time studying with Dominatrix for this part. Highly rated actor Marshall Bell has given his absolute best performance as ever. And because Damian couldn't deliver at any level, it was hard to feel the emotions for any character. Most importantly, he knows nothing about the real world of BDSM and has decided to create a typical "Hollywood reality" of gorgeous men and women who are perverted and dangerous. <br /> <br /> Save your time, money and bracelets and check it out.
