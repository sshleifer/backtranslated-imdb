Drivel. Absolute waste. Writers were not allowed to read the book, nor did they see David Lynch's film. It's not worth losing time. <br /> <br /> The longer does not do better. While more in-depth then Lynch's film, it has rough in-precision, and down-playing key parts of the story. <br /> <br /> "The Night at Roxbury" is more worth your time.
