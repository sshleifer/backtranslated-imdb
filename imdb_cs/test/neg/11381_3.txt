"Ghost Son" is Lambert Bava's best film and also his worst. I assume that this statement requires some slight clarification. It is his best because it is well managed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but its the worst because it is a boring, unoriginal film and an undeniably huge drop in all the true fans of past Bava's efforts. Let's face it: many fans that I certainly included would not care about this movie, which, according to this conspiracy, was not his famous names and even a boring sounding name. The only motivation here was Lamberto Bava, who in the past brought us a lot of intricate Gialli films and fun spraying. "Ghost Son" is a piece of his comeback movie, next to "The Torturer", and although it's definitely not a good movie, it at least lives up to its fans' expectations of excessive amounts of sleaze, blood and sadism. "Ghost Son" is a weak and unbearably soft horror movie, even spoken in the spirit of mainstream stories. Emphasis is too much on sentiment, and this is badly affecting a limited number of terrible and scary atmospheric moments. The basic assumption could be one or two potentially good ideas, but the film is generally boring and too clich√©. John Hannah and Laura Harring star as a happy couple, living on a remote ranch in South Africa and breeding horses for a living. Joy and happiness could not be improved, so naturally something tragic must happen and it does. Mark is dying in a car crash, but Stacey remains in a ranch where he is in constant contact with Mark's spirit. She even gets pregnant with her baby, but mysterious events appear shortly after the baby's birth. It looks like Mark's restless and selfish spirit had a child and used it to encourage Stacy to commit suicide. With all the focus on the couple's relationship, many of the events and sub-sessions are underdeveloped and / or remain inexplicable, like the whole background of Thandi's teenage maid. There is too little action and the only real scary moments are too obviously borrowed from classic movies like "Exorcist" and "Rosemary's Baby" (vomiting of green goo, self-propelled furniture?). Purely speaking, when it comes to the terrible fun of "Ghost Son" is a painful failure, but it must be said, it's a beautiful and charming looking failure. The camera is extremely elegant and many camera angles are truly inventive and suggestive. Sometimes the mood score can even create a formidable atmosphere, although nothing happens on the screen. There are several beautiful pictures of wildlife in South Africa, but if you're interested, I suppose you'd rather watch National Geographic instead. Not much to recommend here. Fans of atmospherically driven ghost stories have much better choices, and fans of Bava rejoice to watch "Demons", "Macabre" or "Blade in the Dark".
