When I heard they were doing it, I was glad the first movie was pretty good if it's a little on the short side. But then I remembered some of the disaster disasters I had previously watched (im looking at you Little Mermaid 2). Anyway, I watched it and unfortunately I was very disappointed. The best part is animation. It's really that special Polish that "right" Disney movies have. <br /> <br /> The rest is disappointing. The plot is everywhere. One moment about something, then completely transforms into another storyline and then turns into another completely different storyline. It reminded me of how the Family Guy movie was turned into a film as 3 separate episodes. Perhaps I laughed once. Kronk was very entertaining in the original movie, but he's not funny at all. <br /> <br /> Stay away from this movie if you don't get it for free. <br /> <br/> 4/10
