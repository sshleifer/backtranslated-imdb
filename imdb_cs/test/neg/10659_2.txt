The pace of this movie is quite slow. It takes about 70 minutes to get Katie to China (which we know she will) and leaves 30 minutes to pack things up. The story is so predictable that you know everything after 5 minutes. Nothing will surprise you. I think the movie is a movie that is approaching age, but the movie is full of stereotypes that are at the top: Katie - A beauty that realizes that look, boys and shopping are not all. He realizes that he can "feel" and "see the real world." Touch. Mother - A tall, nervous, screaming mother (wow very innovative) who needs to take care of a strong man. Father - Patient and always understanding and caring for incompetent woman. A friend who just wants to get into his pants. A comedian clown A Chinese man who doesn't know how to speak English and laughs. The idea of ​​Hollywood dropped those characters in the mid-1950s. A nurse who sometimes knows how to get around in China, that next time she is a copy of Mother, a woman who can't handle situations or knows something. Distorted Chinese girl who, with the help of us westerns, gets help and becomes a beautiful girl. Because in China (according to the film of the third country of the world) they have nothing and therefore we need our charity. Gah, wake up and feel what you're shoveling. Of course, there is some poverty in China, but displaying help from Western countries (read US) is so shallow and happy that it's over. is sad and rebellious. Shanghai (where the film is set) is currently the most widespread and developed city in the world. Chinese father who is so nice and good that he has one wish in the end ... to be a cowboy with a white hat ... <br /> <br /> Teacher (Sean Astin) who has it really heart ripping story (not) that says without feeling. Why Sean? Why ?? Etc etc. It's hard to really find a "real" person throughout the movie. This is nothing but a good movie feeling for the Americans under the age of 15. If you want to know something about the world watch, for example, the Rwanda Hotel. For a better life story or the advent of age film, I suggest you watch the Italian film "Paradiso Cinema", which won the best foreign film academy for several years. The only nice thing in the movie was the little town scenery that actually capture some (not all) of the beautiful Chinese country side. I was there and saw some of it.
