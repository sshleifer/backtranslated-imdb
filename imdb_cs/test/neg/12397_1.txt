After the meteor lands in "Boston" (really somewhere in the Isle of Man), it is a nasty, fanged alien monster being released and being freelancer at a local girls' school, causing chaos and turning students into zombie-like animals. This movie is apparently relaxed (and I emphasize a loose) remake of a 1986 movie with the same name as it represents the same monster, but a different plot. Both movies are horrible, but the 1986 version was watchable. This is not. Let's start with all the problems - acting, especially from the leading professor, was very, very bad. This film should take place in Boston (we know this because filmmakers had the brilliant idea of ​​putting "Boston Police" or "Boston Gas Company" on everything), yet they all seem to have somewhat confused British accents (at least not trying to use Boston accents, thank God). The script is a big bad mess. The best example of how stupid writing is when you find that you can change zombie-students back to people by removing a necklace containing a piece of meteor. Is that what our brave heroes do? No, instead of running Shooting zombie-students. Nice. Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote / directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his movies. The film is terribly boring in places. Lighting is terrible. The film looks inexpensive and faint. One of the greatest aspects is the lack of remarkable gore. 99% of the death scenes include a creature that emerged from the dark corner and dragged someone away while we heard they were "frightened" in the distance. This convention has never worked well in the past and it certainly does not work here. The visual effects were AWFUL. The CG opening sequence in the universe looked like it could be created on Microsoft's Slideshow for God! The "explosion" of the gas tanks at the end was just as bad. Well, I'd like to consider myself a great critic, so I'll give credit where the loan is due - the effects of the creation were actually pretty cool. I have to love those close shots of slimy, drooling teeth! To summarize the film up, "breeders" is a horrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be expelled as an Ebola virus. Not recommended. <br /> <br /> 1.5 / 10.
