Human transport is purely "there, done that" experience? only this time it's quite flabby. The main topics examined include paranoia, male impotence and jealousy? but only slightly and badly. It seems that a lot of film wants to imitate Trainspotting ??? but it does not include the low times / descents that Trainspotting deals with (eg, death / dependency issues, etc.). Is he even trying to come up with a similar monologue of Ewan McGreggor's classic "Choose Your Life"? but Milky bars are on me! Yeah!' ?? what is fudge is that all around? their analysis becomes boring and repetitive. The soundtrack (for a movie that is trying to be cool) is pathetic. These include Fat Boy Slim and CJ Bolland ??? come to people? good dance music is better than this! <br /> <br /> Characters become annoying and uncomfortable (especially in the middle of the film) and the lack of care for characters is shining soon. There are some funny scenes? but they are few and far between. Mother catching son in the bedroom was pretty fun. <br /> <br /> But please? I'm sick to death scenes analogy to Star Wars. I thought it was much sharper in several Kevin Smith movies (ie: Clerks and Chasing Amy). By the characters? Yoda is a drug devil, so is he short and bald? huh?! <br /> <br /> My score ?? 4 out of 10 ?? do yourself a favor and see Trainspotting or Go Go!
