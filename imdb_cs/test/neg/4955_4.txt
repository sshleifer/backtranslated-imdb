If I learned something about how I looked at George Romero's Creepshow, it is that when you come across a mysterious old box that someone has apparently gone to a lot of effort to hide, just leave yourself alone: ​​there is something ugly inside. Obviously, Professor Gordon Crowley, Robert Englund's character in 'Jack Brooks, Monster Slayer' is not a Romero fan, 'because when he breaks down an old wooden box he finds in his yard just to discover? A surprise, a surprise, an ancient demon who has his body (initially causes them to eat and vomit a lot). When the demon finally explodes out of Crowley's body during the chemistry lesson and begins to turn students into hellish, carnivorous animals, it's up to Jack Brooks (Trevor Matthews) plumber to try to stop the stupid creatures armed only with pipe length and powered by lifelong hatred of all things monstrous! Packing a DVD for a low budget monster Jon Knautz promises Damn fun ride that offers kitschy excitement and spots of the kind one would expect from your average 80s creature (jagged creature, rubber monster suits, fearsome gore and absolutely no CGI!) ??? and the last 15 minutes, that's exactly what viewers get: non-stop repayment effects; stupid demon thing Jabba in tentacle style; and Mucho Macho Monster Mashing! Is it a shame that the rest of the movie is a time run? massive 70 minutes or so? He mostly spent after Jack when it comes to his boring, everyday business: plumbing, visiting his shrinkage, going to chemistry class and upsetting his girlfriend. If you think you could enjoy a film that focuses primarily on managing childhood trauma and anger management, buying replacement iron valve valves and the chemical properties of sodium, then this is the film for you; But if it's a huge dose of monsters you mayhem after, then I'd advise looking elsewhere!
