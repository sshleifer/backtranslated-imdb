My wife got tickets for our family to take part in the premiere of this film for free from her employer. I'm just sorry for the price of popcorn and the two hours of my life I wasted on this garbage film. <br /> <br /> I own a DVD of the original mask and enjoyed it pretty much. I was expecting a remake anywhere near the original in production values ​​or writing .. but I wasn't ready for this vulgar pile of garbage. Weak behavior, bad conspiracy, bad CGI baby around gas and peeing in hyper "mask mode" .. woman turned into giant nose, spewing mucous .. Fun huh? My eight year old son loves movies like Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and Star Wars. After that, I asked him what he was thinking. His exact words; "I hated it. It's like a Scooby Doo movie. They're taking something good and they have to put all that rough stuff in." My 12-year-old daughter and wife also hated it. My wife told me later that her son would ask her twice if we could leave. He never did it before. I'm proud of him. To not think I'm a puritan, from that moaning and lack of laughter, I heard in the theater, I think most of the patrons agreed with me. This film presents everything bad for kids fun and any positive reviews MUST be from people financially related to the movie.
