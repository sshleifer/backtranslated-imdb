Ohhhh MAN this movie is terrible !! This kind of audacity is what gives the Canadian film a bad name or no name. To be fair, I think most Canadian movies give the Canadian film a bad name. edition and tempo of the film. It's like a drunken snail who makes his way to death. Thank God, Melanie Doane is pretty. It's the only thing that followed me. Unfortunately, he interrupted the rest of the movie. Good for laughter, though, if you have a bad Canadian night movie, though. Did I mention Melanie Doane? The only good point (too bad that they didn't make sense to hold the camera more than blink at once)
