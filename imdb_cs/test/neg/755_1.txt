In my opinion, the film was ridiculous - a bad dialogue. Whoever wrote the script - please keep your job. It's definitely no godfather or goodfellas. It's good to be on the table at the table - wrong choice of words. Some characters were clowns. But what do you expect from a low budget movie without actors.
