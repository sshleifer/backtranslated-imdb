In addition to Frank Kress (who played Abraham Gentry), Henny Youngman's performance and the last seconds of the film, there was nothing particularly good about this movie. Why is it currently rated 5.3 and adored by some reviewers is beyond me - the movie is 99.44% stupid ... and what I would expect from director Hershell Gordon Lewis. In the sixties and seventies, Lewis was known for producing a string of incredibly low budget uses for films such as BLOOD FEAST and MONSTER GO-GO. However, in recent years, the "father gore" has been baptized and has many, many fans - fans who ignore the impolite of his work and focus only on how some of his films have been breakthrough. But in addition to the liberal use of false blood and real guts, his films are purely bullshit - and he doesn't believe he scores 9 and 10 for his movies. That would be like giving Elvis a velvet painting to the Louvre !! The film is about a series of very horrible murders that become stripper. When I say horrible, it's very bloody and sick for 1972 - though today's special effects look amazing lame. While there are some very devious and cruel murders in the film (I would rather not explain them - they are from a pretty sick mind and show a particularly sick disdain for women), at least they do not vote for you because they were done so badly. Obviously, in many cases they cut rubber dolls and dummies. But letting them do some of the sick acts, though unrealistic, is pretty ugly and shows a lot of misogyns. The only hope in the movie, like all the idiots, is a guy named Abraham Gentry - whose manner and style of speech are very close to the actor David Lochary of John Waters' first films. While his actions are bad, he's so ostentatious and funny that he impressed me. Could be quite funny and strangely it is the only movie ever made !! It was also strange that so many women wanted him - especially because he didn't seem like his type. <br /> <br /> As for the rest of the people in the movie, they are Cretan and idiots who couldn't do. In fact, I was a little hopeful that MORE would be killed - it really came! None of their performances were the least believable, and the director NEVER ever fired a single scene - because most of the scenes in the film were worse than any of those in Ed Wood's masterpiece PLAN 9 FROM THE EXTERNAL SPACE. In fact, for many women in the film, the only premise for their appearing in the film is that they are willing to take off their clothing. Now I know it will sound pretty good, but most of them were incredibly unattractive and looked like drug addicts who undressed to get another fix. When these ladies take off their clothes, the men in the crowd give them the money to get them back (wow - Henny Youngman should have said it in the movie)! But given Lewis's budgets, it was probably the best "actress" he could get. Overall, it's a slippery bucket of bile that can be worse than most other director's movies ... and that says a lot! It is violent (yet stupid) anti-women (treating them like meat and things to be mutilated) and is uncompromising from start to finish.
