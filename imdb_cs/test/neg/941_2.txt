Inane, a horrible farce about a young man who refuses to adjust or make better use of the mismatch to achieve his goals - to deceive his parents to think he is attending college. The truth is that these twitches were rejected by every school he asked for. After seeing this waste, you'll see why. <br /> <br /> What a ridiculous name - South Hampton Institute of Technology. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to find out the initials of this nonsense school. The problem with these types of films is that the non-conformist eventually becomes the accepted mode. <br /> <br /> Let's go back to the world of reality and mark this movie as what it is - excessive manipulative waste!
