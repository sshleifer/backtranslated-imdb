Hasn't the writer of this movie seen three more? I loved the original, I thought 2 was the best, I tolerated 3 (it was OK, nothing special). But I hated this. Who dares to kill UG? Surely it wasn't Ug who was almost like Charlie's brother in number 2. Remember his speech? Charlie said, "You wouldn't leave me on Earth, would you." Ug said, "Charlie, the bounty hunter," said he was one of them now. How dare writers ignore this strange bond between them and turn it into a baddie that is killed by Charlie (in a particularly unpleasant scene) just because they realize that the film is getting bored. We'll get a new cast for the first 20 minutes, and we'll have to wait until we find out what happened to Charlie, who was the hero we were expecting. I waited, "Come on when Charlie appears?" Angela Basset must try to deny she was in this Turkey. Relocation in the future eliminates the ability to see the continuation of the original cast or in our time. I think writers have decided that their film will be the last and can do what they want. This film is completely out of the first two. And it didn't seem like they were written by the same people who did 3. 3. At least they had humor and could be easily seen by younger children. 4 is just ugly and moderately lively (Eric DaRe) is particularly cruel and useless. I hated this movie. He hated, hated, hated it. I hated the fact that he liked it and I hated the fact that it destroyed what was one of my favorite classic camps. I give it one start simply because IMDb.com won't let me give you a zero.
