I really tried as "Saw." The story was good and I admire the cruel pace at which the film was made. However, there were too many clich√©s and elements that might look "cool" but really didn't make sense. First, what I liked about the film was the overall tone of the story and I thought the assumption was fantastic. The Jigsaw Killer character was interesting and reminded me of Dario Argento. Danny Glover was excellent in his role as an obedient detective, and Monica Potter was in a thankless role as a doctor kidnapped wife. Shawnee Smith's scene was incredible, and both Wan and Whannell should be praised for using this scene as a demo to get the background behind. The whole idea that Jigsaw killer finds his way for his victims to kill himself is an excellent idea, but once the movie starts, the logic has started to get away. She held Gordon's wife and daughter hostage, and it was obvious it wasn't a Jigsaw killer and part of it. The scene where he placed the stethoscope over the heart of frightened Diana, while Allison screams at him through the gag, was one of the rarest scenes I've ever seen. It was supposed to be freezing, but it didn't do anything. Also, because the killer Jigsaw finds a way to kill the victim, he has no problem slicing the policeman's neck. I think it is a way to show that he does not want to be caught and will go to all the means necessary to ensure that it does not happen, but for me it simply did not logic, especially when he shows no remorse. the death of another detective (which I did this way, it would just be better if I gave it to someone who deserved it). I felt that Leigh Whannell was fine like Adam. It was not really a spectacular role and has great potential as an actor. However, I wasn't too fond of James Wan direction. The story may be original, but the direction was definitely not. I think I'm tired of the quick MTV style cuts in favor of the old approach to directing, but a lot of Jigsaw killer scenes have reminded me of "Se7en" too. As the movie went on, it started to be a series of demo roles like "Look, look what I can do." Instead of being interesting, it has become very disturbing. But hey, it worked. He is now the director of "Final Destination 3", so he is on the road to a successful career, and I think he will be the best horror movie director in the coming years. <br /> <br /> What was really for me was the ending. As I said, I knew Jigsaw wasn't Zap, and I liked the way Adam discovered the mini tape recorder after he killed him. It would be a wonderful end, except for one fatal mistake: I felt they should leave where you didn't know who the murderer was. The way it was done was done only for one reason: Boy, are we smart? Uh, no. It just didn't make sense to me. Some of the better horror movies are made for some reason where there is a reason for the violence we see in the story. While "Saw" started very well, it began to be a hate of filmmakers who had to be "cool" and disturbing the winning story they had. Maybe if they weren't too impatient to buy the movies themselves and rely on a more experienced horror director who could do it, I think it would be a horror classic that hasn't been involved in the past four months. If it's a "Cabin Fever" future of horror, I'm very scared.
