What's wrong with this movie? Does Mr. Lyne and his writers think that the sado-masochistic quarrel between two devastated Yuppiesi can carry a feature film? Maybe if it had some comic elements (which is not, at least intentionally), or there were some other dramatic elements (which are not there), or maybe if it was hardcore. No, it's just a history of the affair; chronology bunch of R-trysts. Ho-hum, who cares? "Nine Â½ Weeks" deserves every Razzie nomination he received. It's defeated. By the way, what's wrong with Roger Ebert and his enthusiastic revision? Where was his head in 1986?
