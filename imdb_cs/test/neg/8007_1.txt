Could someone please explain why anyone would like to make a "British neo-noir" criminal movie with almost exclusively American film? The accents spoken in this film are bloody horrible! But completely in line with the performances that are so wooden, one is worried about strikes on the match to set the cast on fire. Indeed, what kind of disgusting, moronic, cynical crud is that? Even neo-noir movies have a character that you either feel or want to feel, even if they are unhappy and doomed; at least they have some decency for them, some feeling that what they did is wrong, or that a seemingly good plan has gone wrong, and that they have some responsibility for it. Not in this tent goulash. These characters are rotten, they betray each other, themselves and spectators. Also note that these are low-life lives - all right, nothing wrong - with the difference that they live a life of luxury. For a film allegedly about desperate little thieves, there is a key note here - ennui. It's all so dull and dirty, doncha knows. So let's tear some people or maybe murder them and go to a luxury hotel. What ambitions! Going all this mess to the bottom of a swampy mud is: boring uneven stimulation; predictable "action" sequences that are not; banal and incoherent design; working with cameras and cuts for television; forgotten score; and a complete lack of any imagination or innovation in production and direction. Unbelievable, unlikely, and totally unobservable for less-devoted movie viewers (or masochists) like me. There are other nasty things I would like to say about this ugly movie, but they wouldn't print it here. Suffice it to say that you can find something more useful than something to watch this film - just something.
