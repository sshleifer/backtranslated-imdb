I never slept during the movie. Never. This film made impossible. While many people claim that their American counterparts are dominated by Japanese horror movies, this film has been taught from abundance. The movie was 30 minutes too long. It would help if the film had a little more movement on the land and the camera worked, but instead, all we got was an unpleasant silence and lots of slow motion. Acting was utterly terrible, bordering on bad levels of student films, while everyone was trying to mark something ad-lib as a script. Did these people get any direction? Were they to be boring and boring? Either I wouldn't be surprised. Worse, it was a somewhat incredible make-up that was created from the other side with the creatures. Either way, everyone is stuck. Don't watch this movie. That's all I can say (unless you're insomniac).
