That's a bad excuse for a movie. Film noir by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, forget the conspiracy, a really simple version of a cynical hard guy has changed into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what prevents her from despising her to love him? Along with a group of other boys, he helps keep the baby from drowning when everyone is swimming in the water tower and trying to survive when the water is siphoned and pushed. It's not exactly heroism, but it's suddenly hit. It's really painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-swallowed, noir-spoken speaker. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting instrument, along with a snarling voice. Most of his energy seems to be trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever woke up to this job that I would never understand. Enjoy it if you have few details, old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a decent movie experience. It wasted 1-1 / 12 hours of my life.
