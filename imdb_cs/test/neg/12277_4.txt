The CBS radio program called "We People" helps in finding an American home for the Viennese refugee Charles Coburn (like Karl Braun), a qualified surgeon and a pool imposter. She comes with a beautiful daughter Sigrid Gurie (like Leni) who "studies" to become a nurse. Moved to a small, dusty midwestern village, John Wayne (like John Phillips) and his uncle Spencer Charters (like 'Nunk' Atterbury), a veterinarian, are welcomed to Burly Station. Mrs. Gurie is unhappy in the dust and wants to leave. Immediately. But the prospect of romance with Mr. Wayne could change her mind ... God answers many prayers of the citizens for the rain, but it may not be enough to save the agricultural city. The whole city is recommended to move to Oregon. Wayne wants to stay and endure it. Coburn gets an invitation to work at a top clinic. And Gurie learns that her fianc√©, who is supposed to be dead, will come to exercise her as his wife. They feel obliged to accept; but it has a dark secret ... This movie doesn't like Wayne, which seems to be from his element. Being paired with Gurie, promoted as another Garbo, won't help. They have a cute scene in Wayne's car ("Jalopy, Italian Car"). <br /> <br /> **** Three Faces West (7/3/40) Bernard Vorhaus ~ John Wayne, Sigrid Gurie, Charles Coburn, Spencer Charters
