I don't understand people here. The film is not as good as bad, as some people say. With the exception of De Kok, he's fine. The problem with the film is mainly the script. Characters are not believable. Sex is fine, but psychology behind people has little sense. The film doesn't look good, but what do you expect? The film was shot for very little money on video. Of course it doesn't look as good as a normal movie, duh! One thing I agree on is that music is bad. It sounds like a cheap soft erotic movie from the 1980s. The film is not good, well, but you have to give some credit for pulling it without money.
