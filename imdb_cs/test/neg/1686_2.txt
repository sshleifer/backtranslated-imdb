I never really started watching the show until it was canceled and started to show repetition. Actually, I enjoyed the first to third seasons. As soon as I saw the fourth and fifth I started to get angry. The first problem was that they were making an irrelevant history script that was repeated (Jr had a child like his parents). The other one had to be the one where everyone had contacted someone (eg Katie and Franklin). The third was when Jr did even more stupid than before, which became tedious and shocking to the point where I wanted to go to T.V. and beat him out of his stupidity until he's unconscious. The fourth had to be the zealous dork Clarie had declared a friend. The fifth had to be Katie, she became too good for herself and was treated like her "friend" Franklin as a pushover. Last but not least Noah Gray-Cabey !! Franklin, Franklin was just scary. It was like watching a terrible combination of Urkle and TJ Henderson just annoying !!! The shark jumped out when he came to the show. His nature was little, and no reality at all, and the way he laughed was a sign of an apparent force that showed Noah could not act. Eveytime, I saw that kid made me want to go crazy. However, B.F. (before the franc) this show was fun and very fun.
