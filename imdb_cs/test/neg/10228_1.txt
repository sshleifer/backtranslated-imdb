WHAT ARE MANY MANY FILMS THAT MAY BE AGAINST ALL ODDS, THE RAGTAG TEAM IS LARGE GAMES WITH ALL CASH? There's nothing new in The Big Green. If something you want to lose. Steve Guttenberg had such a good biography ("The Boys from Brazil", "Police Academy", "Cocoon"). Why, OH WHY, had to do these kinds of movies in the 1990s and beyond? So, avoid this movie. There are lots of good movies out there, so there's no reason to waste your time and money on this waste. Clearly, "green" in their minds was money because there is no creativity. At least in recent years, Disney has produced some smart movies with Pixar.
