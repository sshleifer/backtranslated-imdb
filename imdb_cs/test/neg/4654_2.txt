Bad enough. This movie about the grizzled (and honestly rock stupid) old prospector and his dog 'Shep', ie Lassie, as well as an annoying child whose name I can't remember at the moment. At the beginning of the film, the old DELIBERATELY prospector has been buried in the sand so the poor dog has to kick him out. Why? Hated the dog? Anyhoo, in some way, this idiot managed to strike gold and go tell his partner. But the man died, and his other partner is happy to help old Jonathan digging gold. Geezer tries to leave the dog with the dead guy's son, but even a retarded mutt doesn't want to stay with this guy. There's a quaint old preacher (for a stinking quirky reading) and a greasy fellow finished an old guy (surprise, surprise) and try to steal all the gold. In addition, they poison the dog and try to kill the baby. So I suppose it's okay that the evil and crazy Lassie ... SHEP is doing this guy in the end, though it's quite disturbing in what's essentially a children's movie. There are extremely stereotypical (to the racial slurp thing) 'Native Americans' who speak without the use of verbs (as in, Me to make camp fire speech type). And that is pretty much the extent of the cast because Lassie's salary was probably too big to hire someone else. A kind of blunt. not very interesting and tad too dark. In no way is this a great movie.
