Amando DeOssorio never wanted to leave a lack of budget in the way of telling one of his stories. His "Blind Dead" series started great, but she had some really funny moments, such as shots of a small model ship in the "The Ghost Galleon". In "The Sea Serpent", he hits the bottom and takes some notable actors along with him, telling the story of a silly sock monster that brings google-eyed horror to several water tanks and miniature aquariums. The indefinite opening sequence launches the stage and demonstrates a broken military mission where for some unknown reason US pilots launch an atomic bomb (roughly drawn into the film frame) somewhere in the ocean off the coast of Spain. The military commander gives this order from an office that has a prominent American flag and a portrait of an upset looking Ronald Reagan, one of the few things that really feels like the 1980s. The other two are cheerfully incompetent subtitle that declares the year to be "1.985" and Tyria Power is dated Sheena Easton's hairstyle, which would look really cool next to some ripped neon sweats. One of the kookiest monsters you'll ever see rises from the depths of the bomb-blasted explosion. We learned that a crazy atomic bomb killed many local fish. Unfortunately for our cast, it has no effect on the Sea Serpent, which is rapidly falling off the coast of Spain for some miniature set-chaos. Now that I'm saying the monster is unrealistic, I'm not exaggerated. It's not just a "kind of" false view. I'm sure the filmmakers have done the best with ten dollars that seem to have been allocated, but mostly they seemed to be made of Crayola, ping pong and old socks. Not only does it have this sinister music that accompanies it wherever it goes, the music that sounds like the "Jaws" that it is a miracle that no one has been sued. Along with Tyria Power, Timothy Bottoms and Ray Milland, he was caught in slow motion, and the dialogue couldn't be any more derogatory. Through a series of conspiracy plots, our leading actors are thrown together in search ... well, I'm not sure what the purpose is. Bottoms and Power have to prove that the snake is real to save their butts (he is blamed for the snake-induced shipwreck, she is locked in a loony bin after observation). None of this is important because nothing has been solved by the end of the film. No one admits that the snake is real and is not dead either. In addition, Power and Bottoms are still on the lam from the law. It seems illogical that no one but our heroes know that the snake exists (despite numerous disappearances, crushed lighthouse and crushed railway bridge) and embark on a widespread non-adventurous pursuit. down and chase the monster away ... don't kill them because they know they don't match. Their big plan is to use it to scare him. Although their scheme is spoiled, the snake causes a big explosion in the water after attacking bridge support (don't ask), and the giant sea serpent is so scared that it swims away. A critical viewer would wonder why the snake wasn't frightened in the movie earlier when it caused a few big blasts after hitting the dock. It does not matter. He swims away and our heroes are sure he is gone forever. End. I can only imagine the horror that the stars felt when they saw the finished film they were working on. The lamebraine scenario and several firing reaction shots could never prepare them for the embarrassment of sharing the screen with a split sock puppet / stop motion beastie. At least the supporting figures had to have fun screaming and pretending to be swallowed by a huge snake's head. I'm not sure what's going on when they made this movie; the monster is cheap, but there are a few rather complicated miniature sets so somebody has spent some time taking care of them, not to mention outdated animation. It seems to have played straight, though maybe my sense of humor has gone over my head. In the end, the film is nothing but an easy target for a drunken commentary. Check out the party to get the best results.
