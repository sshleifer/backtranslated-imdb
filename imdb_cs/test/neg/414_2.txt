I'm a historian. This movie is so bad it hurts. They tried to watch with an open mind, but if you dive into a movie or anything else, then at least a bit of homework in history, places, church protocol, etc. Stop playing a stupid audience, please. There are those of us who have put on their shoes and went to the theater when something like this kind of theatrical release comes to town. A little research, everything I ask. But again, the book on which it is based is somewhat funny in itself. So they basically took a novel with many mistakes and decided to make it a screenplay, pouring millions and millions of dollars and millions of dollars into it and making an incredibly supported world distributed theater release, and no time at all for little research on it lots. Do I know a few of my colleagues who would do it just for credit alone, or at least give it to a group of students to do a few weeks to explore different aspects? Or just pay someone knowledgeable a few dollars just to run through it because trust me, there are plenty of starving historians out there who would jump on the opportunity if they introduced themselves.
