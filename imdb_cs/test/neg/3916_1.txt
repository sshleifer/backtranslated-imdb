Oh dear! ohdear! ohdear! ohdear! <br /> <br /> I love science fiction, but this ... er ... 'movie' just gives you a swipe to shame. Every sci-fi movie I've seen over the past year has been somewhat disappointing and now I seriously reevaluate the genre of movies I like in the future !! (Maybe I'll watch romance flicks from now!) <br /> <br /> SPOILERS ALERT! (And it doesn't say that much!) <br /> <br /> This movie is so absurdly stupid that it rival the Earth's battlefield and Baby Geniuses in utter badness. The special effects are obviously fake, Big Mac Truck looked down with roller coaster seats, killer robots looked like an idiotic version of the Power Rangers. .. Space Truck School ??? WTF? Mr. Hopper can do better than this. What actually stunk were two good looking young things that accompany him and run around in nothing but their underpants (??) for two-thirds of the film! The obligatory "sex scene" (snicker!) Between our young heroes was so badly made that I almost choked on my tonsils on the TV screen. The only note worth mentioning is the captain of a pirate ship / cyborg / mad scientist. He spilled the word grotesque and was predictably slim, but I believe he could have been much more frightening. He does and says things that are pretty funny (all the best scenes include him!), So I'm giving this captain an extra point for the captain. But this movie is so bad that you will want to throw TV abuse or maybe throw a TV out of the window! He can even kill several brain cells and get you into a catatonic state. <br /> <br /> CONCLUSION? I like the way the captain tries to walk on his leg when it's obviously a false foot! I would give it 0 out of 10, but because it tears me with its folded antique ... this movie gets 1/10!
