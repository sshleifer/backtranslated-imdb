A few weeks ago I saw the movie El Padrino (2004) with the "The Latin Godfather" in the film theater. How did we become lame, I thought, Latin just because he was a Mexican? Let me remind you that any Latin comes from Latia, or is associated with it, Italy, so the original Godfather is more Latin than the Mexican Godfather, and that's why: We are Latin American because we speak Spanish , a language based in Latin that originated in Rome now in Italy. So placing a brand in a movie poster, such as a "Latin godfather", is not just ignorant, of course, if we try to link this film to the original godfather, but a desperate and uncreative attempt to get some credit by copying the title of the film classic. Now about the movie, I just hate overacting so from 1 to 10 I think it's 3 most.
