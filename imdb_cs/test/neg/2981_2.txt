I saw this movie coming out and couldn't wait to see it. I must say, I was very disappointed. That would be better than a mini-series. The whole exhibition seemed to be rushed. They didn't explain things very clearly. Finally, they showed John Paul II, the Living and Healthy and the other scene he died. No explanation of what happened. (We all know what happened in real life) I think ABC released a big time ball on something that could be great. In all, I think this movie was blurry. It looked like a drunken monkey jumping from one place in John Paul's life to another point and never explaining how it happened. When his older brother left, it was never explained that his brother was a doctor and therefore left home. Also, when his father dies, all we see is his father lying on the floor and that was it. I was very disappointed with the film.
