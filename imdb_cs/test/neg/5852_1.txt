I don't know if I'm wrong, or all els'es, who says this movie is good, are sincerely wanting to do a favor to people who have doubts about seeing it, renting it or getting worse (no Do it Really) !). Trailers and very early previews may seem fun in some way or another, but it's not funny at all. - laughter scenes that tend to get into really bad jokes, bad very bad games, no tastes, cheesy effects; This movie has everything, everything wrong, that is. As a final commentary, the movie would be humorous with the basic concept, but believe me it's really far from it.
