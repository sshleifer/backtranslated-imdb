Do you think 'Charmed' with testosterone instead of estrogen and you have a general idea about this picture. A very lame story with average effects and anti-climax end up letting the door open for part 2. Hopefully someone makes sense to spend their money wiser. I would suggest "Charmed - Movie" because compared to this "Charmed" kicked my ass and I just watched the show please my girlfriend !!!! Wait and watch it on DVD on Sunday when you have something to do. Or even better download so you don't have to waste money. The first 15 minutes were fine. But the funniest line of the movie and also the only peak of this movie is when Reid says "Kiss my Harry Potter" while driving a cliff. Although they are not worthy to kiss Potter's ass because Potter is so cold and at least his films have a story. The Goblet of Fire was even more frightening!
