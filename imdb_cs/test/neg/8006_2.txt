I was fascinated by reading the views of "circus" from "amazing, breathtaking, brilliant" and most things among the true candidate for Golden Turkey. I'm in the second camp. Apparently, the producers thought that if they mixed a lot of excessive violence with a four-letter explode, they would have another "Lock, Stock, and Two". Smoking Barrels on Hands. Too bad they forgot to include wit, style, charm and taste. And it was definitely a mistake when you visited the classic Welles' "Lady of Shanghai", which reminded us how better a cinema could be. John Hannah turns off his shirt on every occasion, a huge American drives the Mini Minor as "Circus" pathetically straining cult status, and even the beautiful Amanda Donohoe can't add any class to this procedure. <br /> <br /> If you want to see a good Brit movie try noble 'Wonderland'
