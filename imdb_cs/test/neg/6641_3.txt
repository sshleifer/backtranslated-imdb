This movie is stupid. It's not around it. But so are Dumb and Dumber. Remember that Stupid and Dumber is much more fun. However, for one love I see Tail Sting and laughs with a group of good friends as bad as that. Call me heartless, but look at this movie, and you'll find that the only way you can laugh is when you laugh at it instead.
