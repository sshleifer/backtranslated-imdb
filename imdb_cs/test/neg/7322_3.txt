This movie is about the meaning of 'Ozzie & Harriet' or 'Father Knows Best' episode. An old copy of Reader's Digest (circa 1962) would give more insight into modern life, or a relationship between father and daughter than this strange mixture. Diane Keaton surprised me. He seems to be going through the movie. (Given the title of the film, I realize that her role was supportive, but Martin Short has mastered a distinctive, supportive character.) <br /> <br /> I understand the appeal of an imaginary world created in good romantic comedy. But this movie is a prozac version of the imaginary world. I'm scared when I think that pure fantasy can enjoy it.
