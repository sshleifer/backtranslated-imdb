This proves how awful the WB network has been in the last years of its existence. Of course, as a homeschooler, I condemn this show for her ridiculous, fantasy country, dark and indecent stereotypes that kids are "weird hippies who are so smart they're stolen from super-cool high school students". I apologize to television writers, the world, as seen from the inside of your ass (containing your heads apparently when you wrote this show), is not a world that talented people see with our eyes when we live in a little thing called reality. For those who really liked this show ... please, dear sweet Jesus PLEASE read the statement that you really liked this crap on a very long walk. Acting is even more hollow, false and wooden than the stereotypes on which the whole show was built. I thank WB for doing the right thing and bringing this horse out of its initial suffering. This show should never have had the privilege that I did, just as much as eight terrible episodes. I really hope that these actors finally got a clue and stopped playing TV shows as soon as this show ended.
