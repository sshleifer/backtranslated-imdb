I was looking forward to spending part of the Independence Day weekend watching a good movie about Jefferson. This movie wasn't. It was long enough, drawn, boring and unbalanced. Too much time was devoted to exploring Jefferson's relationship with Cosway and not enough time for his relationship with Sally Hemmings. The lady who played Sally, Thandie Newton, was terrible. Her performances were so bad that it was as if I was watching the A1 attempt to recite Shakespeare. Her constant voice whined in nerves! Nolte's accent was Jefferson as an ignorant man, rather than a genius. Jefferson's relationship with his daughters and their feelings for slavery was also underdeveloped, but the rising of his eldest daughter (Patsy) is a key event late in the film. The movie was too long and the script lacked energy and excitement. Positively, the costumes were pretty beautiful and Greta Scacchi played the role of Cosway well. If you want to watch a movie about the revolutionary era and / or Jefferson, then watch 1776, it's much better than Jefferson in Paris.
