This episode has just aired in the UK. What a disappointment. Heavy humor wounds were poorly condemned, childish and humiliated by what could have been a pretty good story. I can't believe Jerry Bruckheimer allowed this episode. I have seen every previous episode of this show, and even an episode where Jack played his own older self was the way before this episode. Lesbian kiss was pathetic sensational. Also, there was no continuity from the previous episode. There was nothing in the story to investigate Martin's dangerous behavior or possible drug addiction. Similarly, nothing was explicitly written about Jack's growing relationship with Ann. Usually Without Trace is pretty good with this kind of continuity. The next episode must be a significant improvement.
