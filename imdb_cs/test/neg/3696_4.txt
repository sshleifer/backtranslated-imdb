I was wondering if I had watched it since it was cited as the worst movie in the world dedicated to the sci-fi film in the 1950s in the British magazine from the early 1980s entitled "Film" (by the way, the film guide Leonard Maltin ). BOMB). When she appeared on DVD last year, I started to be interested in buying the "Cult Camp Classics" box she was included in (along with QUEEN OF OUTER SPACE [1958] and GIANT BEHEMOTH [1959]); However, since he recently bought QUEEN on DVD-R, I gave the paid idea. Fortunately, I came across a DivX movie - however, the print was not excluded from the Warners DVD (which supposedly boasts a surprisingly nice view of transmission), but rather a muddy TV printâ€¦ though not so much that the detail lose (in other words, it was like watching a movie in sepia as opposed to black and black-white!). Anyway, to get to the point: I have to admit, in a way, I was disappointed that the film wasn't a laugh I was expecting all the time (Maltin calls it "horribly horrible"); in fact, I found it quite engaging - and fortunately brief for just over an hour in length. Some undeniably fun pieces, however, remain - for example, when an old nurse starts shouting her head when looking at a woman with 50 feet, and when the sheriff's deputy almost goes over his boss and chief servant in his enthusiasm to help in such an unusual case. Even the special effects did not come across as the "funniest" movie (Maltin again) on film - though they are certainly embarrassingly bad! OK, so the idea that a stranger (in a giant human form, dressed in cave men's rags and radioactive to boot!) coming to Earth in a large spherical spacecraft (!) and apparently after a valuable one the necklace of the heroine is utter nonsense - and its quasi-transparent look is not a favor at all ... but in reality it is a human story that holds our attention (relatively speaking). The false husband's character is not very interesting, but his two women are: a rich but annoying alcoholic wife Allison Hayes and an ambitious, kind friend Yvette Vickers. Hayes' loyal servant (already mentioned), a few cops (one of them, as mentioned elsewhere, kindly goofy) and so many doctors (one of whom is called Dr. Cushing [!] And another specialist who is called when Hayes begins to grow after exposure to radiation). Of course, the movie can be seen as an inverted female version of INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN (1957) - though it would not be fair to compare these two because the classic Jack Arnold / Richard Matheson is far more psychological / intellectual in approach; In fact, Hayes doesn't seem to be bothered by her "fitness" and actually uses it to teach her husband a lesson! However, her rampage - exaggerated in the movie posters of the era - is somewhat quaint (especially when considering it only occurs in the last ten minutes or so); when the damage caused by her enormous but highly unconvincing hand (especially when lifting a puppet that was supposed to be her husband!) has not been shown, she is usually seen in long shots and almost from behind (with a size that contradicts buildings contrary to buildings). passing by) !! Nevertheless, Hayes' demise (when it hits an electrical cable) is competently executed. Finally, I followed his remake in 1993 with Daryl Hannah as a titular creature - which I rented specifically for that purpose.
