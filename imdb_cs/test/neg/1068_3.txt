This film was thinking of me ... about how I could write about it without personally spoiling the director and all the actors who, as an Australian, am proud to have actually performed there and made a film. > <br /> But the movie itself? Let me tell you a story .... <br /> <br /> Yesterday I found this DVD in my local rental office and had vague memories of reviews at the time of the cinema release, so I thought I'd give it a go. For some reason, I decided to watch "special features" before watching a real movie, not something I usually do. I stopped doing "halfway" because I had enough of a twist on "we're not so amazing we put together such a hard film with such a raw script." <br /> <br /> Film? Ugh. Full of clich√©s and pathetic character development. Actors? Okay, guys, you're Aussies and I applaud you. And just like a swordsman team is just as good as the coach who drives them, unfortunately you didn't have a great work scenario. I felt that the film really trivialized so many items it seemed to want to cover. I have seen many reviews that refer to it as soap. Approved. Finally (and forgive me if I didn't say it right), I was very disappointed that there were no optimistic impulses at all. Yes, we all know that life is full of hard things, and yes we know things like incest do, but it's really hard for me to applaud a movie that has no pleasure in it. I think the director is responsible for putting it there. Otherwise, the film about THEM and THEIR is their feelings they have created for themselves, not for the audience. <br /> <br /> What I think is the basis why this film is not that big. Special features indicate that the director wrote the script in a 36-hour session, the day after he himself tried to end his life. Well, it may have been austerity for him to do it, but the film will be a pleasure to know when you know the story of why it was written. "I feel terrible, I will write a film about how I feel terrible." (Note: I have read the interview with Andrew Urban and understood why Thalluri needed to write something that would help him in his own problems, but I believe there is a line in the film that cannot be overcome - the line of film making for your own emotional needs , and I believe it is what happened here randomly. <br /> <br /> The director did not have any technical experience at all with his own confession, and unfortunately it makes the film look like nothing more than a year twelve media project . As for all the recommendations that this movie should be studied at school, or that all teenagers should watch - not sure there is one. Because at the end is a very dangerous line. I, too, was in a place where I thought someone who might no longer "face life" was "happy," but as an adult, I fear that this line might affect a young viewer who was in a vulnerable position. mood. It could be there to support the debate, but again it does not reflect the possibility of redemption or joy in this story as a whole. In fact, it almost indicates that more sadness will come. I haven't seen an Elephant yet, but I can find it if I compare it all. Nothing personal here guys, I hope one day you can make another movie and we all have to start somewhere, so forgive me if I was too rough. I'm glad you're proud of what you created, which is life. It's not a movie I would recommend. But the whole "It's quiet you have to watch" - we already know.
