If you want to see how to destroy a movie, study it very carefully. In fact, it's so bad that people should only buy it for this reason. Especially note how most scenes look like they are dropped in 5 minutes. Realism escapes this film on every level. The overall impression is that someone got a below average scenario, would-be actor, average director and absolutely no budget. With such a formula it just had to be doomed. I rented it once and I swear I watched it. If you are a humanitarian worker, buy this horrible, horrible film and burn it - UNLIMITED - as a favor to the world. He has no recognizable plot, bad behavior, and then throws something about the bad ugly women to make it all go. I would recommend observing how the paint dries before this silly waste of tape! Seriously. The color would be better. I wish I could give this negative 10 stars.
