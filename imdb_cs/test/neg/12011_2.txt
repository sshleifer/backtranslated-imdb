"Problem Child" was fine movie, but does it really deserve a sequel? I don't think so. The original film was merely a redeemable benefit of Gilbert Gottfried and was not good at this sequel. <br /> <br /> I can't really put my finger on why this movie was bad. To begin with, it just wasn't funny. Even if I saw it as a nine-year-old, I didn't even agree with Junior (Michael Oliver). His character came out as fragile, self-confident, and perhaps most important, a rebel without a clue. He seemed to hate every woman his father Ben (John Ritter) dated to hate them. It also does not send good news to children with divorced parents (who now account for more than half of the children in the US) when one woman Ben decides to (almost) marry a southern aristocrat who is vindictive and who happens to hate children as it is. And as I thought it would be to see the original friend of SNL cast Laraine Newman return to the big screen, she couldn't even save this movie. I also found it strange to be southern d√©butante, whose name was Lawanda. That sounds more like an African American woman. But of course it has nothing to do with why I didn't like this movie. I think the movie didn't work because you had antagonists you should hate, along with the protagonists you shouldn't have anticipated. hate. John Ritter's character was supposed to be a good parent who desperately tried to teach his child properly without following an authoritarian parenting. Instead, he came not only as a stupid parent, but also one who desperately sought a woman in a few days, no matter how well he knew the woman. Did I mention that it sends a bad news to the children of divorced parents? In short, the rest of the things that went wrong with this movie included Amy Yasbeck's unnecessary and inexplicable return to play a completely different character, the young girl who was even more uncomfortable than Junior, totally devious for humor toilets, and even outrageous and outdated homophobic humor (including doggies). The film was just a mess, and it really doesn't deserve a DVD if it hasn't been given yet. It should just knock on VHS along with all the other bad comedies that are forgotten.
