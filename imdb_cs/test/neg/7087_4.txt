I have surely noticed this movie because it is a 1950s sci-fi movie - one of my favorite genres. Unfortunately, when I was looking forward to bug-eyed aliens or power-insane conquerors, the aliens in this movie were a major disappointment! First of all, you only see very briefly at the beginning (and looked pretty ordinary) and you're just a little glimpse of the spacecraft! Second, the alien was neither a bad conqueror nor a benevolent friend of mankind - but a real strange ball. Finally, it seemed that the conspiracy seemed so stupid, preaching and cumbersome that it caused more yawning than excitement. As the film begins, five people from five different parts of the world (Germany, Britain, Russia, China and the US) are kidnapped by a stranger. The alien gives each of them a device to destroy all life on the planet if they choose to - because the alien admits that HIS race of people would like to live in the Earth, but they will not kill themselves to get it. Then they will return them all. While it is 100% obvious that no one wants to use these devices, the alien will then announce the identity of the five on the television without saying the weapons are ALSO MORNING! So all the militarists in the world want to find five and force them to reveal how weapons work. Much of the rest of the film is made up of some of the five that are hiding and one tortured to reveal how it works - how the Soviets want to use it! This part of the movie looked pretty stupid. Sure, the USSR was a bad and corrupt nation (sorry, but it is a fact - especially under Stalin), they would never think they would use it as in a movie! Later, one in five (a German scientist) somehow discovers that devices can also be used to kill only all people who hate freedom. Therefore, he uses it to wipe out all the evil comedies and probably others who have been against freedom and the world has become a paradise !! Preachy, a stupid and full plot of holes - this film is not worth your time, even if it is an interesting relic simply for the way it addresses communism - especially the tensions between NATO and the Soviets.
