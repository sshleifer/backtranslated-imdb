The most positive points in this movie were credits (text style) and some moments of acting Ice-T. Story; Two rival gangs that have had to fight it, with a partial plot of betrayal, power and change are well-worn lands, but in this case painful (very) going through. Dilapidated scenery that added mild credibility in places, and controversial lighting, constantly distracted from any interest / identification with characters (the shine from the actress / nose's head was blinding, not to mention other scenes with the same problem). Even in the middle of the movie I wanted to learn more about how and why it came apart from what was happening on the screen. Disappointment if you have seen Ice-T in other roles. Kudos to other actors / actresses who seemed to get into the role despite the weak direction; Corruption side kick and another restorer.
