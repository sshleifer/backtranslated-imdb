"Balaclava" does not deliver goods. This half-baked mafia comedy boasts a stellar cast, including Joe Mantegna, Kevin Pollack, Joe Pantoliano, Jennifer Tilly, and Seymour Cassel, along with a number of faces known to those watching crime movies. he never was. Writer and director Mark Malone, best known for writing "Dead of Winter" for director "Bonnie & Clyde" by Arthur Penn, has created a potboiler for pedestrians who has a sick but vindictive boss, Louie Martinelli (Seymour Cassel), who broadcasts his Angel's son (Joe Mantegna of "The House of Games") to go Carmine DellaRosa. Looks like a rival bomb that has been bombed by one of the pop stores (in the opening scene) and Martinelli wants a return. The trouble is that no one has any idea who Carmine DellaRosa is. In any other mob comedy, such a complication could be fun, but here it is simply plain. Angelo and the load of Wiseguys, including his best friend Rudy (Kevin Pollack of "Deterrence"), spend half the time trying to figure out who Carmine is. Neither Rudy nor Angelo want to play a hit, so they track down the crazy crowd hit Charlie (Joe Pantoliano from "Bad Boys") to do a dirty deed. Before they can convince Charlie to hit him, he must find him and Charlie's slutty wife Mary (Jennifer Tilly of "Bound") reveals he's locked up in a psychiatric hospital. Our misfit heroes go to a psychiatric hospital and break Charlie. Approximately half of the film is over before finding out that Carmine is a baby in shorts (Vincent Berry) who is harmless and harmless. Indeed, Carmine has the only decent line in the movie. As our mindless game of heroes turned away from his house with him in the back seat to take care of the business, Carmine warns them that they need to get him home in time, or his father kills him. Charlie tries to freeze the hedgehog, but he can't. Instead, he reconnects with his feelings and wants to return to a psychiatric hospital to report good news to his doctor. Meanwhile, when Charlie decides not to shoot Carmine, the child gets his paws on the gun and jumps out of several aimless wheels. Angelo and he are fighting for automatic. The gun slips out of their collective hands and hits the ground, extinguishes and throws a hole in Rudy's chest. Keep in mind that Rudy never wanted the guy to shoot in the first place and Angelo argued that the hit was bad. Rudy throws herself to the ground with such a deadly injury, while Angelo tries to stop the bleeding. Talk about the dark scene of death. Angelo contradicts himself because his father has ordered the intervention, and Angelo fears that Dad will do it if he doesn't take orders. There is a flashback subplot about Angelo's father teaching him how to handle a gun that provides some insight into Angelo's unwillingness to wrap the gun. There is nothing remotely redeemed about this depressing comedy with Downer Ends. Things get worse and if you last 90 minutes of nonsense, you'll see what I mean. Comedy is very laughing. Good actors are secretly in superficial roles that are not even funny. Maybe director Malone was trying to make another comedy like "The Gang That Cannot Shoot Straight." If he was, he missed a mile. Big-breasted Jennifer Tilly shows a cleavage and growls over a few scenes with Mantegna, but does nothing else. She is a stereotypical whore who is not even naked. Payday is the only way to explain the presence of such a talented cast, otherwise this image is pathetic from start to finish. Initially, I was hoping it could be a "Ransom of Red Chief" knockoff where a boy drives wise nuts, but no such luck here. The biggest surprise, of course, is that he has to kill a child, but it is not such a kind of surprise that he would like to follow you up to his resolution. <br /> <br /> Did I actually buy this movie from a Canadian DVD label? Sevilla ?? and contains only the most basic special features. If you hate thumbnails that divide the plot, don't watch the trailer. If you ever meet Joe Mantegna, one of your first questions should be the reason he helped produce this gaping. He is neither cheerful nor dramatic. There are no quoted lines and none of the characters stand out as interesting or likeable. Seville's DVD is a full frame movie with no captions or closed captions.
