Actually, I came into this movie with some expectations, not because I thought the movie sounded particularly good, but because I am a fan of Italian exploitation and a cast that sees Franco Nero and Telly Savalas starring Oliver Twist. it must have been interesting at least. Well ... RedNeck has one or two positive things, but mostly; it is a boring, lifeless movie that is as ridiculous as it is unnecessary. The plot simply focuses on two criminals (Nero and Savalas) who kidnap a young child (Oliver). The twist in the story is that the child realizes he would have more fun if he got into a "gang". Telly Savalas and Franco Nero are two actors who have proven that they can carry the film on their own on several occasions and have some unforgettable moments in this film - though for all the wrong reasons. Especially Savalas gives a stupid depiction of a "bad" criminal. The plot doesn't go wrong, but since nothing interesting happens, it's not really a positive point and doesn't save from film to average. Overall, I cannot recommend this film; It may appeal to some for its iconic value, but it did nothing for me.
