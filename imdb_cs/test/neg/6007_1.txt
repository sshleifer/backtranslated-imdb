overrated, misspelled, misbehaved. was the academy watching this? I think not. political content ensured her an Oscar nomination - indo-then border - little boy, terrorism. Something with the word "terrorist" gets attention in <br /> <br /> this post 9-11 world. Its like the Holocaust movies that are guaranteed Oscar nominations regardless of their merits. and please cinematography does not mean filming a landscape that is primarily nice. you have to be a rotten shooter to spoil the desert. at least it didn't win an Oscar. at least they had the right. it would be indignation.
