The success of the original French series "Emmanuelle" (I saw only the first one, which was not too bad when thinking) led to imitation imitations; the Italian counterpart, which even changed his heroine's race, was clearly less polished and more exploitative - descending more and more into vulgarity as the series continued. Incredibly, there were a total of 16 Black Emanuelle movies, with the heroine, even though her name changed to avoid copyright issues !! Yet Laura Gemser - the titular object of desire - has become almost as big as the icon of the original Emmanuelle, Sylvia Kristel (though she is too skinny for my taste)! She is even billed here as "Emanuelle" rather than with her real name - she also becomes "Albert Thomas" with the director! The film itself has little interest in it: in fact, it would be best to approach it as a travelogue with some dignified footage of African wildlife. As for sex scenes, I don't know how the full version I watched was, but while there was a lot of nudity, none of it was too explicit - or even titillating (the scene that came closest, maybe when Gemser was working as photographer, and her companion Karin Schubert, turns the camera on herself, naturally sans clothes in the middle of the jungle)! The film also includes an artist who looked like Salvador Dali, but his mercifully perhaps his scenes do not suffer much time. Score Nico Fidenco is usually bland 70. pop and really nothing to write home about.
