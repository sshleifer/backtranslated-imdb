The German regional radio station WDR showed both "general" and ODC. On Saturday I saw "General" and I thought it wasn't too bad, but it was too good. But yesterday I saw the ODC and after an hour I turned it off. Although Kevin Spacey was a major actor, the film was totally confusing and seems to be restless. "General" told the story straight and ordered, but the ODC just wanted to be fine. There is a reference to Guy Ritchie's movies "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" but he doesn't have the Coolness of these movies. So, at the end I would rate it 3 out of 10!
