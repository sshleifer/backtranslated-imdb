The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it shows bands and their music when they change in NY during '81. As for the film itself, it has at least three major drawbacks. First, there is a narrative that is not required at all. In a few places where some explanation is needed, a little dialogue would be needed. Secondly, there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any sound, in fact it is quite obvious that most of the dialogue was recorded later without attempting to adapt the film. The third mistake was at the end. I will not end for those brave souls who would endure torture to sit in a movie but commit cardinal sin in screenwriting. It is not worth the money or the time it takes if you are not a fan of one of the bands represented.
