Wild rebels are fun in the wrong way, but also frustrating because of the real good or at least functional elements in the story. He deals with a racing car driver (Steve Alaimo), who mixes in a group of cyclists called Satan's Angels, who are hiding a lot until they decide to rob a bank. Meanwhile, Alaimo returns to the police force to report on what the Angels have and where they will rob next. It's not even that the movie is really "dated", although it obviously carries substantially coarse and stupid music in the film (from the band on stage in one scene to Alaimo "performing" if you could say that a drek did it) on a regular generic score). It's just because the filmmaker doesn't have more attention than putting a little more logical, directional, and better actor into the games. As with the Hellcats, I didn't have a little bit more resistance to the movie, but I was a little indifferent. What might pass as unpredictable comes only with stupid things like the name of the city of Florida ('Citrusville' ho-ho). So it's not completely undeserved than its Mystery Science Theater 3000 status as late. The commentary is good in the movie, though I once or twice almost wanted to hear what the characters on the screen said in case it was worth it. Wild rebels might be a good time if you have six-digit and low expectations, but like me, I wouldn't look at it again.
