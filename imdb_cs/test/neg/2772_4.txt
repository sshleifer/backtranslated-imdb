What I liked most about this movie was the opportunity to see Joan Woodbury, who, as one of several beauties in the classic "Algiers", captured Charles Boyer. He's doing well as Rita, an orphan who rises to be a boss of crime. Her climb to the top reminds me of Joan Crawford's characters, such as Mildred Pierce, who realizes his ambitions with a wild determination and will. If you're looking for a film noir classic, look elsewhere. It is difficult to know where this story goes in several places. At first I got the impression that it would involve Rita's plot of revenge against her father and son who cheated her to take the rap for a drunken driving death committed by the playboy son. However, the payback time ended with only a tiny point and stepping stone to the somewhat confusing second part of the film, where Rita is becoming increasingly involved in corruption in the city. By the way, it's only 72 minutes, so the second viewing should clear all the veils. My copy comes from a platinum set of "Mobster Movies". Image quality is good, but the soundtrack sucks, constantly skips the dialogue fragments. There are eight films in the $ 5.50 box, making each movie a 69 cent. Look at Father Archer John Archer, John Archer, as Rita's friend Bob. Alan Ladd doesn't have much time on the screen. It's definitely Joan Woodbury's picture.
