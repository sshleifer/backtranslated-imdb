The rise of the undead begins when a huge nuclear explosion bursts through an unnamed US city, a few people survive in the building as they lean against the door, leaving it closed and keeping ugliness (!). They quarrel among themselves for ages, then the monster thing comes from seemingly nowhere & begins killing them one by one ... <br /> <br /> Written, produced and directed by Jason Horton & Shannon Hubbell one has to say Rise of the Undead is terrible. The script is taken very seriously, but it doesn't make sense, the first thing I asked myself was whether it was a huge thing about a nuclear explosion that was happening outside and destroying an entire city, why are these people I follow still alive? Why is it in the building? Then I asked myself when something was going to happen, the whole of the first 20 minutes taking place in one room, a little more generous hallway as the main character's argument. Then it turns into a return from a dead life (1985), which is reflected by a government created by a virus that turns people into zombies before one of the most striking, pointless and seemingly random turns I've ever seen, making most of Stalo's it's just a full waste of time. Then in the last 30 odd minutes, Rise of Undead turns into a strange sci-fi thing like something that resembles a ball of energy hovering around killing everyone, I was the only question of what a floating sphere of energy was and where it came from ? Going back to what's going on beyond what was the reason? That's true, we never said. The rise of the undead is a mess, the characters are horrible and there are no first names, the twists around the middle will have the hair tearing in frustration, the dialogue is upset, nothing is explained and there is virtually no story. The last 10 minutes (maybe a little more) with Rise of the Undead has no dialogue and the movie suddenly ends. Director Horton & Hubbell apparently worked on a low budget, the whole movie is set up about two rooms and three corridors! Photography is terrible, using annoying color filters seemingly random and sometimes it really seems that Rise of the Undead was filmed on the camcorder. There are no special effects, some false blood sprays around them, but they don't talk about any real makeup effects. There are some CGI shots of the city being buried in flames that look fine, but the floating sphere of energy creature thing looks terrible. There is one lousy shot soon in place where two people sit against the wall of the hallway and speak, for some bizarre reason their heads are cut off at the top of the screen! Only their lower bodies from the neck down are visible, but nothing else happens in the frame, they do not move and there is nothing else but for some strange reason their heads are cut off the top of the frame as they talk to each other! It's really weird to watch in reality. <br /> <br /> With an ultra-low budget of around $ 10,000 and an IMDb image in two weeks, I have to congratulate the creators for getting Rise of the Undead and distributing it, but that's where my congratulations stop because otherwise It has terrible production values ​​& is set in about three corridors that are located somewhere in New Orleans, Louisiana, as it is where Rise of the Undead was shot. Acting sucks, so I won't dwell on it. The rise of the undead sucks, it sounds like a zombie movie, but in all honestly it is not, all about it is under par & I know the filmmakers worked on a low budget, but it is not really an excuse when it comes to me . Definitely not recommended.
