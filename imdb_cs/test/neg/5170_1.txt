There is no doubt that the Kokoda Trail depicts a really big event in Australian military history the brave defense of Australia against the cruel barbaric Japanese army. This film does not take into account the story of "Fuzzy Wuzzy" or New Guinea. that the Australians helped them carry out military operations there. The film also does not provide a trustworthy Australian soldier account and behavior in this event. It is more like an uninformed contemporary view of what it was. The Australian film industry has once again failed to make this important chapter in Australia's history, the one it deserves. This is a movie that is in the worst case with any cinematography, bad script and dialogue, no character development and a jungle clichÃ©. The audience does not interfere with another meaningful perspective than the Japanese armies of ruthless and cruel murderers of poorly equipped and poorly trained groups of Australians fighting in the jungle. The film failed because most Australian films attract a significant Australian audience in the fact that they stayed far in horror. Br /> <br /> I'm not joining the usual parish waste when I say it's great because it's an Australian movie. I say either a great job or just leave it to someone who knows how. This government-funded film is just another failure of the rich and spoiled rich children of Australia. I'm giving her zero stars because it's an offense to the descendants of these really big Australians and their huge victims. What is shameful waste and disrespect, and I know that this review will provoke more negativity from the film crew and most reviewers, but I have a right to my opinion and that is what the Australians fought for OUR FREEDOM, including freedom of expression and the right to express opinion .
