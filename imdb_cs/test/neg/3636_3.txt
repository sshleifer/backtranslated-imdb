The only time I actually laughed when I was watching this show is when I'm kidding. Jamie Lynn Spears got only an acting job for her big sister and I don't think anyone can argue with me about it. There is no expression in her face (even if she smiles) - just watch the show and see what I mean. Let's talk about the show. Zoey 101 is one of the most unreal shows I've ever seen! As many people have said, Zoey Brooks is absolutely perfect: everyone loves her, she is a direct student and all boys think she is "hot". The PCA is a boarding school full of wealthy children, giving all students flat-screen TVs and laptops that serve sushi kids from a sushi bar. In one of the latest episodes, Zoey is absolutely clueless and thinks Chase is not in love with her, and acts like she doesn't want Chase to love her. Then, when she plunges into Chase's dorm room to prove her friends are bad, she finds Chase kissing this girl named Rebecca. Zoey, of course, is scared, probably because she likes Chase. By the way, just watch this show if you have nothing else to do and the only thing on TV is Zoey 101. You can at least have fun laughing how unreal it is!
