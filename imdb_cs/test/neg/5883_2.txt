I expected it to be cheerful and at best it would be average, the only funny character is, believe it or not Andy Dick. Timing on most jokes and gags was horrible, and writing was bad, I think I know it's supposed to be like blaxploitation, but it just worked. besides this whole genre he was already defeated to death, with all the Austin films and the secret brother, it just looks old, but also feels like a rip off from a secret brother (who was also not hysterical but much more fun than this). Also, for the comedy / action film, the direction was a bit dull. I don't know if it will be released in theaters, but it is for television.
