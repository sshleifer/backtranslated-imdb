I think my summary says it all. This MTV-ish response to the classic Candid Camera TV show features Gen X (or it's Gen Y) type putting into fake helicopters and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses, and setting people in quite unreal, though often not very interesting situations . Example: Kennedy has a guy to invite his parents to his "wedding". Kennedy is the bride, she made a full wedding dress and a long wig. The "joke" is that parents immediately understand that their son marries a man who claims he no longer has his "bits and pieces". The problem is that this schtick goes too long, of course to fill the time. And Kennedy is about as funny as dead cod lying in the sun. Candid Camera would run three or four scenarios at the time Kennedy was able to run through this system. I know the show wasn't for me. It was made for 12-year-old pinheads who think that JACKASS is the height of comedy today. So let's laugh. Thank God the show was short.
