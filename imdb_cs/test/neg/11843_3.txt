I bought a DVD collection (9 films for 10 euros) where this movie was included. It turned out to be a "full version" of what it means. In addition to the low average quality and the short scenes, one thing was really strange - a soft sex scene. It started up close to two larger breasts. After about 2 minutes I had a look on my face that matched "boooooooooooooring!" quite perfectly. 7.5 minutes that you don't even hit concrete like breasts (at this point the term breast is a bad choice), it's far behind fun. <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie was more like "people aren't / that / stupid, is it?"
