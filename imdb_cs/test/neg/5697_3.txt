I would normally say I loved this movie, not for playing, although it was OK.not for the script that was so-so. The reason I would normally love this movie is for an intense action that starts from getting go and Do not end up until the final roll.But credit, the problem with this film, and I felt it was a big deal, was a terrible CGI.it seems to run out of money and couldn't complete the effects of the shots. many lime look effects are in their harshest form.since it is obvious that they did not have enough money to finish the movie, they should not have released it.i the real effects of insulting.it seem obvious that they didn't care about making a decent end product for the consumer. If it wasn't for that, I would give this movie a much higher rating.my vote for Air Panic is 3/10
