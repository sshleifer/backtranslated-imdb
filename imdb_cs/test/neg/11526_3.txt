Russian space station "Avna" with a crew of four Russians and two Americans threatens to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere within days. Russia asks NASA to help rescue a stranded crew, and NASA embarks on Space Shuttle Atlantis. The NSA is also interested in "Prometheus", a prototype of a microwave energy source that is being tested on board "Avna" and organized so that one of their men is on a mission. This is a conspiracy. Less important things. The Space Station and Space Shuttle are the same, extraordinarily obvious models used in 'Fallout', 'Memorial Day' and 'Dark Breed' (and I think there are a few more movies). The effects of the model are so obvious throughout the film and make the film look very sixty. The kits are a little better, but they are up to the 1980s for what is supposedly a brand new station built by an American company (which later comes as part of a plot to destroy "Avnu" and "Prometheus" and apply for insurance. The scenario has a few good moments ( including Yuri's farewell and little spiel at the end), but otherwise it's quite bland and sub-standard, acting is fine, the only real standout show comes from Alex Vead, who offers some of the movies. "Ice-T is Ice-T," said Nuff, but the movie offers some surprises that I don't want to spoil. /> <br /> Certainly one of the best sci-fi movies that's currently set, but it's not the best but it's not the best, instead rent another sci-fi movie 'Stranded'.
