I'm ashamed of actually going to the theater to watch this movie when it was first released. Although I suppose that his thin veiled depiction of the story of Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy is well done, it is a film that should never be created in the first place; therefore, my low rating. The movie chronicles the story of a rich Greek business shark called Theo Tomasis, who woos and wins a beautiful young widow, Liz Cassidy, from a slain American president. Sounds familiar? Yes, everything except names. <br /> <br /> Casting is not wrong. Anthony Quinn is playing perfection for the Greek tycoon, and at least it is a consolation when he read that Ari himself had asked Quinn for his role. Of course, Jacqueline Bisset is beautiful and sophisticated in the section (for all intents and purposes) Jackie and James Franciscus have all the American good looks of the president. This movie I haven't seen since it came out, nor do I want to see it again. It seems to me that I remember a little bad language and some general cruelty. Otherwise, I think it is a sensational and supposedly intimate look at the lives of the rich and famous jet aircraft returning to their yachts, beaches, pools, etc. Yes, the scenery of the Greek islands is a spectacular, best part of the film. <br /> <br /> I suppose it's okay. There are no endings to the Kennedys TV movies that I admit to tune at times and not to my credit. This is basically just another. Far better for Aristotle and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis to relax.
