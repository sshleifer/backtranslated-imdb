yeesh, talk about craptastic.this thing is brutal.horrible voice dubbing, even more horrible acting and no recognizable plot. Long I endured feeling more like a root canal than a movie. \ tI suppose I could quickly advance it, and I encourage you to do the same if you have very extreme pain tolerance or your masochist. \ t From this stuff, so I probably make some dental surgeries without anesthetics just reliving the migraine.bottom line, terrible. 0/10
