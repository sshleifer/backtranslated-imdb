The film is a gross distortion of Orthodox lifestyle and practice. NEVER a Jewish court will enforce divorce between childless couples. Although the concept exists in Jewish law, the conditions are too numerous for it to ever take place. Childless couples think that it is difficult to cope with childlessness in a community where children are a very important part of life, but nowhere are they "rejected" by their community, as stated in the film. It is treated with extreme sensitivity. In fact, many great rabbis have lived their lives without children and have never considered divorce. The portrayal of Yosef, a terrible human being, may - perhaps subconsciously - show the behavior of a typical orthodox man. male. In fact, it is so typical that a violent rapist is typical of secular society. They both exist in their own worlds and both are despicable. It is surprising that so many people shape their views on a film-based society (someone who is personally biased towards the community). I always thought it was just orthodox, because of their narrow-minded nature and island life-style, who judged all secular people on the basis of the violence and immoral behavior they had learned in the newspapers or seen in movies.
