This derivative erotic thriller will remain observable most of the time, mainly because the viewer is curious to see how it turns out, and because the director, Peter Hall, manages a pretty hot (and courageous) sex scene on the scene. But the finale, though unexpected, is pointless, and the whole drawing (complete with childhood traumas and disorders of more personalities) turns out to be unbearably clich√©, especially in terms of motivation.
