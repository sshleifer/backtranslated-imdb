He saw it as part of the DC Reel Affirmations Film Festival. I hope they have better films than this, because this film could not fulfill any hopes that the audience could have enjoyed, from fantasy to see James Franco without a shirt, to simple wishes such as decent acting, coherent direction, character development or real production value . Annoyed by the effects of film school like freeze frames to show moments of emotional anxiety, and obvious influences ranging from My Private Private Idaho to Terminator 2, this film failed at almost every level to engage the audience. After the first twenty minutes of a brave attempt to take it seriously, the audience threw their hands together and began to look forward to the film's own indecision. I could be upset that I paid nine dollars to see it, and it was two hours that I would never return, but on the other hand it was a fun two hours that I would never return. That would be the classic Mystery Science 3000 episode.
