I'd like to sit down and write an intelligent, well thought-out review, but I think I'd spend more time in the writing process than the filmmakers did. I live in Los Angeles and I'm sorry that the characters seem to me to be so busy and too tense ACTORS. There was not one moment in the film when I could escape the feeling that I was watching an interview with unemployed actors who were in LA coffee. One of the worst "indie" movies I've ever seen with so little to recommend to hear it at Sundance has effectively eliminated any previous interest I could have when I attended. Watch at your own risk.
