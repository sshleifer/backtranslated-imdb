What can I say about a gangster movie that dresses up? Not so much. With the average film-making in the style of India, this film has a bad timing. Editing is just terrible. As for the story of the gangsters, it could be withdrawn if the gangsters were missing the character. Everyone seemed to be there for some punch line. None of them were funny. The usual suspects in this film are a hooker with a heart of gold, a dying mafia father who wishes his son to make his business a trusted, best friend with "zany" one-track. But the main character, the gangster who likes to dress like a girl. Just his motivation for dressing up as a girl is that some woman swallowed him? Strange. The end of the film had to be a nail in a coffin. It was at least anti-climatic. I mean, I understand how independent filmmakers don't have equipment for proper firing, but they could also use water guns. Overall, the hype that led him to it (premiere of red carpet in Vancouver) was disappointing.
