This film has some special effects, tearing the Japanese archipelago to such an extent that it would be a humble Godzilla. Both leaders also lead over performance. In addition, it is all a little rope in this undervalued disaster swing. Stimulation discrepancies are bizarre. At one point we take Hokkaido sinking into the sea and pyroclastic snow falls on the rest of Japan while Osaka is buried under immense tsunami. Yet elsewhere in the country, people are still walking around monuments and licking ice creams when other tsunami rolls in ... Kusanagi also manages to travel long distances without any obstacles or even wrinkles in a creamy shirt. Other people appear with burns, torn clothes and muddy stripes on their faces. Japaneseness movie is both moving and so repulsive. Sacrificing Kusanagi in his last evening with Shibasaki is a hint of chivalry that is rarely seen in this genre these days. However, the unfortunate PMs ponder the Japanese psyche and the seduction of death, and the fact that Japan is abandoned by all and has no friends in the last instance, an allusion to a darker paranoia that challenges Japanese concerns about their position in the country. world. Sadly, the last sequence is Armaggedon, a cookie-cutter. Finally, my own bug-bear - heavy handed cigarette placement. This time he's crazy (-or-is-he?) Scientist Toyokawa, who gets a poster for Japan Tobacco. At one point he manages to light 5000 meters below the ocean, in a miniature sub-size of a phone booth. Give me a break.
