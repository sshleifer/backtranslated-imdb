This film was missing in many areas. It's about the type of Elvis, who rides on cars and is approached by BIKERS from SATANS ANGELS. One of them is called Banjo, and they beat the kids in college for fun. They want Elvis to be their "driver." Sometimes I wanted the MSTK3000 people to be quiet because the movie was actually good. Sure, there was violence and lots of kitsch lines, such as "What kind of beer do you want? COLD ONE". That was cheesy. The dude who plays Banjo is a great boxer and I was glad to see him do some fighting scenes. Also biker named FATS had NAZI SWASTIKA !!! That was brave enough to say it myself.
