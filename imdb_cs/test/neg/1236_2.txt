Did Agustus and Call really do nothing? Why are they heroes that they did nothing but get to the places where the bad guys fell. What was the point of this show? I was very disappointed. I was expecting more action, more story and seeing the birth of heroes and great deeds. Instead, I saw very little, it looked like Agustus and Call, where there is a side story for a great Indian chief. I'm not even sure if history is very close. They did very little to show why the Texans and Comanche fought each other. The only good part about this movie was Zhan who played Gus very well and is a great actor. A lot of a good story that could be gone. It was sad and I wish I couldn't see it.
