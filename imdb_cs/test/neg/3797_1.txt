4 Oscar winners, Karl Malden, Sally Field, Shirley Jones, Michael Caine. Great actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle. 1 hour 54 minutes of total tedia, melodrama and terrible acting, mess of the script and the sinking of the GOOD LORD, WHAT DO IT THINK? the popularity of the original classic D-minus script film script, the actors were probably just in it for payday, ... horror, horror! How crazy are the characters Caine, Savalas, Malden and Field playing? Go to a potentially deadly sinking boat that is 1st in fire 2. Hot from steam 3. Slippery from water and oil, 4. boilers that explode every 5 minutes, etc., All for the love of money? Greed? 5. They have very little equipment, no pair of gloves or work boots in sight, much less hook, rope, etc. <br /> <br /> Stupidity! <br /> <br /> What was Thinking? Peter Boyle overcomes so much that I just wanted to break him! Stop it! And what's wrong with the bad guy? There is also no way you can believe that his character was a World War II veteran. Caine, Field and Malden find all the gold and money and they're happy - damn! We're rich! (We can't live to spend it, but hey ...) <br /> <br /> And yee haw, he's a great character actor Slim Pickens! Survivors galore! Jack Warden and Shirley Knight, too! The last dramatic partial plot of that frightening plutonium has never gone anywhere, it's like they've forgotten, kind of? Lots of holes in the script. This film has an illness that the strongest pill couldn't heal. I'm surprised that Alan J. Smithee's name wasn't on the script, I'd be embarrassed to write this! Oh, Madness, Oh Humanity! Oy Vey! Horror, Horror! It's like a bad two-hour TV movie. At least the sets were made from recycled material from the first film. <br /> <br /> The script had to be on a compost heap ...
