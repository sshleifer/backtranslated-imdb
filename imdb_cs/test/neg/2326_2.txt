I bought a video for £ 13 on HMV (we pay more in Britain) as a friend told me that it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive. I must say that the initial credits were released ... dance / music is not very powerful. Driving a car and an unexpected crash, as well as ladies' passengers, will be a shame. ... although the way she left the car with her hair perfectly groomed and still carrying her purse, she looked desperate for most directors, but it was something else for Lynch. the shock was boosted by regular low noise like scratching fingers across the board; I thought another Lynch master touch seemed to portray demons who shocked and traumatized their own consciousness. After a while, this noise became somewhat unpleasant, and I found out that the new video cassette was whistling. (and Money) <br /> <br /> Two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough, though predictable. There were no male characters, no merits, and there were too many terrible scenes that were simple and faint, except for some vaguely good scenes (vacuum cleaner switching). E.g. Coffee creeps into a napkin with a menacing loon and a silly monster face in the back of the dining room. And what about the gemstone color of precious stones ... use and naff. This whole film gives you a feeling of unsuccessful genius. My God who was embarrassed… was it really Bob? The whole feeling is that the TV movie failed, put it together with a few (not many) extra pieces to make it 15 reviews. <br /> <br /> I whistled in the last 30 minutes. <br /> <br /> I gave her another chance and I look again. If I want to be confused and work hard to understand the film I will follow Frank Woods's Guide to Consolidated Accounting. Lynch made one classic .. Blue Velvet and Straight Story was nice. This, like Wild at the Heart, was released; his strangeness is now predictable and musty. Someone wants to buy a second hand video? Make your way for a younger original talent, David. Four of ten (and nothing more). Excuse me.
