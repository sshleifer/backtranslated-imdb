I got this movie from my uncle who got it with a free DVD magazine. It's easy to see why he was so excited to get rid of him. Now I understand that this is Film B and that it does not have the same budget as the larger movies, but certainly they could spend their money better than doing this waste. There are some pretty good performances, namely Jack, Beth and Hawks, but others are ridiculously bad (assasin droid for example). This film also includes the worst battle scene I've ever seen. The amount of nudity in the film made it seemed more like a porn movie than the Sci-Fi movie at times. Finally, Terrible Movie
