SLOOOOOOOW, lukewarm, poorly produced seventy schlocker made moore cowvincing due to today's headlines; However, this film is worthy of stink-feed because of uncowvincing acting, lacking direction, and silly clothing of the 70s (unfortunately, MooCow remembers when Adidas clothing was all rage ...). It has the same feeling that some better 70 sci-fi moovies accowmplished, namely "WestWorld" and "Logan Run". While the premise is interesting (rich people clone to keep the body parts ready to keep them theoretically alive), the film makes a mistake to mourn us with Richard (Tim Donnelly), a clone that is suddenly boring and irritating. . Hollow Donnelly does not help but fits right into the rest of the cast. Even such B-illuminaries as Dick Sargent ("Enchanted" TV series, "Ghost with 1,000,000 Eyes"), Keenan Wynn ("Dr. Strangelove", "Dark", "Laserblast"), and Peter Graves ("End of End") . "" Killers from Space "," It Conquered World ", provides only a mighty lukewarm performance it produces, directs, and edits a bunch of no-one, no wonder" Clonus "can't scare anyone at all. there is nothing that lovers of schlocks like - you want to see some sinister, funny 70's movies that Greydon Clark puts on anything, "Clonus" is no bonus; even the MST3K version is gaping, so do it at your own risk !: = 8P
