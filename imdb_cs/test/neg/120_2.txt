In fact, it bothers me to say it, but this film was terrible at every level. Guilt doesn't just lie on Van Damme, as you see, he tried the best, but let's face it, he's almost fifty, how much can you ask him? It seems so hard to believe that the same people who put together the undisputed 2; Probably the best (Western) martial arts film in the years, created this. Everything from the plot, through the dialogue, through editing, to the overall game, was just terribly grouped, and in many cases totally boring and meaningless. Scott Adkins, who fought the scenes, looked more like a demo reel, he was also terribly underused and not even the main criminal who is so shame because 1) He is more than capable of playing this role and 2) The real main villain was not just not. intimidating at all, but also quite annoying. Again, don't blame Van Damme. I'll always be a fan, but I'm avoiding this.
