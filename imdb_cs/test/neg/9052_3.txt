The Asian murderer kills the victims in Niagara Falls and New York before they go by car. Sheila Morris (former Miss Sweden Janet Agren, gave a hilarious "southern belle" dub to show that she is from Alabama) finds a connection between these murders and the disappearance of her sister Diana (Paola Senatore) and sets out to investigate. This brings her to New Guinea, where she promises a slim guide (Robert Kerman, the American porn star R. Bolla) to help him find her sister. Having barely gotten through a jungle full of bloodthirsty cannibals, they finally find Diana, who is under the control of the cult leader Jim Jones Jonas Melvyn (Ivan Rassimov). Jonas does the typical insane guru thing, such as LSD publishing, initiating group suicide, threatening to kill anyone who doesn't listen to him and rape Agrena with a huge dong soaked in the cobra's blood. Once in a while, the character looks to the right or left and sees a cruel scene raised directly from JUNGLE HOLOCAUST or MAN FROM DEEP RIVER (both of them controlled by Lenzi). I'm sure they also use at least two scenes from CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Here we get the expected animal defeats (gator gutting, natives who eat live snakes), plus more nudity and castration. Me Me Lai turns out to give her breast implants another workout playing a widow who is a gang banged by three of her brother in law at the top of the ashes of her freshly cremated husband. Mel Ferrer appears briefly as a professor and is not much devoted to him. <br /> <br /> Likewise with MANGIATI VIVI! You get a promise fulfilled with all the nudity, gore, dead animals, and the bad taste you expect for one of these titles, so if you're a sleaze hound, watch it with all the means. Personally, I was bored with him in the middle and I wanted it to end. The original (heavily cut) US release in 1985 was named THE EMERALD JUNGLE to make people think that they actually rented John Boorman's EMERALD FOREST. He was also called DOOMED TO DIE and EATEN ALIVE BY CANNIBALS!
