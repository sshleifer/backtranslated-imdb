It starts interestingly because there is a carnival right next to someone's house with an oil rig there too and some kind of store-front church across the street with a neon "Jesus saves" sign, fine in one small area .... Unlikely ... and then we're going straight into a film that's unlikely to be at new levels. Of course it's a lame remake of the 1979 thriller to play Carol Kane as a babysitter for Jill Johnson .... now Jill is some chick who ran her cell phone minutes so high her evil parents are punishing her by her work it, Probably something what viewers can get to know. Jill is taken to this huge and fancy house on the lake in the middle of nowhere (of course) by her father to guard the Mandrakis family. When Jill arrives, the children are already nestled in comfortable beds and the housekeeper is still there, could she not watch over the children? Of course, despite a distant place, one of Jill's friends appears to be having problems with stealing, or something. Of course, the alarm in the house will turn off unreasonably and then calls will be heard from someone who wants to kill her. Of course, Jill calls the police, and since there was no real threat in her life, she throws her out, but tells her to call if they can do anything else for her. Look at the scene with Jill calling her friends in high school campfire / pepper rally or whatever it is to be, it looks like some kind of "Burning Man" festival, ??? There are all kinds of frightened horrors, including Chester's cool cat, which of course appears here and there, one of the worst "horror" clich√©s. I admit that I was at this point and I miss something? It's hard to say or care, really. This is one of those films that makes me wonder how bad the remake of "Amityville Horror", "House of Wax" or "The Fog" was. By the way, from reading online reviews, it seems that people who were the scariest it was a 12 year old girl, and I can only assume that from a statement like "it made me pee-pee my pants". You can only hope that it will end the Hollywood remake of movies that were not completely stellar, but you don't have to bet on it. 2 out of 10 and I'm too generous.
