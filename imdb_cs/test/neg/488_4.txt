This short last was director Del Lord's last and only short shemp. Problem: It was quite weak and the caf√© scene was pretty much a carbon copy of the curly short "Busy Buddies" (1944). The interrogation scene was pretty funny and the beginning of the cafe. But in this short time there is plotholes. For example, why are the meadows hiding in the trash when the police come? In the remake, "Of Cash And Hash" (1955), director Jules White corrects it and the reason the garbage is hidden in the bin is that there is a gunfire between the police and the armored car thieves. The scene in which Moe's troubles with the oyster was made previously with Curly in "Dutiful But Stupid" (1941). The haunted part of the house wasn't as spectacular as the cheerful scene on the outside of the haunted house. There was no end to it. Rating: C-
