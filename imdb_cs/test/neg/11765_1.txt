This film is basically "how to" how to be a well-connected pedophile. I am amazed that so many people - especially other homosexuals - have seen this film and read the book and nobody has argued that if Weber was not an influential photographer, he would be in prison for child abuse. Poor Peter Johnson. Weber took this poor, naive (though incredibly handsome) teenager he found in a high school wrestler training camp in the Midwest, brought him to live in his home, and took thousands of homoerotic photographs, many of which were frontal. Acts, all through Johnson's teenage years. It's not art. It's child abuse. Worse, Weber made a lot of money out of it, and poor Johnson will have serious problems for the rest of his life. Weber's affectionate love of the boy is downright scary, just like his ramblings about famous (and not so famous) people he knows about trying to finish Johnson's "education." Haunted and then just boring. The only redemption thing I can say about the film is that it is a fascinating study of self-deception. But I can't help but why no one has ever considered the effect he had on "Chop Suey" (Weber's nickname for Johnson) himself.
