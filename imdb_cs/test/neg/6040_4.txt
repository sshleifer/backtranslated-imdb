WEBS is quite a strange movie, though slightly observable. Richard Grieco plays an electrician who gets into a parallel overcoming of Earth by mutant spiders, or something like that. The film itself was made with a modest budget that explains the limited space and somewhat boring scenario that can do very little with a very interesting assumption. Basically, a 90-minute episode of "Sliders" and nothing more. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (see www.nixflix.com for more details and other genre movies)
