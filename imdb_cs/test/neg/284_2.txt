RUŠIČ VZTLAKU !! Terrible work with the camera, horrible writing, non-existent conspiracy and numerous units. Beautiful playing! Except for Julia Roberts. Who badly plays someone who goes wrong with Julia Roberts. Catherine Zeta Jones is cute in this movie. <br /> <br /> During the film, we have repeatedly increased each of the twelve (!) Characters. Twelve are too many, even for classics like 12 Angry Men. The problem is that we approach the characters boringly when everyone is in the same room and doing the same thing. Yeah, Clooney eats. Yeah, Pitt ate. Yeah, "Jew" eats. Yeah, geek eats. Yeah, bodybuilder eats. Yeah, Mr. Sensitive eats. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah - Yeah. Yes. Phew! It's happening at least three times in the movie. Yeah, everyone's sitting in the cars, bored. Yeah, they're all arrested, scared. Yeah, they're all taken out of prison, depressed. But until I was home, I realized how badly they would "get" me on this. This is a lie movie, right? That's what I went to see, wasn't it? But when I walked in and set the car keys in a glass to change, then I realized that nothing was in this movie! That is right. It's a film of robbery where nothing is stolen. He's trying. They're going to try to steal a boring document or something from a house (anything) and it turns out it's been stolen. 20 minutes of my life, waste. Then they try to steal some egg from a museum (YAWN!), And they screw it in and arrest it. Then we'll see how some fairy French guy stole the eggs before they did it, and we get all the pleasure of "Capturing" except this time a person inside a tight catsuit dancing around fake lasers is ... ugly skinny french guy. Um. But it turned out he didn't even steal eggs. Actually, our heroes stole the egg, LOOOONG, in another movie completely, which would be a great movie to watch if that movie. Instead, we see a 30-second clip in black and white for how they robbed a college student of his back-pack. You heard me ... a brave drop, the ultimate robbery - the accumulation of this 2 and a half hours of totally boring crap - it's a theft of a college student's backpack by a creative entry into the fight for baseball teams and dispel it and replace its back cover with an identical back -packem? What?? <br /> <br /> Ugh. I tell you, it was so bad, I didn't even realize how bad it was - how much I was robbed - until I got home.
