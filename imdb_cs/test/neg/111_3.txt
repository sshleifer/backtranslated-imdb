This cheap, grainy film of Italian film is about a couple of heirs of the estate in Italian countryside, who go to the house to stay, and then find themselves in the dead ghosts of the people killed in this house. <br /> <br /> I was not impressed by this. It wasn't that scary, mostly just as cheap Italian film should be. The girl, her two cousins ​​and one cousin girlfriend, are heading to this huge house for some reason (I couldn't figure out why) and stay there, clean and check the place. The characters come in and out of the movie, and it is quite boring at the points, and most deaths are quite rushed. The girlfriend is hit by a car as she flees from the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is pretty good, but then things slow down again, until the confused end when male cousins ​​are killed in some strange way, and this strange guy (I couldn't figure out who was in the movie, or maybe I don't remember) goes after the one girl who attacks her when the other girl finally kills him. Hate giving away the end but good. The female cousin decides to stay in the house and watch her, and show the scenes of her living years later. End. You really don't miss anything and you probably won't find it anywhere, so lucky.
