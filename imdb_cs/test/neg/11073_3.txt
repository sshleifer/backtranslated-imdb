If it is true that the film is only 150K, it explains a lot. But he does not explain why he has no real plot. In the middle of the movie, I honestly didn't care if they did it or not. I wanted to finish the movie and go to bed. The end was really stupid and forced me to close the movie and sleep soon. Pretty good acting behavior that wasn't much there. If you like really bad movies with terrible lighting (even for a cave) and a bad camera (even for a cave) ... then you really like this movie. By the way, if a boy plane crashed in 1980, when he was about 10 years old or so, how could he forget how to speak, and built up so much anger? Wouldn't he want to get help from the first people he saw, even if it was 14 years later?
