That's one horrible movie !! Some people have told me that it wasn't so bad, but I definitely do not agree! The monster is amazingly cheap (and funny), but that's something we all knew. Besides, the dialogues are terrible and writing is just awful. <br /> <br /> As bad as it is, this movie as quality is fun. Not always for good reasons, but it's good "so bad it's fun" flick. By the way, there is no such thing as "La Castagne". According to a secondary character in the film named Pierre (described in the film as French Canadian), there is a legend among French Canadians about a giant bird known as "La Castagne". As a French Canadian, I can assure you that I have never heard of such a legend. Certainly laughed at me ... :))
