While I was watching this movie, I never thought I'd defend it. It is quite honest from the beginning that it does not have much conspiracy. There are no real characters for the killer. Some of the games may be better, but most of them are capable. I know, three out of ten are not stellar, but there are reviews that said he was shot badly and totally useless, etc. I think she decided to do what was supposed to be pretty good. Lighting is occasionally minimal, more natural than most viewers, but it is assumed that the top looks like a video camera. In fact, sometimes the quality is probably still too high to be true that, but no one would do it over a minute of working the camera, it's really that bad. It's not scary, but it's sometimes. There are one or two characters that do not appear to be credible at all, and the soundtrack is sometimes bored, but overall it was cleaner than many video clips.
