If I go with the good words of my friends, I hired this movie, I hope it will be at least the same laugh similar to "House Party" but I was very disappointed and very bored. Sleeping while watching a movie is never a good sign. I don't know if I didn't like it because I don't live in "da hood" or when I'm not black but it's probably one of the two. Trying to spoof several movies, just coming up with a few laughs, but in the long run it fails miserably. You miss him.
