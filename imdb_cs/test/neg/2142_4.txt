If I only rated this film on the basis of acting / script / production, etc., I would give it one star. All these elements are terrible. I can partially forgive me for the $ 250 budget. The film contains many entertaining scenes, mostly unintentionally entertaining varieties. Some of them include: 14-year-old boy stealing and driving a bus, teenage hooligans (one of whom is a Joy Joy Division t-shirt) getting scared of chasing the protagonists of a movie woman brandishing apparently fake weapons, and meeting a plastic bull skull in the desert in Arizona. <br /> <br /> I'd like to give her 5 stars just for fun, if it wasn't the presence of that awful, morally pontiffing old grandmother. I had to ground one star for her. Who is * a * beep * does a wedding cake with black icing as well?
