For the first time, I saw a poster promoting this film on a street in Helsinki, Finland in June 2000. What interested me was a proud statement that advised all readers that the film, although French itself, was "banned in France". When I returned home to New York, I found out that one of the "Art House" cinemas in the city was screening a movie, and so (with my Finnish fianc√©) decided to find out what it was all about. Boy, we are sometimes. <br /> <br /> From the comments read here, and reviews I knew the movie was violent and sexually explicit. Not necessarily offended by either of these two conditions, I went open-minded to see what disturbed the feel of our Gallic cousins. Probably, like anyone who reads it, it will know, the story includes two women who embark on a crime and murder in France (the film has English subtitles). But the similarity with "Thelma and Louise" ends; Sex is unusually graphic (and in abundance), such as violence (plenty of stomping to death and lots of blood and other organic substances splashed after a bump). On the intellectual level It could be noted that the essence of the film is the relationship of sex and violence (as is shown only by the fact that these women know: one is a prostitute in little time and the other earns from time to time pornographic films, when they are superior to their sexual situation during their descent into crime and murder, they react only to the same violence and brutality they know and understand, but it is important to note that the victims of their rampage are not only fearsome men interested in for fearful sex (of which there are several), but innocent passers-by, for example, a woman at an ATM. <br /> <br /> I really don't understand why repeated "porn" shots were all needed (except depicting physical contact as harsh, unpassionate and debased) and inexorable gore made quite tedious after the first few fierce convulsions. <br /> <br /> It's rude and rude film, but in justice, it deals with brute and gross people and equally unpleasant circumstances, the lives of the French subclasses are explored from one point of view, and it is quite gloomy; travelogue for France is certainly not - maybe that's why the French forbade it. <br /> <br />
