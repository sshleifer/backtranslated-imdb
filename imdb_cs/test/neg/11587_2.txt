Laughter would be a good term for describing this film. But since this film doesn't deserve any good, I said that instead I would use the term divine scarecrow. Concentrating around the adventures of a lot of eco-fighters investigating the shameful acts of the military on a semi-tropical island, the lack of budget quickly becomes obvious. Michael Pare (real actor! But only in the sense that Pinocchio was a real boy ...) leads a group of fools through a series of monster-chase-and-engulf-hapless-scene victims. There is some vague attempt at pseudo-science to explain the presence of giant reptiles, but it convinces the viewer of just as playing does. As if it offended the viewer enough, the film also mentions what I call "Weapons of Never Ending Ammo". I have never seen Mickey Parrot or his female side clips once during the movie, but I can announce positively that each of them has to close at least 40 laps in each scene to shoot their weapon. Forty laps may not seem like this, but we're talking about standard weapons here. I figure 15 round clip, tops. And don't forget that they never change clips, nor do they seem to carry any more ammunition. It's a stupid thing that brings movies to eternal fires of celluloid hell, right. The third CGI does little to help the affairs, and the acting is best laughed, otherwise you start to cry. Why the SciFi Channel spews out this mash repeatedly is someone guessing. <br /> <br /> My advice .... give this one wide bed ... a very wide bed!
