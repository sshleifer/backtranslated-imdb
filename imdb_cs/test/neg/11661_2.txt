Mrs. Doubtfire's Hindu remake in Kamal Hassan's lead role is a somewhat delicate version, and not as good as expected. Kamal Hassan is clearly struggling with Hindu dialogues, even after all these years, and can not handle even one scene effortlessly. The guy was getting old and should have a rest. Hassan doesn't bring anything new to the role or the character, as he said, Dustin Hoffman does tootsie, or Marathi actor Macchindranath Kambli makes it Mavshi's (aunt) character in "Moruchi Mavshi" (Moru's aunt, comedy star). What did a kid with flip flops do when it wasn't Diwali? Most of Chachi's romantic "cross connections" - Vs Amrish, Paresh, and then Johnny Walker seem superfluous for the main storyline. Tabu's bathing scene was useless. The family is North Indian, but Karva Chauth night 'Maharashtrian' Chachi must be recalled. Yeah, right. The fine acting skills of not one but four actors, namely Taboo, Om Puri, Late Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal, have been wasted in this film. <br /> <br /> Watch original Mrs. Doubtfire - pure, sharp and crackling fun, unlike Chachi 420.
