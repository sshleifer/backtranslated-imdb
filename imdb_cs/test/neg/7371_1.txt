The film about an interesting and sensitive period of history, shot in a beautiful setting, was able to imagine the frighteningly trivial and clich√© of production, the grossly clumsy scenario, the poor continuity, the disturbing music, the sweet casting and the gaming. It was an exchange between script and play that was worse. Screenplay Probably Won - Historical background, backstory and character descriptions have been explained in painful details in the dialogue. .. actually words can't describe how bad this movie is. <br /> <br /> There was a massive departure of about thirty minutes in the pre-screening. he laughs loudly. I should add that I am a Francophile, fascinated by Canada and a love historical film. This really didn't matter.
