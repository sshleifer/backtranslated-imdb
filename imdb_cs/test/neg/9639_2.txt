It is unfortunate that between this film, the Elah Valley, the Lions for the Lambs and the Home of the Brave, they all seem to be based on common stereotypes about the veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Boozing, fighting, short fuses, broken marriages, boys spreading and digging foxhole in their front yard when they are drunk, etc. Etc. Etc. It happens - yes, but not as often as one would think after watching one of these movies. I think it is unfortunate that these directors / producers / writers decided to break their ax against political settlement by depicting soldiers in such atypical manner. In this particular film, Kimberly Peirce has not thrown us a bone, just to show the new children who were born when a family member was deployed, or a child who grew up in a ghetto and who can now afford college thanks to GI Billa. , or a couple who can afford a house, or start a new business, earn a citizenship, etc. etc. Instead, we have treated these stereotypes because those who did this want to show you the wrong side. A few questions with the film itself: 1) Someone broke by putting Phillippe in the Bronze Star with V after leading his unit along the narrow aisle after being set in a taxi by a shooter. Pretty stupid, but yes, it happens. 2) The humiliation had no tower armor, so we believe it is almost the beginning of the war, but every soldier and their brother have ACOG and all the possible links to their M4? Sorry, I don't think so 3) Timothy Olyphant as a lieutenant colonel? It's hard to believe, but I checked for 40 years in May, so the timing isn't too far away. 4) Two soldiers strike to escape to be sent to jail after they say they will not return to Iraq (after learning that it has been stopped). So he's a refugee. When he finally turns around at the end and takes him back, he keeps his position and puts himself on the same unit? Sorry, I don't think so. I can only describe it as one huge stereotype of the army and infantry. There are some events depicted in this movie to some soldiers, yes. However, in this movie you get practically every stereotype in the space for about 100 minutes, and really things just aren't that most of the soldiers are coming back. I wish the director tried to do some better research than to start with the agenda and then make the film. From the films I mentioned at the beginning of this post, the best is probably Lions for Lambs, which is rather a commentary on the sad state of Generation Y + than about the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan or the Bush administration. If you really want to see this movie waiting for a cable or Netflix it, don't pay money directly for rent.
