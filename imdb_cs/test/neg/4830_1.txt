Welcome to the world of Vikram Bhatta, a man who was once successful and got a few hits with small actors such as KASOOR, RAAZ and also the multistarrer AWARA PAAGAL DEEWAN and his single film with Aamir GHULAM. These movies are all that are remake remixes and some decent, as they used to be, which worked with SPEED is a CELLULAR remake and that too horrible <br /> <br /> Star view, we have once sold but now without the work of Urmila and Sanjay Suri, then we have the Aftab flop, Ashish Chaudhary, Zayed Khan and others <br /> <br /> The movie could be a decent thriller, but many of the problems there are telling has a few cringeworthy scenes like Zayed kidnapping mobile company and many more and stunts are also laughing while twists in the end are too ridiculous The film also took a long time to get into theaters that lose them sparkle <br /> <br /> Direction is terrible Music is outdated Zayed Khan screams, makes face.e tc what he always does Urmila is good at part, Sanjay Suri is not that compelling Ashish Chaudhary is trying hard in the negative role and he is fine Aftab is terrible and he gives you laughter in no The Negative Same Director Gave His Only Solo Hit KASOOR Sophie's Terrible Tanushree's Non Actress \ t
