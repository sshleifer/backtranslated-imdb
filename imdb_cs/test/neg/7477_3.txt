Perhaps the best part of the show is the fact that it crawls right after Conan O'Brien and Late Night fans are suddenly unwittingly watching the Carson show. Carson Daly can't hold a candle for Leno, Letterman, O'Brien or any other late night guest talk show and Last Call seems to lack more than a hit in this hit and miss genre. Only redeemable shows are so short. But I wouldn't say that bullshit. Carson Daly is honest and does not hide the fact that his show is not great (that honesty is really useful here), while some of the latest parody and material from the last call are stolen, they still find the brand. In fact, some of Carson's assemblies were quite amusing, and parodies sometimes have decent comedy moments. As an interviewer, Carson is fine, even with only one guest, not exactly late night material, but still above the level achieved by a high school AV team. However, he doesn't have a quick joke that makes Conan so cheerful. He doesn't like his musical guests, but that's more because I'm not a fan of this kind of music, so I don't hold him against him. <br /> <br /> Home band. I don't know Joe Firstmans and wouldn't compare it to CBS, Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleet and Cleetones are better. But firstman's friends still show it to me. Especially Alto Sax, who sometimes appears (has long dark hair and sunglasses and always plays in the top register), if possible, watch the show for him, I do. <br /> <br /> In summary, this show is not worth the full bag of kibble n 'bits. But it has an audience and appeals more to the younger "mtv generation". If you don't have a cable and you're at 1:37, there's no choice, and it's no wonder it's even worse in that time frame. So if you're waiting for Poker After Dark, 30 minutes of the last call won't kill you while you wait.
