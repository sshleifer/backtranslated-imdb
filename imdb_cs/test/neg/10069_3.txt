<br /> <br /> JURASSIC PARK III * ___ Sam Nell (Food), William Macy (Happy Texas, Fargo), TZ (Leoni (Family Man) <br /> Better Title would be: ESCAPE FROM REANY MEAN DINOSAURS, but no one would have to see the movie, in this sequel the group of islands set off to the dinosaur island to save the teenage slippery accident victim. <br /> <br /> without a completed script, which explains why the film seems to have little or no other purpose than to demonstrate state-of-the-art special effects: Sure, there are a few clever scenes and some mildly funny pieces, but no meaningful conspiracies that would combine them together - dinosaur puppets and JP3 animations are very good to excellent, and more numerous than ever, a cinematic experience can't hold a candle in the original JURASSIC PARK or even JP2. <br /> <br /> JP3 is merciful short 90 minutes - of which the last 10 minutes is, and at that moment I was often in my hands. The audience I saw left him in silence. <br /> <br /> Better bet: see LEGALY BLONDE. <br /> <br /> Dave
