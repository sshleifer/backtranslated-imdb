Shopping, sunny skies, beaches, boarding school for rich teenagers and a perfectly happy ending. Welcome to the life of Zoey Brooks and her friends. Zoey Brooks is pictured by Jamie Lynn Spears, a self-proclaimed actress who got her claim to fame by being the younger sister of the international pop star Britney Spears. With her beautiful blonde wig in the first season and an attempt to hide her monotone accent of the country, it was confirmed that Nickelodeon really went to dogs with nepotism. When Kristin Herrera, the actress who portrayed Dan Cruz in the first season, left the show, she beat all hope because she was the only decent actress. Female casting is a total shame, but male casting has the potential for teenage media. If they continue to watch Jamie Lynn Spears as a picture of perfection, many people will have to lower their standards. Hoping to find out soon that you can't make a career out of the blue. Jamie Lynn Spears is useless for acting, singing, and anything else that attempts this downward spiral, which she calls a career. No wonder he's a vowel actress. Critics would definitely say something else.
