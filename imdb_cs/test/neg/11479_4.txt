I love comedy and I love independent movies, but it was too slow and humor was extremely regional. I think it would be better if the main characters were sympathetic, but they were just typical types of gen-x slackers, as well as people who forty years of trouble in high school ... I understand High Praise for a young independent filmmaker when it deserves, but it's a very average movie.
