I sat down on TV and hoped for the names in it that it would be worth the time ... but dear Gussie, the one who thought this script was worth producing? The basic idea is excellent, but the execution is terribly bad, with an ever-illogical sequence of scenes, the end that is almost ridiculously melodramatic and the poor Rock Hudson travels through it with an obviously confused look at his slightly declining face. Looks like a bad B movie from the 40's ...
