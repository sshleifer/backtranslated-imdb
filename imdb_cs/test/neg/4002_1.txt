A piece of waste, if I could have, would give him 0. Animation is good, but not good enough. The story is absolutely the funniest thing I've ever come across and it says a lot! This 'movie' tried to be interesting but failed. It's almost as if a writer started a story, then got another idea and tried to connect the two together. Don't waste time on it; believe me, you will be ticking as I was. The only actor of any note in this was James Woods and his part was at best peripheral. I'm all about doing things that are irritable, pushing the envelopes, but it just didn't cut.
