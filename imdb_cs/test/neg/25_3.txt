Is it a badly pile of garbage? Of course. Anyone who does not realize that if they pick up a box in a video store, they probably don't have any proper assessment of the movies in the first place. Now I will evaluate the aspects of the film we really care about on a scale of 1 to 10: <br /> <br /> Violence and gore: 4 - There is very little death for this genre and gore is almost nonexistent. Anyone looking for a little blood should look elsewhere. The only redeeming quality is the fact that children do these scary things, which increases the bar a little. Tension: 1 - Okay, I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky kids. Nudity / Gender: 7 - Lots of boobage from three different women, one of whom is MTV, Julie Brown. There are two sex scenes, but little is shown in them. Unintentional Humor - 4 - There are a few good laughs with kids trying to act scary, but in all, it's just bad, not funny bad. <br /> <br /> Overall - 4 - It's not impossible. There are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention on the whole movie. However, just watch this movie if you are a big fan of 80 slasher flicks. It definitely falls on the lower end of the scale, but it's not completely down. The real downside is the unsatisfactory ending. For me, it almost destroyed the film.
