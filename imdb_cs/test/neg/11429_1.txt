Ah, here it is! A movie that people say to remind me of the epic "Trainspotting". OUCH, I was crazy to believe it, and OUCH as I hurt my buttocks after I forced myself to watch this c ** p from start to finish. After the first 10-15 minutes, I wanted it all to end, or at least put some nudity or action or cool music into the house to be worth the time ... to the CD and I hope I will never have to choose it again to show it to a friend who is so concerned that he does not want to listen to my warnings.
