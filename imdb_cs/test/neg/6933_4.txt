The O'Neill game, which lasts four and a half hours, is reduced to just under two, and much of that run is dedicated to actors with frosty facial expressions as they read their characters' thoughts in voice. It can work on stage, but it looks cheerfully planted in this soap opera adaptation that soft-peddles its bad heroine behavior and never explains why so many men have so captivated. Norma Shearer and Alexander Kirkland, overly sad, are overcome by the naturalistic Clark Gable - he's the only one who does the frozen face technique. It gets even more fun when Shearer's and Gable's son, undoubtedly moppet, makes a frozen face. There is also Frank Morgan's brother Ralph as a failed suitor, given to soliloquizing "Poor Charlie!" T over and over, and young Robert Young and Maureen O'Sullivan. By the time he appeared, the vocal representation was largely abandoned and played like ripe soap, with a sentimental fadeout that actually plays "Silver Threads Among the Gold" as background music. The direction of Robert Leonard is irritated and shows few options for reining in overactive actors. It's certainly fun - it's not like that unless you count Groucho's satirical parody in "Animal Crackers", or the old Mad Magazine satirist that made the sitar "Shirley Booth" "Hazel" and la "Strange Interlude". But it's not good.
