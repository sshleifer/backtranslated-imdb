Some good stage design. Good songs, though like the other one they said they weren't with great energy. Bea Arthur, trying to do something with the material, had an occasional good line as Mame Vera's friend and helped her move the song "Bosom Buddies". Besides, there's nothing worth your time. Slow stimulation, incredibly bad kinemetography, not very good singing (except Robert Preston), terrible script, bad acting (except Bea) and terrible actress. Who thought Lucille Ball would be good as a classy, ​​life-loving Mame? Heads at Warner Bros. there was no question of cracking when they decided not to use Angela Lansbury, who did so well on Broadway, and instead used Ball, which wasn't as fun as she was 20 years earlier. , he couldn't act as a "right way" at all, and he used the painful cheater as an excuse to sing. Even if (maybe because) to make the film painful for her, and even when she funded it, it's just not Mame. Aunt Mame is such a better movie and the soundtrack of Broadway's musical with Lansbury sounds great. For the most part there is nothing that is great, engaging or interesting at all. Forget it if you're a huge Lucy fan who thinks she couldn't do anything wrong. Hopefully, when you see this, you'll find he's just human.
