As a Bruce Campbell fan for almost two decades, I was thrilled to have the chance to see his latest movie on the big screen with the man himself. Unfortunately, "The Screaming Man" was disappointing himself. Set in Bulgaria - Where Sci-Fi Channel Makes Its Original Films on Saturday Evening - "Man with Screams" A curious blend of a 50-year horror movie horror comedy, switching comedy, vengeance and exaggerated grotesque with a touch of romantic reconciliation. If it doesn't make sense, neither does "Screaming Man". Campbell plays the CEO of a pharmaceutical company who visits Bulgaria with his estranged wife in an inexplicable attempt to invest in half the completed system of the former communist country. Two crashes with a former KGB agent alternated with a cab driver, and all three eventually met their demise in the hands of a vengeful Gypsy woman. Stacy Keach and his goofy assistant (Ted) Raimi, who have developed a technique to allow non-refusing tissue transplants, steal bodies and place part of the driver's brain in the Campbell's damaged skull cab. They also put their wife's brains in the robotic body that they have at hand. Campbell escapes and, with the rapid movement of the skull and the voice of the driver's cab - whose transplanted brain tissue controls the left side of his body - reflected in his head, sets out to find and kill a gypsy. (His robot's wife does the same thing.) But first he tries to imitate Steve Martin / All Lies Tomlin when Campbell's two celebrities fight for supremacy over dinner in a restaurant. Just as he played his own evil hand in "Evil Dead II", Campbell knows that his body seems to be inhabited more than once by his mind. Occasionally "Screams" comes the next movie Steve Martin, "A Man with Two Brains", just as it takes a silly approach to 50-sci-fi clich√©s. However, for too small a result, it is trying too hard and it doubles for the semi-understandable Bulgarian oaf Ted Raimi, who gets too much time on the screen. (Nothing against Raim, it's just that she's better in smaller doses.) Finally, it's not even unreal (or funny) enough to satisfy as a spoof, nor is it serious enough to enjoy it as a B-film pastiche. I was glad Campbell was already showing when he stopped because I was afraid I had to say, "Gee, Bruce, that was really ... something." The best praise I can give as a movie is that at least images stuck to the emulsion. And it was twice as good as "Alien Apocalypse".
