What is the loss of energy and money. What's the loss of talent. Emilio Estevez was totally useless and mostly untapped. Jon Lovitz was very mildly amusing but absurd. Harry Dean Stanton - Why Bother? And it was just me, or the Kari Wuhrer barely act in this. The story was quite non-existent and really disjointed. One of my biggest problems was the reaction of the characters to the events that appeared. Like surfing "dudes" to give up your life every time they were threatened in the last half? How about never seeing surf once! Setting up for some scenes went on for a long time with insufficient pay to damn us. Nothing in this "movie" seemed real or true. <br /> <br /> The only good things I can say is that some (very few) scenes were shot pretty and some scenes were slightly interesting. You don't see it when there are so many better nonsense movies.
