It just didn't look like GI Joe to me. When I watched it as a child, I didn't care. In fact, the best thing I liked about this was the initial credits. It turns so many facts around and turns the story as well. The Cobra Commander is reportedly part of this silly race of reptiles in Antarctica or somewhere where it is frozen. Although I always thought it was a normal person who was considering every time you saw his eyes in the series, they were surrounded by a normal colored body and not a blue face. There is simply too much crap in this one to try to make this spectacular movie, but for me it just destroys what I watched the series in the first place.
