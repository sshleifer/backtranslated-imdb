On my ongoing quest to find the worst movie of all time, my friends and I came across this little gem. It's jolly over and through, especially if you don't (like us) think it's a semi-sequel to another horror series. I'm not going to bother going into a conspiracy except to mention that everyone complains about the terrible snowstorm that comes (it was equivalent to the characters just shouting "FORESHADOWING!" at the camera and waving their hands), and , in some odd twist of fate, a snowstorm sometimes occurs. Budget problems, I think. <br /> <br /> Add to the magic front door that opens or closes, depending on the effect the director the director wants to create, and electricity is interrupted until the high school teacher decides to accept it. shower with lots of soap. I admit it; I had difficulty breathing in points. The only real decent part of this movie, as it turns out, was from the original film, Slumber Party Massacre. Now it's so much fun that I know. <br /> <br /> * SPOILER * End where it is revealed that slasher did because her drunken friends came across her and a friend who did it and then a friend who goes on a train or something that's probably The funniest psycho killer ever, enhanced by fabulous use of blur and footage. I'm glad all friends of the slasher forgot about the incident until a flashback was needed. Run, don't walk, pick it up and see the merriment. Of course, the continuity editor should be rewarded for all this if they didn't get caught up in the terrible snowstorm ...
