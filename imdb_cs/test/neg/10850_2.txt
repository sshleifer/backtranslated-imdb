Rigoletto is Verdi's masterpiece full of drama, emotion and strong, unforgettable music. Maestro had to plunge into his grave when this crazy travesty of his work was released with his unnecessary frontal nudity and cheap copulation and depiction of the naive but principled Guild as a horny ditza. The opera can certainly be adapted to the cinema - look at the wonderful Zeferelli La Traviata - but when the work is as excellent as Rigoletto, it doesn't need cheap tricks. It could even be acceptable if dubbed in music was good, but it is the average rendering of a libretto with a second sound quality.
