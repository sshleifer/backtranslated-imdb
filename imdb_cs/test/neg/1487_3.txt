The presentation is very shabby. (to my concept) are often documentary films. Michael Moore's "Documentaries" - Farenheit 911 is FAR more convincing but has too many media and political influences. I can't wait until Saturday to see "Play Their Lives". IFC goes right from the center. I started a collection of IFC movies from the internet due to "TGOTL" *** from ********** to "Decades". Want to see good documents? Stick to channel history .. Or try docudrama. You can't mess with them my friend. He can't go wrong. The 1970s were ten years of repetition. Or so old times would trust you. Disco died and is gone forever. When Elvis died yes, we all grieved
