An anonymous movie that anyone could order anywhere. Where is Anthony Mann, the director of such classics as "El Cid" "naked stimulus" or "man of Laramie"? There are amazing shots of aircraft in the clouds, lovingly filmed. The story is very banal and almost completely devoid of dramatization. The couple lives almost a routine life, and the user who complains about the choice of Allyson in June for a woman, IMHO, is completely lacking. With her less than appealing look, a hoarse voice, she was the perfect housekeeper the script needed. At that time, the women were barefoot and pregnant: there is not one woman among the basic staff, not even on the table. All they had to do was worry about their heroes who fought for democracy and the enemy whose name we never heard of but in 1955 it was not difficult to guess. One wonders why a young man who has never seen a Mann movie should choose this one of all the great movies he made.
