I have heard that Novo has been compared to Mement for the simple fact that they both rely on the main characters suffering from short-term memory loss. Well, it's like comparing the Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as they both included a character who killed more people. They couldn't be further apart in thought. Novo deals with a cop man in a company that has a short-term memory loss. He is consistently followed by another master and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office. In comes temp, which also engages with it and can / may not use for sex. Needless to say, she has a lot of sex on the screen. Wait, there's more. There's a kid running into a troubled man with amnesia, and it's obvious he just bumps into the boy. And there's a laptop that keeps trying and remembering important tracks. I admit I am not for foreign movies. I don't mind reading subtitles, but I think sometimes it takes away from my favorite aspects of the film: a great dialogue. Given that she has to translate or I could not understand for the most part, I am convinced that she will simplify what the characters have to say. This film was no exception; dialogue was fair, good, blah. As for the story, it was interesting enough to keep me 98 minutes. Strange, yes, but then I do not live in France again, so I am not so familiar with their hobby / resentment or lifestyle. (Such, I think it's acceptable for a father to worship and shock his beach son), which must be a cultural thing. his past and gradually progress to his drug. When I learned the "secret" I was really happy? Well, well, then. <br /> <br /> I can only recommend for some decent acting, good looking people and sexual situations with soft porn (like every 2-4 minutes), but if you're not in that kind of scene, I'd unconditionally skip this slow moving and memory-gain movie.
