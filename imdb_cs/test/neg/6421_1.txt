Good God! This film must have a new classification on its cover "watch only if you have nothing else to do!". I'm disappointed. I was looking forward to a good horror all weekend ... I needed an adrenaline rush and the amazing ant feeling that ran down my spine. But this movie didn't do it. Quite a good story, but pretty terrible acting, dialogue and filming. He was disjointed and sometimes totally stupid. We had actors looking at the wrong direction of the camera, people speaking out loud and telling what they felt and what would happen, shadows of equipment in some shots, stupid clich√©s like "I need you to keep me" in the wrong places and situations. Thank you for allowing me to interpret and apologize if I offended someone, but it was a waste of time and money.
