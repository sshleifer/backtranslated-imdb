What is the drug addiction that attracts first time creators to offer their own topic? This topic has been done to death. Drug abuse is bad. We understand it. Drug addiction is painful to follow. We're getting it too. But the bleak subject does not give the filmmakers a license to make a sloppy film. Every movie doesn't have to be a Hitchcock masterpiece of film excellence, or use the deep focus of Orson Wellesian, but it's still a narrative film. The faithful does not mean a pseudo-documentary. Even consumer mini-DV cameras are capable of producing white white and black black, and this filmmaker is just lazy by filming no contrasting scenes with existing lighting: the subject is bleak enough without artificially enforcing it with sloppy film. And even documentaries have a sound mix. Vera Farmiga is very talented, with the right material, but the director obviously exaggerated her and sucked her life out of her performance. Addicts can live in fog, but they still have emotions, but none of these characters appear to be off screen. Supporting players only added their lines without creating real people. I'm sorry I'm so rough, Debro, but some things are true, whether you want to trust them or not. I'm sure your next movie will be better - but please, not another drug movie. :)
