It's not a horrible movie ... But there are monster scenes where you roll on the floor and laugh - it's not a good thing for action / thriller. Acting is generally quite decent for the SciFi Channel movie. Barry Corbin plays a trusted US Senator and Lou Diamond Phillips gives us a decent military / police / sheriff / agent / marshal character again. Special effects are good, "special" - for example, external train shots are probably a model train. Goofs: Meteor hits a stationary car in the opening scene. The car bursts into flames, but does not move the thumb. After the impact, the meteor is placed in the top of the car hood - it is not possible from the low angle in which the meteor arrived. <br /> <br /> Spoilers ... <br /> <br /> A good part of the movie events is predictable, from a helicopter crash ("Pull up, pull up!") to the fact that the annoying people eventually they get, on a classic blown bridge over a 1000-foot ravine, waiting for the train, at the end of the setting at the end. <br /> <br /> Scenes showing alien attacks are fun. They are cruel cute puppets and move with lightning - remember rabbit Monty Python? Spoiler Goof: In one scene, four people shooting a clip clip cannot hit a single creature because they move at lightning speed. Later in the film Todd Bridges equips a mini flamethrower that he uses to dispatch a number of creatures in close range. On several occasions, Lou Diamond Phillips is able to easily catch creatures with bare hands.
