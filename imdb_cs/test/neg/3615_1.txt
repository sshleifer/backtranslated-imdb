Now we know where they got the idea for Snakes on the plane. If you want it without a cover, you won't see this movie. If you really want to lose 90 minutes of your life, then either grab the cable or get it as a free choice from NetFlix or Blockbuster. Don't pay to rent it. If you pay for the rent, then you are one stupid individual. Behavior was terrible, the story was terrible, everything was terrible except snakes. Whether real or CGI generated, they looked pretty good. But it has been said, this film still has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even the nude dance scene was bad enough to send it on. I didn't think I warned you.
