This film must be the worst movie I've ever seen. There is why it was to make MOW (Film of the Week). Continuity was all bad (palm trees in Chicago, although it was filmed in Toronto, Canada), the effects were left to wish for 2004. "Lord of the Rings" had a better CGI than that. But I think they also had the money for it. The budget will certainly affect the outcome, but anyone who calls MOW over 2 must go back to the Film and Television School. The next time you remember that care and time to make a classic not rushing for a tornado cashier or TV hit hit. <br /> <br /> I also know that networks can reuse shots from old networks or affiliates, but using 80 shots for 2004? I hardly bought it.
