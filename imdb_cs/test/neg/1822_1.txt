This brief overview does not contain spoilers because the movie is spoiled. It is wooden and pedantic. He has no saving grace. If someone invites you to your house to look at Mr. Imperium, don't go. Even the title of the movie is horrible and tells us what lies garbage inside. The whole plot is so bad that she could drive Mother Teresa to despair !!! It was not a stroke that led to the early demise of the poor Ezio, she had to act in this clunker who made him inside. Maybe the enemy was a stranger and wanted revenge on the Americans for his prison. In this journey he found the perfect means for his anger.
