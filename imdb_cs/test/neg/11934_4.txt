I bet the monthly "The Magnificent Seven Returns" (MSR) was made for television. Other reviewers prove that MSR was a theatrical film, and I take their word for it. The logical answer must assume that it was originally filmed for television, and after a change-studio-heart, it was released theatrically instead. Every actor is primarily a TV actor: Mariette Hartley, Michael Callen, Ralfe Waite, Stephanie Powers. Lee Van Cleef split the time between TV and theater screens. Stephanie Powers made only 3 or 4 "real" movie appearances in the last thirty years of a very fruitful television career - proof positive of this was shot for TV. Smaller players are veterans of small actors who can be seen on old reps "Gunsmoke", "Wild Wild West", "Streets of San Francisco" and so on. The Ho-hum sets are identical to Universal Studios Tour sets that often appear on old episode television. And editing reveals a single-stage television with limited camera movements, positioning, cutting and lighting. The soundtrack, without Berstein's original themes, is directly from the 1970s television. Yeah, I'd bet the money that was made for television. This is an important point in the evaluation of MSR. At first I watched the MSR on the cable assuming it was an old theatrical release. Compared to the original "Magnificent Seven", it is a joke, a cartoon, an amateur film making attempt. Acting, lighting, writing, setting, action, cinematography, music (excluding Berstein's themes), editing, stimulation, ... and more ... all pale compared to the classic "Magnificent Seven", which is close to the perfect 60s and one of the big action movies of all time. However, as I believe, the film, which is considered a film from the early 1970s, is actually better than average. The unhappy people who live for 70 years as adults know what I'm talking about. The MSR would compete with "Alias ​​Smith and Jones" and similarly proved to be a sample network. During the 1970s, "Gunsmoke" was a quality show, focused more on character development than on action, deemphasizing the gun to play two shootings a week. The first shooting, usually murder, sets the plot of the clock into motion - the second shootout culminates in an episode by killing a guest star, his nemesis, or otherwise resolving the conflict with Marshal Matt Dillon. The MSR has more action than the entire "Gunsmoke" season. In this light - in this reference framework - MSR is a portable entertainment, a reduction over the television tariff from that decade.
