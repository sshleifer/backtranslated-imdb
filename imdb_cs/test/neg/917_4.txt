I am usually a fan of "artistic" and "foreign" movies, but when I saw it, my reaction was "must be called experimental because it doesn't make sense." "Action" is static, while at the same time bouncing from one place to another. There are not enough titles to make clear who is who and what their relationships are. The main point seems to be to show that, in the face of murder, adultery, and generally weird and corrupt behavior, the remedy offered by the forces to be is to banish an absolutely innocent black man.
