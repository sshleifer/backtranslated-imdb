A girl named Isobel is possessed by a demon. The local priest (who used to go out with Isobel's sister before) must try to save her, but more of a family concern than a demon in their daughter. This film is directed by Ethan Wiley, writer of the "house" and writer / director of "House II". I loved the first movie and the other I liked it better so you think it would be a winner. Unfortunately, this looks like first-year students filmed him. Dawson Leery could do better. I was thinking about blaming the new writer Ellary Eddy, especially because the idea is hardly original (trying to make money with fans of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose"?), But Wiley should have been able to do his magic. Br /> <br /> You also want to think that horror star veteran Jeffrey Combs and James Russo would help this movie. Russo (playing bishop) hardly shows up and Combs plays a big role as a sheriff ... for five minutes on the screen (but I like a mustache). So, no help here. After watching "The Exorcist", all the other exorcist films must be standard in comparison to the classic, right? Demonic possessions in this film were not at least terrifying. No head-spinning or paranormal activity at all. Just a girl with a deep voice and makeup. All "demonic" things were centered around a father who blamed everyone for sleeping with his wife. As another reviewer wrote, "you'll get a lot of Isobel on her bed like a trampoline hiding in a closet and jumping from a hay meadow. Yeah, it's Chuck E. Cheese." Unfortunately, this summarizes the scope of "evil" in this film. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch a movie about family members who are making accusations and yelling at each other while an obsessed daughter is sitting in another room -camera, this is a movie for you. But if you don't mind saying that, you have a terrible taste in the movie if it's what you're looking for. Apparently, the plot is focused on the father who blames the sleeping cowboys for his wife (who didn't, but slept with her daughter) and the vet who slept with her wife (who could have, but denies it). And then you have a gardener who attacks an obsessed girl with a crucifix and tells the family to call an exorcist, but as soon as the priest comes, the gardener declares that he does not believe in God. What was the entire Bible quote you did five minutes ago? Terrible exorcism. Horribler examples of what Combs and Russo are capable of. And such a sad speech directed after a series of "House" films became classic. I would like to pretend that Wiley had no part in making this shamefully derived and non-original film. Christ's strength forces you to avoid this film as if it were a cardinal sin.
