If you were wondering if Disney could broadcast a show with a more spoiled character than Paris, shallower than Britney, more vapid than Jessica, and more narcissistic than DONAL NEXT DOORS, wonder more. The amazing thing is that Selena Gomez is supposedly a heroine. It is also believed to be inherited from broken, shallow, vapid, narcissistic "popular" girls at school, which is no more believable here than for Hilary Duff at LIZZIE McGUIRE. The surfaces range from recycled and backfilled JEANNIE to the "parody" of HARRY POTTER. The older boy alternates between the magical genius and the inability to handle the intricacies of his own laces. The younger boy is just another of those wise "wisecracking" brats who have reproduced on television as cockroaches in New York (and with the same challenge). Dad is a stereotypical stupid television dad and mommy ... well, she's not completely horrible. But they all pale, besides the ugly, hateful, yet terribly fascinating (like a bad car accident), the spectacle of Mrs. Lopez, a smug, self-confident, confident performance. And again, it's HEROINE.
