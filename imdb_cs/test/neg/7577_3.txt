I've seen many Japanese horrorfilms and I have to say that some of them are really interesting, but they're all pretty much the same. this is no exception. The Ghost is a black-haired girl who scares them for sacrifice by doing nothing but walk and look dead .. the difference is just a motif for the scary. the rest is the same as every time: black haired girl, weird stuff going on with some media (photos), spooky playing. While watching this movie, I constantly found out why I was wasting my time watching things that someone else did much better. some scenes where pretty nice though, i'll give it 3 out of 10
