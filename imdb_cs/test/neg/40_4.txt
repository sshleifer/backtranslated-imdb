I bought it on VHS as "Terror Hospital", and when I got home I checked the IMDb and was like OMG it's the legendary "Nurse Sherri" !!! So here's another one from Al Adamson who has clearly learned some tiny amounts of film-making from "Blood of Dracula Castle" days. Where an earlier effort is more or less totally sclerotic flat, it blends a bit, adding some element of diversity and surprise amidst inability. Certainly half of the film is a blind post-op football player who shoots the wind with his stacked sister, but at any moment we could be cut off from the ugly head of a satanic master, or sister Sherri with a farmer over a fork. , or a small piece of an abstract student film cut that is supposed to go with the pulsating effects of holding the scene, or what is unreasonably half-headless topless bit, or God knows what else (forgetting to be honest). As stupid sh * t go, this one runs towards the top. Congrats, Al.
