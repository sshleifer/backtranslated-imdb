As a resident CA, I'd like to see the whores that shut down power plants increase prices. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie was pretty good and had some very informative pieces. While they were holding Enron up and crashing, I found it really interesting. But when the film focused on being skewed against Bush, I wondered if they were really accurate. It is good to point out any connection that Republicans had with Enron, but the monster was created when Clinton was president. The crisis of the energy crisis has come under Davis's clock. They were both in Enron's abuses, but none of them was responsible. Rather, many minutes are devoted to how Bush was friends with Lay. So what? Lay played golf with Clinton and spent the night in Lincoln's bedroom. Why do Democrats have such a free pass in this film? I think most politicians are wasting our taxpayers' money, so I am not partial to either party, but I hate the feeling that I am exposed to something political in watching a document. Yes, politicians deserve some blame, but I really doubt that the only guilty one has Rs after their names. I found no value when I depicted the Bush lover when the Democrats received as much money as the Republicans' Enron campaign. As I said, it weakens the rest of the movie for me, because it makes me suspect of the rest of the facts they interpret.
