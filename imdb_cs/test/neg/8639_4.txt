Once upon a time, Theresa Russell made some half a dozen decent movies, so I hope one of her efforts over the last ten or two years deserves a score of at least 6 or 7 (out of 10). However, DARK WORLD is just the last of a series of disappointments. It's hard to watch for the first 90 minutes. Lines are passed on by leading actors as if they were read during the first rehearsal or even during a casting session (in which the actors do it because of their agents, but actually do not want the parts for which they are perfunctorily) to be read). The sets and props seem to be "off" in some way (what type of police department would allow the detective to have the entire wall of the living room hidden in the case case?). The screen is always filled with insignificant time and little woodpeckers, which seem to be without rhyme or reason. If the writer had been here after the lights were lit from the screenings of the film festivals, they would undoubtedly go back to how all these shortcomings were really clever clues to the plot that had been turned off in the last five minutes of ignoring the ignition. For those viewers whose other film experiences are TV: MOVIE and SURFER, DUDE; They could be compared to nod their heads in agreement. However, it is hard to believe that anyone who has seen 10 or more movies in his life - and is not a close friend or relative of DARK WORLD or crew member - could be a lame canard. Despite what d.v.d. The box may lead you to believe that this film has such a similarity to the SUNSET BOULEVARD or Hitchcock as a depleted bottle of Jim Beam with urine to drink!
