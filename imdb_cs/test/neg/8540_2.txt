Good old Jess Franco! Always a reliable director's choice if you are looking for low-slime, shameless exploitation and 200% free. Jess once again truly overcame himself with this totally exhausted piece of jungle "adventure". Let's face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have a sharply warmed (and underage) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It is actually a somewhat disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of the entire crew, and especially in view of the eyes of a perverted Franco! And it wasn't even the first time because the duo had already made "Linda" together. Anyway, just in case you were thinking: YES, "Kilimanjaro diamonds" have a plot, albeit very imbecile. During the opening sequences, a plane carrying a rich Scottish guy and a girl falls in the middle of an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because they never try to consume human flesh in one place in the film. The unpleasant Scotsman claims to be the Great White Leader and the girl grows up to become a beautiful and barely dressed white goddess. A few years later, the expedition reaches the center of the jungle to return to civilization and? More importantly, to steal some of the legendary tribes of the tribe. It could have been a convincing and action adventure, but Jess Franco seemed unable to bother. Why shoot jungle pursuit sequences or bloody cannibalistic ceremonies when you can just as easily aim the camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most jungle settings seem to be filmed in one's garden and there is a huge amount of clumsy National Geographic images to fill the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes "Diamonds of Kilimanjaro" as a brilliant, feminist and adult-oriented version of Tarzan. Sure, they just put the sentence, because Katja Bienert's character turns several times from tree to tree.
