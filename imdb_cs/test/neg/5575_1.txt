This must be WORSE movement I saw !!!!! It wasn't just boring, it was "gag me a spoon" stupid. Where did you find the actor ... on the street corner? Who made special effects ... Maaco? For God I could do a better movie with my CELL PHONE. And if it wasn't bad enough, you even had extras at the end of the movie so we could see how stupid the actors are in real life. Who ever made extraterrestrial makeup ... had to spend $ 5 on a local used-clothing store and called it a day. And who in the world wrote a film description on the back of the DVD case, he should be shot. PUHLEEZ! It's not even 1/8% of what is described. This description is just for sucking people into buying, renting or paying a ticket. No wonder there was never a trailer ... ya would take them all off !!!!!!! Bad Actors ... $ 5 <br /> <br /> Special Effects ... $ 5.50 <br /> <br /> Fake Fire .... $ 1.89 (Cigarette Lighter) <br /> <br /> Time spent watching this movie ... total waste! (I should sue to watch it)
