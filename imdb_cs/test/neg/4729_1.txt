Against my own better judgment, I saw this movie today and God wished I didn't. Terrible. The first AvP movie looks like a classic compared to being bad. These guys actually do Paul WS Anderson as a storyteller. In fact, that's what I would expect the Alien and / or Predator movie to look like it was created by Uwe Boll! This film actually offended me and the Lord knows only what would happen if Ridley Scott or HR Giger were ever forced to watch this piece of crap. I can't understand how this movie could appeal to any fan of a series. <br /> <br /> I really don't know where to start. The first AvP was a poop, but at least a semi-interesting story and environment and sometimes some real tension. It did not take itself too seriously and it could be at least partially enjoyed on purely "leaving your brain at home" basis. But this seemed to me as if people were thinking of him doing another horror movie. One by one, the "thrilling" scene in a dark room or corridor with a fearsome music that basically attacked you overhead and said, "you're afraid". As James Cameron once said, you can't say you're afraid, you can only have your own senses. Obviously, the guys who made this film were not paying attention because they were trying to force everything in the book to be frightened rather than let you come to that level yourself. It's a clich√© for internet nerds who say "God, I was so bored of this film and felt like leaving", which is exactly how I felt, even in the middle of action scenes. They took this film seriously, which removed any enjoyment. Even the gag about how governments do not lie to their people was played with no hint of irony. <br /> <br /> As for the characters, I knew that the human characters would be completely useless in this respect. the movie, but seriously, if they're on the screen at least doing something that is relevant to the story. I don't care that this guy is beaten by his dream friend, I'm not interested in a mother who is "her own daughter who doesn't even know her, boo-hoo!" (A pair of night vision goggles? Give me a break!) or a released criminal who tries to make a decent life and give an example to his brother of what a guy is. Damn, even a mandatory moment in panties was more than usual. I feel that they expect viewers to be so shocked at the end, as well as seeing the chests coming out of the children, the upcoming mothers being raped, and so on that would replace everything. So I don't think so. Then we move to the stars of the movie and we can't write about it again. Were the aliens well designed? I would have no idea because you never see these damn things. All you see is one of the mouth, head, tail or really lengthy cg outline of climbing the wall, and hardly enough to actually handle it as a stranger in front of Mr. "I'm Marilyn Manson and NIN music videos, I think I will do the same here "Editor goes with the cut tool." Also note how directors of hack actions always set their movies at night and in the rain? Hmmmm. The predator could fight giant monkeys for everything we knew! this time more impressive and I think some new weapons were fine, but that was about it, too, because when the predator sounds like a dinosaur from The Lost World? I also giggled a bit at "getting to the helicopter!"), Although other links were stupid (the name of the main character being Dallas, give me a break) I also liked the visual FX for the Predator vision, st Just like what a hybrid alien looked like (surely he defeated the Resurrection), but indeed, these are the only positive things. Overall, I found that this film is missing, nonsensical, offensive, and above all offensive to the vision of the original creators of both creatures. Leaving the door open for another leaves me almost depressed. If they had any decency, they should remove Dan O'Bannon, Ron Schusett, and HR Giger from the credits of this film. They did nothing to deserve it.
