I write this note as a chess player, just like a movie viewer. I was looking at Kasparov-Deep Blue games from 1997 on the Internet. I know something about the problems that have been raised. Other chess players come and want to know if this movie is worth seeing / buying, and I'm talking to a great extent. However, I will try not to ignore those who are not "in check". This film is about a match between Garry Kasparov and a tailor-made "Deep Blue" computer. However, the first picture you see in the movie is not from Kasparov or from the computer, but from "THE TURK". It is a "slot machine" that was built in Europe at the turn of the 18th and 19th centuries and played winning chess against all incoming. In quotation marks I wrote the word "automatic" because it was, as everyone knows, false. There was a man inside. <br /> <br /> If you don't like seeing "TURK" then you won't be able to build a movie because "THE TURK" has as much time on screen as Kasparov, maybe more in both modern footage and b / w tracks from an old movie. The rediscovery of "TURK" every few seconds underlines Kasparov's charge that "Deep Blue" had human help - that it was a (somewhat) fake computer that IBM cheated, that there was a "man inside" working for scenes to help him win . Not only does Kasparov believe it, but even the filmmakers believe it. And so it is not much about a movie about chess games or about programming chess computers. It is a propaganda piece about a big corporation that allegedly abuses a helpless grandmaster. It really is a lot like "negative advertising for advertising" because it's full of sinister music and evocative camera work and scary sound effects and cues ("we never found out what's behind the locked door") and the ubiquitous "TURK". Now most people in the chess community are pretty much convinced that IBM was not cheating and that it was Garry's paranoia at work. To start with, to help "Deep Blue" defeat Kasparov, it seems that you need a person who was better than "Deep Blue" and better than Kasparov. Since there was no such person, the whole idea is a little suspicious from the beginning. In addition, by the time this movie was made, there were computer programs that could run on your PC that could beat the powerful grandmasters. Today, much more than in 1997, we take for granted that a computer can do things you don't expect. And it's less likely to take it as a monumental human tragedy that the computer beats in check. (And the fact is that Kasparov defeated two bad mistakes, including withdrawal from game 2 in a stretched position.) <br /> <br /> As far as chess games are concerned, they are actually very few. There are some comments from masters and commentators who will briefly tell you how they went, but in fact you will not be able to see any strategy or tactics at all. Of course, as a chess player, I consider this a major drawback, but I think other players are cheating. For example, imagine a baseball film where you hardly get into the game - just a commentator who tells you that "in play four, the White Sox beat Astros with such a score." No one would do such a movie. But here, for example, we were told that Kasparov made a bad mistake in opening the decisive game 6, but we were unable to show the position on the screen or tell us why it was a mistake or what he should have done. instead or anything. We see only a few seconds of Kasparov holding his head in his hands, and then more atmospheric sound effects and working with cameras. <br /> <br /> (Since I saw it on DVD, let me warn the chess players before the DVD Jacket promises you that add-ons include "analysis" games. This grand master analysis that people like us, maybe interesting It is an automated analysis of the computer's voice synthesizer from some version of Chessmaster, which tells you when the piece is attacked and the pawn gets isolated and that you are in "Caro-Kann Defense, Main Line." Blahhhh.) <br /> Someone could then come and say, "Well, this movie is meant to dramatize a match for a player who is not a player, so it is unfair to be impatient with him." we get to non-players - it's skating on some points that a real newcomer really wants to explain, for example, Kasparov could get "permanent control" in the second game but doesn't explain what it is (or show what it would be) off It flashes back to Kasparov-Karpov matches, but doesn't explain why there were two of them, or who organized them, etc. I didn't need this information myself, but I'm familiar with it. If you do not have a chess experience yet, there are places where you will be confused and this is just a glitch in the movie. Finally, I can't recommend the film, which, like "TURK itself", is not what it is supposed to be (documentary) but rather an illusion phenomenon.
