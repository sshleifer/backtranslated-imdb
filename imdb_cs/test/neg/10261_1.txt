Everything about this film was bad, the action was bad and the story was bad. And it was all the blood and blood that was in the "Demons", which is a good movie and it wasn't scary at all. My brother said this movie was bad, but I had to give him a chance because the first movie was very good. When the movie ended I understood why my brother thought this movie was wrong. The only plus in this movie was "Smiths" and "cult", but this is a movie and the music soundtrack is not the most important thing. And I saw that after this movie four sequels were released, none of them I saw, but they can be as horrible as this one, I don't plan to see them, but maybe I'll ever see them.
