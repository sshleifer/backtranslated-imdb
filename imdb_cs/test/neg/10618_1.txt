I chose this movie because it sounded like a pretty decent movie, and I was always a fan of foreign movies. However, for someone who likes movies, I was surprised how much I hate, hate, hate this movie. Although he is trying to uncover the lives of young, lower men in Lima and the characters are hopelessly shallow and spectators are hopelessly flowing and viewers do not even find them. Although the story mainly revolves around M, it rarely ever talks and its dialouge is at its best, amazingly dry and boring. <br /> <br /> *** Warning: Some small spoilers *** <br /> <br /> The story basically revolves around a young man named M, who was looking for jobs, but without success (he has two jobs) But they end up because they are "not for him" when you are poor, the last option is to be picky. Some amount of time is spent with his friends, who is the concept of "fun" is to rape a small 14 year old, stealing grungy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime weed bag, and several other slightly retarded activities. A friend comes up with a plan to make a $ 25,000 piece and move to the US by running Cocaine to Miami. When the drug lord gives them work, we are treated to an extremely poor scene of three friends who shop at the mall with music playing in the background. We see them trying to wear different clothes, like little girls for $ 200 to buy, get haircut there, and then the prancing looks like slippery gangsters (one figure, Carlos, will always wear sunglasses at this point ... night). The day before they leave, the group leader leaves to talk to the drug lord and let M and his friend be stupid. They're partying, taking a few samples of drugs to run, and getting into their old school, behaving like animals and breaking everything in sight. who hangs on it. Then friends go on to set fire to the payphone, which brings out a lot of kids and some old man with a gun. M and Carlos's friend, who is in charge of the drug, appears on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now. Then he takes off himself and the gunner shoots him. The police show up and arrest M and his friends (but not the man who shot the guy) and cover their dead friend with newspapers as the music plays and fades. <br /> <br /> **** Spoiler **** <br /> <br /> I even watched this movie for the second time, hoping to see some subtle, redeeming factor, but I didn't. Full waste for 102 minutes. Even though I have to give him credit for being straightforward and not moving away from disturbing elements, casting, playing, and overall direction is still a lot, a lot needs to be desired. IMHO, if you were interested in a film that explores questions that were supposed to go instead to borrow the city of God (Cidade de Deus). Avoid this waste at all costs! You were warned !!
