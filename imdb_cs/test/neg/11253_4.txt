First, I'm critical of this movie because I really had high hopes and instead, this movie sucked in. <br /> <br /> * possible spoilers * (if you haven't seen a TV series) Where to start? ? Let's start with quality. The film was barely better than the original TV series and the two battle scenes were very nicely created. However, CGI was scary. Then there is a plot of holes and questions that remain after the film is over. This film does not end up as a successful conclusion about a very broad universe known as the FMA, and only returns to the expansion of the universe more than anything else but our imagination to unravel what will happen in the future. And then there's the biggest story. Adding WWII and Hitler ... WHY? The series was perfect ... and she didn't need Hitler. Nor did Germany. Overall, the whole movie was very lace in what could be a real FMA movie and if I were a director, I'd go CoS and create a new, more "End" ending.
