This film has a very unique effect on me: I stopped my knowledge that this movie really sucks! He's disguised as a "thinker's movie" on Memento and other gems like this, but at the end, even after a few minutes, you realize it's nothing but a cricket cr4p. Probably written by a student collage with friends to tell him that his writing sucks. The whole idea is? I don't even know if she tried to scratch the supernatural, or they want us to believe that because someone fills your mind (very weak, btw) with stupid "riddles," the way they learn in primary school. suddenly you get to "one truth" about everything, then you have to kill and admit someone? !!! What? How, What, Why, Why? Is it just like saying that to make a cake, just throw a lot of ingredients, and add water? I forgot to cook? I think these guys forgot, didn't explain, but introduced the mechanism Why did this happen? You have to do this by introducing a story that normal, everyday actions (lies solving rebuses) begin to have an abnormal effect on people. Acting was horrible, with the girl who always tried to look cute at the camera, and the guy from the Highlanders, a series that was like a heavy metal trade (yeah, they're all real, though s-o-b). "Threatening" atmosphere, with "oh-so-clever" puzzles (enter the 60th series of Batman and Robin, with guest appearance Riddle) and freaks who claim to have "knowledge" for not grimacing on their faces? Just awful, HORRIBLE. I'm usually very partial about low budget movies, and I tend to take root in boasting by giving them more praise than they can earn instead of their limitations. But that's just an ugly apology for a movie that keeps you wanting to be good for an hour and a half, and at the end you'll just moan that you've fallen for it.
