A slow-moving, cumbersome film with a terrible act on the whole - but beautiful places and clothes you can admire, and of course Timothy Dalton, who always does a convincing job. I wanted to laugh loudly at voice messages - so stupid! But Dalton is worth watching, even in bad movies, by a great older actor, but still very handsome and male. This film is worth seeing just to see it .... and it seems as if it went into a bad novel novel, Poor. Your time would be better spent watching Mr Dalton in 1970 in "Wuthering Heights" or in the early 1980s BBC version "Jane Eyre". Poor Sela Ward, so beautiful, but so wooden ... surely she is better in other movies.
