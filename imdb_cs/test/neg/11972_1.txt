My roommate and I have another friend who works on a local video blockbuster. For us he finds really horrible movies and tells us about them. One of them was "Christmas Horror", where former professional wrestler Bill Goldberg played as a killer of Satna Claus. We didn't follow it immediately, but we didn't think it could be worse. It seems we were wrong. It turned out that this movie slasher "play" Ken Shamrock versus the murderous scarecrow. At first we thought Ken would actually be a scarecrow killer, and that's why we wanted to watch, but he wasn't, and that made the film worse. What completely disappeared was a teen drama. If you want to save your brain cells from trying to escape from your head, NEVER NEED THIS FILM.
