In this loser movie, humor is nonexistent. Carrot Top plays surfer dude inventor who consistently blows rent money on his goofy, useless inventions. Then assists the old man who is broken down the side of the road, and voila, he is inherited as a major corporation. And on and on and in the past jealous relatives, corporation humanization, hostile takeover, compulsory love interest .. aghgh ... let's say this film is virtually unnoticeable. What Carrot Top has accomplished is to convince me to never go to his theater performance.
