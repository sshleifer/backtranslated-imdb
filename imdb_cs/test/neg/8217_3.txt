The film successfully provides a graphical representation of the suffering of forced sex work, but nothing more. The farthest agenda behind this film can be seen miles away, leaving the viewer embarrassed to see the feeling. Women are so kidnapped and sent to former Yugoslavia to work as sex slaves because (deep breaths) the US military institution is corrupt and distracted while their private security contractors sell people abroad. You don't need half your brain to see the importance of the Iraq War and the Black Water Company. <br /> <br /> What is the load of excrement residues! It seems that I have been confused all my life to think that this problem and many others have been a direct consequence of Communist influence on the region for 45 years. But no, it was an American war with Iraq, which is also responsible for the earthquake, the tropical storm, and the constipation I had last week. The film ignores the fact that 95% of sex trade is women willing to sell their bodies for money and entry into the Western Bloc. You also see scenes that are so stupid that you want to pull your hair out. We have someone who chases a woman in the streets of London in the daylight, beats her and then somehow pulls her unconscious body half a mile back to her apartment where she rapes her. Nobody sees it or tells the police and the running woman doesn't care to scream during the pursuit. Better yet, later we will see 4-5 women in central London in the broad daylight to be sold, one of them has a broken face and people in the background are shopping as if nothing is happening. You can't do this stupidity up. I thought that such a waste was exclusive to Hollywood, but I was probably wrong.
