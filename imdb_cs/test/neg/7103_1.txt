Sometimes the film cannot be easily classified. Such a movie is "Tank Girl", part of the cartoon, sub comedy, and part of the action movie. I'm sure there is an audience for "Tank Girl" somewhere, but it's extremely small, maybe a punk comic book reader, most viewers will look for an early departure or live with a fast forward button. The flashes of humor "find my microscope and tweezers", but these little moments of comic relief are far more prevalent sophomic action sequences, there's no character development, which is not surprising because the source is comic. Do yourself a favor and avoid, avoid, avoid - MERK
