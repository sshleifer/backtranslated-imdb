The current chapter of the US Navy's elite underwater demolition team is being asked to do whatever they want, apparently. Charlie Sheen was an officer. The story is incredible. Michael Biehn is his immediate C.O., but he keeps Charlie on a fairly long leash and one of the guys pays for it soon by killing himself with Charlie's patented stupidity. The rest of the team spend their free time by committing litigation. Mostly exercises in random shooting and paper-thin ethics, these particular seals could be more suitable for filing as crash-test dummies. <br /> <br /> Some good action scenes against goofy driving.
