This movie really disappointed me. Great actors in him and a potentially great plot, but he seemed to limp together. Charlize Theron was in her role and beautiful, but 90% of her screen work seemed to be in the car chases made with Austin Minis. Product placement went wrong, so very bad. <br /> <br /> The direction has also fallen. Edward Norton is a bad guy and it was so clear from the beginning. Every time the camera goes through it, it will take too long and Norton would grimace or something. Come on, Hollywood, give us some credit! It's okay to surprise us with a twist plot without having to wire it. Sorry, but this movie was just below average. I've always been glad to appreciate the work and the talent that goes into the movie, but this one just didn't.
