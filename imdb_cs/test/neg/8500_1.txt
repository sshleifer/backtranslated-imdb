I didn't understand people who rated it over 5. I think it's a horrible movie from any point of view. Land, gaming, art, dialogue, music, anything! I don't mind the low budget. Wandering, thinking ... no doubt .. then the two boys started kissing in bed. terrible, just terrible. I love indie movies, it doesn't matter that it's slow. However, this film disappointed me from any point of view. Even Graffito, not artistic. I wonder what kind of people would like it. I'm a woman in my thirties. Is it for teens who have some sort of loneliness about life, or just don't get it? What did I get then? Wasting time! Please go to some others.
