Only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb; The first problem facing a submarine "Seaview" is what seems to be pieces - rocks? falling water and falling into the torso. But it's not rock, it's under the North Pole - it's ICE! Everyone, except perhaps mentioned small children (and even some of them) know that ICE FLOATS. Then, the disaster strikes - that damn VAN ALLEN RADIATION BELT around Earth catches fire! No one knows how it happened, we are told, which is understandable, because it is absolutely impossible for radiation to ignite, and even if it does, there is no burning for it. There is virtually no good reason to ignore the scientific concepts underlying the second grade textbooks when making a film; however, Irwin Allen manages to do over and over again; Maybe we're focusing on "people" instead, which is pretty easy because they're CARDBOARD. Cast in this ridiculous little child like the later episodes of his "lost in space" TV series, the concept of which he was pulled entirely from writer Ib Melchior and then rushed to production. Sub looks pretty good though, which is why this one. gets "2".
