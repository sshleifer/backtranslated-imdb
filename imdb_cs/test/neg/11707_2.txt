Another Boleyn Girl - not to be confused with a book he claims to be based on. This film is not even close to faithful adaptation. I understood them changing or processing a few things. The book is not perfection but it has been well written and has become very popular. I understood if the BBC wanted to do a little more faithful to what had actually happened, who really was Anne Boleyn - but it wasn't even close to making it historically accurate. It's just fluff. Mindless, made by makeup fluff. Real damage. First, it seemed that the writer and the director thought it was a good idea to set the story as if it were a TV show of reality. Seriously. They have Boleyny sitting in front of the camera and confessing how they really feel what's going on in their lives. Anne Boleyn sits in the confessional (not in the ecclesiastical kind of the Real World) and chooses what she wants to say and what she just wants to sit and smile. He looks stupid to have to use such modern film equipment in the 1500 movie. It's "The Real World: Tudor England". Jodhi May is a very good actress and after 'The Aristocrats' and 'A Turn of Screw' I become a real fan of her. But she should never be cast as Anne. Actually, I think Mary would be better. Natascha McElhone was the wrong choice. She is a good actress, certainly, but she has very modern features and does not seem convincing in period costume. (I honestly spent the first half of the film trying to see if it was "the girl" from the "Truman Show." She made Mary the eldest of the sisters. No sense, I know. It's like the BBC has forgotten that these people They are really living. They turn the story and do things up and to the left. I feel ridiculous to fix the BBC on historical inaccuracies, but really! <br /> <br /> In addition to the two sisters, the rest of the cast was really well chosen. The choice for George and his casting was the real reason I chose to find this movie, a big mistake, I'm sure he's doing a great job, but it's barely how can anyone pretend to adapt to The Other Boleyn Girl and hardly mention George Boleyn? This is simply absurd: Philip Glenister was another very good casting decision, but he was hardly in the finished product again. The script is a real problem. It's really, really bad, it's too melodramatic and doesn't work. Anne is portrayed as an air head, Mary as a leader, and George as a follower. Mary's first wife is barely mentioned, her relationship with the king is never explained - they just don't tell the story written by Phillippa Gregory. The whole thing comes as a big waste. I don't want to see this thing a second time. I think I'll have to read the book again and I hope the version of Natalie Portman to be released next year will be much better. US miniseries is on the last miniseries disc "Six Wives of Henry VIII." This is a great miniseries, but it can cost $ 50 to $ 60 and that's the way to spend if you're just looking for this piece of waste.
