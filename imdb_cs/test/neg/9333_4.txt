"Solomon and Sheba" was the movie you had to go and look back at the end of the 1950s when I was a child: a biblical epic magnificent with well-known performers, unusual costumes, lots of extras and battle sequences. So I went to see it; but I remember that at that time "Solomon and Sheba" didn't work at all at all, which was strange because I enjoyed a lot of "Ten Commandments", "Quo Vadis", "Helena Troy" and others. The thing is, when you are a child, you ignore things in pictures that adults do not have (for example, misbehavior) and you can more easily please warriors in their armor, battles, sword fights and action, so if you are not impressed, then something is wrong with the product of this genre. This movie, although having some of these features, is definitely standard and average. Yul Brynner's wooden performance as a Hebrew king does not shine when he is provocatively dancing naked Gina Lollobrigida. It is better and makes acceptable action. George Sanders is not interested in what he is doing, and Marisa Pavan (sister twin sister Pier Angeli) does not admit it as Brynner's conscience. The final sword duel between Brynner and Sanders is just for conspiracy and lacks interest and intensity (that had to be filmed, that's all). It's not a good farewell to director King Vidor, Solomon, and Sheba will probably be remembered as the last unfinished Ty Power. picture.
