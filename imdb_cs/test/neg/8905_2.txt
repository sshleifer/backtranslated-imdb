Last night I was watching TV Guide and I saw a movie in which Heather Grahm played, like in Boogie Nights and Austin Powers, so I decided to watch it. It started right, but you could say that the story was missing, and it started to deteriorate about halfway through. I don't remember this movie being in theaters, and I'm sure it wasn't that long. The meeting was musty and unconvincing, the dialogue was stupid and predictable, and the story was confusing and stupid. Definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I like movies like the ones that were compared to the Fight Club, but this isn't coming! Heather Grahm has done much better things ever since. I gave him 2 out of 10, but that's because I clicked on the wrong number, I wanted to give 1.
