I went into this movie with a bit of anxiety; the original is a masterpiece of writing and playing, and unfortunately my fears have been realized. It is a humorous work and I was sitting in the theater waiting for the beginning of the joke and humor. Upgrading the story to the present time simply did not work and altering the characters as an absolute travest - why they introduced Bette Midler's character when she disappeared as quickly as she did; the related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot. The women in the cinema laughed a few times, but nothing touched me as fun, except for the line from Meg Ryan, who talked to her mother about her situation, and told her that it wasn't like a movie from the 1930s - I wanted me to was viewing the 30s version. It was all too delicate that the "sisters held together" and really needed some acerbic wit and clever dialogue from the original game - I was still watching the original film and picking up a line I had never caught before. There is no sense in closing this new version, and while the 1939 movie is politically incorrect according to today's standards, every thread has been tied up and when the movie has ended, it has done so hard. This remake should be marked with a warning to all viewers - if you know the original, don't bother: I felt cheated by losing some of my life in the cinema where I watched this unmistakable piece of fluff. Bring the Jungle Red!
