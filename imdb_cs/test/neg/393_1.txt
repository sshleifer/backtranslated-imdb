I have one word: focus. <br /> <br /> Good. <br /> <br /> IMDb wants me to use at least ten lines of text. good. Let's discuss good goals. I don't know about you, but in the first year of the film school they taught us a lot of useless bullshit, like "you'll ever be famous avant-garde filmmakers" - but they also taught us how to make this crazy thing called FOCUSING Lens! it was amazing! you give a little twist and wham! everything is clear like a bell. A person who shot what she found alice must learn a few things about the finer points of focus. lighting. this film is not only out of focus but is also illuminated as the corner of one's cellar. nor does it start on a fence or fence. they could cut off ten seconds from the start and end of each single shot. but who cares for it anyway? there is not enough lurking in this movie to compensate for the total lack of attention to the best movie friends - FOCUS and LIGHTING. <br /> <br /> Words Wisely.
