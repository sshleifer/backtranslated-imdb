Not like I was going in anticipation of much of it, but I was at least hoping for a fun stupid big movie budget. It's not even that. This item belongs to the bottom half of all the vampire films I've ever seen (and believe me I've seen a lot). Bad behavior, zero characterization, little to no thought, almost non-existent plot (and that you can drive trucks through holes). Sure, he has action and is loud, has more action and more noise and blood and action ... These things alone do not make a good (or even half polite) movie. Beats me as some people can say it's the best vampire movie ever done - all I can assume is that they haven't seen much. Instead, I recommend seeing Near Dark.
