It beats me how people can describe this adolescent exercise as a film noir. It's true that a gun and a bottle & dame & lead is a private eye, but that's not what the genre does, people. This thing plays like an overheated TV show - a lot of bloody beatings and a miserable continuity - with a dash of Chinatown memories. Want a contemporary feel, watch everything from John Dahl.
