This film is about a depressed and emotionally narrowed person who moves with him remotely in his apartment in Istanbul. As time goes by, their relationship becomes more and more tense until they finally start screaming at their guest in the house - who is out of work and doesn't seem to want to find a job. In fact, most of the film. The problem is that while emotionally narrowed and depressed people are VERY withdrawn and not communicating, they are not very satisfying for the film. That's because most of the time he (and his roomie) simply stares into space and says nothing. I think all these flat moments could be shortened to a 30 minute film.
