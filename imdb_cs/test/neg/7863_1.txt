This movie is so bad it actually gets funny. One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my whole life. The funny thing was that there were scenes in this trailer that weren't in the movie. Just watching the trailer would save a lot of time. It actually showed everything that happened in the movie, except for the conclusion, and it was also so obvious. That's so bad. Grapes. <br /> <br /> If possible, I'd give it 0 out of 10. There's nothing to say about this movie.
