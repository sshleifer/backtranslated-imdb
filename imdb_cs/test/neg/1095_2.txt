The main character of this sex-filled drive, Mel (Ethan Hunt), notes on several occasions: "He deserves better than this!" "She" she refers to is Ginger, played beautiful Brandy Davis, who really deserves better than this. Brandy deserves better than this movie, his lame script and perverted Mel. A guy who gets off to watch his dream girl, has sex with another man, even in the virtual world, doesn't really deserve it. And for simulated sex scenes, F for script.
