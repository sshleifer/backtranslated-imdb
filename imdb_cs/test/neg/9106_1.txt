Seriously, this movie isn't. Steve Guttenburg constantly enforces his hard dialogue and then gives everyone an evil eye all the time. He just wasn't believable, he seems to be trying to be a mess and he sucks at him. I just remember him as a millionaire father with Olsen twins in It To Two Two ... so this is a big change. I rented this movie for Sean Bean and dies (as usual). Only this time he didn't get impaled on the Patriot Games, the broken giant dish (Goldeneye), or The Field. He was just shot, really fast and civic, and that was all I got from this movie that he didn't kill him in an extremely grotesque and morbid way. How sad is that? I watched it for only 3 seconds what Sean was in, and then the rest was waste. Actually, I was trying to observe and understand the plot, but it wasn't really there. It looked a bit like Mission Impossible with a hole, "Oooooo! It's a mole! He's the leader of the group and LOOKS EXPECTED! Let's catch him! Let's build a good guy to get rid of it!" This film, bent and tired, was a waste of time.
