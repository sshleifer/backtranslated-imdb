Woody Allen again seems to be completely free from any inspiration besides recycling himself. Here we have a fake documentary (like Zelig), the film's structure is a series of anecdotes (Radio Days, Broadway Danny Rose) that take place in the 1930's (Low-Life, Purple Rose, Deconstructing Harry) who believe that he is a genius, depriving him of being a jerk (ditto). Given this film and Deconstructing Harry, one wonders if this is Allen's justification for his own actions with the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow; Yes, I was a jerk, but I'm a genius, so you have to love me. Allen has only produced two good films over the past ten years; subtle but crowded bullets over Broadway, and excellent, but largely ignored Manhattan secrets. His other efforts range from little ones (New York Stories, Mighty Aphrodite), to sharp experimental (Spouses and Wives), to pure voices (Alice, Shopping Center Scenes, Shadows and Fog, Celebrity, Deconstructing Harry). His films are no longer trying to tell the arc, and his humor seems to be moving towards a wildly entertaining, not humorous one. After rebuilding Harry I stopped seeing his films in theaters; after Sweet and Lowdown I can stop renting too.
