The characters were so unoriginal that they hurt. A little skinny little computer geek, a humorous African-American with stupid loops, a cool white boy with compassion and a handsome leader who ends up with a pretty girl. The actors are average on average. Ecsept from Norton who does a pretty good job as a bad guy. The rest of the movie is also stupid and loses time. It's all about a group of spoiled boys who use the world as their playground, where every safe in a big house is what keeps them on the table. Why work for a living when you can rob people? And, Who's playing with this world with traffic lights in a big European city?!? And in the middle of the day, FRIGGIN!? Think of all the damage and don't say the death of innocent civilians. What about all ambulances and fire? I created NO compassion for the main characters and the weather Mr. Wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not, I couldn't give less fart.
