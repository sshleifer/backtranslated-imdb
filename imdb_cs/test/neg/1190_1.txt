In the first 25 minutes of tracking it was obvious that the writers really wanted to make a feature film and seemed pleased with the process, but then seemed to forget the fact that he needed a decent chart! If the best things they could do were to bring the three most horrible characters into the real world and have "all kinds of fun capers", then they should stay well alone! I didn't laugh once and the whole "Baron Munchausen / Time Bandits" adventure in the middle was very, very poor! Converted, resourceful and very free. It seemed as if he were whistling for a stop tour of whatever they thought they could only work to drag them to a function. In order to save them, Jeff managed to enroll in a partial story / time-lapse of William and Mary and an era. If he could, why wouldn't they just write Royston - duh ?? And Mr. Lipp's audition? What was it for? What it was? Did he do it and we didn't hear anything else about it? My main point is that when I loved the show, it was a badly thought-out, seemingly rushed project. That's how it was, the conspiracy was so bad that if we didn't know the characters yet (and as a fan I had some loyalty to continue watching), and we relied only on the story itself, that would be a flat on my face! At best, it would go directly to the video and at worst it would never be the first! Or maybe it should be the other way around? Really awful.
