This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It is supposed to be a remake or update of "The One-Armed Swordsman" by Chang Cheh. Ham fistedka and lousy choreography mean that the battle scenes are not worth it. The script is desperately trying to seem serious, but it is full of clich√©s like, "And then I knew there would never be the same thing again ..." or "If I knew what I would have to pay." And who is the girl who plays Sing? Someone will find it and have it removed! She's terrible. If you like Chinese martial arts movies, you should be better with Lau Gar Leung. It stinks.
