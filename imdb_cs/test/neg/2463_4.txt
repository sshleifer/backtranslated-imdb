"Once again we have a movie that packs about 20 minutes of entertainment - most of which include occasional funny band lyrics - in the 90-minute package." For anyone who's old enough to remember, it's in line with the first "Bill and Ted" WITHOUT the story. If it doesn't say enough about how reckless this movie is, think about Jack Black, who sings about 20 minutes of film, and that's his point of sale. If you really like to listen to Tenacious D because of their musical prowess, then knock and buy a soundtrack. Don't waste time with it. If your stoner is looking for a good bad movie full of laughter, you still bark the wrong tree. Regardless of the strength of your buds, you will still want to make your grandmother's boy instead.
