It's boring. <br /> <br /> It's slow. Where are the nasty and brutal murders? Where is the tension that is supposed to scare us? It's like watching Sesame Street without the funny characters Ernie and Bert or Grover. <br /> <br /> It's really lame. Maybe it was writing ... maybe direction. Maybe it's acting, maybe about editing, maybe about cinematography, maybe about special effects, maybe about makeup. Perhaps all of the above has brought something barely able to keep your eyes focused. /> <br /> I wanted to scare ... bored. That didn't scare me ... I didn't even care ... I had more fun watching time in the microwave instead of watching this movie. Do not bother to buy it .. and if you see it on TV with some enthusiasm, you do not have to sleep.
