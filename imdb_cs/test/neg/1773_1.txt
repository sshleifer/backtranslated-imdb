This movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The storyline could be made to work, the film was written better. The meeting was one of the worst I've ever seen. I was very slow and let me leave the movie several times. I watched the whole movie in the hope that the end would pay off, but not. this movie I think should be rated in negative. (In my humble opinion)
