From a handful of alternative titles in English, "The Sexorcist" is definitely the most appropriate because it is basically just a shameless rip off William Friedkin's classic horror movie in which they replaced the 13-year-old Linda Blair with the 19th-old Stella Carnacina just so that she could unreasonably show her brave naked body. I'm not sure what exactly Satan is trying to achieve here, but he seems to actually own a young girl to play sexual tricks on her! Poor Danila masturbates continuously and tries to seduce the priest and even her own father to have sex with her. A young girl is introduced as an intelligent and ambitious student of theology with a strange friend (driving a silly yellow car) and loving, though adulterous parents. Taking his special home, where he restores himself, the ancient relics come to life and not less than Satan himself (played by Ivan Rassimov of "Jungle Holocaust" and "Planet of the Vampires") will start bothering her. Timeless masturbation and some bizarre nightmare sequences cover about three quarters of the film, and finally director Mario Garriazzo begins with real exorcism. This ultimate segment is even more embarrassing and amateurish! The priests are not really saying anything except a few vague prayers, but somehow Danila heals. There's not much gore, dialogues are terrible and producers seem to compensate for every little mistake by adding more sleaze! This is one of the strangest Italian exploitation efforts of the 1970s (why the hell do they refer to "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"?), But certainly not one of the best. If you have the taste of clones "The Exorcist", I recommend "Demon Witch Child", "Behind the Door" and "Antichrist".
