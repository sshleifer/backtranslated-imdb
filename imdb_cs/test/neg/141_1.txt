Her bit-part as a masseuse, in a lurid sequel to the original 'Emmannuelle', evidently gave someone a clear idea of ​​putting the key to the work of the French soft-core gambard by flipping Caucasian carnitality and casting Javan stunner Gemser in the lead role in this, somewhat tame first a series of sexploiters that became increasingly corrupt as sleazier directors took in-name-only sequels. Someone (and certainly not the English language Overner-carrier Warner?) was also anticipating the 'star's born' meteoric type extending from the results, judging by the way the actress is credited only with the eponymous moniker on the heroine's screen even though he has sacrificed a few consonants as insurance against litigation. Gemser's possession in the series saw her as an "intrepid" photographer, which of course allowed all sorts of subsequent adventures in the world. But even though she might have been one of the most beautiful actresses on the screen at the time, any talent that was there can be recognized in the same kind of unrealizable cogitation ("I must admit that since I was in Africa, I have found white skin less attractive ... ") that was in French movies. <br /> <br /> And in this particular entry, much to the dismay of Brno's cape, the essence of on-screen carnality is so much to be found in puerile symbolism (pumping pistons) the engine!) as it is in prosaic connections - though naturally these include the generous dollops of 'exploratory' lesbianism, however, kitsch experts are guaranteed by a continuous stream of auditory delicacies that, with such epithets of ethnographic wisdom as "I do nothing to be perfect black, does everything to be perfect white ”.
