I am surprised by the number of people who rated this record as their favorite "Chan" (have they ever seen "... in the opera" or "... on the treasure island?" Ironically written by John Larkin, who has fallen here. Firstly, viewers must remember the sharp details of Steve McBirney (played by the venerable thief and HUAC squerer Marc Lawrence) in 1929. Let's not forget that he escaped the main murderous rap at a courtroom with a lone tail officer. also a victim that was fished out of the river 11 years earlier that no one seems concerned.Then there is a suspension of distrust needed when all the characters are seemingly trapped in a wax museum (although Inspector O'Matthews manages to control his thick wet back end Why is Joan Valerie (as a Cream Assistant) in this movie? Can't even handle tongs properly - I realize Chan is suffering with the same boo-boo, but yeesh, he's 66 years old-- (and has fewer than 10 lines --- and her character's motivation is too weak to ever be adequate) splained (excuse me when i write on rantu as Ricky Ricardo). Mary Bolton (Marguerite Chapman) character is written as an eager wide-eyed moron, apparently existing only for the miserable romantic interest of horndog lawyer Tom Agnew (played by Ted Osborne with ferret) Why is Willie Fern a character? Why couldn't McBirney's follower switch at 8:20? (not spoiler, all right?!). The hair IQ that can dress or why it did not appear before bus flights is Toler in itself a slightly more powerful rope than usual (plus), and the real kudos go to stage designer Thomas Little and cinematographer Virgil Miller who has created a truly spooky atmosphere ... but this record has less logic than the Ritz Brothers movie. until confusion as a toothpick can be used as a blow gun.
