Ed Wood, perhaps the worst filmmaker of all time, has left us gems that are so bad, delightful, unintentionally funny and therefore charming and innocent. James Lay and his financial helpers (mom and dad seem to be out of credits) created in 'Dreamland' a movie just as badly made as any Ed Wood movie, but lacked charm or innocence. Dreamland just stinks, and the only good thing about this 90-minute loss of time is certain knowledge that James Lay and his fellow perpetrators will never make another picture. I have to mention some of the dramatic some of the crew have avoided joining this horrible image. I'm sure the production director, once he saw the finished film, demanded that his name be changed to "Donna Snartlebutt" and "Brutus". One can imagine 'Brutus' with his role of 5 dollar bills to pay the crew at the end of the shooting day. I'm used to mentioning a lot of technical issues with this poor little videotape, but I have to mention a few comments that compare this slag to the work of David Lynch. You know you've made a real stink when you have your mom to sign up for an IMDb and send such a stunning BS - no one, except for violent mental patients, could - whatever it is - mistake 'dreamland' - with something produced by Lynch . What a terrible peace against Mr. Lynch and his work. Go back to film school, Mr. Lay.
