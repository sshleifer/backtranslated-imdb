Two refugees fled the forest and shot two campers in the head. That's the first scene, and that made me worry about what was in the store. But by the end of the first half hour, I was all overwhelmed with a flood of images. Not because I took care of as few characters as possible, but because I was horrified by the way the movie was executable, and was curious to see how low it really was to be immersed. Frank (Remar) and Red (Woolvett) are former prisoners. After murdering two innocent campers who sailed through the forest and entangled themselves in the isolated cabin of Dean Stockwell and his two sons, lawyer Keith and estranged gay Behr. At first, the attackers pretend that their car breaks down and need to use the phone, but gradually reveal their identities. Well, it looks like a familiar territory. "Desperate Hours" or "Funny Games" maybe. But - hang - a gay son is with both. Stockwell, when he discovered his son in flagrante delicto with another man named Billy, seemed to kick Billy and toss him out. Billy died and Behr now accuses his father of death. And in fact, Daddy's kind of a Neanderthal in terms of paraphilia, the fact that he was just found with a secretary no matter what happened. Behr was looking and looking for astonished thirst, looking for someone else who knew Billy, someone with whom he could share his despair. It turned out to be one of the refugees, and now Behr is determined to see them to his freedom. <br /> <br /> After that, everything will twist. People talking. He talks and talks. He talks constantly. And not the two insane killers who just can't wait to put them in the eye. No - the dialogue goes like, "You were so afraid of something inside yourself that you even banished your own SON." It is Behr, a young gay man, talked to Stockwell. It's like an afternoon home drama has its genes mixed with a thriller killer in some transformation device or cocktail shaker. The only real performance James Remar provides is more talkative and sinister. both refugees. And mainly because of his gruff, but the liquid baritone that sounds like Lance Henrickson, and his wide guppy-like lips. It is light on both eyes and ears. Dean Stockwell gave a decent performance, including his invaluable bizarre turn in "Blue Velvet", in which he was my backing player, but here laziness, advancing years, or Slack's direction shaped each of his movements and every utterance into stereotype . It's like reading directions on stage - "Look in surprise" and "shout angrily" - and follow them literally. There is no surprise in the basket. <br /> <br /> If a gay son, Jason Behr, sometimes blinked, it had to be when I flashed at the same time because I missed it. He has a long neck and only one expression in his instrument. As a secondary villain Woolvett fades into the wood of a pine knot. The lawyer's son is Robert Glen Keith. I hope he hasn't finished his daily work. <br /> <br /> The direction is pedestrian, the performance is functional without being the least innovative. Sometimes it is confusing. I lost track of where everyone should be when the murderers orbit the cabin porch and the family locked inside the shotgun. Also, I couldn't understand how Stockwell could get through the cabin door, hit Remar and knock him in the back flip of the porch, and then Remar could simply stand up, brush up and come up with a rough riposte Two can play this game. But why next? See if you have to.
