Gene Hackman is a former Marines Colonel who gathers a handful of private vets from Vietnam to return to Laos and save some Americans who were listed as missing in action. Hackman suspects that in fact half a dozen MIAs are secretly being held in a remote Laoana camp to be troubled and provide more hard work. Hackman is paid by rich Robert Stack, whose son, like Hackman's son, is considered MIA. But the circumstances are that Hackman will only be able to buy old and outdated weapons, even if he succeeds in picking up the help of the ardent anti-Communist Loatian and his two daughters on the way. I don't think the film was deliberately invented to support the Vietnamese myth that still holds our MIA for propaganda purposes. Myth was real enough. If anyone remembered, in 1982 and 1983 there were many stickers. Instead, I think the film was created in part to earn a myth. It was absurd on his face. Why would our former enemy refuse to return MIA? Propaganda? Where is the value of propaganda in something that is secret? Do you want to add a job offer? Do they need a hundred other workers in Vietnam and Laos? The motives of this film - with its triumphal music and high number of bodies - were bleak. But what about the movie itself? It is deprived of its theme of rescuing the mythic abused MIA, a routine paramilitary action, no better and worse than dozens of others that appeared in the 1980s. Gene Hackman's performance is the only one that can keep his head above water. It's probably always reliable. Of the others, this is a formal plot derived from "The Dirty Dozen" among others, I tried to guess which of the gangs would sacrifice for the mission. Of the three anti-communist Asians, I thought one or more was dead meat. That's why Asian helpers appear in films like this. Also, I realized that Patrick Swayzie was a newcomer to a former officer, the youngest of a group who had never "worshiped" others because he had never seen a fight, and he had to go into a heroic regime. Poorly. It becomes a hero, true, but survives intact. I thought there were fifty-fifty chances that Hackman would have to go too, but that's okay. Also, the formula is not limited to originality. Charles Bronson's claustrophobic prisoner of war from "The Great Escape" is Fred Ward's rat in the former tunnel, a claustrophobic who is forced to walk through a drainage pipe with a snake inside to take place in a Laotian prison camp. The title "Uncommon Valor" is a tribute that Admiral Nimitz made to men on Iwo Jima - "Uncommon valor was common on that day." Nimitz was certainly right about it. Whether the men who fought in Vietnam were equally relentless, they are away from the place. Anyone who saw the fight, or even approached it, put their lives on the line for the boys in a row beside them, was heroic enough. This film and the way it uses our bitterness in the Vietnam War doesn't really make them justice.
