"Snowball Express" from Disney Studios is not as dated as its output from this era. There are no hippies or hot-rodders, just a blunt-like-bowl of Dean Jones to inherit a shabby hotel / ski resort from a deceased relative. When Jones and the family retreat to the sleepy city of Colorado, the people who give them instructions - look like additions from "Delivery" - they are curiously vague about the hotel (we expect it to look like one room), but actually the accommodation is very nice . Jones's teenage daughter has a sour face on her face (which does not prevent one of the local yahoos from jerking), and of course clumsy pop Dean Jones is a regular stumblebum on the slopes, leading to many pratfalls in the slush. Perhaps this square scenario might have benefited from some magical whim because this script is frozen stiff. * of ****
