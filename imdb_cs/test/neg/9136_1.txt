PLEASE?! When it comes to technology and what a person does to kill others and himself, I think I missed his whole point. Because I felt like Reggio, he relied on shots of the Cold War space exploration, and NEW NEW should not add to the technology fear dialogue. Trails 1 and 0, indicating technology and math and science - DONE. Anyone out there seeing the Matrix? And movement studies of people on the move? Have you ever heard of Edward Muybridge? At least he uses accurate Muybridge clips of human movement studies photographs. <br /> <br /> This movie was derived, and the score is just enough Philip Glass to sound like everything happened in the last 10 years ... Avoid this movie for ALL costs !!
