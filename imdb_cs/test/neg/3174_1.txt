This movie is terribly bad. You can say that all the actors are embarrassed to be associated with such a horrible film. There are obvious budget constraints, but with little thought and attention to detail the movie could be so much better. For example: look at a scene where Mickey first goes to the morgue and talks to his pathologist friend while the murdered taxi driver lies on the board. You can actually see the corpse that breathes! What, they couldn't afford to rent half a decent extra that could hold their breath for a 2-minute scene?
