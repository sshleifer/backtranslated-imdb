I recently watched Ed Wood Jr.'s autobiographical film for the first time. Glen or Glenda, when I've heard so much about it for so many years. Nothing I read or heard about this movie could prepare me for what I saw. This must be the most bizarre movie ever made. The banging buffalo, the women in slavery, Satan prancing around, and Bela Lugosi, laughing just as he can, "Bevare, Bevare .... pull the string, pull the string ...", that was completely crazy. The acting was cruel and the dialogue was unintentionally cheerful, exactly what one would expect from Ed Wood's film. When I said it all, as horrible as it was in this movie, I have to give Wood a credit ... he was so far ahead of his time. You have to remember that when this film was made, transvestites were not even discussed in public, much less as a film subject. I read that Wood was a transvestite in real life, and I'm sure this film is based on his own experience. It was sad to see that Bela Lugosi had to say the ridiculous line he had to say for this film, but it was kind of like Ed Wood Jr. at least give Mr Lugosi an acting job in Bela's life when he was out of money. and a drug addict and no one else in Hollywood will hire him. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you'll need to see it, especially if you're an Ed Wood Jr. fan.
