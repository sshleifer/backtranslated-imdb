This movie, which I rented under the name "Black Voodoo", should be avoided. I was expecting blaxploitation / horror flick; but what I got was very boring, the standard "ghost riot". In this case, he was the spirit of a religious cult leader who tried to refuse treatment, but who was raised in the opposite direction and he died in surgery. The result: his spirit represents Sister Sherry and forces her to commit murder. The only voodoo connection was to one of the three black characters, in this case a blind former footballer who used Voodoo to teach Mommy. The movie is very slow and very boring. There is a very standard ending that provides for excitement, followed by a terribly stupid ending (warning: SPOILER) <br /> <br /> In which a woman actually manages to defend herself against murder charges by saying she is obsessed. This movie is slow and bad in a no-funny, just stunning way. Avoid at any cost.
