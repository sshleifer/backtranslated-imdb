All right, this is no way for a confectioner. The storyline was ridiculous, the assumption was ridiculous, the acting was incomprehensible, the effects were ridiculous, and all the outdoor scenes seemed filmed in Central Park, New York. That being said, there was something about this movie that I couldn't leave. Maybe it was an atmosphere or maybe it was a bad super-vixen or amazon wenches. Anyway, I'm not the one to sit on the edge and criticize without pointing out a few redeeming features, so they're here. The violent off-shoot female lean movement is depicted in the wild (central park, of course) and all masochistic young men will be very impressed there. In addition, some scenes in which certain characters lose consciousness are amusingly dramatic (you'll notice I write dramatically rather than convincingly). All I can say is that some people like B movies and I'm one of them. If you are one of them too, then do it. Cheers, Mr. Kincaid. This is one for ages.
