Larry Bishop, writer / actor / director, focuses too much on camera, music and visual effects. The film resorts to meaningless ramblings and vulgar monologues that seem to have no other purpose than a boring and irritating audience. The actors experience a bumpy ride, from the beginning of the film to the end, and are caught in one terrible smoke screen. To hell with the ride. The movie is a bomb. The winners are presented as weathered vigilantes who seek their own form of justice for what they see as injustice. They are cyclists, anti-heroes and protagonists. Pistolero, played by Larry Bishop, is a vengeful leader of the pack. Ghent (Michael Madsen) is trapped in his own chaos and psychosis. Comanche (Eric Balfour) is loyal but mysterious. Deuce, conducted by David Carradine, was supposed to go through the ride, so ticket buyers (if you decide to see the movie, I'm sorry, but you'll find out why). Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) is a lewd and poisonous character, completely filled with contempt. What's guessing me is how this film, with all its constant ramblings and vulgarity, ever got someone investing in a ride that doesn't go anywhere. Ticket buyers, take my advice: don't pay for a ride. Please do not make the same mistake as investors. The first fifteen minutes of the movie is confusing and incomprehensible. A dialogue that quickly turns into nonsensical monologues makes no sense. The whole movie is great to get anywhere. Poor Dennis Hopper is caught in the middle of a real mess. He too was supposed to go through the ride. There are decapitated heads, slashed throats and naked women wrestling. It is clear that Bishop does not know where to go with the film. It's completely lost. But until the end of the ride, you just don't get damned. Mami Mia! To stay at home. And in all ways, don't take a ride. This movie rated 1 out of 10, but this movie is so terrible it deserves zero.
