I looked at this mainly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel, two of my favorites. The storyline has many twists and turns - it's not bad as a direct secret aboard the train. But why throw a wreck with a circus train and a leaked gorilla? I can mention it without being a "spoiler" because the wreck in the circus and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mysterious plot. The bad guy trying to kill good people has many tricks on his sleeve, but the wreckage of the circus train was purely coincidental. This allows one scene with a terrible gorilla, but then it's back to the murder mystery!
