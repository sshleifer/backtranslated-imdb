This is the worst movie I've ever seen. 85 minutes of totally bad acting (half the cast seems to suffer from Asperger's syndrome) gruesome wigs, strange make-up (including tidal lines around wig areas) and stooges than those with a barber than the dialogue you want to throw up. One comical aspect of this movie, if you have the patience to watch it, is the sheer overwhelming amount of costume changes the unfortunate cast appears from scene to scene - was this movie backed by a catalog maker desperately evasive pastel casual wear? Was the cast paid in clothing for their efforts? They certainly didn't deserve anything else! This frightening film effort brings in the first half a turbulent conspiracy that blends into the equally confused arch of the Christian bible. The entire cast and production team should be burned at the border, or at least crucified!
