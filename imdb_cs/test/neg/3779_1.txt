I have heard that high school partners have built this move. She is not too bad as an art or theater project in high school. If you lived close to milpitas in the 1970s or you didn't know someone who was involved in making a movie, it's pretty awful. Most actors are apparently not actors, but local residents who volunteered. Bob Wilkins (original Creature Features host at KTVU in Oakland will appear, but only about a minute). Some of the monster effects are done with animation stop motion and some with a man in a monster suit and everyone works fine on his own, but there is no connection between the two. Watching without dialogue assumes that the movie had 2 monsters. I think the most unfortunate aspect is that even the main characters that I suppose are children behind the film can't even pretend to act. These kids had to be involved in the theater in some way to do it, but they show zero believable emotions in front of the camera.
