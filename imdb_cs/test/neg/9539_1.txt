.... is where I suppose this movie comes from. So far I have been watching a lot of B movies during my young life and I wouldn't even call it B movie. I remember seeing movies in my high school mass media class that beat this level. So the assumption is ... a lot of dance numbers and goofy crap. Women in bikinis that are not so great that they start, dance at the beginning and sing. Boys with furry chests appear and girls with fangs who are in the sun. I think I can hardly put together a cohesive sentence, just thinking about this movie. According to most people on this site, Manos's hands of destiny and under people are the worst movies (classic MST3K :-D) ... I used to be one of them. Then I saw this movie. I usually don't try to burn a movie too much, but the people who did it really deserve it. It is THAT bad and unbearable, and I am assuming that the director or actor in the film is the only person who has rated this ten.
