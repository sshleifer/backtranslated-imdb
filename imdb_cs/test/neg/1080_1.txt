This is a pitiful Hollywood remake of classic British film. All that made the original "Italian Job" amusing was bleed out of this vile painful film "written" by Donna and Wayne Powers and obediently "directed" by F Gary Gray. I am amazed that Troy Kennedy Martin (original film writer) allowed his name to be used in credits for this pig's ear. Martin has worked on several of the best film and television projects of the past forty years. Even vaguely linked to this stinking NOT ARE GOOD THINGS. The humor is forced, the drama is strenuous, all characters are a nice crimp (except for Charlize Theron's unlikely, beautiful) Safe cracker / rally driver) and the graph only matches the original on the following points: < br /> <br /> (1) Three Minis (modern BMW but Minis however) <br /> <br /> (2) Using Croker and Bridger for 2 main characters <br /> <br /> ( 3) Disrupting the traffic management system in the city to ensure a safe route through it. <br /> <br /> (4) Er, that's all. Otherwise, what you get is a bland and unlikely American by-the-numbers robbery movie, in which a gang of cheerful pirate friends eventually gets a better bad companion. Believe me, it's been a long time before they do it. The cast does their best with what is given to them, but everyone seems to have taken it as a polishing exercise after reading the script. None of the original films is the quirky nature, and the distinctly British taste has survived to be fed to the Hollywood machine hamburger. Do yourself a favor and watch the original 1969 movie instead of this suction wound. It's no wonder that Noel Coward didn't do Aunt Nelly, jumped out of his grave and kicked in the teeth of anyone who was involved in this half-throated lukewarm remake. Italian work? More like Jobbie Italian.
