I'm a chess player and I wanted this movie. The problem is that the content could be set in a 30-minute document. There were plenty of corridors in the corridors, and Kasparov was looking out into the hall to win the world championship. There were other Kasparov shots being bypassed the match site of 1997 and are told where he sat and where Deep Blue was located. It just looked like a filler. Also I didn't find interesting to see in detail where Deep Blue was now and saw IBM Techie trying, 'unsuccessfully' to open it. What could we see in any case - the Grand Master? A recent game against Karpov. I no longer follow professional chess to know when and where it was. Would it be nice if I was told: was it a one-time "just for money"? Was it part of the World Cup? What was the final score? The Nub movie was a game in game two. Could IBM let Kasparov see 'inside' the machine? There should be focus.
