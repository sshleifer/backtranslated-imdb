This was Hitchcock's third Hollywood feature, and it seems he was still settling in a pattern of consistency, turning from a faithful adaptation of the classic novel in Rebecca, to a spy thriller in a foreign correspondent, and now this romantic comedy in the form of "screwball" pictures Hitchcock's formal method, on the other hand, has so far settled in something consistent, so much that he could not (or at least not want to) deviate from it. Outside her usual genre and romantic comedy was particularly inappropriate, in Rebecca it was actually great to see Hitchcock confined by his producer and source text, who was forced to turn his technique into a heavy Gothic drama, but there was a huge mismatch between form and form for Mr. and Mrs. Smith. In other words, Hitchcock wasn't Ernst Lubitsch. <br /> <br /> Let's look at the romantic angle first. tchcock's movies were wild, passionate, and slightly dangerous? "ever fell in love with someone you shouldn't have?" the situation, and he was great at being able to do it. This is something that makes a much earlier movie, Rich and Strange, one of the few non-thrillers of Hitchcock that really works. However, Hitch is not so good about the finer and more familiar love story. A light, gentle touch is required and Hitch does not. Second, take your comedy. Of course, Hitchcock's movies could be funny? Lady Vanishes is probably the best example? but only when jokes were sprinkled throughout the story. Stress Master is simply not enough to make a comedy film that has funny bones. Sculpts scenes like he did in a thriller? shocking opposing angles of people who speak, embedded shots of hands and feet, footage from view? but it does not allow comic timing or focus on gags. For example, Carola Lombard's dress shop appears to us with a few close-ups, but they are timed more as if they revealed some important point in the plot, and they have no comedic impact. Does Hitchcock's style sometimes coincide with comedy? for example, arranging characters in a scene in a club where Robert Montgomery tries to make it look like he is with an attractive, sophisticated woman at another table? but such moments are few and far away. Even the cast of Mr. and Mrs. Smith are not at the level. I'm not sure it was Robert Montgomery's strength, and he's boring here. Of course, that was exactly where "Queen Screwball" was lying. Carole Lombard was lying, and although she was doing well, the scenes were not aimed at capturing comedy shows. Even Jack Carson, who might be happy when he was allowed to go in front of the camera, could not absorb things at all. Of course, neither of these actors is assisted by a screenplay that is not primarily laughing laughter, although the underlying story is a fairly good premise. The only full - Hitchcock comedy he did after this was a problem with Harry, and this kind of work worked because he was playing at his familiar tension. But was it only when the story could have existed independently of humor when the underlying framework was tense? how is it in The Lady Vanishes or Family Plot? that Hitchcock was able to do comedy well.
