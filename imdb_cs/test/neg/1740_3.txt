This meager attempt to drive away his typically bland Japanese horror film toward a haunted cult hit did not have the ammo needed to engage the audience around the world. Translated into faith, Uzumaki is just about - an irrational and exaggerated tribute to a strange descending spiral into nothingness that seemingly captivated the entire little town in a dementia possessed by madmen. Although it certainly does for a nice b-film on the surface, traditionally tiring acting, directing and screenplay will all have, but Asian horror enthusiasts shake their heads in dismay. What could be roughly translated into the Japanese equivalent of David Lynch's earlier piece, he warns instead that it's a spiral trick before he even has a chance to explain - which, of course, isn't. In addition to a few clever techniques, the film rarely combines a dizzying theme with a boring scenario that eventually comes as a cheap exploitation into a cult genre, replacing the empty metaphor with true substance. When the film was over, there was hardly anything that was extracted from any of the interactions, saving only a few scenes or images that rose above one movie. At least I applaud the filmmakers for trying to translate the genre into supernatural, metaphysical realms, and to understand the gross losses lost in the translation, but with zero substance that could return any of its madness, it will probably be pushed to the obscure fanboy's bong-backed cellars.
