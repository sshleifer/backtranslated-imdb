This movie seemed to be in a hurry for some reason. It's definitely not a good movie. So unbelievable. The scenes where the president (Holbrook) was in the center of the city and went among people were a farce. There would be no chance for an ordinary people to be in this real-life situation within 30 meters of the president. If it wasn't for blood and profanity, it was shot as a TV movie. It could be decent if it were different. Holbrook's (presidential) talent has never been realized in this film. Shatner's deal is fine. Production values ​​in this film leave much to be desired. Overall, I think that most people would not have to waste time watching this issue.
