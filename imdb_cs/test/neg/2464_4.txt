Jack Black and Kyle Gass play in this comedy show of fantasy versions of their side band Tenacious D, an art-rock outfit with satirical, spiny text. An ex-runaway possessed by a heavy metal and beachfront-lively, pot-smoking slacker who pretends to be a rock god meeting and forming a band (birthmarks on both of their ass-faces form a group of moniker). Launching with a funny prologue based on the Twisted Sister video of the 1980s, "The Pick of Destiny" is a fairly well-produced film targeting older children; it occasionally resembles nothing more than a medieval variation of "Wayne of the World", with a jokey-stoner interludes and a climactic fit with Beelzebub himself, yet Black and Gass have an extremely comfortable relationship (they also acted as producers, co-wrote script and all music) . Obviously, the target audience will go, even though the inspiration is somewhat low, especially in the second half (just as our heroes impulsively overtake cops in a student vehicle). The musical sequences are much more successful than attempts at film satire, and in the first thirty minutes, Jack Black's manic enthusiasm is contagious. * 1/2 from ****
