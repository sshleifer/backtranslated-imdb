As embarrassing as I admit, I was ranked among the producers of this film ... my first! In fact, it was the first feature film for almost everyone involved. Watch carefully and you will even see me in one of the opening scenes, as soon as a murdered asylum-seeker named ... "Cell" (my last surname). Originally called "hostage", this image was changed to "another son of Sam" by the producer-director who wanted to cash on a serial killer in the newspaper at the time. Nothing could help. I don't think this picture is good enough to be featured on "MST 3K!" The film was shot primarily by a collection of old Mitchell cameras and early Arriflex cameras. The fact is that the helicopter shot during the siege siege was filmed by Arri's own World War II era. The film was shot entirely in Charlotte and Belmont, North Carolina in the mid-1970s. Most of the "stars" were local television newsletters, and the rest of the crew were simply inexperienced enough or trusting enough to trust former stuntman and producer director, Dave A, Adams' illusion of adequacy. <br /> <br /> If you like this type of picture, you can love the work of another North Carolinian, the legendary Earl Owensby. <br /> <br />
