It is perhaps the hands of the worst movie each made, that actually took itself seriously. And not as a result of acting because being an actor, I have to say that Rickman and Stowe had to be in their best case to escape the need for electroconvulsive therapy after the basic photo was packed. As one of the 57 people who actually saw the film in a theatrical release, I have to say that I have never before, or since the movie where the film ended, the credits rolled, lights in the house and no one moved from their seats . About five minutes after the lights in the house came on, people started coming out of their mosquitoes to look around, and I think most of us thought it was a good joke, right? . Finally, after the publishers sent out disguises, and we swore a promise of secrecy that we would never admit we were there, we felt it was safe to leave, to pray that we would not be seen leaving the auditorium. I've seen a few bad movies in my day, (I have a Cinemax for the good), but I'm still bitter that I will never be able to recover those two or two hours of my life that I lost while watching Closet Land.
