Was it a film based on the novel of modern literary god Koontz? I refuse to believe that the studio bought the rights to this film for anything using the name Genius Koontz. From the moment my eyesight became weak enough to require a large press, I couldn't read this book as I had at least twice a year since the first reading. I missed the book and couldn't find it in the Grand Press. I was hoping to borrow this movie, at least I'd buy my Watcher servants, but this movie was an experience. Given the subtle plot points, in my opinion, none of Mr. Koontz's, or the most respectable authors for the matter, can be crammed into 1-2 hours of the film. It will be a wise network, Cable or other wise, who buys the rights to this novel and makes a multiple TV movie of the film, ie the mini series, this book the right way! one star out of five - I could go below ...
