Why the poster and artwork say "Clubbed is one of Britain's best independent movies I've seen in a very long time. SCREEN INTERNATIONAL" when it was quoted by the French distributor REPORTED by Screen International. See www.screendaily.com/ScreenDailyArticle.aspx?intStoryID=39811, which reads: <br /> <br /> "Pretty Pictures has acquired all French speaking rights to the club club Neil Thompson .... James Velaise, President of Pretty Pictures "Clubbed is one of the best British movies I've seen in a very long time." "<br /> <br /> Isn't that rather misleading? The distributor is obliged to say that it is good. Are other quotes real?
