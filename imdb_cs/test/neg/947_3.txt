The most accurate description of how Billy Crystal Fairs in "My Giant" is to say that this film is to his career as "Ishtar" was to Warren Beaty - it didn't spoil it, but it slowed it down ..... many. Crystal should know the three golden rules of Hollywood: 1) Never play opposite a child 2) Never play opposite an animal 3) Never play against something that is nearly three meters taller than you are as innocent as a child and "acts" like an animal. <br /> <br /> What's this story? Comedy? But I think I wasn't allowed, except for those scenes where Crystal is alone and not burdened by his ex-wife (co-is-her-role-in-this-movie) or the aforementioned Giant. Did I mention that there is also a child in the movie? Forget him. The son is brought to apologize for Crystal, and we, but for the actor, not for the character. Billy Crystal is a funny man. If you don't believe me, watch him in the old "Soap" or "Saturday Night Live" episodes. Go rent a "City Slicker" or "Running Scared" or "When Harry Met Sally." "Giant" is more ho-hum than fee-fi-fo-fum. <br /> <br />
