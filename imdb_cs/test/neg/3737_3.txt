Above all, I think casting and acting were excellent. The problem is the story. There is basically no story to pay off, so there is essentially no film here. Larry McMurtry did Lonesome Dove and I can't cause the original, though it probably didn't need a sequel. He did Huda with Paul Newman, which is one of my favorite movies. Mellencamp is supposed to be a country singer, but the only song I hear singing is the old song Buck Owens. The film makes a large piece of chicken breeding. Mellencamp's character has a good woman and is absolutely stupid to go crazy from her. The sliding cage incident is stupid. Maybe people do it for fun in some parts of the country, but I've never heard of it.
