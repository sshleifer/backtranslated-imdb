That's a parody. This means that there are no characters as such, they are all simple stereotypes and the film relies entirely on the quality of the jokes. There are pretty good jokes in this movie. Unfortunately, they are hidden in a pile of real stupid. If one expects all the dialogues to be absurd, the fun will disappear. You see, there's American Pie 2, my favorite teen movie. It contains a lot of original characters. Maybe jokes are tasteless, but all people have some kind of life. For example, they feel embarrassed when something awkward happens. This is what makes jokes in themselves funny! It's not like a movie: every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody, so there are no characters at all, so there is no room for any sympathy. Too much, if you know original movies, you know the whole scene in advance. Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all and you have this movie. The only thing that saved me from being totally bored, where in fact some teenagers' comments in the cinema were where I was watching the movie. Ah, and my personal top of the movie was the very short look of Melissa Joan Hart in one scene. Sigh. It's just too cool, it can't be real. Hmm, is it worth the whole movie?
