GINGKO BED is a special movie. It is very complex, as if it had a lot of ideas, but it lacked the ability to bring them all into one coherent story. Instead, we get different conspiracies that differ in their own separate movies. Sure, they will eventually meet in the end, but it seems to be unnecessary. The girlfriend and her hospital problems are worth mentioning. It was interesting? Then there were "we are ghosts, and therefore we have no elements of physicality", which leads to the same problem that GHOST people had, namely: If the characters have no physicality (ie, no physical form) and can go through the walls and what not how exactly does it prevent falling over the floor or hovering over the ceiling? GINGKO BED was very popular as a new South Korean film breed. There's a lot of special effects, but the film itself is hollow and its faux melodrama will just "touch" those who are easy, good, touch to begin with. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10 <br /> <br /> (see www.nixflix.com for a more detailed overview of this movie and reviews of other foreign movies)
