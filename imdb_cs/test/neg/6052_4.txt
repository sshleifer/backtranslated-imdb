The problem with this movie is that it tries to compile a movie of 6 hours or more in 2 hours. The result is clear. It seems too forced, unclear and too simple to think. <br /> <br /> The only plus side is the beginning. He explains why and how Hercules was born. The rest of the movie was ... just a mumbo jumbo that is together. It has the potential to be a great movie like LOTR if it's not enforced within 2 hours. Even acting is not very convincing. OK is not all bad. But most of them are. The special effects are stupid and look like they were made ten years earlier (although the first monster is pretty good).
