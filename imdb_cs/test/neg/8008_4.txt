I think to say that this movie has too much is not what makes this movie wrong. Twists are not a film problem. The story is very clever and could have been very cool if it was spinning properly. The main issues why everyone is complaining about the twists in the movie is that the film is not so fascinating that people follow them. The film is badly shot (at least in comparison to his genre, Brother Lock, Stock). Worse, characters are (although often well-behaved) simply plain. The characters do not have enough time to get in order so that the viewer can join one of them, let alone understand. Oh, and the places are just terrible: places - man (I didn't bother to watch credits for your name) - get more work (maybe even a photo or interior design)
