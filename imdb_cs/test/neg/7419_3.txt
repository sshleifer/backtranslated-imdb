One minute to UNTOLD and it's already a torn technique from BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR. Does that mean we see a lot of trees? Definitely yes. Will we see an Austrian bodybuilder throwing out? But this film has a TVM budget, so the answer is loud. Does anyone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES? Well, because there is a scene that resembles these types of exhibitions. Unfortunately, the only thing you see is cellulite. Do you like it when the screen gets dark during TVM? Great because it happens between every scene in UNTOLD. In fact, it happens during every scene. Did you like MILLIONAIRE - MAJOR FRAUD? Fantastic because one of the characters looks like a bearded Major Charles Ingram, a contestant who has been trying to cheat the show from one million pounds. Seriously one of the characters looks like Major Ingram. I expected him to say, "It's a bear. It could be a bear. But it can be a bigfoot <Cough, cough> yes it's a bigfoot <Cough, that's a bigfoot <Cough> Yes I`m going to shoot Chris's final answer Oh and I mentioned that all of the above are good bits? UNTOLD is not the worst bigfoot movie I've ever seen this honors go to NIGHT OF DEMON that I've seen more than twenty years ago and I think I've only seen fewer than a dozen movies that are at that time worse. But that said UNTOLD is still a very bad movie in almost every aspect, especially editing. As some other reviewers have pointed out that it looks like missing whole pieces of the movie while there are other pieces where the scenes are combined in the wrong order. This is a really bad movie that deserves much less than its rating of 5.1. I'll give it 3 out of ten and I'm very kind
