** from **** stars <br /> <br /> Let's see ... 14 divided by 20 times the square root of 13 equals 23, which was my old grandmother's favorite number and the year she was born, 23 minutes for 23 hour. Assign a number any way you choose and be very scared. Be extremely scared when you roll into a dead brain that looks at 23, and you have the last attempt at Schumacher's dark tension with the number 23. Oh yeah, 23 is also my record in Cuervo shots on my favorite 23rd Street dive State in the Union. Carrey carries the film about halfway, then we lose sight of his sight, not much care. Don't look for any crazy expressions that come from Carrey, as you saw in Masca and I, I and Irene. No. Don't expect it to be Andy Kaufman's character. This role is sad and strange for Jimbo. Where is Riddler when you need him! I know, we don't need him. Virginia Madsen, as usual, is underestimated as a supportive, speculative and strange woman. Her talent, as well as Carrey, is repressed, and it is almost painful to watch her try to save her backward character from almost anonymity. <br /> <br /> To get credit if the debt is due, there are some interesting scenes in number 23 that show off some very refined cinematography. They are sufficiently arrested without being confused in the incoherent narration of this stupid story. I don't know about you, (and I realize this is the work of absolute fiction) I don't know of anyone who would often read his novel in a dark, dark basement, or spend time in cemeteries like Carrey in this film. Schumacher keeps his film dark and bloody red and grim and rainy and smoggy and grim and rainy and dunny and on and off from start to finish. Even Flatliners and The Lost Boys have a little more daylight and are talking about medical students obsessed with death and teenage vampires! <br /> <br /> If you feel happy looking at this movie, even if it's just out of curiosity ... make sure you do it while enjoying about 23 catnaps, so you can kill 23 birds with one stone.
