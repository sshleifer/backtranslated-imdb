I saw the first House of the Dead and expected the root canal to be more pleasant, so when it wasn't that bad, I was pleasantly surprised. Unfortunately, then I got my hopes that even the other one could be fine ... and I was wrong. Apparently I am one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was wrong. I don't know if I look at it again and make myself see what all the people who saw the good reviews saw or asked if I saw a bad movie. Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job in the roles that were under them. They deserve to be in better movies. Special effects were fine and some likeable / hateful characters that were made for a tolerant watch, but for the most part this movie was just a waste of time. Oh and I have to ask, because I asked ALL the way through the movie aloud ... did anyone know how to close the door behind them, so the zombies couldn't just go to the rooms? Just once it happened, (the zombies wandering in) and I found that a little comfortable ... the soldiers go to the room, leaving the door wide open, giving little attention to the same door, so zombies can just walk around, feel like it would be (with unfortunate "living beings" who have no way to escape), yet only once followed by zombies. <br /> <br /> Nitpicky? Maybe, but honestly ... if I fought for my life, the last thing I would do was go to the room and leave the door wide open so the zombies could swarm and eat. This is really the only thing that * bothered me * throughout the movie * and the film was largely a bad continuation of the not completely nasty original.
