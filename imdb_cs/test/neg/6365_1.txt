When I heard that the film was to be released and the subject of what it was, I felt very curious. But when I saw it, it was the biggest scam of my life. Technically speaking, the sound is bad, you can say about male dialogues that have been redesigned in a studio that is poorly achieved in the final mix. The second of them is average photography, some of the movies show some night vision goggles and the way the cameraman achieves that "dark night" is illuminated by everything as if they were in a real military base with lights, there is no link used for moonlight, my God! Last but not least, most of the actions are really poor, it's totally unbelievable that one of the soldier's wife fits her performance is pretty bad. Great disappointment, the jury's disgrace which decided to send this film to represent Colombia at the Oscars.
