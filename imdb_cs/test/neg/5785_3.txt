Note to yourself. You'll never see a serious movie with Charlie Sheen again. A great comedian, a terrible seal. This film makes the Navy SEALS look like a ruthless group of rangers when they are actually the most elite form of the army in the world. Charlie Sheen helps destroy the SEAL Navy's reputation. Thank you so incredibly for choosing a group of individuals who look terrible in one of the worst action movies I've ever seen. This is a great story that could be created in an amazing action movie, but why Charlie Sheen? There are options for a very passionate story here, but Sheen decides to destroy them with "funny" comments.
