Two LA cops track down a serial killer nicknamed the "Family Man" who wiped out entire families, and when one of the police officers takes deep six, they raise questions and prove the serial killer is not responsible, but rather gangsters. The idea of ​​Seagal in a serial killer movie is an interesting concept, indeed it is seen that Seagal plays a good serial killer, but makes him a cop who has a ridiculous fondness for prayer beads and cropped credit cards that are more stupid than sympathetically ridiculous. The running joke also includes Wayon's delight in deer penis consumption, and this great stuff is well in place. Not to mention the start of the school, which was taken hostage, because of the boy's break with his girlfriend. After Seagal neutralizes him, the girlfriend tells the young boy that he loves him. Now there is a lesson from all this, if you want your girlfriend to come back, hostage at school can take you. I myself would think that flowers or old fashioned phone calls could work, then again, old fashioned. Besides, I stumble on someone who has a brilliant reconciliation plan. <br /> <br /> * off 4- (bad)
