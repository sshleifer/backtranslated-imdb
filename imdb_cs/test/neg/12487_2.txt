Remake can be successful. Customization can be successful. It is not important whether it is a remake or adaptation. Good movie is a good movie and bad movie is a bad movie, no matter what. Sarkar, I am afraid it was a very bad movie. First, just by making the characters look dangerous or macho, they don't bring them aura about them. What was so great about the nature of Nagre (the character of Amitabha Bacchan) that we should be in the aura of his "strength" and of what the "kindness" of the character showed? Nothing. This comment was made by the commentator, and Amitabh kept giving facial expressions. Amitabh can now give brilliant facial expressions, but why should it mean anything if there is no history or story. The characters who worked under "sarkar" were not properly characterized. . Just because man had glasses, why should we assume he's wise. The film's flow was generally boring because scenes from the godfather were created (as a policeman slapped Abhishek Bacchan), the older brother being killed by Abhishek (as Fredo was killed on Pacino instructions) but too much was wanted to be wrapped go with him. That was really a problem. <br /> <br /> If you try to pack 3 hours of complicated details like a godfather in 2 hours, and with a few dialogues, what you get is the ultimate cricket show, never make a full impact by watching the whole game.
