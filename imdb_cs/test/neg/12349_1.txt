All comments on this film claim that the film is balanced. This is their main justification for the film to get high speed. However, the film is not balanced when the main analyzed offender gets the last world in every single subject. The director admitted this at the first San Francisco Film Festival. She justified it by saying that she couldn't lose the chance of accessing Fujimori. That might be true, but by showing so many things to Fujimori about problems, the film is clearly pro-Fujimori and unbalanced. I dare to have all the other commentators prove it to be a Bad Tips 1: The claim that Harvard professors, intellectuals and Latin American diplomats agree with you does not help your argument (logic). Tip 2: I disagree with the director not even your argument (Director says he thinks Fujimori is charismatic and patriotic, and so she portrayed it as such)
