Great Balls of Fire is a movie you show someone you really hate. It is an absolute torture of the highest rank, and is probably used by foreign power minions to gather information from captured intelligence agents. In the past, I enjoyed some of Dennis Quaid's performances, but in this movie he goes absolutely to the top. He does not cross the line so much, the pole is swinging over him, then jumping again and again. It rises and mugs, as if on some incredibly bad acid trip. It is one of those rare performances where you wish you to enter the film and beat a man into your life for doing something so serious. Was he desperate to win the Gold Raspberry or some other prize for wrong? This is the only conclusion I can come with. Thank you Dennis, you gave us a bad performance for ages. Where was the director in this man? The opposite end of the extreme is Winona Ryder, she of plastic and plastic acting. I came across a review of her game style that compared her to a wax figure. This was, of course, an insult to wax figures across the country, all of which could bring more humanity into the role of Jerry's underage cousin / wife. This raises the mixed message of the film that it is 100% okay to marry your own sister and have a baby union. I don't see what's so "okay", but Hollywood seems to think hunky dory is a minor incest. Talk about "family values". <br /> <br /> Another problem is the format. Is it a step forward what he says about Lewis's life, or is it a musical? I'm not talking about music, I'm talking about a really weird scene where Jerry goes to school, starts to get rid of the melody and everyone starts dancing like it was Broadway's musical in search of Tony. Fantasy and reality are thrown together in a mixture that doesn't work. But who is really interested? No. And you shouldn't. You can't get back to the minutes of life you could waste on this movie. So don't waste your time, it's too expensive for something that's misleading and poor.
