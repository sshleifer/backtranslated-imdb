I've heard a lot of bad things about this movie than I've seen it, but all the negative comments were probably on a low movie budget and bad acting - both of which I can deal with when it comes to zombie movies. But what I didn't count on is this film really, boring; If there's one thing you can rely on on a low budget zombie, its gore and fun - but unfortunately this movie doesn't. I am quite surprised because the previous two horror movies I saw from director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining movies, but Kids shouldn't play with dead things, it just doesn't diminish. The plot line follows a group of young adults traveling to a funeral island to mistake the rituals to bring the dead back to life. But they soon learn that playing with things they don't understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the island's corpses return to their blood! The lands sound like it might lead to a decent flick, but what I didn't mention is that interesting parts won't start until the last twenty minutes; and because it's a ninety minute film, I'm sure you can guess it's not a good thing. Opening times and ten minutes are stuffed with bad actions and even worse characters. I understand that the situation is such that horror is stronger when it comes; but please, if you spend so long, you have to do it really interesting. All the characters in the movie are on top and uncomfortable, and I personally wanted the zombies to rush and eat. But the film has no merit because the atmosphere is excellent. Lucio Fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and body eat zombies can blend together; but Bob Clark did it with this movie. The direction is not bad either, but it is due to the bad effects of makeup and a significant lack of blood, which is unlikely to please zombie fans. Overall, I don't really recommend this movie; But if you're a zombie zombie fanatic, you can get a kick out of it.
