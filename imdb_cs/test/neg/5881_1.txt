This movie is terrible. She has absolutely no laughter. The Hebrew hammer (Adam Goldberg) sets off to save Hannukah from Evil Santa (Andy Dick). Perhaps a promising sufficient basis for conspiracy, in fact, the film does not follow this assumption. While some (far and little) nice touches and conspiracies are fairly coherent, they are strenuous, embarrassed and eventually boring. This, despite the fact that Goldberg, Dick, and Greer (Hammer's interest in clients / love), have considerable screen attendance. Despite playing for what could be described as the fearsome over-the-top gags, this film is consistently a middle class resource. Don't waste 85 minutes of your life on it. (note: music was good ..!)
