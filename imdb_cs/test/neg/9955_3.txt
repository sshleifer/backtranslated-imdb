There are lots of holes in the plot, it's wonder if they knew they had an audience on it and just threw them together. I don't know much about George Zucco, but I saw him in two movies. Obviously, he was cast as a loving father, a mad scientist, a vampire. It looks so common. I'm surprised he ended up in the genre. This is typical, "I will create monsters that can be used to fight as an army." By converting wolf blood (or being a coyote) to his hired hand, he transforms him into a werewolf. Glen Strange, who was one of Karloff's successors as Frankenstein's monster, plays kindly, a dear hired man who is a victim because he believes a mad doctor. First, the scientist is able to control when Petro (his name) can be transformed. But just as an invisible person suddenly begins to morph himself and becomes responsible. There's a little love story about a daughter and a reporter with a high voice (Golly Miss Brooks). She wants to leave, but her father, the doctor, won't allow it. He is also driven by a group of his peers who mocked his research before and now he will have satisfaction. The way he gets embarrassed or killed is largely appealing, and it depends on Peter and the boys waiting to be attacked. It's not a good movie. The strength is the atmosphere of the forests, as people and monsters lurk around the Spanish moss. Again, the townspeople are a lot of sages who seem to have fled the wrong west. One thing that remained with me was the fact that the little girl is the first victim to appear unusual for the film of this era. There is also an old lady who knows about werewolves, but nobody listens to her.
