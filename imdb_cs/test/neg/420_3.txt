The book was personally very well written, amazing, exciting, which was not brought to justice. Watching the movie at 12.01 am to find out that the main parts of the book were left out frustrated me when I saw that the "different" result of the movie was affected. There was something that was desirable from this movie, but in all, it lacked in a plot. For someone who didn't read the book, I could see how this movie was seen as an invitation and fun with controversy and tension. However, for a reader who has read it seven times, I have not seen a strong connection between the two: both film and novel. The main characters are missing (eg Maximilian Kohler) and the sudden reversal of the conspiracy with the survival of the last cardinal on preference, the plot of the film was slightly littered, which led to another acceptance at the end of the story. Hassassin also was portrayed as a common white man, compared to that in the novel where he was portrayed as a Muslim; his motives in the book are mainly based on his ties with the Illuminati, but in the film his motives are money-based and seem more like work than a personal bond to the task.
