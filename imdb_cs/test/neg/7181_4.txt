If it's the best Commander Hamilton movie, I have no curiosity about others. The greatest tools of a film actor are his eyes, but when Peter Stormare wants to show great emotion, he closes his, so for five or six seconds we can admire his eyelids while his feelings are unknown to them. Lousy acting technique. Stormare also sometimes jerks when firing a gun, turning his head and closing his eyes. Be careful. James Bond can easily relax with such a competition. There are some interesting supporting performances from other actors, but not enough to hang the whole movie. Cinematography is good looking, it does a great job of capturing Nordic winter. Even the Sahara looks cold. Maybe Hamilton carries his own climate. <br /> <br /> Here are some good action sequences. Unfortunately, the only sense of humor on screen is the villain who turns the hero into a big pill. James Bond jokes may not be particularly good, but at least they don't look like constipation all the time. books were omitted. What has been maintained is the worship of the noble, heroic PLO that shows us that it operates in Libya without the knowledge or supervision of dad Khaddafi. This fantasy is hard to believe because Gaddafi actually throws a PLO from Libya four years at a time. And at the end of the movie Hamilton PLO gives a very worrying gift. Where will they use this gift? Hamilton doesn't care. <br /> <br /> We are long, far from "For Who Bell Ringtones" here. Commander Hamilton remains a local phenomenon. While Henning Mankell's books sell around the world, Jan Guillou will never have the same success. <br /> <br /> As for this movie, bleeeeaaahhhhh.
