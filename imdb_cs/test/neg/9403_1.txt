This is by far the worst movie Al Pacino could play. The film had no real plot. It is a kind of care in 24 different directions. The target audience for this film seems to be an anonymous gambler. McConaughey's character is not credible enough to be Pacin's protégé. So he won several bets for some degenerate clients as a side-line recording service for 900 services. Should it automatically convince the audience of his skills? It was just stupid to think. He promised to show us how he made his self-confident choices, but after I went through the film, I didn't see what skill he had if he had anything. If you want skills, try to look at the figure of Robert de Niro at a casino that is now showmanship. At some point in the film, the character Mata selects his winning stakes at the flip coin. Anyone could do that. It seems that Al Pacino talks a lot and I mean blabber mouth in dialogue face. I think this style started with Scent's women and worked for him because he eventually won an Oscar, but now I think it's just irritating. It always seems to be preaching. He will do what is typical of a person who has an unstable angina (which is an impending heart attack), who usually resembles his acting in Godather part 3, who plays aging, the diabetic mafia don corleone, but unlike Pacin's talent is wasted. film. Rene Russo is simply the naked eye for this film. She's in shape and shows her in the tight clothes she wears. This movie is simple bullshit. Don't waste money on it. It is much worse than Mats's game winners in the film.
