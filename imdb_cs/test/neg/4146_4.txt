I can't believe it's a movie I didn't like. . . I usually found myself open to all kinds of things. . . but this movie is just, good, bad. <br /> <br /> I could deal with the topic if the script and story were better. I could deal with acting if the camera work was better or if the characters were better proven. . . I think it mostly boils down to the script and direction, though. it was just bad. <br /> <br /> I want to give this lowest rating, but. . . I don't believe it, at least this guy got out of his tail to make a movie. . . so she gets four stars (just above the average she has)
