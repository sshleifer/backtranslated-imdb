What is it with studios like Paramount that have proven serials hit the movie on their hands, and the character can screw it around with the budget and formulas? Paramount spent less on this film than on TMP, which doesn't sound bad until you realize there's 10 gaps between the movie. The $ 40 TMP prize to be made would be approximately $ 75 million in 1989. This film is why Shatner never got a fair chance of managing other films. Every time he turned around, the studio cut the budget and handled the storyline. The fact that this was one story that Roddenberry and Shatner could agree on for the most parted made freshman the overhead task hard enough, but after all the machinations were done, all someone finished with was an unequal story and a load of badly executed special effects that they are not worthy of the original series, a much less significant film. Most blatant examples: - All Phaser effects were heavily dumped and looked fake. - The shot of the company that entered the big barrier was so obviously still. At least the stick that held the Enterprise was successfully disassembled. - God "Chasing" Kirk Up on the Mountain ... Egades, Like They Only Sheared Godzilla Shots Climbing on the Volcano at the End of "Godzilla 1985", and used thumbtacks to scratch the emulsion from the film to make his eyes look in the eyes of the Captain Kirka surfaced electric bolts .... Yes, friends, I have a really big problem looking at this last scene, especially. Thank You God Star Trek VI was such a movie redeemer ...
