Incredible. "Philosophy". "Depth". "Genius". "Masterpiece". People had to see another "Oldboy," because the one I saw was a poorly written, badly conceived, over-fiction, sharp piece of "Kraapola," which even for a moment ignored the ridiculously violent scenes that made it unsuitable for the child's eyes, barely to satisfy the imagination and thirst for a seven-year global consistency. "The depth" of this excused mixture has been exhausted in one small piece of wisdom "Laughter and the whole world will laugh with you, cry and you will find yourself", a type of boring cookie that says a great author Whether it's Shakespeare or, more than IMDb, Kurosawa, he would be thrown into a dustbin with no second thought. Where this film should also land if we weren't living in an era in which they are cheaply shocking and perverse, puzzled by what was once called "great art". In short, yuck. <br /> <br /> 2 out of 100. It's not 1 in 1000 just because of some occasional camera work. However, it was by no means enough to save this infantile failure from worthlessness.
