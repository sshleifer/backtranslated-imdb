My expectations were high after I saw the trailer. They were even higher when I saw a movie that had the same director as Independence Day and Godzilla. Special effects on Independence Day were much better than in this movie. The whole movie I was waiting for the spiders to appear. The rest of the story was really boring. And when the spiders came, they had a very amateurish look, as well as special effects from the movie made in the 1960s. I didn't watch the whole movie. When she was playing for about an hour, I turned off the DVD player. Almost every night I watch 3 movies and never left the movie, even though it was so boring. The only thing that is good in this movie was the sheriff :) That's why I voted 2 instead of 1 :) So don't look for this, instead you should go out and rent a Starship Troopers, it's just like 10,000 times better.
