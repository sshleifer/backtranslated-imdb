This is by far the worst movie I've ever watched. I never rated the movie 1 out of 10. My advice is not to watch. It doesn't even classify as a movie. You should rather sit on the couch bored than watch this movie. Acting was horrible, but what was worst was far. A very unlikely sequence of events that are not even funny. They are actually very lame and stupid. Very silly choice for Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid in this movie. It could sort of upset their career a little. When I went to the blockbuster, the main focus was on this movie, so I decided to rent it. I sincerely regret it. <br /> <br /> Once you get 10 or 20 minutes into a movie, you can basically predict what will happen. I was hoping it would be better, but it was worse instead. <br /> <br /> I'm not overdoing this. The movie is terrible. Don't look at it. Perhaps it will help.
