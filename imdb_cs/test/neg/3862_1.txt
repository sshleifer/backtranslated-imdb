Imagine that Diane of Cheers focuses on intelligence, now imagine trying to make a film moire movie. That would be. If you've just looked at some of the shots without sound, you'd think it might be a good movie. <br /> <br /> Now that you turn on the sound and listen at any time, you'll find that the person who shot the film knows nothing about movies beyond what they read in the book. I was constantly thinking that this is a foreign movie, it was so bad. If you don't remember Cheers, then think of Mr. Beans Holiday ... remember the character DeFoe who did a horrible movie ... well imagine that horrible movie without Mr. Bean saved. That's the movie. I'm not saying anything about a film other than trying to create a dark moody movie about a hit coming home ... at least what I could get from it.
