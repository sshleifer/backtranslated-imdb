Oh my God, this movie is incredible, it's the worst movie ever and I know what I'm talking about! I'm a fan of scary movies! The story is totally stupid, a group of adults decide to make a party and a stupid guy comes with a terrible mask and kills all ... dialogues are nice parodies, worst, just talking about sex with such a bad accent. The end is (oh !!!!!!) to discover for yourself! you will really be really surprised ... (not possible! yes, it is!) and the movie surprise is only 58 minutes. (not possible (bis) yes, that is!) Worst Than House IV and Howling V. <br /> <br /> For a nutshell, forget it forever !!!
