If you've never heard of Jane Austen, have seen the original BBC movie or 1995 BBC adaptation, or even saw a pop-up version of the book, then this farcical attempt to show this classic love story can be considered vaguely persistent. From the opening scene, you need to remember this movie for its horrible act, the nasty miscasting and the complete lack of Jane Austen's classic joke. Whoever chose to cast the actors (except for Judi Dench, who had probably never heard of Jane Austen, let alone read it, should be punished! Keira Knightley grins and grins at each scene and hits that she is so uncomfortable that no one wants to marry her! Darcy looked like he was trying to remember his lines throughout the movie, and the rest of the Bennet girls were interchangeable in that their characters were not shown as they were Originally written. <br /> <br /> This version failed to show the correct pride and prejudice that both Darcy and Elizabeth suffered, and at the end of the longest two hours of my life, who were looking to get together or not. Absolutely abysmal - even a few minutes later, Judi Dench can't save this waste, I can't think of anything good to say about this movie except that it's over!
