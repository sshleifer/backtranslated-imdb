I enjoyed the Masters of Horror Series until I hit this heap. This anti-Bush propaganda piece of masquerade as a horror movie comes as an episode of the original Batman made by Michael Moore. The political satire should be smart, but this ten on a simpleton scale with all the styles and credibility of L. Ron Hubbard's film. steals elections, goes to war for absolutely no reason and treats soldiers and women as a mere cannon. It even takes a second change and religion. All that was missing was Caesar Romero when the president was delighted at how he arranged 9/11. I think the end should be the moment "we support our soldiers," but I think it would be more offended than pleased with the whole effort. I'm sure the Hollywood elites are sitting in their paintings and patting each other on their backs for this "overwhelming" work, while misinformed anti-war Drons consider it genius. <br /> <br /> It's time for you to put in new baby hats with a baby cot.
