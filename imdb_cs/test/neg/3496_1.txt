With its two-hour length, Crash maps the emotional anxiety of its 10-odd set of characters when it encounters the sometimes shameless and sometimes latent forms of racism that underlie American society. This and the emotional anxiety of one of her listeners sitting in front and desperately trying to understand what movies have happened these days. The era we live in has become so complicated. Not only do we reject modernism, but even the not-too-enthusiastic flag of the wisdom of postmodern ideas is always shot down by what post-postmodernism aims to destroy all of these thoughts, by no means due to the great devastating thought of the great "thinkers." But I turn. This has nothing to do with what the film is about, but rather what the film is. Certainly, it seems difficult to make a living in Hollywood that has to satisfy the market, which is so post-post-everything that cynicism has become more than just a motto in life. It has become part of everything we do and part of everything we think we like or not. And so a new studio product will be born! Independent films that once were energetic and idealistic in their defiant experimentalism now seem to be as clumsy as Hollywood movies they sell to independent film markets. An independent film has to be sold at Sundance before it becomes "recognized". And so there is nothing easy. Even what constitutes a good movie is so dark. While in the past the filmmakers wanted to entertain people and tell a good story - and in these seemingly simplified experiments the greatest of the films are carried - filmmakers today have to make films that are primarily good; films must make people think, must be meaningful, must be provocative, ask questions, yadda yadda yadda. All that is all about is subversion of the Hollywood movie system, but this subversion seems strangely similar to the formal similarity of Hollywood movies, countless ways to basically differ the same product. And I haven't started the movie yet. Maybe I became too picky about movies I see these days. Maybe it's because of my primary need to be fun, rather than, say, to be tested when I see a movie. But to hell, this movie is one big piece of crap. And I reflected this film not only because it follows a guide to how to make a good movie Good 101 on T-characters screaming eloquent lines and are so funny that they are gifted with God's speech; raises questions about racism and life faced by racism in America; he has "moving" moments when everyone learns more about himself and more about other people; not to mention that once you hear the sound of women singing in high registers in foreign languages, you know that you are in all the above qualities. And something about the above-mentioned point - it raises questions about issues of immediate concern, such as racism - I am very happy about time. Like all post-post-post all movies, it doesn't interfere with just having a message about this issue. Since oh, our audience is in favor of this post-post-post-post-post-post. Our viewers want them to think, not want things to be simplified (and then go to existentialist crap and say) because life itself is not simplistic. Ha ha ha. What other routine exercises we do, then viewers need to think about things rather than giving them food. Well, good and good. So the movie makes it a point to libe viewers with these non-news and because they aren't exactly the message, it is so definitely gentle and gentle means good law? So we are hit again and again by this well-written subtlety with the rhetorical rhetoric. And as if the irony wasn't quite steep, we have Ludik's character, the only character who doesn't seem to take all of these racist debates seriously, is transformed into one of those irritatingly meaningful characters to learn at the end, give meaningful looks and pauses. where viewers should "learn something about themselves". Yeah, yeah. As I wanted to see an incredibly racist film right after this man. <br /> <br /> To shorten the long bullshit, I think I wouldn't have a problem with the film if it wasn't so inflated. self-confidence. The anger that made up the whole film felt more like a white man than the real anger of Spike Lee-ish. It's Tim Robbins and Sean Penn, the type who wants to undermine the humanitarian flag when they don't realize it's the flag they're waving is their punched clothes. Plus it's so modern in post-post post post post post post post post post post post post post post. Nothing is easy anymore. In her best effort to actually be good, provocative, and ultimately a man, it's not going to happen, imho, just another indie crap from indie director who wants to make a name of herself as a trusted indie-filmmaker. Now at least Hollywood is easier and more honest in its manipulation.
