I've always been a fan of Bottom, grabbing as many videos as I could have found in the series in the states. The chemistry between Rik and Ade is always a genius, and the combination of clever writing and totally silly humor seems to work flawlessly. So I sat down to watch this movie with great eagerness ... and was totally disappointed with the end. <br /> <br /> The first 3/4 of the film can best be described as uninspired and poorly directed (sorry, Ade!), but with some great moments. Unfortunately, these laugh-out-loud moments make you realize how less-brilliant the rest of the movie is. Slapstick starts fun, but eventually becomes a little boring, with only perverted sex jokes to make things funny. The end of the movie ('green' scenes, for those of you who've seen it ... maybe the worst end I've seen in the past decade. Honestly. thirty times, followed by a sharp end that didn't make sense (which didn't bother me) and wasn't funny (which). to keep the most enjoyable memories I can ... but I need to warn you if you're going to overpay for a NTSC conversion tape from a local importer, no.
