This review contains a partial spoiler. <br /> <br /> Shallow from the beginning, 'D.O.A.' at least it starts as if it could be a smooth, fun piece of nonsense like Fincher's "The Game". It's a central character (Dennis Quaid) suffering from a terrifying sequence of events that seem to create a twisted and cunning thriller. But the conspiracy is spreading too fast, leading to a dramatic twist that is not halfway when the character learns that he has been poisoned and has only 1-2 days of life. And that, simply, is a too big twist to add to the story carelessly. Once this happens, the only chance of a film is to succeed if it treats the psychology of someone in this situation as its main subject, but with its single subject: but with "D.O.A". it continues as if it were just a normal revelation like any other you can usually see in a thriller. The problem is twofold: firstly, Quaid's actions are not convincing that whatever is his situation is likely to do; and secondly, even if they are convinced, it is hard to worry about what happens when the most important point of the land is prematurely resolved. The rest of the film is a fairly standard fare for a movie of this kind, but it is much more boring than the usual nature of the mildly treated difficulty that logically dwarfs events that the film is interested in. Dennis Quaid, in the lead role, did not convince me as a burnt-out professor, nor as a man destined to die: Meg Ryan is how often, ditzy and uncomfortable. Another negative feature is the ugly 80's soundtrack. Instead, watch "The Game", which remains similar and character-driven from similar roots, while "D.O.A." develops that only undermines its own premise. Given that the assumption is quite interesting in itself, it is a pity to see that he drowned in an excess of excessively cooked land.
