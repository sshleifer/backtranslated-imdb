You completely agree with other reviews. I've been watching this movie for about 5 minutes. I looked at one other site review and found that it wasn't even a real sequel. It was after I slowly retreated from a TV with a remote control in my hand, the jaw dropped below and below. <br /> <br /> The quality of shooting is beyond the low budget. It doesn't even look like a crazy movie. If I watched the footage of "home video" from the document, I would expect it. <br /> <br /> In short: Avoid Avoid Avoid. Boooo Lion's Gate! <br /> <br /> She's completely ashamed of watching for 5 minutes and I hope I saved others from renting or owning.
