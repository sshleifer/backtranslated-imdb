History Teacher Mrs. Tingle seems to have her for student Leigh Ann Watson, who has her heart to get a writing scholarship. She gets another low level from Tingle, which doesn't help. When one of her classmates, Luke, steals the paper from the final history test and jumps it into the bag, Mrs. Tingle finds herself sticking out. He threatens three to go to the director, but he is not available. So, before they announce it the next morning. Leigh, her friend Jo Lynn and Scott head to her place that night, trying to convince her not to tell the director. However, given the stubbornness of Tingle, who found herself returning to drastic measures to keep him out. It wasn't a fan when I first saw him and I'm still not one after seeing him again. Writer Kevin Williamson was on the role after writing successful contemporary teen horror movies; 'Scream (1996)', 'I Know What You Last Last Summer (1997)', 'Scream 2 (1997)' and 'Faculty (1998)'. He went on success (also not to mention the TV show 'Dawson's Bay'), but this project would be the ultimate impact. The difference compared to this record was different than writing the script, he also debuted in directing. The peculiarity, however, was that I found that his direction was competent, but the material that attacked without tastes and fatigue. He seemed to be caught in both the black comedy and the straight thriller without the gel. The screenplay is crowded with fast jokes, ongoing gags, trivial stretches and imaginative links to other movies, but the problem is that it is too watered with so many inventive developments and sad moral currents that disrupt the flow. The broken scenario had to be stronger and stronger because it is a small-scale production that feels like you're watching a stage show because of its mostly limited files. They are trying to play with the characters in mind, but these moments are only there to serve the wrong story in a puddle of stupidity and absurdity. The movie ends. Williamson's polished direction is healthy, but rather pedestrian, and so he lacks tension and stimulation even with his tight surroundings he can really wash. Finally, you feel it half way, and it shows how small the story is. The performances are acceptable enough, although it would not be for the elegant and icy portrayal of Helena Mirren's handling prowess as Mrs. Tingle and the thriving Marisa Coughlan, we would be stuck in Katie Holmes's unfortunate attention. Barry Watson is modest in his kind part, and Molly Ringwald plays a smaller role. The soundtrack contains enough energy, but I found it awfully overworked and formless in its possibilities. Trackable but mechanical all the time.
