2001 was not the best Eric Roberts. As Raptor, this came out. He watched the Raptor a while ago and really thought he was being sucked and is the worst Erics. But it had a common moment of fun and D-standard. This one has no thing. Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of probably the worst actor these days. The story lacks any blow, and the whole thing feels even slower than breaking the snails in the curves. Two things that stand out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts. You could argue that their efforts are good or what, but they are mainly critics compared to the rest. I say thank you that Roberts will see you next time (and maybe even better).
