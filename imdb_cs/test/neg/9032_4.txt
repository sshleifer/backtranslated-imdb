Have you ever wondered why these boys - Seagal, Stallone, Willis, et al - manage to survive all those shootings in which they are renumbered? I think I found out. Enemies are always missing, and no hero. Here, Seagal has a gun and outshoots half a dozen Heavies shooting at him from a few meters away. One of the heavens has a shotgun. Or maybe two of them. It does not matter. It could be thousands of shotguns to shoot at him, and Seagal would still appear with an intact ponytail. And when it comes to mano fight, don't forget it. Criminals may or may not be armed with swords or knives or a blunt object, but Seagal, with his skill in aikido or tempura or sushido or play-do or whatever it is, brushes them with a few refusals. Not only is he the master of these outres skills, but his physical strength is Herculean. More than once, one's long bones snatch as easily as we break a toothpick. One he breaks the guy SPINE over his knee. <br /> <br /> I'll tell you something. (I'm getting into the spirit of the movie because Seagal uses this line, "I'll tell you something," several times, along with "What is this supposed to mean?") These guys deserve extinction in any good Xenophobe manual. They are all black, talking to the unintelligible accents of Jah-MAY-can, wearing dreadlocks that look desperate about the need for shampoo, torture and murder with shyness, and - here's the worst part. They are necristic. That is right. They practice voodoo. Actually, the voodoo element is coming to be the most interesting element of the movie. They got the ritual components pretty well - cigar smoke, rum, sacrificial chicken. They just missed the dance in which the ghost dances. They should read Metraux on voodoo. Otherwise, the drawing follows the usual convention. What happened to Jaqueline Bissett voodoo-practitioners in "The Deep" is happening here to friend Seagal. What happened to John Wayne when he was stuck between trucks in "McQ" is here for Seagal. The film is very open when Seagal makes a short speech that he has seen too much unnecessary violence in his DEA career, so he is now happy to retire, and when we are acquainted with his friends and family, I tried to follow his affiliates they saw If I could choose which one would be terribly murdered or maimed to generate his search for revenge. Acting does not actually require many comments. But Charles, a Jamaican cop, played by Tom Wright is really pretty good. Wright has a considerable range. Here is a companion of dubious devotion, somewhat sinister. But in "The Pentagon Wars," he has a comic part that he underlines. Jamaica has never flown like film criminals. I don't know why exactly. It's a small film market. And if you go to Jamaica to hold Montego Bay. However, if you want to see Jamaican voodoo drug dealers as heaven and if you are in the mood for another typical action movie, it should be a satisfying sight.
