Some reviewers of this film have been extremely "generous" with praise. Personally, I was disappointed because I was optimistic about these reviews because the initial credits started to roll. Too familiar story looks like this: A deformed boy and his father live in a swamp in Louisiana. Local boys ridicule him and bother him. Local boys launch Gruesome, oh, sorry, I think there's Victor Crowley's cabin. Dad tries to rescue his son, formerly known as Eddie Munster meets the Elephant Man, but accidentally puts the ax over the baby's head instead. Victor becomes a murderous spirit that hunts unfortunates who enter his domain. Oooo ... scary. One thing I appreciated about Hatchet was the fact that he never took seriously and some gags even made me laugh. The thing is, I'm tired of Hollywood B-horror slap-sticks. I like to laugh and I like good fear, but this movie didn't even give a tough dose. As for Crowley, who is another Michael, Jason or Freddy ... Pumpkinhead has a better chance.
