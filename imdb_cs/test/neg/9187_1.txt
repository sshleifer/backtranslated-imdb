Jeff Fahey has such wary eyes and a blurry, insidious smile that every character he plays seems to be a villain; Because it really doesn't work to throw it as a good guy piece, the audience is just waiting for its character to burst and start blowing people away. Drew Barrymore, fresh off her acclaimed role as "Poison Ivy", had to make this film simply as a favor by director Phedon Papamichael (he was a cameraman on "Ivy"); Playing character named Daisy Drew (!) Immediately jumped, which leaves no one to look at, but Jeff Fahey and Sean Young (who didn't have one fine moment on Blade Runner). Michael Angeli's mindless script relates to a police sketch artist who draws the face of his own wife from the testimony of a murder witness, and although this is not a bad idea of ​​conspiracy, it would be much more appropriate for the hourly television series. This cable film is short for inspiration (starting with casting) and shorter for surprise. * of ****
