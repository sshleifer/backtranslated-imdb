Jonathan Demme is such a character-oriented director that to see him pulling Brian De Palma (which means he is leaning on Hitchcock), he is almost predictable when he can't work with great tension in this lukewarm secret. Work from David Shaber's screenplay, from Murray's novel Teigh Bloom, Demme attempts to strike a chord somewhere between Alan J. Pakula's drama paranoia and Hitchcock's hanging-participating thrillers. Roy Scheider plays as a retired secret agent, mourning the murder of his wife, who is now busy to avoid the bad guys who are supposed to kill him. It takes off immediately, but the script is full of fragile threads and the excitement dies quickly. Niagra Falls has a visually impressive climax, but Demme doesn't get out of the cast, not even from this sudden story. ** of ****
