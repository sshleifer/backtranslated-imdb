Navy Seals is an ignorant, racist and contented film that unthinkingly uses the Middle East conflict as a backdrop for an action film created for Mid-West, a well-protected American audience. The conflict, as well as those involved in it, is simply used to feed cannons to celebrate photogenic young Americans who proudly kill Arabs for the good of "freedom." Worse, however, the action scenes of the film are carelessly processed and insensitive, preventing Navy Seals from working on the mindless shooting. Charlie Sheen's character (Hawkins) is disgusting, uncomfortable, unconscious, ruthless, and above all racist. He refers to the Middle East as a 't-hole' and to its inhabitants as a 'rag-head'. Throughout the film, Navy Seals are celebrated by the use of Lebanese aborigines as cannon food. These people unreasonably massacre with consequent free attitude. There is even a taste of the murder of a young Lebanese boy who is shot dead by Hawkins; Hawkins makes fun of his tongue before shooting him while doing another humorous joke. In addition to being tasteless, this should be unacceptable. The extreme (though predictable) pro-American attitude of the film is also rebellious. This can be seen when a Lebanese-American journalist informs Hawkins that terrorists cannot be spoken because "they are religious fanatics". Hawkins then chants with 'yeah, and we're sea seals!' As a result, fanatics have little meaning in addition to US military power. In addition, even insulting the racial heritage of this journalist and treating her as a sexual object, the scenario requires her inability to resist this disgusting thief and she still ends up sleeping with him - because it's the All-American Navy Seal. This marginalizes the character of the journalist by subordinating her to the "superior" pro-American attitude of Hawkins despite his offensive behavior towards her. In addition to ethics, this conspiracy also has little confidence as drama. The script is also amateur. Most scenes are simply threaded without any thought of mood, plot or character development. For example, the "music video" scene on the golf course is poorly groomed. And two scenes where Charlie Sheen plays a reckless hero are also pointless. In one, he jumps off the bridge from a moving car just to show his friends how hard he is, and in the second he chases a tow truck on a push wheel and drives his car. No scene has a follow-up anti-climax, both are highly unlikely, and no one has any relation to the plot as a whole. They are just sweets designed as a vehicle to show Hawkins's cheap all-American heroism, and are bad replacements for character development. Most of the other plot development scenes are also poorly filmed and misspelled as - in fact, this affects the entire film. In addition to the African-American Navy Seal and his wife, as well as the characters of Michael Biehn and Charlie Sheen, it seems that every other team member is unknown to the audience, so when the climate scenes turn around, no one seems to be circulating and the death of someone lament. In such a movie, action sequences can potentially save production. But not here. They are poorly directed, poorly lit, and perform poorly executed stunts. In fact, their direction is so bad that they are almost incoherent with the viewer, resulting not only in incomprehensibly heavy scenes, but also a complete lack of fear and tension. Poor illumination supplies only their impotence. Explosions look fake, gunshot wounds and one of the bolder stunts, which includes breaking the Mercedes over the tank, looks like a stunt that has been staged on the backlot and then poorly modified. The end of Navy Seals puts the coins firmly in the eyes of this production. First, it is a mandatory slow slow motion scene - from a-big-blast-it-had-to-have-killed-me scene with Sheen carrying Biehn on her back. That was, of course, the starting scene to be the star of movie trailers. Then the very end is when Seal's rescuer, injured and floating in the ocean, is rescued by a submarine. This submarine actually turned home long before, but of course it miraculously returned in the absence of time. All this despite the violent and stressful suffering of the Seal, and despite the fact that many of their colleagues have just been killed, many of them still bleeding, everyone can laugh at them warmly and bless America loudly. Predictable? You can only imagine this ending while watching the opening credits. This film reluctantly exploits the Middle East conflict as a means of macho All-American tendency for photogenic young filmmakers. The Arabs are treated condescendingly and dismissively, and their defeat in the film is used as a celebration to celebrate the use of US military power against a 'lower' minority group in a subsequent plain environment. The events of 2001 pointed out that such smug and exaggerated trivialization of the conflicts of these minority groups is certainly not the result of a free passage. The Middle East can no longer be written off as with a ** t-hole full of rag heads knocking each other off (quoting Charlie Sheen here); it is now where engagement can lead to serious consequences. Today we remind us that the consequences of such arrogance can be very close to home. Therefore, at least Navy Seals looks quite stupid these days; but this is to be kind. It is a highly ignorant film whose production values ​​and professionalism are equally suspicious. Navy Seals is an ideologically and artistically complete insult to its viewers' intelligence.
