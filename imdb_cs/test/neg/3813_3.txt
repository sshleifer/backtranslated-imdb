Like "The Blair Witch Project" before him, "Hatchet" collected his own fair share of publicity from bottom-on-up (as an avid reader of Fangoria magazine, full-page ads are hard to miss); even after his medium theatrical run, the film is tied to existence only on the hype surrounding it, and would probably turn into a cult item at some point. With MySpace URL and a mighty (if mysteriously subjective) promise to preserve the so-called "old school of American horror", "Hatchet" will draw many people interested in curiosity with its DVD release (where this claim is decorated on disk itself). Maybe it was a big ad from Ain't It Cool News about ads that made me move closer to the movie with some concern (it seems that Harry Knowles and his minions will approve any movie for VIP tickets and free food), but "Hatchet" I doubt what the idea of ​​writer-director Adam Green really is about "old American horror at school": based on the evidence here, it means it's crazy, late "80s" "friday 13." and "Deliverance." Characters are unpleasant stereotypes (Black Chris Tucker type, Survivalist Chick, Topless Bimbos, Requisite Old Couple, Asian Guide), whose interactions are marked by painful, endeavor-to-be-modern dialogues and mostly obvious stabbing at humor (not quite as bad as "Cabin Fever" but still); the scenario has too much stuffing (such as the "rustle shrub" scene) and "hatchet" is falling apart like a typical postmodern slasher of the last decade, with its only distinguishing feature expertly calculated hype. I'll give it a little bit of praise for gore - if you can pierce the padding between the kills, the red wine is definitely a miracle and the only real reason to look at it.
