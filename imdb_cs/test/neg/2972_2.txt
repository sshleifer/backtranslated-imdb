Hollywood has done a lot of weird movies over the years, but none other than this. WHY THIS MOVIE I HAVE NEVER KNOWED OR HOW Paramount Could Think That Would Sell Some Tickets In 1947. It's the strangest mix of genres I've seen in a long time, a movie that really doesn't know whether it's trying to be a serious war drama or Viennese operetta comedy. It tells the story of a British spy trying to get a poisonous gas formula from Germany in the days just before World War II. Ray Milland, a fine actor, is stuck playing a role as a Monty Python refugee, all a very exaggerated English preschool dialogue. In Germany, she meets Gypsy Marlene Dietrich, who helps him travel under the cover, of course, another gypsy. She plays her role as a typical Viennese operetta gypsy cartoon, as well as other "gypsies" in the film. But there are also Nazis who are not at all funny. And then Milland finds out that he thinks he's a gypsy, and it's not considered a joke. Sometimes music is a light comedy, sometimes a drama. Every time the Nazis appear, the film score plays Wagner, who is in itself funny. This film could have been a comedy, or it could have taken the serious situation of the Roma seriously. show how the Nazis treated them. They are both outlined in this movie, but they weren't watching. What we have left is really strange mish-mash genres that have to shame all involved (except the director). <br /> <br /> Bizarre.
