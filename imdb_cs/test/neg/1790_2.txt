I was a huge fan of Lynn Peterson since her breakthrough role in the 1988 blockbuster movie "Far North", even though I loved her in her next movie "Slow" (2004), where she plays "Francis", that's the strongest role. Lynn, because I'm sure you all know (or should) that "driver" plays a decisive role. Unfortunately, others I'm afraid this movie doesn't really have much to do. Oh wait - there was one more thing - amazing creativity adjustments that would remove the profanity for TV viewers. . Commemorative lines like: "You son-of-a-gun!", "You son-of-a-witch!", "Shoot!", And "Well, forget you!" <br /> <br /> O.K. Hi. P.S: Does anyone know where to get another Lynn Peterson poster?
