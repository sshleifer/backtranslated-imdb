Sound: <br /> <br /> I've never really seen a movie with a worse sound. There are scenes where people go through the grass, and you can hardly hear them through their steps. They have to wash their feet. <br /> <br /> You know how they forget the line in some movies, so they have to copy them into someone's head shot. Here the editors weren't so smart. There is actually a scene where Shannon Tweed's character says her line without moving her lips at all! <br /> <br /> I'm sure for their background sound that played loops live while shooting because in many scenes the sound effects will be either different or absent whenever you change the camera angle. <br /> <br /> I could write a lot more about how bad the sound in this movie is. <br /> <br /> Other Nuggets: <br /> <br /> In this movie, they probably consider special credits to be the introductory credits because they seemed to be so difficult to produce. The main title and the first few titles in the introductory titles are in white text above the white sky and fluctuate as if they were carefully hand painted on each slide. <br /> <br /> Reusing add-ons in this movie is incredible. There are about 15 rebels in the cast, yet thirty or more of them will be killed in each battle. If only the film was good enough to distinguish which of them die again and again. It is also interesting to note that insurgents are usually killed by explosions that are always between 30 and 200 feet. One scene is one scene when some insurgents run away from their chats at the rebel base and one cottage shakes as the rebel leaves the door. This wonders whether the hut will take so long to meet an inevitable explosion. There is a blue helicopter that looks like menacing as a pair of running shorts, but somehow it is equipped with an endless supply of rockets. When it turns out that rockets are fired from rocket positions in a helicopter, they often shoot in unpredictable directions very close to large bottle rockets. They still manage to reach their goals with ease, which, as mentioned above, is always a very safe distance from the rebels they kill. Note that the recycled pilot footage presses the LIVE button to shoot the missiles (because it is printed vertically, the first few times we saw it, we read it as the "ZLO" button). Note how the grenade launcher they use produces the same explosions as those created by helicopter rockets. It's also fun in many scenes as the actor in the foreground shoots in a completely different direction than the group of enemy soldiers he kills. And often, characters shoot a disproportionate number of rounds to the soldiers who are killed (as if a short blast kills a large group of enemies). Yes this movie is very bad. The storyline was thought almost as much as a five-year football game, and the cut is the worst I've ever seen. But honestly, sometimes it's fun to spend 90 minutes of laughter with a group of adults who sincerely participated in such a horrible movie.
