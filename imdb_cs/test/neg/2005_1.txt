That was by far the worst movie I've ever seen! Me and my husband own more than 600 DVDs, most of which are Sci-Fi B-movies and Horror, which are not of top quality but still fun. Dracula 300 had no redeeming qualities at all! Writing was scary and the acting was even worse. It took us 3 attempts to get through the whole movie because we could only tolerate it in 30-minute intervals. We thought it must be better ... we were wrong. I'd rather look at a corpse that is embalmed than have to sit back again !!! When it ended and my husband looked at himself like "Uh .. is that?" The end looked like there should be more, but they overcame their apparent $ 500.00 budget and were like "Oh, stupid ... we're broken ... now ... fast ... charge credits!"
