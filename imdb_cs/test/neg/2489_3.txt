There is no real story that the film looks more like a fly on a wall drama than the right movie, so this piece can itself be a spoiler. A teen drama about three young Singaporean children (very similar to British chavas) who play school at school, run with gangs, get into fights, offend people on the street, get tattoos, hang on doing something, etc. Etc. Be hard and everyone so often scream demanding rap chants into the camera. MTV-style, fast cuts, crazy camera angles, close-ups and animations. Dialogue could be sharper in the original languages ​​Mandarin and Hokkien than in the headlines, and I have no doubt that some of the current Singapore links will slip over the western heads as well as the cultural and political context unless you are familiar with Singapore. This kind of teen movie can be the first for Singapore, but it was done earlier and done better in other Western countries, such as La Haine (1995).
