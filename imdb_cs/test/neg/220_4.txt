There is not much to add to what others have already commented on, the film fails where it should not, has no depth in robbery planning, and characters are so incredible. One thing that occurred to me was that while the rest of the gang was trying to remove the pins from the armored car door because it wasn't supposed to be another way to open it, the guy inside the cart , with great ease, we can remove the truck floor that has a hole in it to get out and then go back without anyone noticing, because no one else could think that it could get out of there or even better to get out of there. <br /> <br /> Promising, but not quite there.
