The film moves quite well, but acting, directing and editing leave a lot to be desired. The characters are mostly picked up from other movies and Vinnie Jones lookalike is straight from Gone in 50 seconds. The comedy gangster movie is a genre that should have a lot of contrast, silly sellers in Lock Stock and filming that leaves all dead. You should never know whether to laugh or just sit in shock. This film had the right elements, but it's too easy to sit there as a man knitting and tut on small details that should be set somewhere along the line and once the faith has been suspended one just getting more critical. Too bad it was a brave attempt, and although Clint Eastwood is famous for saying it will be fine for the scene, he will do the job before he shoots and is Clint Eastwood. Here a little more imagination with the camera and a little more coaching and line delivery tests would make a big difference.
