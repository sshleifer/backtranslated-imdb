A very unsatisfactory movie by Oliver Stone, which, unlike his recent epic "J.F.K." unable to stimulate any real emotions. "Talk Radio" is about talk-back host 'Barry Champlain', a very loud, persuasive man who can excite a lot of people and still draw an audience, most of whom think you just want to ring and abuse him. His boss in the film (Alec Baldwin) sums up his character very well by saying that he's just a shoe-seller with big mouths. And as Barry (Eric Bogosian) gets a threat of death on the threat of death, the end result is almost inevitable. This is a movie that usually has something very powerful to say. However, "Talk Radio" cannot make a serious comment and remains a frustrating, meaningless film. Thursday, September 17, 1992 - Video
