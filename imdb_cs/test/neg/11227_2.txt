I saw worse, which is a backhanded way to tell how confused this movie was. The story is ridiculous: a student fires a policeman and another five takes him hostage? In a poorly lit, smoke-filled New York school - and any situation of hostage clich√© takes 24 hours? Are you serious? Daylong hostage situation - with a wounded NYPD officer all day long? I realize that this movie was made pre-9/11 but still. I looked at the clock and wondered how they could drag this exaggerated plot for another hour and 10 minutes. Acting was average at best, and the characters seemed to be 7th. graders. Child Abusing Child, Pregnant Scared Girl, Violent Gang Like, Confused Unfortunate Victim, Wise White. Are you trying to make this hostage situation a mission for "more textbooks" and better school conditions? Please, it's a weak attempt to justify writing a movie about a guy who shoots a cop. They are confused, ignorant idiots who have engaged in a stupid situation. Don't try to paint them, suddenly, as noble, the most ridiculous is Ziggy, who lives in the school attic and admires Michaelangelo so much that he scares the striking scenes on the walls. You gotta be kidding. <br /> <br /> "No Racism" in the Protesting Crowd? The black boy is shooting a black cop and the black negotiator is trying to fix him. This is a random message. I understand the overall message that has been poorly rendered, though for some actors who have continued a serious career. red sniper lasers on the roof? The worst scene was a boy, falling falling snow, dying in the arms of his friend on the roof, "promise me," etc. How original. 'm Pre-Law at XYZ University' ... a good way to end the movie joke.
