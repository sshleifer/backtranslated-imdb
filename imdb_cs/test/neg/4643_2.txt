I know that Full Moon, or any other film studio for that, could never capture the fun and cheese sci-fi feeling that was the original "Trancers". And with the last two records in the series with Jack Deth in the Middle Ages instead of the futuristic Los Angeles, it was obvious that there was little hope of reviving the Trancer series. Breathing new life into the film is one thing, but taking our main character out of his element and putting it in the past, well, it didn't work! So now with Trancers 6, Full Moon breathes so much new life into the show that we're not dealing with Jack Deth anymore. Now we'll deal with his daughter, Jo. Jack is in her body and has to go past and fight Trancery again. <br /> <br /> * MINOR SPOILER: REVEALED FIRST SCENE SCENE * <br /> <br /> Demonstrating how bad this movie is, all you have to do is watch the first two minutes of the movie when the original Jack Deth appears on the screen. But it's not actually Tim Thomerson. These are his clips and the sound bytes that are linked together (believe me, you can say they are with each other) terribly to give Jack Dete the last real humor. And from now on, things get down the hill. Having this girl, Jo Deth, as our main character, while Jack Deth is supposed to be in her body, is the worst idea in the world. With this adorable young woman you act like a rough and hard man is not the right way! It doesn't work and it's really stupid. I will not go into aspects of special effects and make-up because most reading knows what happened to the full moon: And indeed, the low budget of the business. I don't know what to say about this film, except that I really wish it was a full moon like in the days of Demonic Toys, Puppet Master and Trancers 1. Back then, while special effects weren't great, telling stories. They did serious b-movies for serious B movie and horror fans, and it just doesn't happen today with the new Full Moon Studios. I long for good days, and I really hope Full Moon can break out of this terrible downturn they have now. Tranceri 6 get 2 out of 10.
