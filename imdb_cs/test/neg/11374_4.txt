Whatever the PC Enforcer Committee is responsible for this film, it has achieved something I never thought possible: take some really talented actors (Davis, Hardin and Taylor) and let them never take care of them in an enclosed space. The feelings underlying the script are so jejeune and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine what the viewer would find this image appealing, much less entertaining. Architecture students perhaps? Only one scene is visually clever: Marcia Gay Hardin sashaying, all the fluctuations and rhythm, the bar can radiate more style and energy in ten seconds than the rest of the world. the film was summed up and multiplied by the tenth power. As for the other cast members, they probably won't want to put this on their resumes.
