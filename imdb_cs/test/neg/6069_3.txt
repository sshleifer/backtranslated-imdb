I am a music lover and I was glad to see this movie. Unfortunately I was disappointed. I was ready to go halfway through the movie. I did not identify with any of the characters, which meant that I did not care about what happened to them, and I completely lost interest in the story. On the good side, Ed Harris looked exactly like Beethoven, and the 9th Symphony is always a pleasure to hear, so it made part of the movie bearable. Also, the parts where they talk about the bridge almost bought out the whole movie, but they couldn't keep me going. The actors did what they could with what they had to work with, but the script was simply not enough to make it interesting. A little bit of "washing" was a complete garbage. I was wondering how many actors had to do on this one (I couldn't say those lines without leaping into laughter).
