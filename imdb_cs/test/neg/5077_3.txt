I just watched this movie on DVD late in the morning and I was so disappointed that I thought it was a good joke for the audience. In other words, the creators planned to do a comedy not a drama. But finally I realized that Mr. Tony Giglio was serious about this film. It's a shame because: dialogue is ridiculous, acting is poor and lifeless, the story is a fish story! Poor Ryan Phillippe - despite his efforts, his character remains the worst performance in the movie! What to say to Jason Statham - lack of all skills to develop a role that is an imaginary fiction ... For these reasons, I voted: 3/10
