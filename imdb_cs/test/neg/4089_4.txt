I saw this movie waiting to roll in the aisles. The film was slightly entertaining, at best and in the worst case irritating (the slapstic style of comedy building the ark with archaic instruments, laughter ... not me). I'm very disappointed that Steve Carrel was the leader. I look at the US Office religiously, it bursts me tremendously, I thought a 40-year-old virgin was good ... but Evan 'elp us - why he accepted this scenario on Earth. And like Morgan Freeman - he's old enough to know better. So the thought seemed reasonable, the actors I had every faith with, but the execution was nothing to write home and end, it seemed like they ran out of money or ideas . This was one of the most beautiful ends I could imagine. They took a biblical story and dumbed it down to a warning story about localized environmental issues, not even global affairs, but a local account - yawning! In summary, a reasonable start, gradually getting worse, and, for me, it was all washed out at the time the credit was rolled.
