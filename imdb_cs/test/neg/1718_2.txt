Tycus is one of the worst movies directly on video movies that I ever see. <br /> <br /> I am not amazing that this product does not appear in the cinema.Bad Visual Effects (Beginning is Terrible) Bad Actors (I Do Not Understand Why Dennis Hopper and Bad Screen have no meaning in this movie My Alternative: Armaggedon or Twister SENTENCE FOR TYCUS: Don't watch this movie.
