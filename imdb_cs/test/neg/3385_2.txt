Wow, where do I start? After suffering over this pathetic $ 1.00 rent (thanks to LOT, family video) I just had to make some comments. I didn't bother writing the names of the 3 actors in the movie, but hopefully you'll know what I'm talking about. Monster truck terrorizes the country and haunts two college friends. their fate. They meet a hot girl who wears seductive clothes. This sounds theoretically fantastic. I laughed hysterically at the DVD box when I went to the girl behind the counter in the video store. Acting: The hot girl played by Aimee Whatever is visibly laughing through the many scenes she was supposed to be scared of. The other two main actors in the film, a fat joke and a vanilla-straight boy are both terrible. The fat guy thinks he's Jack Black. He is not. Another actor, our hero, conquers and misses all his suggestions and meets him as some kind of kind of character you could see in the film made in for Nickelodeon about skateboarding in the early 1990s. Look: I'm not expecting big performances in movies like these, but at least the actors can try not to be uncomfortable. You may be an incompetent actor, but still be pleasant (ie John Wayne). At least Aimee gal is attractive. Scenario: Saint ****, who thought this dialogue was fun? I wouldn't have the strength to play it in front of my classroom class, much less than the screenplay. Undeniably bad. More about it later. <br /> <br /> Production: OK, this is the only place where the movie will definitely succeed. Production quality is incredibly high. The film's appearance is very good. The only talented person who worked on the film seems to be a photo director. OK, here are my biggest shots: 1) Whoever drives a car never drives faster than 25 miles per hour. 2) The one who drove the car is out in the ground before realizing there is a fat man in the back seat mask. He is reportedly careful about recording gas mileage and keeping his antique car in good condition, but he does not notice the 300lb Jack Black impersonator in his back? Come on. <br /> <br /> 4) Characters never change clothes. There are two hotel scenes available. Probably there are showers available for our characters, but within 3 days this movie is taking place, none of the characters mind changing their clothes. 5) Comedy. Lighthearted, slapstick comedy does not mix with horror. Time. You can't have our characters running away from the monster truck one second and the next second is verbally approaching each other with some dopey light / comedy playing music. This kind of stimulation virtually destroys any tension in the film. Films like Evil Dead 2, which mix comedy and horror, understand that tension can be relaxed, but never completely removed by humor. Monster Man doesn't get it. I'm irritated that what could have been a very funny horror movie was destroyed by a director who thought it was a lot smarter than it really was. Oh, good.
