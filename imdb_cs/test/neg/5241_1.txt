I saw this film during a festival in Munich with a huge crowd of fantasy fans. Approximately in the middle of the movie, one part of the audience slept and the other part was booinging. Boring dialogues, poorly choreographic combat sequences, a terribly stupid story and even worse special effects. Well, at least the actors didn't have much to do except to care for it, or (if they were women) who showed their breasts in the right light. Even GÃ¶tz Otto, who was later admitted among viewers, could understand the disappointment of the audience. Be warned, people, from the cheapest movie of fantasy ........
