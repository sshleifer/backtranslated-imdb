I've never heard of "The Clearing" until I someday really bored with my friends at the local blockbuster and grabbed our attention. The description on the DVD jacket grabbed our interest, but once we jumped into the DVD player, boredom was just the beginning. The story was pulled out on waaaay too long. It seemed to follow the same outline as other films that include kidnapping. However, the strictest parts were at the beginning of the film. Then followed the outline, which made "The Clearing" unoriginal. The memories of the shots were too much and the victim's grief did not provide anything of interest or increase the nature of the film. And I also found that I didn't like the ending, so it probably made me not like the movie at all. Acting wasn't terrible ... but it wasn't the greatest. Robert Redford performed much better. Willem Dafoe's tragic character was the only one I saw developing throughout the story, and the viewer actually saw it only in the last ten minutes. The depiction of Helena Mirren, as the wife of Robert Redford, was flat and followed the same general form as other films that include a tragic event happening in the heart. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, "The Clearing" is nothing. Use your movie to rent money for something else ... like "Garden State," maybe?
