I found it hard to be about these characters who were either annoying or shameless, all living their wonderfully cheerful city life. The dialogue was sometimes exciting, and sometimes the story was hard to follow. - Was it me, or was the whole scene erased? I felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a movie. Stereotypes and jokes about "male groups" might have been funny in the early 1990s. This is where the big part of the film's humor comes from - and the boy, it gets old fast. <br /> <br /> In addition to an attractive Irish man, this movie was fake. And even in "so bad is a good way". The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Perhaps if you have never met any homosexuals or you have never thought about homosexuality, then this movie might have something meaningful to say. Otherwise - darlings, you should be even better off renting Boys in the Band or Beautiful Thing.
