Apparently it was the winner of the award. Apparently someone had a gun against his head and was forced to nominate corn: a film. Or it must have been a mistake. when it was done. Screening and editing is the greatest horror movie of this movie. Two little girls get lost in a cornfield and get stalked by someone who can be heard laughing under his rubber mask. The girls run into their heroic father and then run away from him, W.T.F. The hero dad in the film loses track of them in a few minutes watching this. The girls probably weren't trained actors, and they had no common sense. They were so annoying and so infantile in film, or remotely comedic. Hear them again and again as a broken record was the reason I got up and left. You can't even listen to this movie without almost cramping. <br /> <br /> I can throw up a better winner than this waste.
