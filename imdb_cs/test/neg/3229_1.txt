I hated the book. The guy meets a clever dog, gets a virgin girlfriend, and is always chased by a boy and ape (both who want a dog). Dean Koontz really can't write (I read the book on the recommendation of my sister, I should have known better). When I saw it (mostly from morbid curiosity), I found that I criticized it because it was untrue for the book, even though it's a book whose impossibility to make a good movie. I thought at least if they were going to make a film adaptation of the worst book I've ever read, they might be accurate. They turned a man and his virgin love interest into a boy and his mother, for some reason that worried me the most (although I seriously doubted it was a man and his chick wouldn't be better). Quite simple; bad book, bad movie, I don't see it.
