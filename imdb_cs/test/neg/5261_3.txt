My age: 13 <br /> <br /> Keats, played by Damon Wayans, and Archie Moses, played by Adam Sandler, are best friends and have been a year. What Moses doesn't know is that Keats is indeed Jack Carter, a secret cop waiting for the right time to break through Moses and Frank Colton, the chief criminal Moses deals with. When Colton and Moses find out that Keats is a cop, Colton wants to kill Moses, but after Carter's shooting in the head that didn't kill Carter, he gets away. Moses is found by the cops and is taken as evidence of Colton's wrongdoing. But when the cops, including Carter, are about to escort across the country for a plane, all the other cops are killed, and Moses and Carter are alone in the desert. Carter must stay alive just as he can take Moses inside. A relatively average action comedy, Bulletproof has a fair storyline, but a lot of the movie is just stupid. For comedy I found that most jokes are totally rude. But as an action movie, it has some pretty good action scenes. I wasn't a good fan of Adam Sandler or Damon Wayans, I found acting and therefore characters, well below par. The top is not really great and the film is so unrealistic. It's not completely bad, but not too good and too short. When I ran under 85 minutes, I was still 15 minutes before it ended, but the movie wasn't too short. Overall, it's not a complete waste of time, but I still wouldn't recommend Bulletproof.
