This is another original Sci-Fi channel movie that looks at Rhys Davies, where it's hard to decide what's worse, acting or writing / directing / producing (John Sheppherd helms all three.) , it is smuggled by a cargo container aboard a cruise ship that escapes and starts a blood bath. Clich√©ci sci fi cast a robust captain with a beautiful daughter, handsome hero and mad scientist. Captian calls for a terrorist challenge to the ship (because of course he wouldn't believe the story of the monster.) There's no dramatic drop in Navy helicopters. The budget allowed only the entire power of eight seals to get into the glass ship and the ship. Puleeze. Also, the ugly computer animation of a ship you could do better on your computer. I also loved when Commander Seal, who was staring across the standard telescope from ten miles away, was able to see three people jumping out of the ship. If the Sci-Fi channel continues with the original films, I hope they realize that the audience is not at the kindergarten level and buys better scripts and directors. If it was right on the video, you would find it in the 99-cent bin.
