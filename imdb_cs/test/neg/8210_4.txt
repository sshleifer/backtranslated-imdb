"Dungeon of Harrow" had a lot of things that could make this pretty good horror movie. Haunted mansion, torture chamber, paranoid guest, follower, werewolf in dungeon, etc. Unfortunately, unfortunately it wasn't very good. The writer and captain have crashed the Earl's property in his castle, his slave and the mute maid. The number is becoming increasingly suspicious that the two shipwrecked men are pirates (of all things) and have a greater tendency to turn to them and subordinate them, and mute the maid who makes them, torture and imprisonment. Sounds wrong? Well, not exactly. I used to call it one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but now I hesitate. Because he had so much potential that he really couldn't be called "one of the worst". But seeing this potential is really a big hit against this movie. All in all, it's not a very good movie. There is a very gothic tense scene where our hero is chained in a dungeon and is confronted with a mad and leper rotting bride, adorned in a torn wedding dress. It was scary and disturbing when I first saw horror appearing in this scene. I wish it was a better movie! This movie had all the right things to make this moody late night cooler, but eventually made all the wrong turns. I recommend that someone remake them.
