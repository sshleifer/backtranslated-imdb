When this show first aired, I confess that I was intrigued by space and environment. With an open mind, I watched the first two episodes and naturally refused it as being destined to run for half a year. I recently watched A / E and witnessed the ad for this waste and I could barely surprise myself. I really hope people watch it for laughter and don't take it seriously. Characters are really some of the most ridiculous and utterly laughter on TV, script or otherwise. It is, of course, generating ratings, so I have to give the creators a credit to set up and maintain a fanbase, but I seriously hope that no one will observe it under any pretense of seriousness.
