This miniseries / movie was so terrible that I almost collapsed and turned off. I am a big fan of the novel, but this film has many problems. Costumes are poor and many of the emotionally charged scenes are bliss. Departures from the novel are poorly chosen, significant nuances are missed or rewritten. <br /> <br />
