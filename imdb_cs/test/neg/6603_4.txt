I grabbed La Bandar because Jean Gabin and Julien Duvivier met Pepe le Moko as a masterpiece. I'll give her a few points because Gabin is in it, but the clumsy land, cheap sets, and the ridiculous Annabella who does like an Arabian princess put the movie on my "sell" shelf. If you look at it, you will find that you are asking why the idiots did not create a fortress around the well instead of a few meters away. And why use tin roofs in the middle of the desert? But at that moment, the sheer perversity of the controversial act that makes up the scenario should numb you for further contemplation.
