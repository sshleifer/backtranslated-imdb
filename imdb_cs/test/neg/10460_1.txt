While trying to build a major shopping mall or complex, or something like that, a wealthy landowner ignores ancient Indian artifacts buried on the ground and empties a bone meal ... a creature that goes by and kills people in search of his fallen friends or something. In fact, this movie had to be the original Sci-Fi channel. If not, the director should never direct anything. The effects in the movie are at best ridiculous and the Bone Eater monster is nothing but an animated CGI that is later added to the frames. The actors don't even seem to frighten them when they see things (probably because they really don't, and they're just terrible actors). It's a great comedy, even though it's supposed to be pure horror.
