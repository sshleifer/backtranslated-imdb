I loved the original P.H. and was somewhat satisfied with Bloodwings (II) and Ashes to Ashes (III), then I saw Part IV. Oh boy ..... As a Pumpkinghead enthusiast, I've done my best to give Part 4 as much credit as I can, but it's pretty bad. Fighting at the wedding reception right at the start of the movie is a terrible mess for one thing. The story of Hatfield and McCoy is incomprehensibly stupid and clich√©. How did manufacturers get away using this tired family controversial story? Wow, incredible. Acting, except for Henrickson, is below average. The storyline and the script are numb. Custom editing and cinematography are average as well as directing. I think the movie is not a total loss. As always: I really enjoy watching Pumpkinhead, I like to see Haggis the Witch and I like to watch Harley's spirit in action. But all three characters had too much time on the screen. I thought Haggis and Harley would end up in the evening club for dinner to eat and drink as the buddies in the cabin behaved. The bottom line is ... It's that I wanted all the characters in this twist from the storyline to be dead within 20 minutes of the beginning of the picture. Where did Sci-Fi get these so-called "film production professionals"? I could do a better job of writing a cold drunk script. I'm sure there was a limited budget and everything, but come on! See if your fan of the other three, but only once. And then go back and stick to the original two. Shame on you Sci-Fi !!!!
