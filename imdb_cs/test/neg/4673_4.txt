Half of the movie is flashing lights and shaky camera. The rest is made up of predictable characters (science vs. government, "know-how" vs. authority, etc.) <br /> <br /> What is the worst aspect of this movie? It's a car throwing in the first 5 minutes, it's a horrible 'Russian' astronaut's accent, it's uninspired characters, poorly integrated Top 40 hits, or 'USA will save the world' vitriol? No. It is a fact that, despite the "sad" ending - there is very little tension in this film - we basically know what will happen. One good part of this movie: "American Components, Russian Components: All Made in Taiwan!"
