I do not understand exaggerated good critics about this film, except that many people in Venezuela are, of course, very enthusiastic, making the Venezuelan cinema really a bit behind what other countries in the region have. <br /> <br /> The film is too repetitive in the first place, with many scenes almost identical to each of the two main roles, giving you the impression that it's a time fill. The good thing is also the time fill, because this movie is definitely too long with 105 minutes, after a while you get tired and watch the clock. <br /> <br /> All the actors are pretty bad. except venezuelan guy Edgar Ramirez, who brings a little slapstick and plays the role of venezuelan recruit "Pedro". By the way, this is not a representative film about people in the (Caribbean) region, it tends to mock them.
