This film had the potential. The script was not bad and featured an interesting dark atmosphere with the themes of suicide, patricide, regret and - as Chris says - "10 years from nothing". It's a sharp contrast to the original MAG7, which was bright, funny, and even the bad guy was kind. I liked it. But instead they lose too much time on the gratuitous (and ridiculous) battle scenes, poorly edited. At one point you see the horse fall and 5 seconds later you will see the same scene again. But many people wouldn't notice, because there are already dozens of horseback trips, and then we've already run away. <br /> <br /> What leads me to my review title. This film has been greatly shortened due to the cruelty of animals, so the chances are (if you choose to watch) you get a watered, childish version. There is a bullfight where the matador stabs the bull, and suddenly, as the crowd explodes, there is no bull, just a matador in the empty arena. Like wow, maybe the bull was a Jedi, I don't know. It is more likely that the scene has been cut. Later on, there is a cock scene where one of the birds in the original version defeats a huge crowd of cheering Mexicans. That was interrupted. But we still see enough to be angry. But by far the worst scenes are horses. One by one, you can see how the legs of the horses are torn out and thousands of pounds of horse are being sent to their heads. In one scene, the horse is thrown and then, when it is spinning on the ground in paralytic cramps, the explosive goes out under the neck. regulate the brutality of animals on film. This is probably one of the last moves you can see. So if the kind of things that float your ship, look at it and you get a slight excitement. But if not, either you will be irritated or bored.
