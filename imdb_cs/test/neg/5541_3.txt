I realize this is a small statistical selection (8 votes from this broadcast), but 5.9 out of 10? I give this movie 3 and it's generous. Now I tried to watch this movie three times (on Saturday at 9:00 premiere on SciFi Channel and on Saturday evening at 1:00 and on Thursday evening re-broadcasts) and I fell asleep three times. Which leaves me on a list of unanswered questions. For example, is Lance Henriksen, who is strapped to money, that he must play backing roles in these divine "Pumpkinhead" sequels? Is Henriksen banned from making any movies that are not "Pumpkinhead"? Can the creators of this franchise do better than a monster who looks like a geriatric, emitted by "Alien" who walks like he had a stick stuck in his **? When will the hick characters in these movies realize that guns and rifles don't hurt "Pumpkinhead?" Why don't they try to steal another wand this place? Finally, the writers of this film are so creatively questioned that they couldn't come up with names for two fake families more original than Hatfields and McCoys? While you are at it, why not write a screenplay about a fictitious president and name it George Bush? One day I can have a mental endurance to watch this film all the way without going to sleep. If anyone has answers, please let me know.
