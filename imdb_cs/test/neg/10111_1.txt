Where on earth do I start with a mess that is Darkhunters? First, the scenario is one of the worst ever found on a cinema or TV screen, and can only be described as a badly judged Stephen King rapture. At one point, the fearsome dark hunter Jack claims that Carol, the girl who helps the man he watches, is just as annoying as "the hamburger cucumber". I'd like to laugh if I did it - BUT NOT! Equally ridiculous is how Carol originally came to have the power to see people die. The cat gave her when she held him during a car accident she had as a child. CO CO ???????? Second, for a horror movie, it has no sense of tension or threat at all. It may not be helpful for all actions to take place during sharp, broad daylight. It's not too atmospheric at all. Third, acting is terrible, the Pinion proves once again that it must speak in its native language to be even remotely believable. Of course, Jeff Fahey is on autopilot, but how can he blame him for going through the imitation of Humphry Bogart as Barlow (Marlowe-Barlow? We're getting the joke that it's just not funny). The loan should go to Susan Paterno, an actress I didn't know about doing the best with the terrible part she has, and putting others, more experienced actors on shame. By no means does it even explain how HUMAN's character can understand what Van Husen's character says to her. She apparently has some sort of degree in dizzying foreign languages. On the plus side one moment is well done, a car accident involving Susan. Sfx is truly believable, and if it wasn't for the cheerful story the reason why it happened, it would be applauding. All I can say about darkhunters is that the British horror will never recover from its endless life decline if films like this continue to be produced and displayed. Avoid this movie as a plague, even though the plague would be much more frightening. <br /> <br /> Darkhunters 0/5 <br /> <br /> p.s. stimuli in other reviews that the movie remains too intelligent for some are sincerely cheerful. It's a weak defense when someone says you didn't like it because you didn't understand it. Letters after my name make you mad.
