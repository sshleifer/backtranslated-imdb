There is something about this show that keeps me alert and hoping for the future of it. In writing, jokes are few and far between, and the story of the line is boring, so I have to be physical comedy and visual effects. <br /> <br /> I like camera movement, dressing up and a wardrobe. It is amusingly high contrasting to the numbness that rules. And I'm sure I've always laughed because it was John's or Molly's physical comedy. Two of them make a frighteningly cute couple who laugh at me and want to vomit at the same time. So here I am ready to sit down at Kath & Kim one more night to see what way this production is going to go down (or increase, we look forward to positive).
