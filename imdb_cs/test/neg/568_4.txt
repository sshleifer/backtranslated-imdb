A really funny story with good actors, but somehow it is missing. The actors are older, but none of them looked particularly good. They needed better makeup, photography or something. It's supposed to be a love story, and yet the film had a more coarse look of street movie. I liked the cast, but I think the performances were rather bland. Here shows the director's weakness. Perhaps if Mrs. Spielberg had directed Mr. Spielberg, it would be a much better film.
