I witnessed some movie atrocities. In the last few years, it seems that producers and directors are trying to make films that bring me closer to madness. Hannibal was no exception. I didn't expect much when I went to see the movie. The book was absurd, and says, "The book is always better than a movie" to assure me at all that this movie would be something but garbage. But what I saw was a movie in which all the other bad movies seemed better compared. Usually, when I see a horrible movie, I find myself more amused than anything else. Unfortunately, I couldn't even laugh at the sad excuse for the movie that is Hannibal. The movie was filming promisingly, I think. They had Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman. And for directing was Ridley Scott. There were films with significantly less talent that were tremendously better. There was so much I could cut out of this movie, which I doubt would have left anything. It was pathetic. The story was so ridiculous it looked like a complete idiot. Worse, the book was even crazier, and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included, which is sad in the case of a movie where <br /> <br /> *** SPOILER AHEAD *** Ray Liotta's brain was cooked in pieces. More than anyone else, this scene made me want to cry because it tainted its predecessor to such a monumental level. The silence of the lambs was one of my favorite movies of all time. But Hannibal was two hours plus a joke. This film should only be watched if people want to learn how to write a good film.
