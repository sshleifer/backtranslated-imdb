I saw this movie yesterday and I thought it was awful; it was useless and simple stupid. the supposed conspiracy concerned a potential groom who was too affected by the world's problems to relate to his bride and other people in his life. He disappears on his wedding day (in tux no less) and joins the wonders assortment. We saw it with bus-loading people on the way down to Atlantic City and everyone agreed that it was a horrible movie. He was trying to be deep, but he wasn't; it was stupid and offensive. If I weren't on the bus, I'd go for a movie. Anyone who is considering viewing a movie or buying or buying it.
