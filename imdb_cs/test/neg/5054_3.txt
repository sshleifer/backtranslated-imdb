This absurd film was about "Goodie-two-shoe", a teen-girl who really wanted to be Valedictorian, but finds her obstacle in the teacher's name Mrs. Tingle. Katie Holmes, who plays this "goodie-two-shoe", faces the "biggest dilemma of her teenage life" when this classmate comes along with a sample of the final exams that should help them get closer to Mrs Tingle's test. Mrs. Tingle arrives, grabs Holmes, a classmate and her best friend with a final exam sample. Convinced that three of them are planning to cheat the test, Mrs. Tingle will thrill on her chance to destroy Holmes once and for all with accusations that can take any chance that Holmes will go through her class. And a classmate who's obviously had eyes on Holmes always wondered why she never gave her the time of day (he's an idiot)? Holmes and her friends, who felt desperate, visit Mrs. Tingle in the middle of the night to try to discourage her and believe that Holmes is planning to cheat. It all depends somehow when a classmate shows a bow and arrow to Mrs. Tingle and threatens her to do things for Holmes. Mrs. Tingle fights back, but eventually ends up as Holmes and her boyfriend in captivity. During Mrs. Tingle's captives under Holmes, they do everything they can to her and throw her on her own bed to blackmail her. fake pictures taken from an unconscious coach in bed with Mrs. Tingle. I found myself crouching when the children at Mrs. Tingle's house were doing home, eating and going to their private jobs. At one point, Holmes found Mrs. Tingle's grade book and intentionally changes the grade in her favor, lowering the degree of her challenge for valedictorian. The ending took place as a childish effort to bring a comedy that was seldom at the beginning of the film and was solved by pure irony, grotesque and absurdity. This must be the most unpleasant and malevolent evil character Holmes would ever play in her lifetime. I wanted to help Mrs. Tingle to actually dig the grave for Holmes. She was manipulative, selfish and pleasing. She even slept with her classmate, even though her best friend was interested in him ... and she didn't like him. From attempting to destroy the classes of your followers by catching Mrs. Tingle's mark to marry the best friend's men, you think Holmes will eventually get what he deserves, right? Unfortunately, she gets everything her heart desires, shows he's evil, manipulative, selfish and whining can get what you want. Mrs. Tingle was supposed to be a character you didn't like. They did not bring me until I believed it to be a woman who had to be "taught this lesson". She was like any other strict teacher who even gave valid reasons for her next-generation resentment. Personally, I felt that her opinions on young people were always confirmed by Holmes and his friend. I still hoped she could freely call the police and the nails of Holmes. They left her tied up in bed, ate a meal like a bunch of pigs, drank a woman's wine, spoiled their personal belongings, and assumed we believed they didn't deserve each one's head? And a classmate must be one of the most unpopular characters in film history. Forget the idiot, we need a new word for him that isn't in Webster's dictionary. He brought the main problems to Holme's life, and then things got worse when he entered Mrs. Tingle's house, uninvited behind Holmes, and Mrs. Tingle's horns with a bow and arrow. I was thrilled every time Mrs. Tingle had a chance to fire him, or to choke the best friend. <br /> <br /> If you are a teenager and want to see when teenagers are engaged and misbehavior can get him into the world, see this selfless, cartoon filled, unintentional film noir.
