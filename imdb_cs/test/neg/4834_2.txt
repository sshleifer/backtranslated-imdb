It happened to me on TV and I wanted to watch because I remembered the article of Spin magazine on which the movie was based. I was very disappointed. First, if James Belushi is the leading player in the film, it should be a sign that it is not exactly A-sheet production. Gregory Hines was a world-class dancer, but unfortunately he's not a great actor. In fact, all the performances in this film are either flat or hammy, which can only be blamed on the director, who is the weakest link in this movie. It seems that Charles Carner is trying to appeal to "JFK" Oliver Stone when he portrayed the alleged plot to cover the "true" killer (s) of the child, but without the benefit of a good script, cast A-list or, talent must be said. It just doesn't work. It is a pity that such a worthy subject for the film did not receive better treatment.
