this is the most overrated show on television. I believe people watch it because they think they should, because it has become a somewhat "cool" show that looks and talks to their friends about the next day at work or school. it rarely induces anything more than laughter, and never raises any sense of irony or thought from the audience. Every joke is interchangeable with "punchlines" that seem to be pulled out of the hat. the total lack of originality, combined with a more peaceful spin that was born (see: American Dad), makes me question the intelligence of the audience, which still keeps this horrible show on TV. i award family guy no points and may god of mercy on his soul ...
