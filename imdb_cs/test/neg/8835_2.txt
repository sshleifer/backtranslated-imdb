I have no idea how commentators might consider it a decent B Western. Or as one commentator said the story was more coherent than most. Nothing can be further from the truth! This movie is one huge non-sequitur! It is an insult to the West's noble films of the 1930s. I've seen many of Wayne's early Lone Star and Republic westerns, and this one is easily the worst. Bad is known as The Shadow - for crying out loud! The Shadow scheme initially holds open one-sided trainers. At the same time his gang fucks all cattle in the territory. Then they decide to switch to bank robbery. To do this, you have to shoot in the city with a machine gun - no explanation why it is necessary or how it got into that little toy! <br /> <br /> No single system is revealed in sufficient detail to indicate a fence here. The shadow is probably just a bad person with all kinds of generally bad schemes. He gives his gang his instructions through a false wall. (Knock-knock, who's there?) He's obviously clairvoyant, because whenever his followers have to talk to him, they knock on the wall, open the safe and - PRESTO - he's there. (I can only imagine seeing them face to face and saying, "I have some secret, shameful instructions to give you about our next evil act - meet me safely on the wall and give it to them Just because The shadow requires safe communication with its outlaw army, it is, like most elements of this mess, never explained. It has a handy tunnel to the stump cavity across the street from which the prospect, his evil explorers are doing. a hidden panel that isn't in his secret lair behind a fake safe, but out in the main room. <br /> <br /> When he's not in the safe, he's hanging on a ranch without a cow, he's masquerading as a Matlock rancher. the real owner of the ranch - the two brothers - and the identity of one, the daughter of a dead brother recently arrived from NYC in 1930 (judging by her wardrobe) and apparently never met her real uncle because If you thought you always wore black hats and good guys white hats, you have to see this movie. Here, good guys, they all go for hats in favor of white headbands that make them look like everyone is suffering from head injuries before any shots were fired! It's like a pick-up basketball game - only Wayne gives them tied bandanas around their heads instead of taking off their shirts. Perhaps the strangest of all is the end. Immediately after we got rid of Shadow and his gang, we jump far enough into the future to see Wayne and his wife (the oldest niece) on the front porch of his home. (It doesn't matter that there was a little romance.) There, Yak plays with Wayne's 3-4-year-old son, dressed in Injun garb! (Hiyoo, Jumping Fun!) <br /> <br /> Not because of this nonsense, Wayne became a legend on the screen. Only a super-star (packer or not!) Could record this record in the movie. Long live the Duke!
