I really love Lucy ... the comic genius yes ..... MAME ... NEVER ... was as ridiculous as Mame ... as well as the film adaptation of Sister Ya Ya's Divine Secrets. They both just missed the point. Roslind Russell was, is, and always will be the first and only Mame. Perhaps as a young star ball, Ball could tear off a role where her natural beauty and youth could transfer her ... but the old star's desperate effort seemed to show that she was still viable in the field. . The reason why so many more Russell version supporters are (in addition to the fact that you can't improve the original) is that Russell had a presence, she absorbs every scene, while Lucille Ball can also be a wallpaper pattern in Mame for all the attention she commands in the role .
