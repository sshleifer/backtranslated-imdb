The biggest problem "in search of the historical Jesus" is that there is little to it.

Sadly, "historical Jesus" is really more than just the third stage of the dramatization of Christ's life. Unlike Shick-Sunn's superior "In Search of Noah's Ark", who spends most of his time, discussing the possibility that the Ark rests on the earth today, and where it might be, this film is essentially a story of Jesus without effort. prove or refute its existence. Known Shroud Turrin is mentioned, but little other detective work is given much of the screen time. For fans of these quasi-documentary films such as "Jupiter Menace" and "In Search of Bigfoot", etc., this movie doesn't offer much.
