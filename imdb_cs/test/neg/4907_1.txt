That was one of the most beautiful, boring and clich√© movies I've ever seen ... and yes, I've seen Pearl Harbor. Even Gina McKee couldn't get out of the frightening dialogue. It has been described as "art-house"; Why is it that when a film does not have a plot, critics feel that it deserves to be called art? But much more confused, why does America love it? Without you, this movie would stay on the shelf where it belonged.
