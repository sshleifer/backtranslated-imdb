A combat veteran, fresh from completing ninjutsu training, meets an old friend in Manila and gets into a power struggle with a reckless baron on the ground. Does it really matter? If you even read this page, you need to know something you can expect. It's your typical chop-sock, complete with absurd dialouge, mega-corny villains, apocalyptic sound adjustments, and a camera that asks for your attention. The only reason this movie is seen on this film is the battle sequences, beautifully choreographed by Mike Stone and true master Sho Kosugi. Franco Nero is not even tempted, provided you can see the mustache. Well, I'm too cruel. There are some good laughs - enjoy Christopher George repeatedly shouting "Ninja!" and bringing probably the strangest scene of death he ever captured on film.
