To put simple words or rather a word, PATHETIC !!!!!! The film is starting to attract little interest in conspiracy, but, but how few minutes away from the audience is still restless for toilets and getting snacks, or breathing fresh air outside the closed dark halls .... <br /> <br /> Looks like you watch a film from the 1960s when the colors were boring, driven by debutant and held by high school students! The film revolves around an American high-headed actress trying to return to movies by playing in one of the extraordinary Indian movies. Her acting is a real Sad compliment worse dialogue delivery. OverAll: I would not recommend to anyone to watch this movie Still want to watch: Then try to watch it at home when some TV channel is broadcasting it, believe me it would be fun because this movie would received unified advertising and no sponsors. <br /> <br /> And better to carry aspirin, u may need it if you can't find a remote control to change the channel! p.s. I have no idea if other reviewers even watched the movie? I did and wasted $ 10 on the ticket!
