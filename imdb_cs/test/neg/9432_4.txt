Beautiful semi-humorous tribute to expressionist black and white films by people like FW Murnau, Fritz Lang, Carl Dreyer, Marcel Carn√© and others. Allen plays a character caught in the Kafkaesque nightmare, first thinks he's part of a vigilant group trying to catch a killer and slowly realizing he might be a suspect. Writing is a bit forced (that's all, Woody Allen is trying to be Kafka's coy), but it's in place, and no shame. Cinematography is interesting, about 100 shades of gray, but make sure you watch in a very dark room with a good screen, or the details will be swallowed in the fog. This is a fun little movie with a few laughs that are actually snorts "uh-huh". The deal is fine with regard to a strange vehicle, and it's worth watching if you're a big Woody Allen fan. Also interesting is information on expressionist films. I would give it 6.5 out of 10.
