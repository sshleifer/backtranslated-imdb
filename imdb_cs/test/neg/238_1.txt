Terrible, confusing piece of crap from the south border. Now I watched it twice and I still don't know what's going on. It had something to do with a silly-looking Aztec mummy, a "human robot" who is the dumbest robot I've ever seen, and no woman who is a reincarnation of an ancient Aztec chick. Most of the story is told in a painfully slow and appalling way by an incredibly boring scientist. This guy's a great sleep. His nemesis is a fat fool called The Bat, a pretty unimaginable name for a bad scientist. I think a boring scientist and his wormy assistant dug a mummy and what shock a scientist's wife just becomes mom's reincarnation girlfriend. For some reason, they keep the mummy constantly in the mausoleum, I think the bad man can overdo it. It takes him five years to do it because he invents a "human robot" to steal a mummy, or attack it, or anything. It's a treasure that has a mummy to be rich. But excuse me if this guy had this huge intellect and a strong effort to succeed, why didn't he just patent some of his ideas and get rich? Well, I think it would make too much sense. Instead, there is a ridiculous fight between a mummy and a robot, and it is really hard to tell which one is a cheater looking or more cheesy. To tell you the truth, I watched it because I thought a movie called as Robot Vs. The Aztec mum just had to be wonderful kitschy. Instead, it was just scary horrible and the mind stunningly confusing.
