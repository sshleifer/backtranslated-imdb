The ruin is Turistas as Deep Impact was Armageddon, a worse version of the mildly entertaining movie, except much much worse. One of the characters is going to the medical school, so why are they all retarded? "You can't keep the cut." the most beautiful line of this movie. That's a horrible movie. I like horror movies, but I fully realize that most of them are horrible, but after seeing reviews on IMDb, there was some hope for this movie. The situation they are in is stupid, and the way they handle it makes them stupid. It's terrible, one thing that makes it somewhat tasty is its cool Australian backdrop, despite the fact that they spend most of the film in one place.
