Witchy Hildegard Knef grabs a group of people in an isolated hotel and pulls them one by one in ugly and outrageous directions. I thought I had seen it all until one unhappy man was crucified and then his head was set on fire. Hildy is also quite a joke: she takes annoying harpy and closes her mouth ... then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for the roar of fire! "Witchcraft" made me sick. It hurt me. I was ready to write it as the worst movie ever made by competent people ... until the final. I have to admit I loved the end. This is a boy and his toy tape recorder in the corner of Linda Blair looking fantastically obsessed. The scene only lasts about a minute and the movie is over, but you know the old saying: "If you have a great end, people will forgive you almost!"
