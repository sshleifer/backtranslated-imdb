For any moment, 4kids brings a new show to it's company. Over the past few years they have brought pure gold like Kirby: Right Back to Ya! or Mew Mew Power. But Recenetly, 4kids was gone. CatDog is one example. It is difficult to write a negative comment without the show overflowing, but in fact Weekenders is a clean garbage. It revolves around a group that has an active brain. But the catch is something he thinks is wrong. This may sound good on paper, but after watching it, you'll realize how far from the good of this show it is. Pizza Guy is a very stupid character. It is very dimensional, not really much for it. It is hyperactive, the end of the story. Although many feel that all the characters are rip off South Park, I think the opposite. Mechazawa from cromartie High-School is an interesting character and can make me laugh. Tino can't do either. The cast on the show is no better. Like Mom, Tina suffers from a lack of character. They just stick to one characteristic and that's it. The only redeeming quality is that the show can make you grimace. Whether it is a scene that can be funny or you can just sneer, because it's stupid. Thje Weekenders is a very miserable show from Disney / 4kids. Although it seems to love some fans, it should really be left to the kids.
