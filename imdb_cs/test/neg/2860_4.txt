The child's play has created a new horror genre, KILLER DOLLS, Some of these films don't have much money for it, but I think the only film that makes Chuck's shadow is this one. The video or directly on TV, but Pinocchio is not real and the killer is a little girl.Fantacie children are too big and this movie play with it.The roles are good and Candance McKenzie is great. <br /> <br />
