The only reason I haven't removed this movie after 20 minutes is that we've spent 20 minutes unnecessarily on it ... One and I repeat ONLY the effect they used is a strange capoera (from India ?) Jump to half a meter wall / bin, I think the effects don't make a movie, but ... sheesh .... me and my friend hoped the whole movie for some real effect (huge wolf?!!!>!?!) but noooooooooooooooo ... all we have is a jump! on the wall 0.5 meters + used a pharmacy ..... and found weapons?! in pharmacy ?! What the hell? Oh I forgot, there was another effect-contact spear like green eyes! every 10 minutes we shouted "the only thing that can save a movie of shame is a giant wolf who kills them all !!! except that the script was so terrible that you don't know who you'd like to die first. I mean PRAY!) that "good?" man dies, perhaps at the beginning. <br /> <br /> Do yourself a favor and send letters that will remove the film from every archive in the world.
