I was looking forward to this movie that I can't understand how I got into it. I'm afraid it's a really gaping festival - every patron in the cinema I attended was yawning and taking care of him often. It's a shame because it's a fantastic story - I'm willing to think it would be a better reading. Nor does it support a basic character that only shows teeth once - and that was due to the camera angle. As the story unfolds, it is easier to understand the main character's dilemmas. However, the tension and drama that could make this really best rated movie was totally spoiled by the tedious treatment. Dull as a half-baked document!
