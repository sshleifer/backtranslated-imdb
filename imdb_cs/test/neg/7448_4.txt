I was a huge fan of the original Robocop. But to say that I was disappointed with this first sequel, it would be an understatement. Problems are many. Glossy, although the movie may look like there are plenty of bloopers on the screen to see everyone, wires, cameramen, etc., something that I find totally unacceptable from someone from Irvin Kreshner's family tree. Robocop became a robot. There is no human spark in the emblem. Real disappointment when one thinks his "soul" has returned to the end of the first movie. Here, his attitude does not show any human side and is difficult to sympathize with. OK I know the Boddiker from the first movie was better than average, mainly thanks to the performance of Kurtwood Smith, but usually solid Tom Noonan creates a character you couldn't care about in one way or another. What happened to the old man? I appreciate that he didn't get where he was "nice", but changing his character is nothing less than courtesy. It is clear in the first film that he despises Dick Jone's tactics and attitude, and yet he is no better than Jones. It does not make any sense. Dr. Faxx is a bad replacement for the charismatic, if uncomfortable, resident genius of Bob Bob Morton. <br /> <br /> Action sequences store a sequence where Murphy is stuck. to the side of Caine's truck are harsh and ugly and repel rather than amuse. What's with the music score?. Don't tell me that Poledouris couldn't have done it simply because he was working on Total Recall at the time. The soundtrack of the series (TV or movie) is part of her personality. Part of his character. When you remove it, it will damage the familiarity of the characters we follow. So it's bad enough, but shame on Leonard Rosenman. His score here is clear, camp and downright cruel. The story has its moments to be fair. There is a lot of originality here. But it is trying too many new things to do with one movie. Hob is a well-executed villain and the only really dis likable "villian" on the move, Thumb Up Gabriel Damon there. The last showdown between Robocop and Robocop 2 is also fun. > <br /> But for the vast majority of his extended period, this is a serious disappointment.
