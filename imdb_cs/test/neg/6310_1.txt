I haven't seen this film in years, but the terrible "taste" of Quaid's performance still persists on my language. Some have commented as Quaid has Jerry Lee Lewis "to the tee" but the fact is he only seems to have the most extreme stage of Jerry in mind. No one is in this way all the time and the performance comes as hopelessly clown, reducing Lewis to a Buffoon cartoon. The bores of human life are lost in the ruins of an overly exaggerated one. The author of the book is based on (Nick Tosches) is a good writer who wrote several fine music bios (Especially I liked "Dino" on Dean Martin); in the books Toches gives us a full human being, both separately from "biz." Quaid's actions seem to suggest that Jerry never acted as a human being. If people were like that, no one would bother hanging around them. As cartoons go, it is slightly fun, but otherwise it is one of the most incredible, film-destroying shows I have had the "honor" of viewing. Grapes...
