Don't waste money or time. Terrible movie. Bad behavior, conspiracy everywhere. Really, really bad behavior. Man, this movie is just bad. I turned it off in 7 minutes. The scenario is bad, directing is bad, it seems to me that a group of high schools met to make a project for their drama class. Yes, it's so bad. The meeting is not convincing at all, I think I only saw it for 7 minutes. How this movie got on DVD is over. <br /> <br /> It should stay in the editing repository. I saw the cover and I thought it was pretty cool.
