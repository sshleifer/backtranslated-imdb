I remember seeing this movie when I had about 10, one of my friends had it. At that time it was just a movie as I was about 10ish and just thought it as another action movie. When I look back as a complete movie enthusiast it is quite a shocking bad movie. The one who made this movie, I'm sure he had a short Hollywood career. Although the main actor seems to have made several IMDb movies, even though I haven't seen any movie and I don't remember much. Anyway, just to say that this movie is really bad, it could be in every way. I'd like to see it again: oD
