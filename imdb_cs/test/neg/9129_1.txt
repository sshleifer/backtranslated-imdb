Dear Reader, Beware! This movie is not really a movie, though its creators have impertinence to say it that way. If you haven't been alerted to its content, here it is: the movie is simply a sequence of images that flow continuously and try to transmit a feeling, concept. They could therefore be called symbols. The paintings are accompanied by a soundtrack that also aims to create an atmosphere. However, the images the director has chosen can only transmit feelings to the American audience because they are in a staggering number of American icons. Although the film is intended to express the idea of ​​a "civilized struggle", it does not only do so because of general chaos, but also because it is too long and tedious, and I felt that many scenes should not do with "war" in any concept. In conclusion, I was very disappointed with a documentary that is not a documentary, a film that is not a film, something that has its only strength in the extraordinary use of image processing technology.
