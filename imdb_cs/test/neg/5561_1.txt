Another try, another girl. France may be doomed for not being able to produce a good horror movie. The smallest they could do was make a movie in the Broc√©liande forest, but the forest is false! He was shot near Paris! The subject is useless, the actors are really insignificant and the text wishes you to be deaf. Nothing could save him. Bad ... bone. I wasn't warned. I want my money back.
