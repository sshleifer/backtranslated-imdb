"RVAM" reputation preceded it. I first heard about it in one of those Medved-style films, "50 Worst Films at All" or "The Golden Award of Turkey" or something like that. Basically, every movie review said that this movie was so bad that it blew you out of your eyes to look at it. So when the Exposed Film Society finally got to show it, I was expecting what kind of renowned experience only a true film stink could provide. But "Robot" wasn't that bad. Oh, that's definitely "Z" through. Some voice dubbing (as is usually the case for K. Gordon Murray Imports) is severely kitschy, and the film itself appears to be structurally something of Frankenstein, because a huge piece of it seems to be footage from the previous "Aztec" with voice-over leading man. Dead Gift: Anytime the question "So what happened?" In the dialog box, he asks more than twice, looking at re-assembled shots with little regard for the consistency or momentum of the plot. In RVAM: "So what happened?" or "What happened next?" it is pronounced at least four times in the first hour. Even without design problems, the fence and dialogue don't translate well to an older American audience. For example, how a hero explains (and explains and explains) the back story. includes a note about Dr. Krupp, a "doctor who suddenly turned into a criminal criminal" and began to look for the treasure that the Aztec mummy protects. No background, no explanation, he just "suddenly changed evil". Obviously, it was aimed at a fairly non-discriminatory audience. But the clinic is "Robot", a supposed "showcase" of this movie. This robot is the worst special robotic effect because of "Undersea Kingdom" or even "Santa Claus Vs. Martians". Compared to this piece of junk, the Tin Man of the "Wizard Of Oz" looked like a Terminator chassis that followed Linda Connor through the T2 foundry. The Aztec's mother is well designed and executed; It is clearly undead, well-known to look like a mummy, and yet different from the collection of "Boris Karloff" bandage that most American audiences know. But the one who designed Robot in this sequel had no feeling for this concept ... nor any budget. They could at least give him some knees, for heaven. Moreover, the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds. (I saw crashes on junior playgrounds that are more convincing.) Then the film basically stops. It seems to be a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the film spends building the battle itself. Despite all these problems, the film is not terrible or incompetent Coleman Film Francis or Larry Buchanan's movie was. Compared to "Monster A-Go-Go" or "Attack of The Eye Creatures", "RVTAM" is like Coppola. It's just boring and boring and stupid. Actors are competent (in the B mode of the film) and reasonably photogenic; Dr. Krupp, in particular, seems to have a great time when he is looking and plotting and capers in his cloak and "Phantom Of the Opera" suit. I often took root for him, despite being a villain. Anyway, I've seen a lot, much worse. Give it to "Samson Vs The Upamp Women" under "interesting Mexican juvenile peculiarities".
