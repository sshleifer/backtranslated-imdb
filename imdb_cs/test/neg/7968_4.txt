Lina McLaidlaw is a bright, lonely young woman who has unexpectedly fallen in love with Johnnie Aysgarth, a highly qualified bachelor who has a penchant for losing money. They get married, but almost immediately Lina is exposed to Johnnie's dependence on lying, gambling and debt. Despite her shortcomings, she is unable to resist her enchanting way until she starts to suspect that she can be a murderous thought ... <br /> <br /> It's a good movie, well-made, with an attractive cast, a good script, and maybe the only one the farthest end in film history. Well, maybe it's too far, but not much. Lots of movies change the end of the book (Great Expectations, Glowing, etc.), but the last two scenes of this film not only can be terribly lame, but also make the whole previous story meaningless. The story is about a woman whose husband is driven by his greed and moral shortage - and what he knows about him - to kill her. It should end (as in the book of Francis Iles / Anthony Berkeley Before the Fact) when he tried to murder her. The reason is not that the studio forced Hitch to end the end, one of the first examples of the pious process of audience testing. Hitch was scary and did what he was told (it was just his third movie in Hollywood), knowing that if he played the game, sooner or later he would gain creative control over his films, as evidenced by his masterpieces of the 1950s. But that still leaves us with a turkey end. This is a great shame, because it is a really very good movie with an interesting theme - does anyone really know her husband or wife well? The screenplay is excellent, with many off-guard moments (like Lina's father dying and Johnnie assuming she is crying about it), the finely rated performance of Grant (who has never played a villain) and fine photography around the world. famous glass of milk. Fontaine won an Oscar for this performance, although I personally prefer her confusion and vulnerability in her earlier role as a sacrificial woman in Rebecca. I would like to rate this movie above, but I really can't forgive that ending; that is what happens when movies are made for money, not for love, which I think is curiously the theme of the movie itself. Look quickly at Hitchcock's portraits as a man who writes a letter.
