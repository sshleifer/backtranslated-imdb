Jack Lemmon was one of our great actors. His appearances in Days of Wine and Roses, The Apartment, Some Like It Hot, Missing (to name the first to come to mind) were all worthy of being nominated for Best Actor. His only win was to save the tiger and that's a shame. He gets melancholy to science, but never puts it in balance with the driver in his nature. He actually made a similar character much better at the end of his career in the one-note Glengarry Glen Ross. As for the film, the beautiful supportive work of Jack Gilford as a partner of Lemmon and Thayer David as an arson is nothing important, because the rest of the script is confused with the confusion of clich√© vignette, anxiety, neurotic nostalgia and nonsensical moralization. It is worth seeing once as a time capsule until 1970 in the Avildsen experimental direction.
