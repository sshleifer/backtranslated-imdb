Humor is a very individual thing, and viewers in the insightful look of The Wog Boy seemed to enjoy it more than I do. I found it to be an anachronistic matter, representing the old-fashioned racial humor of Australian cinema in the 1960s and 1970s. The boy meets a girl who never starts because of the lack of chemistry between Lucy Bell and Nick Giannopoulos when I found the laugh on the ground. If you want to spend on it, wait for it to be on video.
