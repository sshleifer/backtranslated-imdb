Legend says that at the 2001 gala premiere: Space Odyssey, about 20 minutes to the Rock Hudson movie, he shouted, "Would someone please tell me what the hell is that movie?" Well, I beat Rock about 19 minutes, 59 seconds. This film doesn't make any sense at all. Who were these people? Where were those people? What were the rules of the game called Quintet? Are there any rules for the Quintet? Were Robert Altman and his movie cohorts when they went? What did Paul Newman think when he signed up for it? Maybe ol 'Fast Eddie saw Zardoza and thought, "If Connery could get involved in a futuristic film that doesn't make sense, I do." Maybe good things are on the cutting room floor and incoherently. Also, do all the cast get on your individual funny hats? You've never seen such bizarre-looking hats in one place in your life. Quintet just confirms what I always thought: when Altman is good, he is excellent, but when he is bad, he does things like Quintet
