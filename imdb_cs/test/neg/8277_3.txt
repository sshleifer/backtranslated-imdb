This film was complete, slow, torturous. I'm not a fan of slasher movies, and preferring a classic horror movie, I don't have to be the best judge. Slasher fans can enjoy this as an early entry into the slasher genre. I'd really like the 90 minutes I spent watching. The only reasons to watch are 1) young Vanna White (in front of the Wheel of Fortune), who has about 3 minutes of total screen time. 2) The early role of queen Linnea Quigley (with nudity) and the legendary beauty of EJ Peaker as a school secretary who has added a bit of humor and sexual attraction. Otherwise, the 80-year-old group called Felony makes an appearance that is interesting but stretches too long. Just like the movie ..... I had to check how much time was left, and I couldn't wait to see a "graduate" make a better film.
