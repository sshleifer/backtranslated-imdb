This movie is the standard goofy fiction fiction of the 1950s. In his favor, the plot manages to pull an alien invasion without actually producing the alien himself. But now that strangers needed energy and could absorb it from sources like hydrogen bombs, why would they come to the ground? Why wouldn't they just throw it out of STAR!?!? The only credible reason for the presence of Kronos is a direct attack on Earth, not just the collection of energy. Nothing like that is even intimated; Kronos could have been built by a superior race, but its activities on Earth are the most primitive. The end that the Kronos scientist-hero plan is based on nothing but pseudo-scientific babble. This equals the "opposite polarity" of the gambit that has been used so much in bad scifi that it has become a joke in itself. Low and lo, this causes our unwanted visitor to release their collected energy. No one in power seems to care about the impact that the release of this great energy (which at the end of the film includes, among other things, the entire hydrogen bomb yield) will have its surroundings. And unfortunately, at the time the movie ends, there are suburbs of Los Angeles nearby. Oops!
