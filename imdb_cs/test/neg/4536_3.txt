Directed by the same Jin Ishimoto, who gave Neoedision and flixer.com (once a promising online movie community) temporarily out of service because of his directorial style and filming method on his next film GIRL'S BEST FRIEND. HOLE suffers from this "look at me, I'm a filmmaker" in the style of filming, which is almost standard in today's Hollywood, at the expense of content. WORLD truly begins with a unique concept, but this concept and the promise of glamorous content will soon destroy the directorial style of "Look at Me". There are some funny moments that still shine through pretense, but this is a painful short to watch. How sad it is that a new breed of "filmmakers" has decided not to be a servant of the story, but rather to seek a dominant position on and off the screen. Damn, they don't care if they get their studio shop, beach house and new car, content and presentations are secondary. The real sad part of this is Hollywood's "look at me" attitude so much that the whole aesthetic of the film changes. Rather than introducing the story in a straightforward way that builds the story first, today's directors gain "experimental", ie "Look at Me". It is me or I am the only one who was really built by Sena's opening minutes of SWORDFISH. The film continued to rise above Sena's directorial efforts to film "Look at Me". Unfortunately, this Ishimoto short film is not. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 reviews by Elec Tv.
