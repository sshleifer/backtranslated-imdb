The Mexican 'classic' was the third item in the Aztec Mummy series. As you will soon discover, this film is something other than classic, instead it is more a film that deliberately tries to carry you. Some scientists want to steal the Aztec treasure from the tomb, but guarding the tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial: Aztec's mother. Knowing he can't beat the mummy, he builds the robot and is very bad at it. We see Mr. Robot only in the last reel when he spins around and fights the Aztec mother. I've seen a lot of lousy science fiction movies, damn most Fi movies that I see are miserable, but this, for the duration of 64 Minuites, is the worst movie I've ever seen with Fubar, which comes in a while .... <br /> <br /> Don't waste your time.
