I'll start filming first. Take Abbott and Costello out of the cast and you have a badly colored film, a stiff cardboard from a casting department, a badly dubbed sound (especially during singing!) And an unpleasant dialogue (eg, listen to the line "Mr. Dinklepuss" advertising infinitum). Obviously, some studio hacks thought they could earn a "Mickey and Beanstalk" presentation at Disney's CLASSIC, but viewers might be more trustworthy than ever (unlikely) or stuck in a double function (more likely). Even children should feel offended by showing them this film. Full celluloid waste. Now, about Abbott and Costello. Bud Abbott has always played a straight man, and all the bills were the nicer guy in the set. On the radio, his character was usually a smooth quick speaker, and was especially entertaining when his speed caused him to flub his lines and smooth over the bugs. In movies, he still plays a straight man, but is a more con artist. Not that he was wrong about it, but Groucho Marx played that character to perfection. The real throughput of the duo is Lou Costello. He was funny again on the radio. He played a character that was a bit slower than Abbott, but not too slow! He was also glib with lines, and got me laughing when he would ad-lib to Abbott's mistakes. On the movie, I don't know if it was his decision or not, but in the movies his character becomes a poor personification of Stan Laurel, who in turn was even more delicately performed by Jerry Lewis. Why the change? he was entertaining on the radio when he was smart - but here he becomes a childlike figure who looks like he was throwing himself at the cameras in each shot. this characterization is shown in each film they make, and only brings a stain to the rumor they had on the radio. Their film career remains a poor (very, very poor) copy of Laurel and Hardy. Movies would be much more fun if they played their radio characters instead of repeating casting.
