Irwin Allen's first venture into all stellar spectacles was one stellar disaster. The story of mankind contains some of the most incredible casting decisions of all time. Virginia Mayo as Blond Cleopatra, Dennis Hopper chews the scenery with Napoleon, Peter Lorre eats on the scenery for several weeks as Nero, Marie Wilson as Marie Antoinette as the road show of Marilyn Monroe, these are just some of them. The film is also known to be the last film on which all three Marx brothers appeared, even though they all have different roles. Chico plays a monk who is a confidant of Christopher Columbus, Groucho euchres Indians from Manhattan Island as Peter Minuit, and the most stunning of all is Harpo Marx as Sir Isaac Newton, who is discovering gravity when an apple beats him on beans. Holding all these portraits is a story where humanity itself is judged. Super H Bomb is going to discover and release will do in the world's population. It's a judgment day that comes. But humanity has its advocates and critics. Speaking for criminal prosecution is Old Scratch, which brings the worst in man for centuries in the form of Vincent Price. But man also has a good side and who is better than Ronald Colman to show a man in the best civilized world. Colman and Price claim their case before a judge played by Cedric Hardwicke. <br /> <br /> In these three individuals, you have some of the best talking voices the English language has ever known. When the film is on them, because each of them exhibits exhibits for their case, it's a pleasure to listen. When you focus on individual stories, you want to scream in agony. Was it intentionally camping with some of these decisions? If it was satire, it just wouldn't fall out of the ground. That was Ronald Colman's farewell film. a man who could say better for civilization. So when you see the story of mankind, fast forward through some of the exhibits and treasure every moment when lawyers are before the judge.
