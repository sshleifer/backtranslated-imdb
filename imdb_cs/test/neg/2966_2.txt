No matter what you heard, "Fame" is not a good movie. It's not worth investing over two hours before looking at stereotypically concerned, dancing, singing, learning, and looking at girls in locker rooms. <br /> <br /> Every clich√© in this film finds a cozy little home. There's a gay teenager looking for admission. That would be great if it were considered to be something other than a secondary plot. Is there a ghetto boy who has too many attitudes - what was I surprised? And guess what? Everyone wants to become big stars, seek fame and wealth, and everyone would be willing to climb over their own chickens to get them. Strangely, this film is remembered for its music. But in fact, only a slightly good song is "Hot Lunch Jam," which is still too cheesy to be of any real quality. The two most popular songs are nothing. "Glory" is an insignificant fluff drowned by the mere spectacle of a massive dance scene in the streets. And "I Sing the Body Electric" (what in Bubba means it even means?!?!?!?!?) Is just an incomprehensible joke. Bad Play, Tasteless Dialogue and Hack Direction (After all, it is from director "Evity") only a duly ordinary cameraman Michael Seresin helped. But cinematography itself cannot carry a film, especially one that is missing and absurd.
