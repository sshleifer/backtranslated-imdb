(May contain spoilers) This movie is the epitome of strangeness. I rented it and hoped it would be such a bad movie. However, I can still honestly decide if this movie was supposed to be scary or funny. It combines emotions in a rather disturbing way. Apparently it's trying to be clever, but it's not really like that. For example, when a knife comes out and tries to kill a teacher, happy music starts playing. When we go to Toxica, we have an up-beat, quasi-pan. Roger's Neighborhood Music. However, when a small child dreams of falling into "blood" and when he finds a leg, they are clearly intended to be tense. Watch this movie and decide for yourself. It's too strange to be described by words and I say, kudos. <br /> <br /> "Nose-dive ... WOW!"
