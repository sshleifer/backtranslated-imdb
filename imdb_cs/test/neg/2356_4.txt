Saboteur was one of the few Hitchcocks I haven't found yet, and I was less than half stunned. The French title "La Cinqui√®me colonne" (ie the fifth column, a very evocative phrase for underground spy and sabotage organizations) set my expectations fairly high, as did the finale images atop the Statue of Liberty. Basically the Saboteur is as light as 39 steps (note that this is another evocative phrase, even McGuffin as a title), but lacks most of the humor (so the characters are on the ground) and it's definitely not the same fast. As a film of persecution across the US from LA to NY, Saboteur pulls the legs out of sequence to order. Succession on a beautiful ranch? A beautiful ranch, a beautiful villain, but generally tame, it really does not add anything to anything. Meeting the blind, mixing with Circus, Soda City sequence, NY ball sequence? They fall flat, bringing more characters with very little added voltage value. One big problem I can point out is the relationship between leading Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane, who is not building as with Robert Donat. and Madeleine Caroll in 39 steps. Therefore, the entire narrative structure is floating depending on the addition of new scenes. And the new scenes bring us closer to the end because it is unclear whether the hook is the hero's escape from the police, the bad guys or his actions to stop the drawn sabotage. In 39 steps it was clearly written as 1 / police escape (so you know that a hero can't just go to the police), then 2 / run for his life and after the villains prove their innocence. <br /> <br /> If you want better Hitchcock from the 1940s war propaganda, I suggest you choose a foreign correspondent over Saboteur. They're both chasing movies with a catchy final but really one of them clenched and not just sightseeing in foreign correspondents, as well as beautifully effective scenes (umbrella crowd, tulip field, strange mills ...).
