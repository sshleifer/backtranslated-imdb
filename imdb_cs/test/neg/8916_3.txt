I love his martial arts style, it's fast, close and oh so fast, but his movies seem to be becoming more and more criminal based on lifestyle quality and less meaning ... a deeper message. At least some of the movies had a hidden meaning or agenda that had some good redeeming features of the character, but the rest was so far away. I was very disappointed. Martial arts also suffer. I hope to see more of Segal in his future films. This movie also lacks storyline storyline, there are too many gaps, so the idea is lost. Too many things are mysterious without a solution.
