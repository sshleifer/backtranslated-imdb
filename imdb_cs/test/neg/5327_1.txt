I thought I saw the movie before the summary story sounded familiar. But when I watched it one afternoon (I needed some carefree but fun fun), I didn't know anything - if I had seen it before, I had to block the horror from memory. This movie is terrible and shows its age. In fact, it looks older than that: more than half-80s of moronic comedy. Even though I am a fan of toilet humor and see the funny side of many things, it is a "comedy" that is most puerile and homophobic. The story is as thin as a supermodel who wouldn't bother me if only the movie was fun. There's only one fun line in the movie, spoken by Louise: "Looks like someone threw a perfectly good white boy!" In fact, Louis is the only likable character (and doesn't say that much). James and Carl are the type of irritating, immature men a reasonable woman would have missed a mile from, their practical jokes about as humorous as the war in Iraq; Susan Wilkins's character is colorless (looks like Julia Roberts, but she doesn't have her charisma) and there is zero chemistry between her and Carl - though it may be unfair to blame an actress because I don't know what she could do with such a badly written part; and the villain is neither funny nor frightening or unforgettable. There is good waste and bad waste. This is a waste that should definitely not be recycled.
