I have an affection for these twists on British social norms, and it's rare to lose me. But Our Better lost me a little. It's a story of social climbers and their joy in breaking the rules, but I personally found it a little boring. I liked the Duchess, though she whimpered a little too much, and Constance Bennett played the role of Lady Greyston to play Bette Davis. The movie comes to life in the third act when Ernest joins the party. He is so lively and entertaining (and in fact probably wears more makeup than Lady Greyston). He gets the last line of the movie and it's gas!
