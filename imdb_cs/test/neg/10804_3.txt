Soultaker was written and played by Vivian Schilling. He also played as Joe Estevez, Gregg Thomsen and Robert D'Zar as the Angel of Death. The story begins with an introduction to Soultaker, played by Joe Estevez. You will quickly learn what will be the role of Soultaker in this film. Subsequently, young people at university age prepare for a summer festival, appropriately named "Summerfest". In this film, the Battle of the Classes is ubiquitous throughout the film. Girls come from a rich class and boys come from middle or lower class. Classroom roles seem to play a role in the film for some reason that is not really clear or suitable for the story. At Summerfest you will learn more about the seeming class struggles, why Zach is not encouraged to date by Natalie. Soultaker also performs, apparently his boss, Angel of Death. Here, D'Zar's character points to who should die and to whom souls are to be covered. It is also revealed that Soultaker will have a character conflict over Natalie, and how he will deal with it for something in his past. Meanwhile, Natalie is dug by her ride on Summerfest and Zach convinces her to go with them. During the journey home, Soultaker takes an active role causing them to wreck terribly at high speeds. The rest of the story is surrounded by Soultaker collecting the souls of dead travelers, and Zach and Natalie try to outsmart themselves to return to their bodies so that they can continue to live. Conflicts between class and character were in the story, but they are never never brought to the fore or resolved. There's an ending attempt to get some drama out, there's a lot of chase and run that tend to be really boring. It is not really acceptable, and it would be nice if it were dealt with differently, in some way the drama could be increased, but it hated the audience. The story and acting are decent. The soundtrack is fine, and even the production values ​​are good. Robert D'Zar has a good work as an Angel of Death in his short screen performance. Joe Estevez is fine, but sometimes his role is a little flat. Vivian is pretty and does a decent job like Natalie, though maybe in a bit of a scene she does a little more. That may sound strange, but this movie could certainly benefit from some nonsense nudity. Vivian is a bit irritating, but that wasn't enough. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, this was a pretty serious attempt to make a film. The results are worth watching. Don't expect perfect production. <br /> <br /> 3/10
