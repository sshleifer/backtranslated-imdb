This film took three hours, including commercials, to London's International History Channel. But it was like three weeks. It was not a cheap, motionless and unintentionally witty depiction of the bombing of Dresden. It was not that the film got rid of almost all the connections related to World War II. Nor was it that the bombing itself was often regarded as nothing more than a great inconvenience for a goofy love story. No, it was a wooden, insignificant characteristic that pushed life out of the story. Oh, and the fact that if it is possible for the film to be obedient then Dresden is the movie. Perhaps a better title would be DRESDEN - AS URIAH HEEP SHOULD HAVE EXPERIENCED. It's just the second point that makes it so irritating. Was the bombing of Dresden a war crime? The creators of this film believe it. But in the typical emulated way in which the Germans came close to World War II, they cannot bring themselves to say it without saying "peace" and "no more war - wherever" as though it were Mother Teresa. And also typical German obedience to the British, it is a clumsy effort to pamper yourself before "Britnost" while loading all "blame" for Dresden on one person, Arthur Harris. <br /> <br /> Did I say one person? Well, not quite. At the beginning of the film is the scream of the leading figure of Anne with whom we all sympathize. "Bloody Americans!" She shouted as they watched the bombs fall. A few minutes later, a vocal tone sounds, alerting the Germans to the "American terror bombing". Notice the word "terror". I have it? It's really Americans for the inhuman targeting of German civilians. Despite the fact that the American strategy for almost the entire war in Europe was "precise" bombing of industrial and war production sites. Despite the fact that it was the British who enthusiastically accepted the "regional" bombing of civilian targets in Germany - before the Germans themselves targeted English. Despite the bombing of the Americans during the day, they suffered more casualties in the process than the British, in order to hit precise targets while the British bombed civilians under night cover. Despite the fact that the Americans were basically brought to the real RAF terrorist bombing campaign, which threw it and screamed. Regardless, most US officials, from FDR to gene. Dolittle, opposed the targeting of civilians, while Churchill and his generals could not wait to do so. No, in DRESDEN, the Germans and the British, with the exception of Harris's "bomber", are innocent doctrines, intimate, created by evil Americans. And only the power and strength of a love story between a German sister and a downed British bomber pilot can explain enough the "truth" of atrocity. Correctly. By the way, for younger and probably less readers of IMDb readers, the first and so far only major literary effort to reflect thoughtfully on the Dresden bombing was the pacifist novel. wrote Kurt Vonnegut - American prisoner in Dresden at the time of bombing. I think the German ZDF couldn't find Billy Pilgrim.
