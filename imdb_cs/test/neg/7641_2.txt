... I'm leaving with a little choice to use it at least once during my Respiro review. What, among other things, defines prejudice is the lack of emotional honesty on the part of the author. Respiro seems to be artistic, symbolic, spiritual, provocative, metaphorical ... mythical, even even with an over-inventive and confident intent. Fortunately, for all true artists out there, there is no predetermined formula to achieve artistic beauty and depth. Stunning natural locations (yes, these remote parts of southern Italy look exotic to most other Italians), pretty actors and some fun, dreary, spontaneous performances by a handful of attractive kids will not raise an incredible film for a nice series of paintings. Yet this insincere and futile and ultimately hollow film pain is an art to succeed only to a very limited extent, perhaps in some cases by chance. I admit that the conceptually pompous end has some visual poetry for him. However, I believe that this has been achieved in ways that have more to do with the beauty of Lampedusa and the strong symbolic power of bathing and water (associated with so many mythical, mystical, religious, archetypic, etc.) than with Crial's talent. Valeria Golino is gratefully historical and influenced by her performance as Grazia. For a mentally unstable woman from a humble and provincial environment, she certainly has a fashionable wardrobe. Her flattering, floating floral dress and attractive, sun-kissed beach hair could decorate the pages of any Vogue edition. The fact that it was a "nutcase" could be a way that was just a fashion accessory to her fashion behavior and appearance - that is how skin-deep seems "my condition" to me. Golin's two-dimensional stereotype of the innocent, natural child-women misunderstood and oppressed by her backward community was tedious and irritating in the worse, while letting me motionless and indifferent at best at best. I agree with a London reviewer who wrote that mental illness is very poorly served in the cinema - we have never had the feeling of Grazie's disease throughout the film, and we have no idea what's wrong with her (except her being) the "free spirit" stereotype. We do not know why an injection is being given and is required to visit a specialist in Milan. This general way of writing mental illness is one of the main narratives of the overall film shallowness. Another rather offensive aspect of Respiro is the apparent representation of his position. I tried to find out whether this film should be set in the present or in the past, when it saw that it was intended that even the supposedly backward part of Italy (compared to it) would seem ten times finer and more primitive than it really is . Again, it slapped the shallowness and the complete lack of honesty on Crialese is part. Some non-Italian viewers will cheerfully slow down the picturesque backwardness, cliché of an obedient, macho Italian man as if it were a common place. The question I would like to ask David Ferguson, a reviewer from Dallas, Texas is as follows: is your country mentality stuck in the 1950s? No? OK, so why should it be mine?). Unfortunately, for anyone who wants to explore Italy in such an anachronistic way, this aspect of Respira is actually ridiculous and false even in the eyes of this Italian viewer. The gentle incestuous tension between Grazia and her eldest son was as tedious and predictable as the routine of a sexist but loving husband, Fabrizio Bentivoglio. In particular, I disgusted the scene in which Grazia joins her husband and friend in a joke over a bottle of beer, the macho embarrassment, and her husband's resentment. According to this film, there is no place for women to attend male interviews. Oh, but our "loving" free spirit is too good for this place and doesn't understand the repressive, unwritten rules of Lampedusan's patriarchy! Not only does this scene capture something so false that it should suffice in itself to discredit the whole film. It also fully gets the wrong end of the culture wand that seeks to depict, clearly showing that it was written without a clear understanding of the location or its population. I would like to invite anyone who knows contemporary Italy to say something else. <br /> <br /> For a truly perfect contemporary Italian filmmaker who, in my opinion, deserves to be ranked among the magnificent famous Italian film past (which is unfortunately not looking for anything but Gianni Amelio - especially Lamerica, Così Ridevano and his last, La Stella Che Non C'è Unlike most contemporary Italian cinemas, unfortunately derived and stagnant, Amelio is a fresh and independent creative voice, and despite my horrific Respiro review, I am now more than willing to believe that the latest Nuovomondo, which now appears in Italian That is why I am looking forward to enjoy it, even if it is not too shocking for me if I am not (considering my feelings for Respiro!).
