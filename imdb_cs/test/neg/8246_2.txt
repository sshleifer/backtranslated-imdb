This movie is so predictable when you know the modern American dream: Do nothing, be defeated and then suddenly ... whoah! You are a genius and an unpleasant person, and the world kisses the land you go to. And surprisingly, all other intelligent people are defeated. They know nothing and are bitter when our wonderkid solves problems so easily. And what problems? They are so difficult, but these professors can analyze the results in less than 10 seconds. Every movie has something good about it and Robin Williams is in this.
