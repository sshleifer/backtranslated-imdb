Seriously, all of these Satan comes to earth movies that always include Catholics. Why Lucifer never deals with other denominations. The reason is that Asmodeus (played by former Jason Vorhees Kane Hodder) has a plot to become a man (but it wasn't always a demon) to get this young girl who is his sister pregnant with her baby. Except it's not his sister. The story is not clear, and they intersect between these scenes where they see a reduction in their problem. The leading girl gets pregnant when she is still a virgin, with her incredibly terrible scene her father has a gynecological examination showing that her hymen is still intact .... Eeeewwwwww. Her sister (played washed and looked much worse on Denise Crosby's clothes) concludes that this is a sign from heaven. Praise! Well, a demon child takes his mother's body for a fun ride and marries a truck driver, a friend of a friend and her boyfriend, all watched by a former military priest whose mission is to kill a child when born. We find that Asmodeus is actually a Catholic cardinal who leads the whole thing. The end is largely incomprehensible and if you could do so far, you have a stronger stomach than I do. . (I stopped the movie a few times, it was so bad.)
