I usually love these movies. Give me a good old B movie every day, but this was just awful. Acting (?) It was terrible to almost the point where I turned the film off completely. I thought I saw the worst all the time, but this is right there with the attack of tomato killers! In all honesty - it was playing that made this movie for me. I found out that the actor is clumsy and the leading man / woman was very boring. This film had nothing for him. Maybe I'm asking a ridiculous question, but why nudity and sex scene? Did the producers believe that no one would have seen them if they had abandoned them? I think they were right! Where is the price and Tingler when you need them?
