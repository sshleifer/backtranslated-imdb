So boring you'll sleep after 20 minutes. Excuse me, Mr. Boutonnat, I admire your work (all these beautiful "movies" you have directed as "Tristan", "Sans logique", etc.), But here is a conspiracy ... vain! In addition to the spectacular photography, everything seems silly and there is no envy to know what happens to these "middle" actors. Moreover, the dialogues are minimalist. The famous question "where are the children" is repeated so often that it looks like a farce. Believe me, it's a pure waste of time (conspiracy) and 3 hours is a long time. The real reason for this cashier is certainly a mess!
