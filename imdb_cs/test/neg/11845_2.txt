The biggest and most disturbing things about Raptor ended because Tyransaurus is the same as Carnosaur, except that the child in the loader was a little better off and acted then. The similarity to the Carnosaur films was a rather poor choice in the plot line. The only thing that was nearing good was the beginning with the children in the jeep. Then a conspiracy fell from there. It would be nice if a different chart were created than the cloning of earlier films. The predator movie should be instructed from a range of Jurasic parks on various lands. The only film that came close to a good dinosaur movie is Aztec Rex. Repeated scenes, as if they were taken from Carnosaur movies, leave a person who thinks about these films.
