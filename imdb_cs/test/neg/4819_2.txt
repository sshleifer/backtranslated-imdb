New Orleans is nothing like it is shown in this film debacle. Quaid's attempt to speak with cajun <br /> <br /> accent (by the way, hardly anyone speaks this way in New Orleans) is terrible. Plot = elementary and mindless. This picture refers to herself as a mystery, but the mystery involves a gradual process in which the viewer gets clues and twists during the movie. None of this is here. "Easy" is trying to get stereotypes on the New Orleans trite. Don't be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the city <br /> <br /> that Quaid & Barkin bumble your way through.
