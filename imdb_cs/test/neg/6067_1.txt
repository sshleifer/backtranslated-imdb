From Kreestos: <br /> <br /> Dialogue is terrible, terrible, drivel. He was wrong. Many conspiracy flaws. I do not recommend this at all. Wikipedia: <br /> <br /> Artistic Licenses The score handwriting is attributed to two copiers [1], both of which were men. , not females, as shown in the movie. <br /> <br /> The copiers did not contribute or change the score. In fact, they were enthusiastic about Beethoven for any deviation that occurred from the original score. The film is set in 1824 during the composition of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Beethoven's film shows to be deaf, but quite capable of understanding people who speak loudly. In fact, Beethoven lost much of his hearing seven years earlier (1817). Beethoven has never experienced permanent deafness; his condition fluctuated between total silence and terrible tinnitus. The Ninth Symphony was composed when Beethoven's hearing deteriorated significantly. At this point in his life, most Beethoven interviews were facilitated by the use of laptops. It can be argued, however, that he was also able to read the lips of people, evidenced by his insistence that people face him when they talked to him. In the movie, Beethoven makes an allusion to Moonlight Sonata. This is an anachronism like Sonata no. 14 "quasi una fantasia" was not named "Moonlight" until several years after his death.
