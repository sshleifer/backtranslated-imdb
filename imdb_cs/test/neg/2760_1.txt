I was forced to read this adorable "love story" between a German 24-year-old prisoner and a 12-year-old Jew. It has "political correctness" written everywhere. It's something like "SPIRIT" in which a horse wants to be free, but those "bad" Americans won't let him because they need him. I have good news that the Americans are "evil" in a German soldier and his summer book. Why!!! The horses that the gods gave us, and if the Americans needed horses, could use it well. In the same sense, the Germans tried to kill Americans, but this book / film looks good! Casting is absolutely terrible !!!!!!!!!!!! The girl's Hispanic mother's white daddy has bubbled out of predominantly white origin and the nurse's "shirley templish." Playing is also bad enough, the serious part becomes a comedy! Concluson-Bad movie, bad book, but both have different endings, don't read or see one!
