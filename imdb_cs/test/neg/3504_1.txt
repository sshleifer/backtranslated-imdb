I wrote it as a two-part review. The second part has spoilers. Part 1: <br /> <br /> No, this is not about car crash. This is about racism in L.A. You know, the one where everyone is racist, and the race is the theme of every one of us. Race. It's like a movie that has a turret syndrome where the race is a constant theme. Race. Racist. Racism. Relationships with races. Relay race. Paul Haggis made a film that took the structure of Magnolia, which was used to show the disconnection of people who are tangentially connected, and then screwed it into the 1'53 "mental vomit of racism in America. for hours we have parallel 7 stories that are connected and about the race, the first hour, people say ridiculous things and make absurd things in an effort to be a true racism in America. <br /> <br /> the first half of their story is rich directly from The Bonnie Situation in Pulp Fiction RACISM, their section is Quentin Tarantino, where, Instead of being cold and talking about foot and religion massages, the characters talk about race and racism. Another good thing about this is a Mexican story when a Mexican guy talks to his daughter, giving her his invisible impenetrable cloak to protect her Decent writing, but that's just because the writers had daughters and knew what they were saying in his place. The rest of the stories are extremely ridiculous. Hindi does not act in any semblance of realism. The scene in which he tries to get a lock and a Mexican tells him he needs a new door is short and stupid. Why would someone do that like that? Is it realistic? NOOO. It reminds me more of the Doom Generation store salesman. "Six dollars sixty-six cents girly." If I ever watched the other half of the movie, I hope his head is shot and his bodiless head starts to cough up. I didn't mention the paragraph above the race. RACE. RACISM. SUN SITE. Better. Then there is a black man who wants to be white, Matt Dillon, who has a black background chip on his shoulder, Ryan Phillippe, who looks beautiful and does nothing, and various other bad actors who are wrong with bad dialogue. When Matt Dillon harasses a black wife, could I help her if I recovered? When Philippe second is arguing about his writing his racism partner, can I help you but break it? The film is so funny when it's racist. Racist. RACIST: I'll tell you. Now, remember, this movie was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Cut, except for a nod to Matt Dillon, who actually tried to do a decent job. Who was paid for not knowing. I don't see it if you don't want to be preached about racism in society through a bad and unrealistic scenario from two white men over fifty. who have no form with reality or interaction with a real society in any way in form or form. Part 2: <br /> <br /> The second half of Crash takes all the first stories in the first half ... and throws them back in some sort of redeeming, Conclusion, the world is a great coincidence. And in fact, it's one of the worst ways to do it. Take Magnolia from 1999. People weren't comfortable tied up over and over again. They were connected in a special way that happens more often than you think. You know someone who knows someone who did something you knew someone else was involved in. Is there only 5 on LAPD strength? Don't these people work strange shifts? Dillon and Philippe were late shifts and then soon the next day? And why does Tate have to be a murdered hitchhiker? Wouldn't that be more emotional tension and realism if it was someone we haven't been watching all day? Just like Phillippe, he just picks up a random hitchhiker and then gets scared. Everyone would be frightened. Finally, in the second half, the untouchable cloak that touches is used to make Hindi shoot a daughter. She tickled me and felt dirty. Not that Hindi's daughter was shot, but they created a beautiful moving scene and then it was the direct cause of people tearing. It really tickled me. For writers, not a scene. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is fake and totally unsolicited. Accidents are too much and require extreme suspension of mistrust. Unlike the Magnolia, which was slightly interconnected, it had links on connections on the lines that were just as high. The only good part in the second half was when Sandra Bullock fell down the stairs. He won't die. She should have. When I fell, I made fun. <br /> <br /> The worst part of the movie is pulling a magnolia. Not only in the structure, but has the assembly through the song In the Deep, where you can see that everyone is depressed. Magnolia took this and had a post-modern commentary on it by having all the characters sing along to Aimee Mann's wise up. Unfortunately, Magnolia came out in 1999, while Crash came out in 2005. Its hard to comment on the movie, which won't be done for another 6 years, but it happened. Somehow. Loss of my time. <br /> <br /> First half: D-; Second half: lowest level ever; Overall: F ---
