I've never seen so many talents and money that I've made something so bad in my whole life! As stated in other comments, who is who of talent, such as Christopher Plummer, Faye Dunaway, Donald Sutherland and many others, has been thrown into a movie that is not recognizable as the story of Agatha Christie. I'm still thinking about how it could be with the same cast, did the right way. The film has even less intimacy than the films of Christopher Reeves Superman. The big cast makes spectacular production even less effective than in these films because there is not enough time to get to know anyone. Progressive jazz soundtrack Dave Brubeck wondered if there was a bad video in this video store video. Music became more and more offensive as the storyline continued. It's hard to tell whether the soundtrack or annoying technique of repeating information from earlier scenes was more offensive. Someone who has seen most of Christie's movies (that's what attracted me to it, it was one of the few I didn't see) missed this. It's not Agatha Christie's movie. Golan-Globus is more suited to producing films about a big time match than the cozy atmosphere of English mystery.
