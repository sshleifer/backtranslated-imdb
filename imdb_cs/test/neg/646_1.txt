I was thinking of this movie when I was looking at pluto nash ... why ... because both movies have a rand quaid playing a retarded robot, this movie did years earlier, but probably written by a writer who drank the same biotoxic coffee or something. ..Whoa ... Avoid all the costs, even though I pay tribute to the last big Andy Kaufman, it's hard to do it here ... to find another movie or just watch taxi blows on the latenight tv ... his character lath gravas is much more loving ... TANK YOU BERRY MUCH
