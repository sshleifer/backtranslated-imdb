I was really excited to see "Cold Mountain". Unfortunately, like most movies I'm really excited to see it was disappointed! If it wasn't for this miraculous invention called DVD, I think I'd put my head over the monitor, I was so bored! <br /> <br /> When I met because their characters are supposedly "determined" for themselves. But the Law's face showed something other than stupid love. Zellweger's character is pure grandmother Clampett (as if we didn't get her, the maize banjos marks her as every entry), and so up there was everything I couldn't laugh at! Ironically, her performances point to the stiff lines that are stiff. we never know why. The more confused is why none of them remained that Ada and her father were unusually good, and (as seen on one scene) it was a very dangerous period for the blacks (as they are politely called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to breastfeed milk or grow crops? Hell, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And for all Ruby's practicalities, when he sends Ad's "bad" cock, this kind of kiboš has other chickens on them! At a time when her beloved is finally coming back, Ada doesn't need him or anyone else - that's a big joke! Indeed, she may be physically intimate with Inman, but her real intimacy is with Ruby, who has turned Ada into an Über-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else go down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in the pod when they left Inman behind? Bush's film. Inman tells us that he is "like every fool sent to fight the flag and lies," and Ada's father says, "I think God is tired of being called on both sides of the argument." These "observations" are historically inaccurate and offensive. While slavery was the foundation of the southern economy, the reasons for the war were more complex. It was incomprehensible to the soldier when he thought the cause was "lie" (in fact, most of them were indifferent). For filmmakers to impress their views on a period when such views were alien to those who lived at that time is beyond the unpleasant. Structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. Law and Kidman are wrong and have zero chemistry! The scenario is a little more than a half-baked dialogue and an incredible bundle of clichés and banals. "Little moments like a bag of diamonds?" Ugh!
