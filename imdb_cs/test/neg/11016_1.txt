I'm glad I didn't pay to see "The Wog Boy". I sat there and hopefully waiting for something original and / or funny. It recalled I am a lot of those predictable English 1970s comedies. <br /> <br /> I will not bother with the synopsis plot, I suggest you do something else for 90 minutes <br /> <br />
