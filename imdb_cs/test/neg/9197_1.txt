I'm sorry, maybe it's part of the wave of praise for firefighters since 911, maybe it's an old-fashioned story, maybe it doesn't want to knock on socks, but I'm sorry, this movie is terrible. As in the title, cliché 49, I think it has at least so much cliché. It's a bleak story (an impressive way to behave when dangerous fires and lives are rescued) about firefighters. And his bleak life, he said in a senseless, 'scene from now' flashback to the past style. We start a movie with a hero in danger in a collapsing burning building. The whole film is about trying to get us to love this guy, so a few tears disappear when he meets his end in the final of the scene from the beginning of the movie. It was hard to take care of it and wished he had smoked before. Clichés are abundant as - the death of a best friend, love in the first place, overloading in a new job, the first-born, caring wife with a husband with a dangerous job, father a boss / superior character, 2.4 children (well 2, but pretty close) life save others, awards for bravery .... he and he. It's every firefighter's life, every policeman, nurse, doctor somehow. It was lazy if it meant "life flashing in front of his eyes" when he died, then God helps the poor boy, I'm surprised he didn't feel more smoke to go faster. Flashbacks are mostly mundane and predictable, they acted terribly and with the soundtrack that could give Laughing Cow the store, it was so shabby that it sounded like muzak or copyright without a lift !!! To avoid at all costs if you need to watch something with your grandmother on Sunday night. Or maybe if your relationship to firefighters - warning - your life ends terribly, or if you revelation for a lifetime if you are a brave firefighter by this movie. If your John Travolta (Special Hair Style Velcro in this!)
