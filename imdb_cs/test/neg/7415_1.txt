I think it's one of my ten worst movies I've ever seen! It disappears every two minutes. If it was on TV, they should have a preview every 2-3 minutes. But it is obvious that I personally enjoyed: which is when a blonde goes to bathe in a pit of boiling water with a man and you will see her whole body without a towel for about 10 seconds! That was the best scene in the whole movie because you see sasquatch on them, but the last 10 minutes is when we see his whole body. In addition, most deaths are off the screen and only shouting or roaring. And I expected Sasquatch to die. But he doesn't shoot him and only 4 or 5 people die in the whole movie, which I expected 8-10 people to die. Don't watch this movie. I give him F-. Don't waste your time.
