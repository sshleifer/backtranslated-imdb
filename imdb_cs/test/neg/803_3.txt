Without being the worst sci-fi movie ever made, or the worst thing I've ever seen, "time under fire" is still below average. Spaces and the first 10-15 minutes are not that bad, starting as the X-Files story, combining the mysteries of the Bermuda Triangle with time travel. Quite early elements of other genres (too much) are mixed together, but the story never exits the level of interest of the television series. Soon, 'Time Under Fire' quickly degenerates into a series of clich√©s, not just blending together too many genres but also being unable to create something unforgettable in tension or special effects that would help viewers remember the film until tomorrow. Negotiations are bad and the rhetorical lines in the script do not help at all.
