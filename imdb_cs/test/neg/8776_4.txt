I loved this movie when it came out for the first time (but I was only 12 years old - and I forgot that the movie existed one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station. I bought it and couldn't wait to watch this movie , which I loved as a child, and then when I saw this movie many years later, it struck me .... Why did I like this movie as a child in the world, watching it again as an adult I realized that this movie it's horrible, the saddest part of this movie is that they have everything in their power to make the greatest Western and throw it out !!! It's amazing and keeps the classic old-time spirit of Lone Ranger alive, second score is a series of songs country music artest like Merle Haggerd, and The Statler Brothers and those songs like "The Man in the Mask" are so bad that they are funny.This strongest point is that he had Brilliant Storyline, and one of the best West ern conspiracies ever,and for a while his fun to watch as John Reid is being treated back to health, after he and his fellow Rangers are ambushed.His joy to see him grow into his new life and identity as a lone Ranger, as he meets his identity, and goes on revenge to make the gang responsible for killing his brother and all his fellow rangers with whom he went. But unfortunately, as well as the story, it's all destroyed by Merle Haggard. The story of everything you watch is happening (for God's love, why did they do it?) Between Merle Haggard's Narration and The Statler Brothers singing corny songs like "Ride little cowboy" "who play in the background does not allow this film to be taken seriously. I'd like to see a really good producer to take the same script and story and make this movie right again, because there's a great Western in the heart of this stupid movie. ugliest clothes. I give him 4 stars out of 10 - if you are 12 years old and you don't know better, then you might love it.
