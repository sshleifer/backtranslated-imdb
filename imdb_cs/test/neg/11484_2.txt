When I first saw the movie trailer, I wanted to see it. I thought some other directorial work was pretty good, but I have to say I was disappointed. The plot includes a young woman who lives with a widowed father and two of his two sons. They move to a well-guarded community, but everything is not as it seems; a kind of Twin Peaks. The woman begins to see or does not see things that people. During the first winch I had a hypothesis and thought, "This can't be the whole reason?" Well, the end lived, or better DOWN, and gave us what I felt was a really weak final act. Sound mixing and quality is excellent. I saw it at the THX Certified Theater and was impressed by the sound and sound. The picture lacks substance.
