Somehow, this movie shows 6.2 stars, the director seems to have many relationships. I'm embarrassed to explain. <br /> <br /> Avoid this movie at all costs. You have only a certain number of hours on Earth, do not waste 1 & 1/2 of them on this retarded Guana smoking heap! There is no story about how the director would "write" (and I guess with a blunt orange crayon) the next day's script at the end of the daily shoot. The "story" was called whimsical, it is not aimless, it is perhaps enough "story" to fill the ad. Do you hate ads? Now that both leaders can act, they obviously decided not to be here. And likewise, a writer / director can actually write and direct, as illustrated by his other work "Toy Love". avoid. To paraphrase Monty Python's search for the Holy Grail, "Run Escape!"
