"Oh, you're such pilots." "They don't call it a cockpit for nothing, baby." Dialogue like this is just one of many reasons why Concorde? '79 Airport (or, if you saw it in the UK, where it was pulled back by its heels to be released, '80: The Concorde Airport) was the last and by far the smallest of the series. The catastrophe movie was in horrible straits in the late 70s, which with swarm offered a lot of unintentional revelry and Beyond the Poseidon adventure when time ran out and the city on fire just offered a lot of boredom, and despair to find a new spin on the genre is too obvious here. This time it's a conspiracy plot, with Susan Blakely's anchor news discovering a billionaire friend Robert Wagner selling weapons to terrorists and northern Vietnamese. Naturally, he decides to tell him everything, rather than publish the story, but he blows it out by explaining, "I'm a very rich man. I have everything I could have in my life. so incredibly stupid? "In case he doesn't buy this line instead of, say, hires a man to kill him on the ground, he decides to do things in a clever way by planning to destroy Concorde when he flies to Moscow via Paris." the things I was ashamed of, but I'm not a murderer, "he insists on his way of reprogramming the missile to destroy the plane. So there's nothing incredibly stupid. And if it fails, he sends a jet fighter after him. Don't even think you're looking for something that looks like logic: this is the real thing at the bottom that even the studio gave up and sold as a US comedy after the critics laughed at the screen. Where all three previous items looked like a shiny big-budget entertainment program, this friendly little canvas effort (the only one that won't be able to shoot in 2.35: 1 widescreen format) can't even make Con corde looked good, which is quite a performance, TV veteran David Lowell Rich apparently got a directing concert because he was fast, cheap and previously directed a TV movie SST: Disaster in the Sky, where Peter Graves' supersonic plane could not land due to sabotage and Senegalese flu ( which was not, intentionally, at least a comedy despite the presence of young Billy Crystal in the cast), and it seemed to be a natural choice for what looked like a $ 14 million movie that had somehow escaped into theaters when no one was looking. Cast as a bad episode of Hollywood squares, the stars are in a very short time this time, and most of the little-known faces seem to be rounded off by rehabilitation clinics and arrested sitcoms. Alain Delon gives Hollywood a career that last shot as a pilot, "Happy Fish" (don't ask) George Kennedy moves from a powerful suite to a passenger seat in hopes of reminding other movies while the rest of the set includes several The Towering Inferno veterans ( Wagner and Blakely), soft-pornstar (Sylvia Kristel, trying to worship), regular Ingmar Bergman (Bibi Andersson ?? and she's the one who plays hooker!), David Warner is a diary navigator who has nightmares about it that they are being chased by bananas, the voice of the devil (Mercedes McCambridge), Charo and her visual eye Chihuahua ("Dohn miscon-screw me"), Martha Raye and her weak bladder, Jimmie Walker plays saxtu in her chair and smokes weeds (in those moments when Martha Ray is not occupied), Cicely Tyson kisses her trusted farewell as a compulsory mother with a critically ill child and a frozen heart in the cabinet e, owner of the airline Eddie Albert and trophy wife Sybil Danning took the best place in the house, Ed Begley Jr in glasses, and the Russian Olympic team and their dear coach Val Avery and his deaf daughter (ahhhh!) on tour of the goodwill of states (who did they know about the boycott? ). Just to add a touch to the Simpsons to control, Harry Shearer pronounces one message in the same tones he later used for Smithers. <br /> <br /> Highlighting? Through an impromptu wedding ceremony during a landing crash, it just has to be George Kennedy diverting the heat-seeking missile by opening the window, holding his hand (almost twice the speed of the sound!) And shooting flares? while the plane is upside down! And then Alain Delon shuts down the engines, so there won't be a "heat source" for missiles that should go back? Yes, somebody paid for it, and that somebody was a future Oscar winner and screenwriter Munich and Insider Eric Roth (hey, everyone has to start somewhere), even though it was producer Jennings Lang who came up with a plot. But what do you expect from a movie that attributes stunts to stuntmen and ends with a shot of Concorde flying into the sunset? Surprisingly, in one of those who do not admit defeat moments, the studies were prone to Universal filming for another 20 minutes or so a few years later to include a TV show on the net (not included in the DVD). Unfortunately his box-office failure led to a fifth entry in the series, The Laughter-Riot, which would be the 1984 Airport: UFO, Never Standing Out. Even more tragically, it was Concorde used in this film, which crashed in France 21 years later. (Oh, and if you're wondering what Charo is saying to her Chihuahua in Spanish when it's not allowed on board, it's "What do you think? Don't worry. When the revolution comes, I promise you'll be whatever it is, my love, what do they think they are? ")
