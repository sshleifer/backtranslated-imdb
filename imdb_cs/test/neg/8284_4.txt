After their race runner dies after the race, track members are tracked and killed by a mysterious masked killer who seeks revenge for the girl's death. <br /> <br /> It was obvious from the beginning of this film that it wouldn't be very good (at least in terms of true quality). The 'dramatic' track race at the end of the opening scene was one of the least believable sporting events I've ever seen in the movie. It would seem that the winner of the race never ran in his life. Not just running on the track. . . but run at all. At all. From there, we get a terribly unrealistic female navy member who, with her jewelry and make-up, has violated numerous appearance rules, not to mention her hair hanging loosely on her collar. Sensually awkward camera angles, pathetically made gore effects and acting that moved from scary over-top-to-boring pod done (all in one actor, mind you) all help make this movie one of the most unintentionally cheerful horror movies ever made . On the other hand, writing wasn't so bad and the story was really fine. But the direction was terrible, worse by the blatantly bad cinematography. The negotiations ranged from acceptable to simple abysmal. Regardless of all the embarrassingly bad elements, there's something, whether it's cheese or something else that I can't come up with, making the film a very pleasant and worthy watch. Maybe it was Vanna White. Mandatory Slasher Elements: Violence / Gore: The death scenes were pretty fun, but gore was just awful: blood sprays from impossible angles, no real bangs or bangs from knives , etc. But this movie has the first 'death of football' scene I've ever seen. Sex / Nudity: There Was a Little Nudity (After all, Linnea Quigley is in it, and yet some excessively horny high school students, but nothing excessive. Cool Killer (s): If you think leather gloves, stopwatches, track suits and fencing masks are great, this is for you. Scares / Suspense: Not at all. I was preparing to be afraid ... but it just led to some typical stupidity and was destroyed for me. <br /> <br /> - The Secret: A little bit, but if you can't figure out the killer's identity for about 20 minutes Into the movie, then I 'm not very sure about my powers of deduction. - Awkward Dance Scene: There is a great improvised jam session ("Graduation Day Blues") with a guitar & harmonica that leads to some amazing 80s bopping, followed by some strange mix of 70's and 80's disco, which was probably the best The more frightening part of the movie. <br /> <br /> The final verdict: 4/10 Don't take it too seriously and you can enjoy it (like most of the other things it touches the Three). <br /> <br /> -AP3-
