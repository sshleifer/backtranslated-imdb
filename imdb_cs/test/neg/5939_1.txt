If Andrei Tarkovsky were stuck, instead of a mirror he would direct his mother and son. This is the most beautiful movie ever made in the world, I'm convinced. The son, without a name, cares for his mother, without a name. I think they love each other. No, certainly not. These are not characters. They are not even actors playing characters. At least it could be nice, but nature seems to be ridiculously touched and changed wherever necessary with a Macintosh. And could Sokurov come up with a technique that was like a shabby aspect ratio? You had to be born yesterday to buy this waste. 1/10.
