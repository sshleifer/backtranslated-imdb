Rs.30 / - is all I paid for as rent for a DVD movie and believe me it's not worth it. Bollywood directors think that showing fools is funny? it's not good. Please grow up. Here is a dialogue from the movie -AAG TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI '. The fence is useless, criminals and police as well as fools. This is it. BHAGAM BHAG. Well it lived the title, I had to run away from him. :) I switched to Star Movies and instead I watched Home Alone 2 and I had a good laugh.
