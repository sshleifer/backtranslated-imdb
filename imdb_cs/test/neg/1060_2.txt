My Caddy Limo was destroyed !!! Well, I had him like that - he was driven by hoi polloi and many of the Chosen in Manhattan for years. That was much more fun than this movie I can tell you. Lord, what a bomb - like in a RPG go boom. I also drove many more stars in my white Caddy before I appeared in this bagpipe. Robert Patrick is a very serious actor, and with the nonsense he had to work with, he did a credible job. Rutger Hauer played his role as a circus clown red. If he couldn't take it seriously, why would his audience? The director should kick his ass from the set in the first hour of filming. Dialogue wrote 10 years old for 8 years old. Surprised that there was not much more on the scene. Well, I'm a film fanatic - ergo - you have to get wrong to get to the good.
