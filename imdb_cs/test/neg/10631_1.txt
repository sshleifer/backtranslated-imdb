After lasting this movie last night, I turned off the DVD player with a well-earned medal for being persistent. During the movie, I felt I was watching you get into a high budget movie. The acting was tough and tense, the camera work scary and the places and files were so poor that it was as if they were borrowed from a local High School "Amateur Drama Company". This movie was that it had Amy Adams and Harriet Sansom Harris in his credits, other than it was pure dribling.
