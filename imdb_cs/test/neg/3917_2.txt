Dennis Hopper had to be really hungry to do it. Curious special effects, very bad writing, kitschy dialogue, stupid looking killer bio-robot. It doesn't matter the obvious disregard for science. An awkward scene with two young leaders took off her clothes. The best work of this film was a cyber-penis that ran on a broken pirate captain. 2 out of 10 stars because I'm in a generous mood.
