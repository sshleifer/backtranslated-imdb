Writer-director Emilio Estevez has a clear lack of talent with this irreparable, anticipated comedy. The script is absolutely hopeless, let alone the fact that it is unoriginal and malfunctioning. The comedy just doesn't work. When Estevez does not use bad taste sex jokes, he borrows used gags and re-makes them very badly. You'd think Esteveze's team and Charlie Sheen's brother would be fine ... but ... it's not. barely coaxing a smile from their audience. Do yourself a favor and keep it on the shelf video.
