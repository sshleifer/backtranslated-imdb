It's hard to make it through this movie without choking on your own vomit to be honest. Poor animation doesn't help because it looks like a decade old video that you can find in 99p bin Morrisons. Yet it is better than an abysmal scenario that spends about a third of its length on useless extras such as today's Belle problems, things about Scrooge's father, and lots of enthusiastic spells - with a choke - TWO ANTHROPOMORPHIC MICE. These bizarre additions reduce the time on the screen to the detriment of the elements you think would be very important, such as Dickens' dialogue and the key pieces of his plot - the film annoys the game, for example, twenty questions and sometimes fails to put the scenes in the right order. Absolutely hopeless.
