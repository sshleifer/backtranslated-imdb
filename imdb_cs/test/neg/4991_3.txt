When I first became a father about 5.5 years ago, I was ready for the many sacrifices I would have to make. I knew I'd have to change diapers and take them to swimming lessons and take part in many of the chilly parades of Santa Claus, but I wasn't ready for what I did last night. This is, in my humble opinion, a cruel and unusual punishment. Underdog is bad. It's not a bad Karate Dog, but it makes The Shaggy Dog feel Pulp Fiction. If the Underdog was a TV show, I would recommend that I turn around. Even Puddy's presence and Banky Edwards's voice can't save him. Bow. Wow. It was also about the best 80 minutes I enjoyed. James was sitting to my right and Michelle to the left, spending more time watching their reaction to this conversation, flying mutt, than watching the screen. At the age of 5 and 3, they were the target group and the film nailed the target. There's a scene where Underdog shouts loudly in other dog faces and Michelle thought it was the funniest scene ever captured on film. When Underdog flew into space, James was literally on the edge of his seat, fascinated. The kids absolutely loved the Underdog and that's why I was there. That's what she was about last night. <br /> <br /> If you don't add to someone who is under ten, you can't waste a second of your life and watch this brutal movie. But if you want to kill 80 minutes with your four-year-old, I won't judge. I had an explosion.
