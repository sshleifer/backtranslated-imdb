If a movie can't keep your interest in the first 25 minutes, it's over. This concept, which you simply have to solve with the slow first third of the film and later rewarded, is nonsense. A good movie has to start and be strong. It all looks interesting and some decent shots and lots of promises, but in the end they are confused and irrelevant. There are many other movies from Asia that are watching, many of which I am sure most of you have not seen that I really missed and looked away. Why exactly does IMDb require a minimum of 10 lines for reviews? I said my piece and hope it helps a few of you move on to the next movie.
