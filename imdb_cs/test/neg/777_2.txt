The quality of this document was very disappointing. Content is poorly produced, very poor video quality and especially terrible sound. There is very little about how Bruce Haack produced his music and practically no examples of direct connection with later and contemporary electronic music. Interviews of people who knew that Bruce Haack were ad-hoc mostly inarticulate mumbo-jumbo. Too much and not enough Haack. Although I have a serious personal interest in electronic music and I have higher than average attention, even for a slow and / or difficult business, I fell asleep while watching this document and had to check it to see the parts that I slept. If you look at this, make sure you are set up before displaying it, such as Alex's Watch Orange. Bruce Haack deserves much better than this. Shame on producer and director.
