Two popular actors are paired in showtime as De Niro and Murphy playing police and actors. Although they share the most time on the screen, they do not achieve the expected performances of such films as Analyze This, Meet the Parents, Dr. Doolittle and Nutty Professor. The film starts interesting but becomes a thin, ordinary comedy that is quite disappointing. This is a shame because it really shows your feelings, what I think. Unfortunately, if the idea was cleverly used, it could be a more interesting work and could follow the sequel as any other popular Hollywood movie. Well, I don't think it would be a continuation of this at least re-cast of De Niro and Murpy. ** outside *****
