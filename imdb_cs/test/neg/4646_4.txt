I read the book first and thought: Wow it would be cool to see the movie before I started looking and found out it was already a movie ... I bought a movie a week ago on a DVD and watched it ... they did it terribly wrong! initially that child of Hapi, who is no character in the book, then the mixture between the two books ("Greek God" and "Seventh Scroll") than Nicolas needs funds, while in the book he himself is the donor, the whole thing about Hyksos is bad too .. taila has invented a light-chariot .. the whole thing about the tomb is also very bad .. there is to be a channel that has some kind of vacuum-sucking around it .. the tomb itself was made in a maze with the possibility to pass if you know the rules of ancient boa-games. There was nothing in the film that Nicolas was an Englishman and Royan was a Coptic Christian in a book, not a Muslim. The list is endless. There were only a few things about the movie, the actors who played Royan, Nahood, Taita, Boris, Mick and Tessay were well chosen, the rest were just parodies of the characters, Rasfer was the worst, he didn't even get to the character that was in my head while I was writing the book. It's a shame that such a great book is mutilated in such bad reproduction ... I wonder why Wilbur Smith ever gave permission to do so.
