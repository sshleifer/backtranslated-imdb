I saw this movie when it first came out in the cinema. We were all looking forward to Mark Hamill starting his career again, but we came to wish we didn't bother. After half an hour a lot of people came out - I wish too. The basic assumption seems to be fine, but the conspiracy was ridiculously involved and torturous and ran out halfway. Its completely unmistakable and not the movie you want to pay money to see. If you're really bored and it's on TV, then it will help you kill a few hours (or help you nod!). 2/10
