I saw it in the independent cinema of my city - no surprise, because no mainstream theater would want fingerprints on this train wreck. <br /> <br /> Working with the camera is very disturbing. Continuous shifting, focusing, and zooming could cause a sensitive person to have a motion sickness. It looks more like a student film project than a serious film. Although characters are well-functioning, characters are unlikely. Josh is devious, always trying to manipulate situations and people to his advantage. Without affiliation with Emily and Josh's relationship, she goes away like a crazy, insecure girl who is desperate to marry. Rhett is an emotional child who is unable to understand the complexity of human interaction. Without any redemptive qualities, I didn't care about what had happened to them. Some people seemed to like this movie because the couple sitting behind me laughed hysterically. Of course they could make fun of it. I could barely blame them.
