*** Spoiler spoiler, but probably not *** <br /> <br /> The game is called donkey kong, but donkey kong is no longer in it <br /> <br />! Diddy's gone anyway! The first Donkey Kong country was one of my two most popular Super Nintendo <br /> <br /> games. (Second World Super Mario) <br /> <br /> The other Kong Kong had at least diddy kong and good levels, although it seemed more like a game based on pirates at times. However, this is the worst of the series! It doesn't feel original <br /> <br /> or 2., Enemy look stupid and levels are <br /> <br /> even worse. It doesn't look realistic anymore! I didn't like his game unlike the last two, the first had great <br /> <br /> background music and the other wasn't bad, but the music in this <br /> <br /> game is terrible! It happens a lot these days when movies, shows, and sometimes video games that start fantastic end up being destroyed <br /> <br /> stupid sequels! I am sad to say that I feel that a kong donkey is not so good <br /> <br /> that it has Donkey Kong 3! <br /> <br /> They should have left it on the original or MAJBE the other.
