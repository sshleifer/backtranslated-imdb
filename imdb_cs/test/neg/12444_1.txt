Everyone has already commented on the obvious fact that the first few comments were obviously from people who either had a share in the film or had friends / family who had a share in the film, and that's fine - if I made a movie, everyone in my family and friends would also be a compliment. In all honesty, there are some good things along with bad things in this movie. Unfortunately, bad things far outweigh good. Well: The overall plot was interesting. The music was pretty good overall. Several songs (when you heard them) were actually pretty cool. The only musical problems I had were: # 1) the first thrilling scene with some quiet instrumental instrument (seemed to take away from tension), # 2) the song being played when the lead character went to the outdoor party at friend's house and # 3) songs that were good were too quiet, especially when the heavy metal song was playing in the background, while Danny Trejo hung up the man (it sounded like a pretty cool song, but he should tear it across the scene) frog). Now for completely bad things: The script was cruel. I mean, HORRIBLE. I saw a smoother dialogue in Star Wars. Advice for writers from working part time writers and full-time movie enthusiasts: When you are writing a dialogue, ask yourself, "Is this something people really say?" Frankly, the script was ridiculous. I want to play acting, but with this type of writing it's hard to know if they have talent or not. A slightly interesting plot was severely hampered by miserable dialogue. I know it was a low budget, but the words don't cost money - if you have a good script, even half-cast actors can pull it out. This film didn't seem to have one, but hopefully the director will get a second chance for a better film.
