This is a bad cartoon "Lonesome Dove" - ​​and Larry McMurtry. I love your books, with "Lonesome Dove" among the top three. I admired the way you look at yourself, through your characters, with such unflinching honesty, balanced by never taking it too seriously. I am therefore spoiled. Why did you lose it? <br /> <br /> "Comanche Moon" is not in your standards. I see you are counted on the screen, but it is unlike you, I think it is written by someone else. Dialogue gives me claustrophobia, wishes someone to set off with a naturally determined sentence. Part of the 'genius' was painful. McCrae was unknowable - mainly because his mouth came out of his mouth. Well, I miss the call. The most important missing factors are Gus and Call and Men are: their material courage; a basic vein of ethics and honesty; their lack of self-deception. Hard men lead a hard life with some undeniable grace. <br /> <br /> Some of the blame has to go to the strained direction. All cast the necessary dialect and dialogue coaching. Although I try to imagine Robert Duvall as McCrae, to speak this same dialogue, it will come better - but not much. Trying to sound cowboy-of-little-words shy, sly-grin funny, but not half succeed ... <br /> <br /> How can it be so different from "Lonesome Dove"? Can a writer forget his characters? Some people have fooled you, Mr. McMurtry - but not this.
