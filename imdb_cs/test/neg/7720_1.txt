How bad you can make a movie. Good question that House of the Dead 2 will succeed in answering. I couldn't believe anything worse was possible than the First House of the Dead, but it was amazing. The only feeling of the movie is that its bad, bad. What with overacting, bad FX and stupid story. Its this kind of movie that gives a bad name to Z-movies in general. Why couldn't they learn from the first movie The House of the Dead? Anyway, now you will understand that you should not see this movie. It's just a waste of time. Watch "Bad Taste" or "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see some good zombies.
