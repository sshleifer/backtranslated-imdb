He's a male bastard. I saw it on Sci-Fi a while ago and the idea looked interesting. It could have been a good movie and I don't see the story itself as a male attack, but some specific references to men are really annoying. But I could still watch the movie because at least she tries to redeem herself by suggesting that women in the film aren't actually as nonviolent as they claim, but it still doesn't equal the really tiring man -bashing. I understand a bit, it's part of the movie plot, but after a while it will be really tiring. Not only that, but assuming that most women in the world would accept being so homosexual and that the few remaining heterosexuals would be such a minority that they would go "in the closet." It's just incredible. There are too many women with cultural or religious constraints to prevent it from being totally unlikely. I mean, I know his science fiction and I like science fiction, but the best science fiction has at least a hint that it's possible, and that's too unlikely. The phrase "Truth is stranger than fiction" arose because fiction must at least seem acceptable to welcome it, but the truth is not always. This is not the film. In addition to having a good deal of action and the morale of the story, something that happened was bad, to redeem it a little, but not enough.
