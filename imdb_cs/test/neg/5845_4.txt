This story had the potential of a good film. A difficult choice of love versus money and anxiety and regret of having done the wrong. However the film was destroyed by the terrible miscasting of Robert Redford as a villain who offers $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Demi Moore. Like Redford, he has to pay for it. Redford's boyish good looks and all American charms just don't diminish as unlikely, menacing, boor. Redford's acting skills are inadequate to threaten his character. I see it now, $ 1,000,000 to sleep with Robert Redford. OK says the lady, but you have to give me some time to make money. Jack Nicholson would be perfect as sleazeball.
