The short existence of The Sex Pistols and the creation of this film after the controversial, pioneering breakdown of the English punk band took place before I was born. However, I started to listen to their only album "Never Mind the B * &% @" & "Here's the Sex Pistols" in 2003, when I was a teenager and quickly became a big fan. I haven't seen "The Great Rock" n 'Roll Swindle "until 2006, but I've seen it a few times that year and thought it was pretty good (definitely not great, but pretty good), though I could only remember When I saw it for the third time, almost three years after another, I didn't care much about it, I'm not even sure what I've found so well in most of them (I can't remember This movie is a mockument in which Sex Pistols manager Malcolm McLaren tells his side of the band's story and its members, guitarist Steve Jones, credited here as "Crook", drummer Paul Cook, credited as "Tea -Maker "; bassist Sid Vicious, attributed as" trick "; and John Lydon (aka Johnny Rotten) credited as" Coworker ". McLaren claims he created a band (and even a genre of punk rock) as a scam to earn money. the story of Helen Wellin Gtons-Lloyd (aka Helen Troy), in different places where they go together, it's basically hodgepodge speaking McLaren, Pistols songs, live band footage, fictional scenes (often silly, weird), several cartoon sequences, etc., all together in one movie to tell the side of the gun manager story in a bizarre way! It has been well established that McLaren is a liar, I know that many have already pointed it out, including band members. He was not the band's driving force, did not create them (nor did they invent punk rock and The Sex Pistols were not even the first punk band, although they were unique). The band members were the ones who created the band. "The Filth and the Fury", a much more plausible film about the Julien Temple band who made this film, is from the perspective of the band members who contradict McLaren's claims. However, the dishonesty of "The Great Rock" by 'Roll Swindle' is not my biggest problem with it. If it were really fun (which I thought it was to some extent), I could overlook how I probably got used to it During my third tracking, except for the Sex Pistols, some live footage and at least one fun cartoon sequence, it was pretty boring! I found out that "Who Killed Bambi" is fun at first, but it gets tired very quickly. It is a mockumentary that is worth watching the Sex Pistols fans, it seems that a good number of fans would say that it is, not to learn about the true story of the short but pioneering 70s punk band, but It was once my opinion about "The Great Rock" n 'Roll Swindle. When I first saw it, I couldn't remember what McLaren said, and when I saw it for the second time, I realized what the Pistols manager used this film to indicate, but he could barely remember anything I heard him say! Obviously, other aspects of the film were what I found impressive. Now, after my third review, I certainly remember some of the things McLaren says, but it was still not 100% clear. Like most of the movie, I think his words are not so unforgettable, probably because of the way they are presented. If you're a Pistols fan, I think it wouldn't hurt to "Swindle" a try, but for me, for the most part, it's just a disjointed, boring mess that tries to be funny but fails.
