This movie was terrible. Biblically very inaccurate. Moses was 80 years old when he led people from Egypt, and the film is about forty. Moses was about forty when he fled Egypt, was forty years old and had been with them for forty years. Moses was 120 years old when he died, and he was denied the privilege of going to the promised land. I realize that films use a lot of "poetic licenses" because the biblical account is not so long, but if you are making a biblical film, it still has to reflect the well-known facts and maintain the general flavor of the main biblical character, this film fails in this aspect and many others. Although the 1956 version has its problems, it was much better theatrically.
