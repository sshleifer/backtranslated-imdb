This movie was challenging, foppish and just down right not funny. The shooting technique reminded me of MTV. I'm a Hartley fan. But what was he thinking? Much more thought could be given to this film in relation to the subject. It could be a real theoretical battle for good and evil, but Hartley seems to be using the stand-up psyching technique out of the viewer.
