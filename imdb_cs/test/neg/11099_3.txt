The film is apparently based on the popular French horror novel, Arthur Bernède, from 1927. Not that I have ever heard of it before but Belphégor was a popular theme before for films and mini-series. The first film was released in 1927 along with the novel. Arthur Bernède was part of a group of writers who wrote and produced films and novels simultaneously. Belphégor is one of his most famous creations. Sophie Marceau was once a promising new European actress to win Hollywood. But now she has returned to films like this. Nothing wrong with playing French-quality movies because it's the country it comes from, but this movie is just a mockery. . Well, horror and special effects have never been a good combination, with some exceptions here and there. It's not like special effects are bad in this. Especially for European film, it's just good, but it's just badly placed because the film felt that it could easily be done without its effect. That would actually make the film better and more frightening than it was to look, it really didn't matter. The film is never tense or looking at it because the film seems to have difficulty with the right approach. Occasionally the film chooses a light and less serious approach, while in others it clearly tries to be a good scary horror movie. This is mostly why the movie just doesn't work at any level. You can say that the movie is still a little boring. All this is definitely getting worse towards the end. After a while, you stop worrying about this movie and its story and start wishing you instead to watch something else. <br /> <br /> Editing seems to be completely off. It uses too fast cuts, without much style, while quick editing was clearly designed to make the film a good, modern style. Also, the timeline is sometimes free as if some sequences were edited in the wrong order. The musical score is also really annoying and sometimes not even heard. the movie as if it all scored long before the movie ended filming. I can't believe composer Bruno Coulais is an Oscar-nominated composer. The music score is almost as annoying as the movie's sound effects. <br /> <br /> The movie is filled with many characters, but you don't care about it. It also seems very unlikely that a woman like Sophie Marceau would ever fall as a man like Frédéric Diefenthal. Julie Christie is also part of the film, and she is pretty, but doesn't add much to the movie. Awful watches. <br /> <br /> 3/10
