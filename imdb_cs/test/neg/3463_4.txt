Leatherheads is an apt title, but a leather strap would be more useful if he looked at this harmful attempt at entertainment after buying the ticket. Clooney's attempt at suicidal humor meets silent pounding because his behavior suggests that there is something other than that. Maybe with another actor who plays the role of Clooney, the film may be marginally tasty. I'm sorry George, I doubt this time it'll be an Oscar. George Clooney is definitely a fish of water when it comes to comedy (if you refer to his policy). Anyway, only the most ardent Clooney fans will be happy about watching Leatherheads, everyone else will long for days of silent image.
