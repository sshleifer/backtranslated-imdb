I saw this movie on Telly at night and little I knew what the cringe-fest would be ... I knew it would be stupid but not so bad! This film is an example of everything terrible in an Australian comedy. Except for the most interesting, uninspired scenarios and characters I've ever encountered (except for the dubious French producers of US tax reliefs!), Most situations were boring, incredible, stereotypical, and not just fun ... terrible! One such scenario that really upset me was a fool on the bus scene. From the point of view of writing, the writers used the most interesting scenario, despite the incredible scenario to get these three stranded without their luggage to the feast of their lives and risk it all (including $ 300). custody, luggage and room) exercise their rights to dance on the bus? I think they are about half an hour from their destination! At the very least, they could let the bus driver kick them, but they don't want to leave voluntarily because they can't take it anymore! "And the wreck of their vacation ... Anyway, I can't believe the authors didn't work a scary scenario. I think a ten year old might come up with 5 set-ups smarter, more fun and more believable. <br /> <br /> I can continue with many others - a truly unimaginable stereotypical psychopath, an entire relationship with an angry girlfriend and a tag along the virgin, 'Wow Man! There goth girl 'inhaling things on the train - everything was just pitiful! I can't think of one redeeming function of this movie, except that the third round was so cute. Perverted his career by appearing in this basket though!
