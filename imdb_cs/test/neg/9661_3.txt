wow, this movie was sucked. This film was embarrassed about the original script. Everything about this movie was terrible. Acting was terrible. Every part of it except the "Mexican" sandlot manager was terrible. Luke Perry, though only a bit of the bits was absolutely terrible. That was the worst part ever. Even the kid who played him as a child was someone you wanted to strike, even at the end, lol. This movie reminded me of those guys who make that extra mile to make a goofy part as far as a funny stage. Humor was for 6 years. <br /> <br /> If yours is over 12 and you want something worth watching, skip this movie and watch a sitcom.
