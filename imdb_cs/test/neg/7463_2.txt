ATTIC starts well. The somewhat rugged story is largely aided by two major actors and there is a semblance of character study going on here, but the film goes downhill quickly when the character Carrie Snodgress' buys a monkey. Not one of those cute monkeys. She buys a real big chimpanzee !!! <br /> <br /> This sudden plot device basically kills the movie. It's not simply possible for a woman like Snodgress to do anything about her father's father to buy a chimpanzee from her. I mean, come on! Forget it!
