iCarly is a teenage girl named Carly Shay (Miranda Cosgrove) who lives with her artistic brother Spencer in a Seattle loft. Carly has a web show that gets millions of views and makes a ton of money a year, so much money she "doesn't even know her real number". Her best friend is Sam (Janette McCrudy), who is as predictable as they are! He says "normal" things and beats Carly's neighbor, Freddie, who is in charge of all the technical stuff for their web show. Carly screams every word and seems to have no emotion. Sam chases Freddie and Freddie screams. In one episode, Carly and her friends shoot Lewbert (porter) down in the elevator and he survives. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend it at all, if you don't like teenagers, shouting, hurting people and making fun of things.
