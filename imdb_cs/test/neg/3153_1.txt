Barney is just terrible. As many of the other reviews at this show say. I am not one who disagree with them (I will not). Because I hate this show as much as they do. They use children who seem to be in the sixth year, kitschy conspiracy, frightening dialogue, and really bad special effects. Not to mention the big purple dinosaur. Makes every other child show look like winners prize (Sesame Street won the award that I know about). Please just watch Sesame Street, Thomas Tank Engine or even Teletubbies. Avoid both this and his film (which I also reviewed). They are both extremely miserable and unsuitable for anyone (even young children).
