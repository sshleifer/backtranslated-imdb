Just awful. It's almost unbelievable that thanks to the characters and situations provided by Dashiell Hammett, there might be such a passionate, passionate mishmash. But this is the TV for you - the fill between ads. The first warning signal sounds from the commotion of the re-creation of the period that screams "1928" in the banner type. Flivvers and tourist cars, fedoras and vests, cloches and speakeasy jazz (nervously played) - with all the attention paid to useless, bohemian detail, important things get ignored. Just like narrative clarity, or credibility, or competent writing and acting. The story sets one of Hammett's agents ("Hamilton Nash", whether it's "Ham" or "Nash", we mean "Hammett" or "Dash") investigating false diamond theft. This is how the young woman who allegedly carries Dain Curse (the magical and talented Nancy Addison who has returned to the soap she belonged to) is introduced; she belongs to the crackpot religious cult led by Jean Simmons and looks addicted to "drugs" as well; there is also a mysterious gaseous drug that penetrates into the rooms .... <br /> <br /> But enough. Writing is never more pedestrian than when it gets poetically or highly flying, and casting parrots is the only way they know: grotesque excessively. Simmons treats old Hollywood as a royalties, but the treatment of grande-dame is not washed. For some reason, Hector Elizondo looks forward to the second billing (after Coburn) for the useless part. Other familiar faces are drifting, doing little for their resumes. Actors aren't even photographed to look good; Jason Miller is strange afraid, but extreme Coburn footage is also ruthless. Coburn probably cast doubt on this role because he bears a strong resemblance to Hammett with the mustache. He needed more guidance than that; no one has given him a vague hint of how to play his character, or the tone of the story, or how the various elements of the conspiracy (not, at least not in this narrative) are interconnected. So he flashes his big Chesire-smile cat, whether called after or not. <br /> <br /> Dain Curse is available on videotape, in various lengths. For those who are stupid enough to "convince themselves", the shortest of all is the kindest of all.
