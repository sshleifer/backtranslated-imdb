Bad, bad, cinematic, so bad, it's worth watching. As long as you watch this movie knowing it's bad and you're spending 2 hours of your time watching a bad movie, it's worth it. Special effects are cheesy and animals look fake and acting is bad, but watching the actors' faces trying to look frightened is just very funny. If the nurse is to worry about the giant commodo of the dragon, wouldn't you do something to try and save her? If she ate her, wouldn't you fall to your knees and cry? This guy just sat in his chair and ran his fingers over his. How is climate change? Maybe he was supposed to be in shock or something. He joins his sister in the comodo's belly - oh he didn't want to spoil it.
