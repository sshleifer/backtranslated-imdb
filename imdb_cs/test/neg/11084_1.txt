The movie goes something like this: Run around, run around, someone killed, lots of madness and then one of the group yells at "Pull it together" or "Just relax!" Repeat as many times as their characters. Among these things, you can look forward to a blank black screen. It is not fast but a few seconds long. Every time I was wondering what a waste of film is - yes, that happens more than once, if you can believe it. I have noticed other mentioned "Blair Witch: and it reminded me of how the camera was bouncing, but this movie did it to the extreme. Every time the characters move the camera is bounced. Sometimes so much, that you can't make heads or stories what you're looking at, it brings us to lighting, it's too dark in some areas, but I'm trying to make them feel like we're in a cave, but Helllloo ... I'm watching the movie here, would it be nice to be able to see then. <br /> <br /> Then it is over and I said out loud, "Are you kidding me?!" (I watched myself) Stupid, stupid. after such a long time of boredom with the so-called "twist" they were shocked. At this point in the movie, you could see a "monster" collecting his nose and it would be incompatible. "turn." Really awful.
