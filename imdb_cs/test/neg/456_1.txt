One is a very aptly named show, mostly because it is about to be the only network that shows up in the main period that hardly more than one person is watching it. <br /> <br /> When I first heard about The One, I thought about myself: "Wee! Another song of singing! We don't have enough!" And then he went on the helmet strap and ran past my home hitting his head on blunt objects and sharp corners. Because in all honesty, constant, year-round pain and suffering caused by having just one or two "talent" based reality shows running just isn't enough. We needed more. And not just one - "The One". The one with slightly less attractive competitors with slightly less talent. The one that has a little less point, though it is hard to imagine a scenario in which it is possible. The one with the nonsensical footage of the contestants when they don't. Because I care about what Johnny Sings does in his class! Really! Now you may think, "Hey! Less than 4 million people have watched the first episode all over the North American continent. Doesn't that show show shit?" Well, to say this, less than 4 million people in North America have syphilis, so sometimes low numbers bring good news right now? Think about it. Finally, The One may be very unoriginal, showing that even the broadcasting network didn't bother to promote because they also realize how worthless it is, but it's still not syphilis! Yay!
