First, I read the director's comments further and would like to thank him for offering him his opinion. I've always wondered what movie makers who got infected with MST3K felt that their works were torn (not to mention how Best Brains got the rights). Rissi's comments make me curious how much Sci-Fi could cut a movie to make it look different (now I think I could rent it from NetFlix). Of course, I've never seen this uncut, non-MST3K version of this movie, but even when I saw it on MST3K, I never thought of it as a bad movie or something unnoticeable (though I thought it was a pretty funny episode) MST3K); certainly not, as Pearl describes, "horrible skin peeling"; not after seeing the likes of "Future War" and "Hobgoblins." <br /> <br /> As for cutting the film, it was done earlier on MST3K, at least once. Case in point: Joe Don Baker movie, Mitchell, in which a subplot involving the character of John Saxon's cut in the version of MST3K, yet Joel and Bots comment on Saxon's absence after his appearance at the beginning of the film. If I can criticize MST3K, if you need to shorten the movie to time, fine, but be fair to the movie that is being cut (though it is a movie so miserable as Mitchell). Of course, such criticism is somewhat unnecessary with the show, but I think that aspect of the show was a bit unjust. But anyway, if it's a case of Soultaker, he'll get my sympathy. Still, I think it's a fun episode of MST3K, even though the movie itself, even the version that was "hacked" in MST3K, is not a place to be scared. As a final note, in a strange coincidence or perhaps a Synchronicity case, I was looking at The Hudsucker Proxy on the day Soultaker aired and you don't know, the guy who played Father Vivian Schelling had a piece in that movie ; one of his three other roles. I thought it was weird.
