This is better than earlier Cronenberg's horror movies, but nothing more than your basic story. The video game theme has been said. Except for the strange atmosphere of Cronenberg (which is not so strong here) with fun sexual links and Shore's dark score, nothing original remains. The story never takes your full attention. It just flows forward event after the event with a boring pace. Rating 4/10.
