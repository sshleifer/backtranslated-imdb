The field breeders' family is moving west. The head of the latest motley fruit, Walnut Grove, is named "Charles." He works in a mill cutting a lot of lumber, but who in hell thinks it's all that is a mystery to him, because none of the people in all towns have enough money to buy a shred, far less than two Four. Run City is Olsons, a rich but stupid clan who has moved to these parts to sell eggs for eleven cents per dozen in all the doughs they make. They have two children, a boy, 'Willie', and a girl, 'Nellie', who has only one asset savings between them ... Nellie is hot and it's fun to spy on her when she bathes in cricket. The city preacher is also a municipal idiot because he thinks it's really something special about what's happening in this country when they can't really build their boring preaching and the only thing which he prays. because on sunday it's for him to fall off the nearest reef as soon as possible. A city doctor is a dinosaur who has seen his better days about 20 years ago, but equally hangs so he can give a free breast examination to old hags that live in the city. Unfortunately, the only time these ancient hot moms get down on their knees is to pull a loaf of bread out of the oven to give Doc for his service. But that's okay with Doc because he knows these old wenches give good bread. Mary ',' Carrie 'and' Half-Pint '. Mary is another hot cat that every boy creeps whenever he takes a shower or crap. Carrie is an annoying little child, but he puts a biscuit in his mouth and you don't even know he's there, in fact where he is? ... oh, there he is ... he is in the yard and playing with a pack of cigarettes ... how cute! Half-Pint is the youngest city. She may not have a brain or some kind of body to talk about, but she can spit further than any boy in a crazy school. It's a great city, Walnut Grove, where someone is always dropped from the roof or running around the car, and it's also beautiful, made up of one building ... church / schoolhouse / town hall / billiards. Oh, that's a little hairy on the prairie, but that's okay, especially when Mary bathes in a crick ... that's when you see how hairy it is.
