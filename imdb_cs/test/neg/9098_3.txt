I remember seeing a clip of this movie on HBO when I was a kid, and I scared the living crap out of me. When I found him, I watched it. I wish I didn't. The movie wasn't scary. The plot revolves around an old woman who runs a castle. She feeds this terribly disfigured person in the 12th century castle cellar. He constantly beats the poor man every day and feeds him. Well, he'll die that day. A few months later the family moved in. Father, mother and their blind daughter. My father got involved in a terrifying car accident that made his son kill and leave his daughter blind. Later, during the film, the daughter hears sounds, things are moving, etc. at all. That's until a few people appear dead. It seems that the creature in the cellar has broken and kills people. How this thing has survived the last few months without food or water is impossible! Every time I saw a creature, it gave me horror. The creature sets out on a cruel deadly spree and the police accuse the father of death. It was a pretty bad movie. This film I give 3 stars out of 10 Scary is not scary!
