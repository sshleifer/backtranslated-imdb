I expect this film to be successful in Czech, where it will be welcomed by its obvious assumption: "They are ex-pats who can have money, they can even get our women, but they are old, soft and our women want to be happy, we can to be poor, but ... Now, if Evzen could keep Marcela happy, she wouldn't need to play with herself, or if she already had an existing family in Italy ... but that would complicate it.
