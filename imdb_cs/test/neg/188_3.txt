Luscious Candace Bergen as a Primitive Victorian Beauty, kidnapped by Sean Connery as the Sheikh Devil Desert! How can you go wrong? As? Let me count the ways !!! Earthy, primitive Sean Connery, just the right man to cripple the delicate, elegant beauty of Candace. . . in the role. It's because instead of talking about real problems ("you're a woman ... I'm a man!") They have to fool the nonsense about "the will of Allah" and "the wind blows fate through the desert sands." "John Milius, a director known more for nude male body worship and brute military strength than any view (or interest) in conventional human relationships, has a crazy way to get rid of his desert lovers every time it looks like Candace might kiss Instead of watching nature with two wonderfully appealing people in a picturesque landscape, we're treated to infinity (and I mean ENDLESS) footage of Brian Keith, who flashes his walrus-sized helicopters and brings a bold sermon about Teddy Roosevelt's delight. nothing against Teddy Roosevelt, but watching him test his new rifle or talk about the heroic death of a big bear will not hurt me as it would be a story about the love between Candace Bergen and Sean Connery ... if it ever happened! that Milius spends most of his time building characters and stories that are not different Two little Candace babies in the story have more time on the screen than she does. There is no humor, no chemistry, no sizzle in any of the things she can't do in the desert. If you don't think it's funny that after weeks of canter riding her hair is still perfect. The only "real" moment in the story is when, at night, Candace Bergen shakes her little daughter of healthy sleep on soft cushions and says, "We have to escape." The little girl turns and answers without a rhythm: "But mother, I slept!" That one line summarizes what is really missing from the story. No danger, tension or sputtering in the basic story of a cultivated lady in captivity. She (and her children) are both so cozy and well cared that it is hard to believe that everyone is drawn about their fate. Remember, if Candace herself said it might work better. If the tension came from her enjoyment of her captivity (or the joy of being in the arms of Sean Connery) and her guilt about all the problems her kidnapping caused, then the story would have some tension. But Milius is a strange assumption that the audience is as well treated as him if Teddy Roosevelt gets a chance to prove his manliness three thousand kilometers away. Finally, it seems that a pretty lady and her children don't care that he cares. . . and because they are in the middle of the story, the whole thing seems to be rather dry and endless. . . like burning desert sands.
