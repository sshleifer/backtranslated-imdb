One should have the right to expect people who have made a film about the Second Coming and the Third Law to read the other two, or at least know them more than miracles and doomsday. For viewers interested in Jesus, religion or philosophy, this film contains nothing important - there is only standard British social realism with gutural dialects and plump figures in pubs. the true Third Law has been published several times - like "The Course of Miracles" or "Conversation with God". All have new ideas that provoke Christian faith and theology. <br /> <br /> The most interesting information in IMDb is not the number of stars, but how many people bothered to vote. In just four years, only 387 people have been bothered by this film. As usual, enthusiasts are eager. For comparison, look at "Jesus Christ, Superstar" - the original version of 1973.
