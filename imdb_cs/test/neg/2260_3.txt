Margaret Mitchell spins in her grave every time someone watches this mess! The fine costumes and sets can't even overwhelm Joanne Whalley's insignificant performances (as the title character) and still the Dutch Timothy Dalton (like Rhetta). Worse than acting - and perhaps a partial explanation - is a scenario that is incredibly clich√© and predictable. Add to the hellishly wrong scenario a score that will cringe you, and you have a catastrophe I don't want the viewer to do. SCARLETT is just incredibly lousy and I can't imagine how it happened, much less.
