I had great hopes for this production because I'm one of my favorite works. Indeed, much of this is reasonable: Helen Baxendale is not a bad Lady Macbeth, but she lacks a devil that has an original character. filled. Many of the smaller characters behave well and Scottish settings are great. Great disappointment is Jason Connery in the title role: he seems to read his lines from the card with the wrong glasses - for the first time. It can do much better. Any production compared to the noble Ian McKellen (Macbeth 1979), who in my opinion gave the gold standard performance, will try to appreciate, but I actually fell asleep and had to rewind before I could get through it - barely great sign. <br /> <br /> Honestly, avoid one.
