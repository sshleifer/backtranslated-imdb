"Scarecrow Gone Wild: He's Party Death!" Do I need to say more? Scarecrow disappeared wild got four out of ten stars from me for one simple reason: in addition to terrible acting, plot holes, cheap special effects and anti-climactic whistling, it was movie gold! I think this movie could be really good if the scarecrow turned out to be a baseball coach (as always with brilliant Ken Shamrock). But then they would have to redistribute the wonderful special effects of "the amazing Jedi return." While watching this movie, I and my friends were convinced that it was actually written by one of them. our friends, stereotypical teenage boy. This film has topless women, an unfortunate false gore, and a dialogue that couldn't speak his way out of a paper bag, or in this case, a corn field. If I could ask the filmmaker one thing, it would be; "How much did you pay to the teenager who wrote it to you?"
