It starts pretty well, but after a while you start to expect more from this movie than you actually get. Everything becomes unclear and unclear. Czech filmmakers were good 20 years ago. But after they have moved to the capitalist country, here is the Czech unofficial but well-known mentality ... COPYING ... COPYING ... COPYING ALL THAT ARE GOOD TO SEE IN OTHER FILMS OR COUNTRIES OR OTHERWHERE. I think it is a good example of making "art" and "politics" and "horror" and "humor" and "movie" and money. I'm left with flying over the cuckoo's nest, which cannot be compared to this ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS movie. I think this movie is boring. You could do it better. At least they tried. Sorry, guys. :-( MUST NOT recommend
