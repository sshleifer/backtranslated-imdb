This can be all you need to know to decide if you want to see this. The movie is bad. Really, really bad. And sometimes it seems that he realizes it and makes fun of how bad it is. It aligns clichés to clichés and even gets worse as it goes along with some moments that are bad enough to be funny. <br /> <br /> If you can laugh about the really bad quality of screenwriting and production values, you can enjoy it. Otherwise get ready for serious brain damage. <br /> <br /> 3/10
