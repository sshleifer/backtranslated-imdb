I am quite surprised to see that this film has also received lukewarm reviews, and I have found that this film is terrible. The plot flounders around trying to decide whether it's a comedy or a thriller, then realizes that it can't reach either. So she throws it in a towel and continues with his absurd conspiracy highlighted by an unintentional merry scene with Laura Linney, an injection and spilled coffee that leaves the audience uncomfortably twisting in their seats looking at each other like it's for real? Basically, it's totally nonsensical and really disappointing for Robin Williams fans, and you think someone blackmailed Laura Linney into adding this piece of waste to her otherwise decent CV. I wanted to leave after 10 minutes and I wish I could see it for free. I wanted someone to pay me for wasted time. The computer glitch / twist in this movie was embarrassingly stupid, and you don't care about who wins the election to the end. I vote for DVD.
