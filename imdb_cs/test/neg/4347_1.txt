I had no idea what movies were about, jumps from the plot line to plot lines that are intermittently linked. It just doesn't make sense. The chopped timeline will also not help. we will begin to get the flash back to the past and then return to the future just to return to the past. offender, "you can't have me in my death", lines, "you don't even love me enough" line. clich√© to max! Although the moon company was quite interesting. in fact, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, if possible, avoid it. This commentary is hard to follow, the movie would be just as bad.
