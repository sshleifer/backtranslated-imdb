The horrible "comedy" in which a beautiful, crazy woman (Liv Tyler) "comedically" destroys the lives of three men (Matt Dillon, Paul Reiser and John Goodman). Dillon hires a man to kill him (Michael Douglas). What's wrong with comedy? 2001 brought some of the worst comedies ever (Saving Silverman, Sugar and Spice, Freddy Got Fingered, Tomcats, etc.). This is one of the worst. There is no single, repetitive, or even fun moment. Jokes are either stupid, indecent, smutty or real. There is also a strong hatred for women in this garbage - the only major female character (Tyler) is constantly used as a sexual object. Extreme bloody violence is thrown at the end. The only bearable moments come from Reby McEntire as psychiatrist and Andrew Dice Clay in two roles - both psychos. Dillon, Goodman, and Reiser have reached a record low career - the only way to go is up. And poor Tyler! Did she do intelligent, gutsy independent movies for THIS? A DOUGLAS ???? What was it when he agreed? A complete piece of crap - avoid ALL COSTS !!!!!!!!!!
