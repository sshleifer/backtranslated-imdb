The cat in the hat is just a slap in the face film. Mike Myers as a Cat in a Hat is absolutely funny and Mike Myers couldn't get any worse. This is his worst movie ever. I mean, how could they do the most popular stories of Dr. Seuss in the film and be one of the worst movies of all time and such disappointment. I couldn't see the worst movie than this, maybe Baby Geniuses. But this movie is so bad that I can't even describe how badly they made this movie. Bo Welch should be fired or writer.
