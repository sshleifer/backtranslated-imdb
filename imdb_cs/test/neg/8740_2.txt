After watching this movie, I can only wonder why the film was made. This was undoubtedly one of the worst films I've ever seen and had no cure features. If it were to be funny, then it could be a very weak comedy, but the action thriller was terrible. Slow, no conspiracy, no real action, nothing close to good dialogue and I have no idea about characters. What else should I say. Avoid.
