I considered this film a great disappointment, especially with regard to the cast. The characters are not believable, as are the absurd circumstances in which they are found. The only part I enjoyed was when the most unpleasant characters were finally killed. Special effects consist mainly of scenes of dead or dying bodies. A typical unimaginable dude. It is hard to believe that it is impossible to believe that a creature creeping on goats in the middle of the night can be captured by a group of clumsy noisy idiots. It was equally impossible to believe that they knew they were supposed to find them, despite the fact that the creature avoided capture or even photography. our one-dimensional Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito). All that Dr. Foam obsessed with creature is his arrow weapon. The dart gun that works was mere balls failing. The ship's captain (John Rhys-Davies) is introduced as a 'war veteran'. She employs her military prowess by shooting at men, no matter where they were. Navy Seals that come out of nowhere, repeat the pattern of shooting at everything. Dylan Neal plays an insurance investigator aboard a cruise ship to catch a thief. He spends most of the film's brands with anyone trying to kill the creature at the moment. Creation does not even resemble Chupacabra. It doesn't even behave. Instead of a small, shy, secret animal hunting for stealth at night, we get bulletproof Freddy Kruger who kills everything in sight. A simple Google search would be very useful for writers and special crew effects.
