This movie is upset. Playing is worse than the movies we shot when we were 10 years old with a video camera, the effects look like a computer game 80 years and the plot is worse than terrible. Even the worst films of Van Damme make this look lousy. The accent and speech rhythm of "bad boys" is so bad that it's funny .. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you were a big fan of one of the actors. 1 out of 10.
