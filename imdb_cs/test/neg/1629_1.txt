Even MST3K couldn't do this painful, long and eventually stunning little or funny fun. While most bad movies in and of themselves are cheerfully bad, this is one of the few videos that use the word wrong in their literal sense. The element that makes it so PAINFUL to observe is not a lack of story, but the fact that SOOOO a lot of background is crammed into the first half hour is absolutely ridiculous and harder to watch than the freeway when driving without headlights. The hero of the movie, Ator, is nothing but eye candy for this literal energy vacuum cleaner. Dressed in lumbar and sports "pits like melons", as Joel said, they are more in the fitness magazine than here. I would recommend it ONLY to die and think stubborn followers of cheese. If you have an enemy, we recommend this movie. If you can do it, I'll compliment you. You should be able to do it through anything.
