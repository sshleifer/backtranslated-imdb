This movie "Vampires: The Turnning" is not even really worth 2 out of 10 I give it. The film is very predictable from start to finish when our hero kills the Vampire killers. The use of music in this movie was even bad, as if you were waiting for something significant in any second, even if it never did. Playing, at best B-Rank ... And the movie was just boring. The only reason I gave this movie 2 out of 10 is that the story had the potential, even though it ended up incapable of delivering. And did I mention the closet? The wardrobe for this movie was of course cheap to "non-existent" because our hero, and his girlfriend (who is trying to save the whole movie), wears the same clothes throughout the movie. I would recommend this movie only if it is really bored, and you should not have a good wall with fresh paint so you can watch it dry. Dave, the cowboy of horror
