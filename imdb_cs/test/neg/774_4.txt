it might be better, but it was fine ... it helped me get away from my boredom. I didn't even want to see it, the only reason I wanted to rent it is because Jamie Martz is in it .. he's an unknown actor, but he's shining and is the highlight of the movie ... the end was so terrible and the acting was good for ab film ... I give it 4 out of 10
