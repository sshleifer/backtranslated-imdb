Wow, this movie was terrible. It's so simple. It's actually the first time I ever remembered coming out. But it turned out to be all right: I had a very nice conversation with the two most beautiful girls while we all waited for the rest to finally give up the bullshit they called "film". <br /> <br /> Where to start. Bad behavior, bad jokes. Faecal humor I just can't stand. Sorry, snot, pee and scat are not * funny. Did you see the cover picture? The scene actually stretches for about five minutes, with both "heroes" beating each other and muttering, which in itself should be funny. It's not. Apart from body fluids, violence and dressing, I don't remember much about it. At least not very good. I was really, really disappointed with this piece of garbage. Or let us be honest: since I am actually a big fan of "British" (ie Black) humor, I was angry. So, I want my advice? Three words: do not look.
