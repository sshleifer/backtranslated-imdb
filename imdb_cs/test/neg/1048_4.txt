Frankly, I'm not impressed, it's not a bad movie, but it's not a big one. There is a story that needs to be narrated, but it is said in a very incoherent way that makes them full of meaning and ability to intrigue. This movie could be created in a different way with excellent results, the story is so interesting, but somehow I watched it while watching. It's definitely not an amateur movie, rather the opposite and some scenes are really emotional. Actors and actresses have a pretty good job, so do the director, but there is just something so unfinished the whole movie that I can't quite put my finger on. Perhaps if you learned more about the characters, all of the film's "mess" could be better clarified and more "action" because it was that it became slow from time to time.
