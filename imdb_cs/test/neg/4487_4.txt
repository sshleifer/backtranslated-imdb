I was looking forward to seeing two young young actors in "Dear John," but it was very slow; and I felt that both the script and the direction hinder the flexibility of the principal artists. I usually like the film adaptations of these novels. Ironically, I thought the movie did a great job showing realistic military action. The camera was very good at segueing through love letters, focusing only on the keyword or phrase in each letter. I felt that Channing Tatum was involved in what had become a very hang-dog series in response to loss.
