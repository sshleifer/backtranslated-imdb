I didn't see Ishtar, but I was unlucky to see Kevin Costner's mailman. It is worse. Maybe I've ever seen the absolute worse piece of waste and if you look at my review for the Moulin Rouge? it says something. Bad conspiracy, acting was substandard and even unnecessary (although yes, Michael Keaton was in the worst movies I've ever seen), and this film has no redeeming value for anyone with more than half the brain. DO NOT SHOW THAT THE GRADE IS SET UP 4. GRADE, as you will find, insult your intelligence.
