This film suffers from the fact that for years Hollywood had no idea how to pack Jackie Chan for the masses. His low-budget Hong Kong movies were all fast-paced kinetic thrillers that emphasize his amazing gymnastic skills and talent for light comedy. His early Hollywood movies got stuck in the same movies that were packaged for Stallone or Chuck Norris. There is nothing in this movie about the character of Chan, which requires him to be an Asian character, except that he is a star. In his Hong Kong movies Chan is never boring, with movies being one fast-fire martial arts sequence after another, but "protector" is without life through. Danny Aiello doesn't have much to do with it, and the lack of chemistry between the two is probably more the result of the script and direction than the two actors got together. Both were better at worse movies. Best on film is setting in Hong Kong. The worst part is the scary way Jackie Chan is so colorless and drab. It wouldn't be until he finally learned how to make a good movie of Jackie Chan in the West.
