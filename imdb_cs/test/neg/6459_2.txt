This movie was recommended to me by one of my friends who filmed, so I was expecting something good. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the first half - ah, of a film about how the young were revenge for their boss, how original - and watched the other half in the fast forward, hoping to find something to justify - I passed unnecessarily. But all I got was the end of the shock ... <br /> <br /> The basic problem is that it is a movie that seems unable to decide what it wants to say and says what it says: to say what it is) wrong. Great acting does not impose a bad script full of characters I can't care about. Now maybe, if I wasn't a moonlight in the film industry, I'd be shocked to discover stupid politics and exploitation happening behind the screen, but as my feelings are, they're summed up above: "Ho Hum." 2/10 ... would be 1/10 if it wasn't for playing and the cut paper scene.
