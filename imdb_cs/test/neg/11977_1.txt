That was a shame on FarCry I had a lot of expectations, but everything ended up in a nightmare. In addition to the bad effects of visual effects, the stunt story even the humor used in the film was an absolute flop. The film is not worth watching. The funniest thing was when the girl came in and kissed Jack to give him the cuff key. Guess he's still holding the keys. I hope a good director will once remake this fantastic game into a movie. And I invest some good money to make the visual effects right and the right scenarios as well as the right ACTING. But until then do not waste your time trying to watch this movie because it will surely make you mad if you are a FarCry lover.
