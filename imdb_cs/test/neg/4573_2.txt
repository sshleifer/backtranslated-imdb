I love a strange animation, I love many Asian movies, but I didn't love this particular Japan product. The Fuccons are probably an American family (they are all dummies) who have moved to Japan, and they are somewhat 50's sitcom type family, with somewhat more modern feelings at times. The DVD contains some very short episodes (as well as less than 5 minutes?) And I didn't consider them fun or entertaining, even in a strange way. I'm not sure what this appeal is. I picked up some satire, gosh, who wouldn't, but the satire is usually somewhat funny, right? And nothing I saw or heard was a little grinning. I chose it used and certainly SOUNDED appealing, but I think it either lacks a point or it's just plain LAME. The box even says it's Fuccon cheerful, right on the front, but I'd like to be different. 2 out of 10.
