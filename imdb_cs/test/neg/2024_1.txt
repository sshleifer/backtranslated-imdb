Did I see a worse movie? No, I can't say I do. That was pathetic. If the director is still alive: 1. He shouldn't be. 2. He should be ashamed. 3. God, how do I want to take my unnecessary hours for my two hours on his $. <br /> <br /> To give you a few pointers to "movie": <br /> <br /> 1. (I'm a man) and I'd rather make a piece of paper before opening my urethra before looking again (seriously). 2. He has several well-known names (Casper Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio). They do not help them and their cinema career after this "movie" is officially closed. 3. Dialogue is the worst I've ever heard. "I want to ejaculate in the kisses." What writer did they have on this film? Still using crocheted phonics and just mixed up with letters to make these horrible sentences? "Or was he trying to get the director to be killed by just a few people who saw it?" 4. Watch this movie back. Because I recommend you PROMISE that you don't want to look ahead. 5. This "movie" would make Helena Keller stand up and leave the theater. 6. The movie file looks like an adult McDonald's playplace. I was just waiting for this so-called "Dracula" to be in the ball at some point in the movie. <br /> <br /> 7. I also like the fact that in the year 3000 they still have ear-phones that go into the mouth. No bluetooth, no wireless headsets, no chips placed in the brain, but they use a microphone borrowed from a telemarketing agency that ended in 1983. reading this.) <br /> <br /> 8. I don't know who was in charge of special effects, but I could do better in my backyard with my VHS camcorder that doesn't have a battery. 9. I was a devout Catholic before this "movie". But because I see it, I know he's not God, because if he was there, he wouldn't want to make this movie. I'm an atheist now. 10. I'll be honest, I can't talk about the end. Last time I tried to explain that I was unconscious. But people are bored, whether they are curious (or brave), but many are laughing to get out of this movie, please. DO NOT FIND THIS. Literally ruined my life. Avoid all costs! Director's comment: I hate you. You ruined my life. After viewing, I feel inside. My wife and children left me and hates me because I didn't even see it. I lost my job, my dignity, and above all my pride. I will never forgive you in this life or in the next (which does not look good from my new beliefs).
