This foamy romantic comedy is based on the kind of story I loved as a teenager, but now it's somewhat disgusting. In the case of the commandments of May to September, the elderly are undoubtedly thinking of either lust or the inability to face the reality of aging, or both. And the younger is most likely looking for a kind parent who is missing as a child. These basic agendas seem to me to be more pathetic than romantic. there is also something rather predatory about them. Dick Powell looked a little embarrassed - just as he should - playing an older lover in this stupid story. At the age of fifty, he tried to play the role of a thirty-eight-year-old man who was romancing a teenager. But young Debbie Reynolds was a knockout - pretty and dazed and full of vinegar - as a bad seventeen-year-old as a "gift" to a morally upright and honest screenwriter, as a subject for his study. Her spirited performance set me off better than she deserved. Anne Francis was cast as a beautiful but fragile fianc√©e, Powell, and skillfully mastered her little role. Some of the dialogues were also fun, so it's not a total washout. <br/> 5/10
