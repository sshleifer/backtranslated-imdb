My first question, NOT a terrible act, not a terrible writing, it's overhead. The choices made about cinema are some of the worst decisions I've ever seen. Why must every bad man die in slow motion? I was going to beat the rubber hose. Camera images do so by not seeing what is happening. I was probably about to turn off the movie for Jalal Merhi's accent when he got on the sex scene, so I thought it might be better, but not. If you rate special effects on rating scale A, B, C, would I have to put it around W or so, and did I mention acting? Wow, it was bad !!! A WORST section of the whole "Expect DIE" experience is an obvious abuse of the phrase on the cover that is: "MATRIX JUST GOT DEADLIER". comparing this movie with Matrix is ​​easy WORST comparison I have seen EVER. If you haven't seen this movie, Don't if you're looking for a good reason to beat your head against the wall.
