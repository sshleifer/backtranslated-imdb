... but I would lie. The relative was a crew member and for a few days we had to watch the production of this film (and I was extra). I'm gonna die and have a little time on the screen, not that I intend to move to Hollywood soon. I thought it was amazing to see how films were made and part of them. In addition, I received a copy of the film once it was finally released. They did not have a studio background when making this film, so it was truly independent. Why is writing and playing so horrible is behind me, but the main character "Cherry" is the director's sister, so she could be a part of it. But cinematography was good. :)
