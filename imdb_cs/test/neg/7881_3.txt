How to make a film as provocative as possible? This cartoonish straight shock is attempting to have two low-life women in Paris (one prostitute, one recently raped ex-porn actress, no less), to go out and go for national sex-and-killing spree- especially men. Very short running time gives you a hint of the experimental nature of this violently "Thelma & Louise" - but it is done without irony or contemplation for any possible feminist message ... And because we don 't have too much to the protagonists, violence is actually muted and numb - and maybe it's a good thing. As a liberal advocate of freedom of speech, I always welcome the "serious" film industry dare to embrace full sex scenes. But the question is: Does it work for the film as a whole? It's good? Here, not much, even though we got a new meaning of the phrase "shot in the ass"! <br /> <br /> 3 of 10 from Ozjeppe
