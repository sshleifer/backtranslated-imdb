I got this movie on a DVD with the title Evil Never Sleeps, which provides cover on Carrie Ann Moss's front page, but plays so little that I didn't notice it in the movie. I'm afraid I consider this one of the worst purchases I've ever made. The dialogue was set out and a wooden van, and I found it to be disconnected from the land. Graham's performance for me was someone asking if she left the gas at home. All my wife and I have found that this movie is painful when I watch it, and it's not a valuable addition to my collection, watching it at my peril, but spending 90 minutes with nails pulled would probably was a better way to spend your time.
