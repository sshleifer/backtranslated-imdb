"Flood" is a prime example of how throwing good actors and cgi will do little to film to cope with waste. The basic assumption is okay: what if a terrible storm threatens to send the sea directly across the Thames, flood barriers and engulf London so quickly that most people would never get on time? It's basically a segment of New York's "The Day After Tomorrow," but it shouldn't be any less than a movie. However, the script is not. It is only functional, flat and lacking in depth. Great British talents like Robert Carlysle and David Suchet name two, but they do best with what they have, but their characters are two-dimensional cyphers, like something from Marvel's old comic book. and it would be frankly easier to return the tide. Not that every actor got out of the hook - Tom Courtenay seemed capable of only one emotion in the whole movie, but then he wasn't given a big challenge. <br /> <br /> I appreciate every opportunity to see some of the others -Hollywood disaster is changing for a change, and I do not expect a trillion dollars to spend on rendering ultra-realistic graphics. However, there is no excuse for writing rushes - especially from a country that has made some of the best fantastic science fiction stories ever created without any budget. This is the kind of harsh B-class fluff that the Sci-Fi channel produces, and that's hardly the target to focus on. If, like me, you are such a catastrophe fan that you are still tempted, do yourself a favor and watch it with your friends. Even better; do not bother.
