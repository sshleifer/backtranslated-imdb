On a flight from London, I watched it be the Man; Apparently Air Canada has a film policy. Maybe it's not the best way to start reviewing this movie. Amanda Bynes plays a girl who loves football so much that she pretends to be her twin to get to boarding school team around town. Even if you control your mind at the door (on a 6-hour flight), the story is unlikely and ridiculous. There are some moments of humor, mostly from David Cross comedian as a principle, but a complicated love polygon really does not inspire emotions, though is cleverly mixed (with a warning of thoughtless veracity). The end is just as absurdly absurd as the rest. I think if I were a twelve-year-old girl, maybe I really enjoyed it.
