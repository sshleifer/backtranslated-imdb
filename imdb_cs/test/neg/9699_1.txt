I spent quite a while and went through all the reviews of this movie. I am in complete agreement with almost every reviewer that Noah's Ark is stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! Do NBC managers have no class? I feel bad on my stomach that I really watched both parts of this mini series. The script is so stupid, so useless, and yes, absolutely idle! I understand that I've made some changes for dramatic purposes, but this movie has changed almost everything in the story. God himself will try to kill the entire Earth population, but somehow he misses one man who sails around and tries to sell things to Noah. Give me a break! And what about Noah's sons, who act like Indiana Jones, save the girls in need? If all that is not bad is the part where God apologizes to Noah and says, "I'm sorry Noah, I was wrong". Newsflash NBC, GOD CAN'T BE INDEPENDENT! This film is the most tasteless and shameful biblical film ever made.
