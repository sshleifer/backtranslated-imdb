I saw it on Sci Fi and in retrospect I'm not sure how I did it. That's a waste. This is not film B, it is "D" at best. Basically it is a gloomy job that looks on horseback (and sometimes not on one) and kills everything in the way somewhere in the west. America. Lots of people are missing (infact murdered) and a lot of mismatched spec op types of go to look for them. The best part of this movie, I'll say it now, there are some really cute girls. Let me now spoil it by telling you that everyone except the smallest cute ones will either cut off their heads, cut themselves off, or hit such a strong weapon that the head will explode. This is not a spoiler ... Gore is on top of this movie and really grotesque. It has no real purpose, either. <br /> <br /> Here's what's good: Sets look fine, actors sometimes act well, clothes and props, some of them are decent. Everything else you can think of will piss. A lot of badness is in the making. Sometimes it just moves from a quick action scene to a real, quiet and dormant scene. Characters sometimes do incomprehensible things and always divide, but not as the viewer can watch them. It seems that they will split up without realizing it among themselves, but it also seems that everyone knows that they are constantly sharing and are fine, even if they are in a really dangerous situation and there are bodies everywhere and people are dying right and left. Nothing in this movie is the least reliable, most of them are incoherent and confusing, and I really don't get how this immortal, indestructible bad guy killer was finally stopped and honestly, I don't care. Too many stupid, merry bad nonsense is happening during this movie and I don't really care about putting it all here. And all this is so hard all the time of suffering when it's almost ridiculously bad ... just awful. This film is a complete waste of time. There is no excuse to watch this, if the only channel that gets you is SciFi and you're bound to a chair in front of the TV. But if you're not tied, you'd rather do a crossword puzzle, throw a Frisbee, or just think. There's a lot of much better B movies you can watch. My older high school year, my friend and myself, in visual communication and in the deign class, made a long movie trailer of our own movie type (There was no full movie, just a really long trailer) and we did a better job of filming and editing the work with the premiere. It was a better job than this movie. It really says something about it, and I'm confused and worried why Sci Fi would show something like that when there are so many good low price movies that can show up. The only movie I ever endured was that it was worse than Raptor Island (another brilliant SciFi job) - though it had a smoother and more traceable flow than this movie - but it comes very close and is definitely 2. on my list of worst movies I've ever seen.
