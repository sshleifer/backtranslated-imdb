He must not be confused with Michael Ritchie's ugly false bond of 1975, this "Smile" is an example of the good intentions that pave the way to hell. The film copies two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to grow on a face-deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and TV-spawned Malibu family act "Gidget to get birth control." Katie (Mika Booram, third pair of Olsen) plays a corrupt, self-dropped college remote from reality. Her teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China to show students how to work with deformed children. The film uses deformation as a means of tension by treating Ling as a Frankenstein monster. Kramer keeps covering his deformity with hats, hoods and placing the camera. This approach uses the quality of the madness that is contained in the material. It may be inconvenient as society looks at it and Kramer's answer is to cover it up to the great revelation. Why disturb your audience with such annoyance? At the end, we see her face briefly, and only minutes before the final shots, after the operation, she reveals the swan under the harp. It's not good enough to give a girl a reason to live; what is necessary is Ling is as hot and popular as Katie. The funding of the film comes from the trust that Roy Rogers and Dale Evans have founded. They imagined a heritage of quality family films. Give me "Son of Paleface" every day.
