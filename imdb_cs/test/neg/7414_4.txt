Bigfoot movies tend to be bad, so I'm not willing to watch them. However, there were some good ads on the Sci-Fi channel, so I decided to watch. A mountaineering expedition is heading to the Pacific Northwest to find a fallen aircraft carrying the expedition leader's daughter (played by Lance Hendrickson) and brought a revolutionary DNA detector that could be used to prove the existence of sasquatch. And, in fact, it first raises some tension. Sasquatch is invisible but sees the body heat of mountain climbers (like an alien in "Predator"), and I wondered when it went. Acting is clear as well as background music. The dense wooded area is well used. And when the creature is finally seen, the costume is not bad, though nothing big. But as the film grows, it becomes increasingly unpleasant and absurd. Most of the characters are unpleasant people, rude to each other and only in a quest for money and publicity (except for the character of Lance Hendrickson), so it's impossible to worry about what happens to them. And their behavior is getting stupid. One person shoots a creature (not mortally), then gets drunk and sits alone in the dark. One woman camper lays on the slinky silk negligee before crawling into her sleeping bag, then barely escapes to be dragged into the sasquatch forest without her hair and makeup going wrong. Survivors then concluded that sasquatch was indeed a DNA detection machine and would let them live if they left it behind ("the creature knows what threatens it"). Of course, instinct does not apply to these actors, or they would not appear in this movie. And the end is so stupid you'll want to kick the TV screen. If it wasn't for the script, it would be a decent horror movie.
