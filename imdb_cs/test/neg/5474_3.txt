Devil's men represent what turned out to be one of the last glimpses of the occult obsession of a horror scene from the 1970s, when Halloween came up, tore the rule book, lit it and kicked in the gaudy window. Br /> <br /> To shorten the long story of a brief couple of enterprising Greek filmmakers who like their chances of approaching a new film series with an unlikely double act of an effeminate, wisely speaking American investigator Milo and a stuffy but kind Father. Roche. The exile nobleman is mixed in some satanic advancement - offering the victims victims an extremely erratic portrait of a minotaur, and only Milo and Roche can stop him! Or something like that. But the reality is terribly boring, frustrating and full of unnecessary opportunities. I strongly believe that the emerging filmmakers have thrown most of the budget for the acquisition of Donald Plesance, Peter Cushing and Brian Ene (for the soundtrack) on board, and hoped it would be enough to make the audience in the English-speaking world enough. <br /> <br /> Not. Devil's Men looks beautiful with confidence, camera and fantastic places. Eno's score, though basically only one drone chord, which he probably cranked out in the afternoon, is properly atmospheric, and the film is loaded with a cracked 70s crumpet including that Austrailian species from Fawlty Towers and uber hottie Jane Lyle from the Island of Shame Death. But there ends the positive. Cushing sleepwalks through it, looking like having a corn cob with his ass and pleasance fuss about how he tries his best but never quite enough stuff right. To make matters worse, the character of Milo is terribly fragile and unlikely. Good, so it doesn't look so good. But from here the film simply refuses to go anywhere. There is a hint that local villagers are obsessed, but to be fair to them, never really anything but shuffle looking glassy eyes. Maybe they were just tired? Just when you are sure that things will come to a head, Milo and Roche interrupt Baron's Satanic party with laughter and send him to meet his creator. The minotaur statue is silent and hey presto! Satan is defeated. <br /> <br /> Sure. The indecisive optimism that Devil's Men might be the first in a series of films is the murderous result of Father Roche's last line. ridiculously rushed end. "Who knows Milo? Maybe someday I can call you again to help defeat the Antichrist." I'm sure you'll give the call on any day, Donald.
