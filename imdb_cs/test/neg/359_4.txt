A man with a golden arm (film) is a decent career vehicle for Frank Sinatra, but he does not succeed as a good adaptation of a fantastic book. You will always learn how the books "change" when they are in movies - things are cut out, stupid, etc. Well, you can't even say that "with the film" they changed something - they just said a completely different story. Characters and environments are the same, but ambiguous characteristics, depth of men and women in Chicago's book in the book. When it comes to the environment, it is just a game stage, supplemented by an unnecessary "supportive role" of players who go too claudophobic, the inner outer streets. The film is a clumsy, completely different view of Frankie Machine and drug addiction. When that happens, Zosh, Frankie, Sparrow, all lose their psychological lead. Frankie's drumming, a modest dream in the book, becomes his full passion in the film (probably because Sinatra is a musician). And drug addiction is considered shlock, exploitavely. Acting is decent, especially snakelike Louie, who is more threatening in the film than the book. But it's just a shame that this kind of movie can be heralded as a classic next to a book that's "based on" the real Frankie Machine story. The movie goes just to show Hollywood can "get anything without it dumbing down and adding a happy ending." In this case, they completely changed it, making the important and realistic story of Hollywood fluff cheaper. I'm sure when I read the book first, I can't handle the film honestly because I know how good the book is. Actually, I was thinking about turning off the movie (and never doing it) just to get my stupid conspiracy confused by the beauty of the book. But it's an overrated movie, and although it's not that bad, the book should be the first one because it was the first. And it was to be the only story of Street and Frankie Machine.
