The feminist tract, in which the viewer believes that: i) wild animals are rarely tamed by singing, but instead attack, kill and eat (the line that the grizzlies never think of, if not provoked, it is horror - if "provoked" does not mean that they see meat); ii) homosexuality is in itself immoral - and its acceptance almost always associated with history of the decay of society and disintegration iii) few women are bisexual (in which case virtually every woman is presented as a woman who has no preference for men or women) iv) divorce is much worse than infidelity v) the earth is there for human beings to use, develop and enjoy vi) it is the duty of an adult son's mother to stay in touch as it is on her son vii) mother's upbringing her son is unhappy and the real tragedy for the child viii) the idolization of the parent for valuable ideals is a good and healthy thing ix) adults continue to be responsible for their sexual behavior regardless of their age and the duty to engage in the most intimate and giving acts only within the most intimate and openly sacrificing relationship: Marriage - Believe Me, This Movie You Don't Like! Basically it's Howard Stern a kind of guy who is shot down by Jane Fonda's wife (I mean The Electric Horseman). It's an ugly thing because values, ideals, scenarios are so harmful. I share further objections about special things in writing: a) why would this man lose every girlfriend he has - because he refuses to reveal that his mother's death and funeral have caused him to not keep up with them? It's a mystery why he just says it was personal when they were struggling with angry and disappointed women. HUH? b) there is a huge inconsistency (ie the screenwriter wants it in both directions) by telling us that the protagonist's mother loved her father with all she had - and then only one big one told us love in her life - her lesbian girlfriend. c) The basic legal assumptions are nonsense. We have never said that the bailiff has the right to live on property - only to determine the timing of the title of the sole heir and the right to occupy that property. The film seems to be a bailiff who is a legitimate resident - which is crazy. (Try to think of any executor of any will that uses decedent property before the wills are fulfilled - that will not happen). d) The premise of this film is that women are equally drawn to men and women - it's just absurd. So we said: (i) that Penelope Ann Miller's character dates back to the other men at the end of the film - after having been with the decedent for five years - and before doing so with the protagonist, (ii) the hero's housekeeper after having her she spent her adult life with her kind husband - now she goes with another woman iii) that one girlfriend angry at the protagonist would now "want to try a woman". iv) that a male transsexual desires to date the protagonist v) that Mary Kay Place's character naturally looked at other women in college ("and they looked back", says with idiotic triumphant flip of the head). That's just ridiculous. <br /> <br /> I agree with others about DVD audio (I had to keep it at maximum volume and rewind to understand names, phrases). It's a movie of someone who really despises the traditional heroism of any person, hates the idea that one needs to raise a child, hates the idea that there is a necessary link between marriage and sex. The film is preaching - and this kind of false message propaganda doesn't fit well.
