There is a famous story about a man who becomes a prey to a hunter safari who has lost interest in hunting anything besides humans. Its pretty good, and it has been done and redone in film and television many times. Some are remarkable, but this urbanized version that injects tired old racist motifs will simply wipe out the stink. Leguizam's grotesque is almost as weak as an unreal scenario. Chaplin, this guy isn't. There must be people who find a dwarf who can't stop dancing funny, I think it's funny in a pathetic crazy way, but it's not enough to carry a movie. Do you have the usual Nazi supporters or neo-Nazis, what the hell do you think, the type of villain who is, of course, a homosexual son, a German accent ... get a picture?
