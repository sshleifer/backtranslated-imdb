This is absolutely out of the question of the worst movie I've ever seen. It's so bad in the fact that I plan to rent it again when I find it. This film makes the 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' look like an Oscar candidate. Just looking at the actor wants me to laugh out loud. I can't say a lot of bad things about this movie. It's a terrible approach to perfection. The plot is based on a terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon in San Francisco (I think). It's as far as I can go ... I laugh too hard. I know it shouldn't be funny, but ..... * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL * <br /> <br /> MOVE BEFORE ED WOOD !!!
