The film is nothing but exposure to nudity. Did anyone notice that all three main female characters look naked? It seems that the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some (if not much) nudity of the local stars, along with the slang that is being repelled by horror in contemporary Portuguese society. If you watch Portuguese movies on Portuguese TV, they all included a "hot" scene from the movie. I'm not saying that a Portuguese company is stolen; just that the film industry doesn't seem to be able to find other ways of success. Returning to the film ... There is nothing left of the spirit of the book, which is a masterpiece. The film could be good if the real idea of ​​the book (news at any time) and not the strictly erotic part were emphasized. He had almost all the ingredients ... but the "chef" was terrible ...
