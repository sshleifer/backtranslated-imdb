The fact that the film is on DVD does not guarantee that its quality is very good. The fact that the quality of the film is toothless does not mean that you should not buy it. This review concerns two movies paired on one DVD. The lands of these films are of little significance. Are they interesting only for people who collect Holmes movies? Anyone who wants just a few of the better offers would have bought some of those made by Jeremy Brett? or, at the top, Basil Rathbone. Are there several other very good Holmes movies with good actors on one basis? "Seven to Cent Solutions" or "Sherlock Holmes Private Life". In any case, these films are much less predictable. Here we have some movies that show the best actors who do Holmes, even though the results are disappointing. This seems to be the only disk with these movies on it (though "Deadly Necklace") appears itself in the same version on other disks. 1962, although it does not look or sound. Some who have seen it may be surprised to learn that it is Hammer Studios. Not that Hammer didn't come up with things, but where Christopher Lee was involved, they usually did a better job. Print direct transmission from a slightly worn 1: 1.33 copy in black and white. The color quality indicates that the original may be in color, and the fragments of the end of the film suggest that it might have been 1: 1.66 or more. The film is shown at the beginning of the 20th century. Century? it is not unlikely because Holmes was still working (and actually died until 1957). However, the script is not modified from any real Doyle story. Includes an Egyptian necklace and Professor Moriarty appears as a world-renowned archaeologist and prince of crime. The story is melodramatic and banal. The biggest defect of this movie is, isn't it? for any incomprehensible reason? Hammer made it in Germany. It was nevertheless filmed in English. It was then dubbed in German and then re-dubbed in English. So what you hear is not Lee or any of the original actors, but a bunch of strangers? No, outside Lee, I doubt anyone knowing any of the other actors. That's too bad because Lee (see his "Hound of the Baskervilles") is quite a decent Holmes. As it is, his double voice is condescending and free of raisin-free bread pudding or cinnamon. Music for this film is primarily jazz, in a possible attempt to be a "time". Too bad nobody knew ragtime. As it is, music does not concern what is happening on the screen, and is often at odds with the action. Another movie is "(Sherlock Holmes a) Speckled Band" from 1931, played by young Raymond Massey. The picture and sound quality is fully at the level of the 1962 effort and actually a little better. Massey makes quite respectable Holmes, though he definitely does not own a role in the way Rathbone did and Brett does. It is unlikely that other readers taking part in this production will be interested in modern readers. Playing ?? as is the case with many films of this period? She owes the post-Victorian scene and the silent films. It should be noted that while "The Deadly Necklace" is available on the DVD itself, "The Speckled Band" is only available with the former movie. There is little about this movie. The settings seem to be a special combination of the 1890s (horse-drawn carriages) and 1920s (electronic devices such as the primitive dictaphone). All in all, it is an interesting curiosity and a sufficient incentive to buy a pairing DVD rather than just a DVD with a Deadly Necklace.
