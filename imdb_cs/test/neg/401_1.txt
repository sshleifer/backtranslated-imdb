My wife and I watched it after DVR'ing it from the Encore event this week. It must be the worst horrible shock that any of us has ever seen. A predictable dialogue (my wife and I were guessing that the lines before they were spoken), hokey special effects, the script that floated everywhere. I think the most annoying part was the stereotyping of different characters in the plot, not to mention the gratuitous sex scene between the two young heroes in the film, none of which had any other purpose than the bare parts. their anatomy for cameras. This film should be categorized as comedy, not horror as film villains (spiders) have been stopping motion animated and unbelievable in the least. I can't say I'd do a better job if I did the movie myself, but it was a very amateur movie, not even a "B" movie, somewhere closer to the movie "d", or "f" if possible. I think Science Fiction 3000 would have to pass it!
