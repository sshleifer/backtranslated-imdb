This movie starts with this scary song that gave me some chills as a song used in "Nightmare on Elmstreet"! It instantly sets the mood! The following procedure also shows what to expect! We are aware that there is a spirit present! The secret about this spirit is what keeps this movie together! But the conspiracy structure is so complicated that it is difficult to understand! Thoughts behind the plot are quite interesting! Only the way we are told is too abstract! I understand that the director believed he had to keep the secret as long as possible! The problem is that when certain matters are revealed, you will never get a satisfactory explanation! Important characters' motives are omitted and some questions raised in the film are not answered at all! Because we don't learn enough about characters, it's hard to take care of them! And as a result, you lose interest! Just some fears and a twist to save this movie from becoming a total failure! Twist is interesting, but no real shock! Experienced viewer will see it! Some reviewers complain that this movie is too "Ringu" and not original! Well, it is true that some of the effects and horrors are borrowed from this movie! But there is a major difference! The tension in "Ring" was mainly based on this one twist, where the viewer finds out how the characters are killed! The "Ryeong" ("Ringu" as) twist is used as a spooky effect to accompany another crazy twist! "Ryeong" heavily relies on a complex structured plot and twist that doesn't contain enough to frighten you! Simply put: It's not a scary movie!
