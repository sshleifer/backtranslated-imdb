Personally, I did not gain power from the ACT OF VIEWING ONE EYES. I noticed a lot of reviews on the movie and I am a little surprised. Maybe I missed something that other reviewers felt "moving", but I found that the movie is pretty boring and basically useless. "Action" of the movie is a bunch of autopsy footage that is filmed in "art-house" style - lots of extreme close-ups, strange adjustments, etc ... and no sound or dialogue. I think ACTIVE VIEW WITH ONE OWN EYES can be seen as a study of human anatomy, or maybe (if you really want to kick a little) some comment on the fragility of humanity or anything - but I personally found it A bunch of semi-interesting but ultimately blunt autopsy shots. If this is yours, then it will be a winner for you. As for me - I've seen more interesting ER recordings. It's not a "bad" movie because it's not really a "movie" in any traditional sense - I just didn't find anything really remarkable - 4/10.
