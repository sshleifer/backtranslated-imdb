I saw this movie because Calexico made a score. Real disappointment. Annoying, trendy scenes, with urban hipsters and their hip life clich√©s. Cheesy stereotypical Mexican border culture (mystical grandfather with rattlesnake and potions, granddaughter in her mariachi-style restaurant). A few laughs, but hipper-thou, and a painfully missing vision and basic film talent.
