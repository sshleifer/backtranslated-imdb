* some possible spoilers * <br /> <br /> Of course, this movie cannot be expected to be as good as the original, a remake rarely. But this remake of one of Hitchcock's greatest movies, Psycho, could have been much better. First, the filmmaker had to be psycho. Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates! What he thinks ?! Unlike the "harmless", almost childish Bates, whom Anthony Perkins could portray, Vaughn seems to be a murderer. In an effort to get his Bates to look innocent, Vaughn ends up playing gay. Many of the other actors seemed not to fit on their part, including Julianne Moore, who doesn't seem to fit into the movie. At the height of cruel casting, cinematography is remarkably shabby, despite the fact that the film scene has been reworked. One thing they added was random shots of a subject, such as clouds or a naked woman, between shots of characters who were murdered. These shots seemed irrelevant to the plot in any case, and in turn made no sense. Overall, this Psycho remake, which may have been a decent image, has instead turned out to be a complete waste of time.
