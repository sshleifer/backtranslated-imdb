The trailer for this film promised a new twist on the zombie genre: setting in the Old West. Of course it's not the real old west. It is some kind of future for the West, in a world where the apocalypse, as it is known, has apocalypse, to kill people and then turn them into zombies. Again it is a zombie virus, people, and you know what that means? Bite and become one of them. A hero comes to this dusty and dead world. He's a hunter who pays off for zombie care. It's not entirely clear who is providing the funds, but there seems to be a small zombie hunting industry. But as the trailer tells us, there's a problem. They're running out of zombies. The only way to earn money is to infect new cities and towns with the virus. I think it's not a bad idea for a movie. But unfortunately it takes a lot more than a good idea and a crowd of people swinging on the windows to make a good zombie movie. What we actually get is Clint Eastwood's clone (the actor is even called Clint, for loud shouting) and his "hilarious" sidekick, who tries to pack zombies while trying to stop some still-living bad guys from getting a big reward. All the subplotations about infecting other cities are mentioned only in the passage, half through the film. Instead, there's a lot of western movie clichés, bad makeup zombies and some bad world class acting. Really bad. The type he wouldn't even do on Hollyoaks. Both the hero and the villain chomp on cigars, tosses are thrown, people bite. As the film concludes, the only thing worth thinking about is whether it ends up with a cliché of a hero who is the only person alive when he kills the one he loves or the cliché that ultimately turns into a zombie. frame. (By the way, it's the first one) Gerald Nott wrote and directed this film. It is the only thing he has done and hopefully it will be his last. At the beginning of the movie is a headline that reads "Nott Entertainment". At least one thing was right.
