Following the 1970 classic horror movie Carrie with this offer, is like Ford succeeding the Mustang with Edsel. This film was terrible in every detail. This would be called Beverly Hill 90210 meets the Mystery Science Theater 3000, but both of them show far beyond this tripe. This film was barely horror. I timed about 3 minutes gore and 90 minutes lame mid shock and ritual. Wow, what a surprise, Carrie's strange friend commits suicide! Wow, Carrie misinterprets her love interests! Wow, the crowd is preparing Carrie! Wow, athletes have sex competition! What this film needed was much more action and much less tired teen clich√©s. This film is absolutely unmistakable.
