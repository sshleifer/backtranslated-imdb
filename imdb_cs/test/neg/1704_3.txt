This film, if done correctly, has such a great potential. Parody movies are always funny, and people tend to like them because they are light hearts, silly and silly, but fun. This movie was fun in some parts, but it could have been more fun. The act itself was fine from all the actors, but ... I was not satisfied. It seemed empty and my collective name says it all about effects. Proper green screens were not used for this movie ... the background was added after it looked awful. No wonder this movie went straight to DVD lol. It wasn't all a total loss, it's funny and gives you a good laugh (AT, not with him most of the time).
