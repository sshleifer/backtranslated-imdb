"How much does he know about this?" ... "Let's keep it that way!" I wonder if it is possible to do some new dialogues or not? The film is a really bad copy of the original. Bruce Willis probably shot this movie while he was asleep. As he looks at Richard Gere's face with a cold-blooded glance as they meet near the harbor ... oh my God! he scared me. Why kills Major Kosl and her friends are not clear to me yet. Another thing I couldn't understand was the solution of the poison he put on the car (what was it in the world?). The film plot is hay and the climax is boring. Another funny thing was how the Russian was killed in the club. I fell from my chair when I saw the scene. Also, what was it about the homosexual .. what purpose it was to serve. I think the movie is too fast to be easy to understand. You really have to think what the hell was meant by the director. LOL. And the best scene after all was Richard Gere, who was trying to keep the post between two fast moving trains. she had no one to lose if she was not in contact with the pillar.
