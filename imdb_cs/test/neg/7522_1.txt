After reading the novel, which is about one hour of reading, this film became a sad disappointment. As in the Egyptian prince, Simon's wells somehow managed to direct the script that removed all of its drama and mystery from its source material and transformed it into this homogenized nonsense. Now I'm crazy about cheese and camp, but this movie doesn't make sense. There was no joy in any of the performances or humor. There was no excitement and that stupid brochure with the addy character of filby throwing a hat in the air was the last hackwriting straw. I felt very broken when this movie ended and I still refuse to believe that it was just 90 minutes that it went forever. I wondered how a studio and director could have such a lousy screenplay, but then a friend sent me a movie just as it was and I said it sounded great, but what happened to the movie.
