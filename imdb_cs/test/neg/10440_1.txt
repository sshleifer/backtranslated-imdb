This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There is no fragment of historical accuracy, in fact reality is reversed. Just one example: Morgan made a living with several ethnic Chinese he met. Acting is at the top, the script is a badly written lie. I've never seen worse fake beards. Hopper arrived in Australia and reportedly shot the film if the script was completely rewritten to be a hero. Since the scenario was ten in flight, it can explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie is. Every movie about Ned Kelly is much better than this movie.
