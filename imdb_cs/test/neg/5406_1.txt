As I wrote, no user reviews are yet, but there are 17 voices with an average of 4.8, so apparently some people thought this movie had its moments. I didn't notice it, and even if I had, I don't think I could stop rolling my eyes long enough to appreciate them. A common debate among film enthusiasts is whether they are big mistakes Science, police tactics and so on, so common in B movies, should significantly discourage enjoyment. I tend to fall into the camp "Yes, that's a sensible reaction" - especially when errors are the focal point of the conspiracy. With this movie I look forward to reading how someone can defend this mess. They completely lose almost every aspect of military tactics and strategy, police tactics, weapons, science, folklore, common sense and human behavior (except B movies, that is.) In short, I can't think of any other Trivial thing they're right about. Any movie would mean to her that his work would be cut out if his supernatural spirit, impenetrable to all small weapons, could be its central prerequisite, which could, if necessary, dissolve into another dimension and yet clearly vulnerable only a bigger explosion. (They don't create ghosts like they used to.) Combine this assumption with every detail that's wrong, and you have a remarkably bad movie.
