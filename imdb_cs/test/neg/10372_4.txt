The first three movies love me absolutely, they were great! I once captured part 5 on VHS 10 years ago and I was disappointed. But maybe it was because I never saw the fourth because they were shot back to back. But after I have finally read the copy today, I must say that it was no better than number 5. My expectations were not high for the beginning, but this is a cheap direct video, not a horror movie, it's PG -13. The action was not convincing, the story was somewhat stupid without any excitement and there were not many. But the main problem is that there were no killings or no gore (the annoying child that is killed in his car was supposed to be the top, but it will come ..) Jeff Burr, who gave us excellent Stepfather II and Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw III Massacre. I liked the puppet master: Legacy, although it was nothing but a tribute to the best scenes from all the movies. Overall, the puppeteer is very similar to Hellraiser: Big Trilogy, but forget the rest.
