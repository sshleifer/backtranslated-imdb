Ed Gein's story is a disturbing and frightening story. Ed was a really bad character, and his legacy continued to inspire such 'greats' as Dental Fairy, Norman Bates, and Leatherface. How is it that such a fascinating person has inspired such a boring dramatic piece of propulsion? Ed Gein made bands of nipples, bowls of skulls, leather lamps, danced under the moon in suits of human skin. None of this got into the film because they needed to give us a fictional story about a ridiculously horrible representative and his rather homely, sex-starved girlfriend. This film seemed to go out of the way to falsify history. What I am sorry about is that most of the movies have gone mad from the path of truth to exaggerate history; this seems to make it minimize it. I just don't get it.
