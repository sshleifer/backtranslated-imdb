When I saw it in the cinema, I recall the first scene about a minute or two thrown into a bad play, then I immediately said "no, it must be better". No. The performances are quite uniformly teak 'n pine and no, there is no sexual chemistry in this film at all, just clumsy posturings reasonably comedic, discreetly talentless actress who seems to have born grace on the cover of "Interviú" and not much else except. If the screenwriter thought that making Mérimée a character was a truly original creative trick, maybe he should get out. Aranda, if he gave things a little more, would realize that the story of Carmen is just CRYING OUT for a thoughtful, iconoclastic, parodic deconstruction, not for the matter - that's your brain - on the turnstile. ersatz passion and comic book dialogue. This is contemporary Spanish cinematography at worst. <br /> <br />
