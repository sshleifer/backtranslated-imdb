It must have been a long time since I saw such a bad movie. I have to say that it's really hard to make a good and / or realistic film about an air disaster, but this film was such a waste of time and money. I also think it's an unofficial way to get a bad reputation on Airbus. First, the cockpit looked a lot like the Airbus cockpit, secondly you have a wand, the third using computers to control the rudders / lifts / ailerons through "fly wire". When I saw this movie, I thought the film's intention was to "not fly computer aircraft like Airbus, instead using Boeing instead have direct steering and rudder connections". <br /> <br /> All I can do is a bad story, terrible acting (most actors), the worst movie trick ...
