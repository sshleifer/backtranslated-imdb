Apparently in early 2005, the SciFi Channel threatened to release incriminating photos that have John Rhys-Davies and said, "We need you to star in another SciFi Original." The horrible thing is he's really damn good at this movie. This is really something he says because he is a silly being SciFi; You have to give it some feel to act well. Unfortunately no one else does. It's your stereotype movie "Moster-run-amok" on a cruise ship. The cryptozoologist wants the creature to stay alive, the Navy SEALs thinks he has everything under control, but they don't know what they're dealing with, and they all end up dead, the girl jumps into the role of "sexpot movie" as Rhys-Davies's daughter and creature maul about 100 friends. What this film is about is very fast and lively; never get bored or wait for another kill. Otherwise, it doesn't mean anything that is different, and it's stupid that this thing is crawling over the ceilings and it can't be hurt by Navy SEAL machine guns, but it can be karate-kicked by Rhys-Davies's daughter. Kinda went back and forth to give this bad boy 5, but for the above stupidity I give it 4.
