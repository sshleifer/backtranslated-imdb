For the first time when I saw it, in HORROR I returned to what was presented as a modern, liberated woman. Sorry, but I can't relate to whining idiots whose lives revolve around sex without love and the acquisition of Gucci, Prada and Louis Vuitton labels. The problem is that some may think that this is how women living in New York live. Definitely not. These women are incredibly shallow and materialistic and, as another reviewer said, behave like a golden hoof. This is not a liberated womanhood and I am glad to be gone. 0 stars and just plain AWFUL
