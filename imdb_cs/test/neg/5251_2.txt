What. Uh ... <br /> <br /> This film is so dissociative and I ruined that I literally lost a bit of my sense after it was over. I'll never be the same person again. I'm trying to put my finger on what's so crazy about it ... It's not just cheerful techno music, or "out of time" medieval / Blade Runner / Wild West / Highlander setting, or weird CGI "Grendel" monster that looks as a man made of animated sausages, or even "Grendel's mother" a monster who looks like some Alabama dancer who grew up claws and tentacles when she stayed in the sunbed for too long. All these things are weird, but what's really the weirdest thing in this movie is acting. I just can't explain it. This scenario is obviously stupid, but the actors radiate deadly esteem. Lambert is always weird and usually boring, but for this one is in Dolph Lundgrin territory: I can't help but just laugh every time she talks. I'll give this film some credit for being totally distracted and crazy, unlike conservative and boring. I will always take a bizarre catastrophe movie over an absolutely average one. Warning: If you are planning to watch Christopher Lambert as Beowulf, be prepared to spend a few hours after going through the streets in some countries. a kind of nightmare, hyperactive catatonic intoxication. It is true. When I was with my spiritual journey with Beowulf, I woke up in the middle of the Siberian tundra in a pool of blood and milk. Next to me was a dead wolf and I later found out that I had a pair of human teeth in my shirt pocket. My copy of VHS Beowulf sat on a hastily built stone altar surrounded by candles and withered flowers. The tape told me to go. I got up and went.
