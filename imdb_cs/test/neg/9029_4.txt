Allegedly the "true story" of Juan de Castilla, the eldest daughter of Queen Isabella's Catholic (yes, the same who funded Columbus's quest), the film maps the progress and degeneration of her morbid obsession with her husband, Archduke Philip of Austria, known as "handsome" unispired by the Italian piece Daniele Liotti, at his most butter and beefs here). It is a familiar story from the late 15th century, at the beginning of the 16th century. intrigue, betrayal and bodice. The destructive lust drips from start to finish. But while La Reine Margot succeeds in seeing the cruel sensuality and merciless intrigue, Juan La Loca is not just pulling away. It just ends up feeling like a big-budgeted soap opera, with below average, lazy or over-eager acting. Liotti looks positively bored and Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in the title role ??? although being just she can mature into the right talent? He seems to be trying too hard, to switch back and the fourth of a two-dimensional horny look to spoil hysterical teenagers. Some of the supporting casts are fine, except for Manuel Arcuri, another Italian pin-up, sensual and beautiful, but really no "actress" to talk about. I couldn't really force myself to feel any interest in any character, nor did I feel strongly negative against any of the alleged bad guys. What a waste of a substantial film budget! This, unfortunately, is just rhetorical and deja-vu, rather to inspire other films in the genre than to its source material - history. It seems to me that such a fascinating and complicated historical era deserves a much better filmmaker to provoke it.
