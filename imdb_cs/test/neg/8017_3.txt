Remember the wooden, non-dramatic adaptation of the 1970s to the worst? You will, when you see this widely held, unintentionally cheerful piece of chocolate adaptation. The most serious of all is Catherine Z-J, who, while undeniably simple, replaces a big dress with a dandy and seeks a sense of reality. Playing a po-faced melodrama, or a cool cool farm without jokes, this effort isn't helped by a screenwriter with a tin ear for dialogue that lacks a completely novel sense of irony or tragedy. Too bad, given the quality of the gaming talent he offers - Joan Plowright, Claire Skinner, Steven Macintosh deserves better than this.
