My wife invited her son and I to watch it on cable television on a lazy Saturday night because I think it might show the unusual role of Juliette Lewis. At least the film brings about this promise: its character is ineffective, holding onto almost every horror cliché. Just like a movie. Cataloging his studied adherence would be an exercise to remember something I hope to quickly forget, so I won't do it. Basically it is a whodunnit, heavy on red herring: they all seem guilty, rather than just two suspects from the beginning. "Exclude logical and obvious, and what's left, it's" the rule of bad horror movies works fine on this. The only surprise that it affected me was his final hacking of the vague end of the cliché: Jane retains a meeting with her experimental rescuer, who tells her (apparently the viewer) the identity of the second conspirator who will release her to another round of hysterical game victims. I will never know mercifully.
