Maybe it was * An important movie * and that's why people rate it so high, but honestly it's not very good. In retrospect, it is easy to see that Chaplin (probably all of Hollywood) was incredibly naive about the size of what is actually happening in the ghettos, so you can't allow him too much to disconnect that affects the modern viewer, but disconnect remains. More disappointing is that the film is simply clumsy; it is as if Chaplin had no idea that films from the time of silence continued to be sophisticated. Parts, those that concern both the Jewish barber and the dictator do not come together; they just sit there, like discrete bits of events that progress in seizures and begin to move, but they never come to resolution. Some are funny, some less. <br /> <br /> The magic of a movie is strictly in the person of Chaplin himself. His parody of Hitler's speeches was the best part of the whole thing, and there's no doubt he had physical grace that was nice to watch. But practically everything that surrounded was ANOYING. Hannah was an American TOO DAMN. Storm Troopers were Americans TOO DAMN. <br /> <br /> Oooh! Oooh! One more thing! I don't know what purpose Garbage served as the source of evil behind the throne. Almost seems to say the film says that if it wasn't for the harmful effects like Garbage, Hynckle wouldn't be so bad.
