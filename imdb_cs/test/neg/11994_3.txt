Glenn Ford, a New York boy who saves his money, inches and hobos his way to an Arizona ranch he bought where he hopes to find HEAVEN WITH BARBED WIRE FENCE. The film with the Screenplay and Story of Dalton Trumbo, director of the rogue Ricardo Cortez, and often playing nervous Glenn Ford and the restless Richard Conte should not be so damn nice. Although the system - mostly perceived as mediocre cops and bulls on the railroad and people with real estate - as terrible as one might expect from the left-wing Mr. Trumba, every single proletarian is so sweet and sweet and the salt of the land that man has. feeling sick. It doesn't help that a heroine - a sweet blonde who is an illegal refugee refugee fleeing from Franco Spain - is uncomfortable for reasons like scripting and playing. So why watch? In his first role, Richard Conte already has his personality and quite a good part. And there are moments of a left-wing 1930s camp that are amazing. (Did Dalton have to figure out a large part of the film in the Russian worker's mission? All that was missing was a portrait of shining Joe Stalin!) It's also Glenn Ford's first factual role (though his performance isn't good). <br /> <br /> Why not follow? Basically, the film offers an unconvincing vision, is linked to a political aspect that is horrible, and the two clues have created much better films. Also, the strengths of Dalton Trumba as a screenwriter are nowhere in evidence. Instead, we get a movie that could be written by Coen Brothers Barton Fink in a flash (and avoid that infernal fit with a writer's block).
