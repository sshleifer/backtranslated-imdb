Since I just finished the book, "Mrs. Dalloway" from Virginia Woolf, I was thrilled to see that it was one of the movie channels last weekend, but I saw a movie that was boring, incomprehensible and meaningless The film cannot be completely blamed, tried the best that was possible, with the material it had, but when the source material is Virginia Woolf and is almost entirely written in the conscience style with long periods of internalization and little real dialogue, one would certainly think that she shouldn't be a movie just because she can make a movie out of it. Vanessa Redgrave, who plays the title character, does not deserve any blame for the failure of this movie or any of the other actors. just a movie that couldn't be made from the story written by Woolfe in a comprehensible fashion and not even tried. Don't watch the movie, read the book. <br /> <br /> --Very great
