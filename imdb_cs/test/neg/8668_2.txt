I read a lot of Jane Austen in my time and agree to a few movie / TV edits, but we just don't need this. Rating is 2 because I wouldn't say it's awful so boring you'll feel like you're wasting 90 minutes of your life. A blunt scenario balanced by even more stupid action. I heard Billie Piper's okay in Dr Who (not a fan who can't confirm) but just sucks. There is no chemistry between the electrodes. It's Austen, it's supposed to be romance! Please do not let yourself to you from Austen or historical dramas. There are plenty of better viewing programs.
