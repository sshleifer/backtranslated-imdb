I'm rubbing my brain, but I can't think of another movie like the Gwangi Valley. Western with dinosaurs? What could be more natural? You have to wonder why John Ford and / or John Wayne never tried it! <br /> <br /> Land ?? In search of a mythical miniature horse for her circus, TJ Breckenridge (Gila Golan), Tuck Kirby (James Franciscus), and the rest of the cast / character enter the strange, lost valley. There they find not only a miniature horse, but also other, more horrible creatures. Dinosaurs control this place. Wouldn't that be the attraction of the TJ circus now? T-Rex in the Cage? It's not that I find out that the Gwangi Valley is a bad movie, it doesn't seem to me to enjoy it just like many others who have commented on the movie. There are some parts that I actually almost unnoticeable. In the first half of the film, it doesn't seem to be happening. I wasn't necessarily bored, but I wanted something to happen. Plodding would be an adjective I would use. To begin with, the film presents a very fancy love story. She feels compelled as if the writers decided that the male and female leadership had to get together. However, the Gwangi Valley is not a complete waste. There are times I really enjoyed. Who does not get a kick from cowboy horse scenes trying to lasso T-Rex. You don't see these things every day. The creation of Ray Harryhausen is impressive. There are some really cool shots of Harryhausen's miniatures of interaction with humans and horses. It may not represent the best of his work, but the effects are very nice. At least in my mind, these good moments are not enough to overcome the negative. Just as I hate it, I have to evaluate Gwangi Valley 4/10.
