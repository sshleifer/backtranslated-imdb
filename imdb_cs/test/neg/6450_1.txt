Tug-3 is perfectly fine. Although I'm sure Mr. Osmond wanted to make a sincere, gratifying Christmas movie, this one is as cynical and scary as they come. The religious meaning of Christmas is forgotten and replaced by cute children, clueless adults and dopey villains. Production values ​​prove that it was either made on the line or really inexperienced filmmakers. The worst part, oddly enough, is really music. Do you think someone with a long-term musical career could do better than the title song, but you are wrong. Even my mom didn't like this movie and she likes Osmonds A sappy.
