Devoted to noir, they were not deceived, it is stinking ... badly filmed, badly bred, and nothing ... nothing for a film enthusiast looking for another solid B-movie from the classic mine of the 40s and 50s. I tried it on a relatively high IMDb rating. There is no account for the taste, but I have not found anything in this movie to recommend to other IMDb members. This is a classic example of watching a movie and feeling that you have been deceived by x number of minutes that took the film to get grateful. Having Alan Ladd on the DVD / Tape Cover is almost a scam, he's on camera for less than two minutes and has almost no dialogue! This is not this weapon for people ... it's a classic in a miserable sense of study that feeds food without a budget ... We're all looking for the big ones ... saving time on Gangs, Inc. / Paper Bullets ... that is lousy!
