Absolutely nothing about this complete piece and the only thing that is worse than seeing this film is to see him in English. That's literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen. He completely ignores and contradicts all the themes they can imagine, so the story is really really boring. Thank God the 80s are over, and God who saved anything was actually born as "James Bond III".
