This film is sometimes called 'The Story of O-Pt.2', which tries to pass away as a sequel (of the species) to the French erotic S&M thriller 'Story O'. Although I have never seen the original version, I did, but get to this excused mixed bag of sexual and social policy. I think the 'O' angle comes from the occasional S&M undertones (which have never been so explicit (and uncomfortable to follow) as those in 'Mistress'. at least in the version I saw) Unneeded use of surrealism can prove that what a boring example in pseudo porn does is even more challenging (what is it trying to do with a floating piano?) Obviously, after all "Porn chic" the cinema trend wasted (ouch-sorry, bad pun!) In about 1975, manufacturers had to scratch the bottom of the barrel, trying to please the mavens from the adult cinema, not to mention the Foreign / Art Cinema so little woods like 'The Last Woman', and others like it.
