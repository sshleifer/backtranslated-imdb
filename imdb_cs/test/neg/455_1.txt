No surprise except how quickly ABC responded to the dismal ratings. According to the published reports (Variety), the worst ranking in the history of ABC's television network appeared on the show. And I quote: ABC's "The One" talented music contest opened Tuesday night to cancel the rating now. The article further said the show received a "shocking low rating of 1.1 / 3 in adults 18-49 and a total of 3.08 million viewers." This makes it the weakest premiere for any reality show on any network and also under all ABC series. <br /> <br /> From the first time I saw the ads, I knew it would fail. We don't need another American Idol clone. But ABC should have given this show a chance to succeed.
