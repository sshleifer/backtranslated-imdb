The film opens with beautiful footage of the landscape of the Northwest landscape. Fenceposts protruding from an earthy earth, a freight train crossing a field of hay in the distance, a wave of clouds, small buildings by a roadside, motel or inn in the middle of nowhere. Twin Peaks, a puzzling but mysterious piano arrangement, is above it, and it is all reasonably moody and atmospheric in American style. Through this director, Jon Jost keeps interleaving unpleasant images, blocks of letters, opening credits with unpleasant sounds, colored boxes that indicate "BLUE", numbers that count into "12 steps to the conclusion" announced in the opening credits. It is obvious for the first few minutes that even though Jost is more than capable of capturing the landscape and the atmosphere, he does not care. He has no affection for the Pacific Northwest open expansions that Terrence Malick does in the Badlands and neither the time or inclination of Twin Peaks David Lynch to weave secrets and intrigues around the given position. The rest of the movie is more Jon Jost's frustration with experimental tricks that serve their own purpose. Using a split screen is interesting, I particularly like the way we get the first picture of Ricky Lee, which is divided into two, one tells the childhood memories that matter to him, the other curses and bangs his head against the wall and over the run of the second film Ricky Lee prevails, the macho lumbar with shades that is hopelessly self-sufficient and stupid. On the other hand, the motion stop animation and the choice to play most of the movie in voice narration over does not work. It does this occasionally because Jost writes as well as the static footage of smalltown American Nowheresville shoots, but Beth Ann's monologues, delivered in the most flat nose monotonous imaginable, voice that sounds like Stephen Hawking's computer program of speech crossed with a whinnying horse, are thus a grid into The ear is a kind of defeat aimed at paying attention. Each one of us applies our past experiences, their little triumphs and foolishness and doubts and past relationships that have gone nowhere. They say very little to each other and what they say with empty faces. But they hunch like rabbits. It seems to be their only communication channel that remains open, perhaps the only one they can trust with any security. Jost clearly chooses his main characters in the Framework between na√Øve and vicious, those who are brought by the American dream become acidic, but they do not stand above them. In his portrayal he is neither condescending nor self-satisfied. They may be misleading, but they are endowed with moments of mankind, awkward, though they may be. We are called to empathize and show affection rather than pointing and laughing. This is the most successful Frameup happens; the characters of the movie come to life, even if their idle faces do not work, even when Jost gets in the way with its stiffened framing and disturbing camera games. Then we return to the angry screams of the destructive effects of money, we replayed the embedded shot of the banknote, we get a strange psychedelic succession when Jost's camera slips under the large deciduous trees that will soon turn into beetroot as Beth Ann repeatedly talking about "redwood trees" in the voice, even getting suddenly turns toward the plot and genre when the pair Beth Ann and Ricky Lee, defeated with small towns who have nowhere to go, and nothing that could keep them back in their lives in a dead end, arrives in California and decides to rob 7/11. The film is not ascending to the emotional crescendo as a result of the 7/11 confused work, as if to be expected from the "couple on the road" road movie, it stops slowly and you look at the window to see that it really has no place, especially. Parts of the ride were hypnotic and parts almost touching and funny, but everything else was mostly unpleasant.
