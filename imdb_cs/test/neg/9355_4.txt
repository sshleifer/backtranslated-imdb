Go to any movie fan and ask them about the title of film directed by Robert Wise, with director Yakima Canutt and Sergio Leone, designed by Ken Adam and scored by Max Steiner. Cedric Hardwicke and Brigitte Bardot were filmed in color, range, and stereo, at Cinecitt in 1955, with thousands of accessories - and they'll tell you to leave and stop being stupid. to say no such EXISTS movie. That the names you quoted NEVER cooperated - they weren't even present. And that you just picked names from a movie publication randomly and try to confuse them. At this point you can direct them to IMDb and show them the cast and crew of "Helen Troy". They will be amazed! These lesser-known epics of swords and sandals have ALL these names and more - Niall MacGinnis, Janette Scott and good old Harry Andrews. And that's definitely a weirdness. After the war, 1000 Italian supplements cost about $ 25 per day and toga dramas were at the heart of Italian cinema. The organic scenes were shot twice - one with peaks, the other without (you can guess which version of Britain and America got). I believe that La Sophia is also in this case. In any case, the names of the STAGGER mind. But it's just a coincidence. All these names have either reached the end of their career (Canutt, Steiner), or they start (all others). In the middle of his career, there were only Robert Wise and Niall MacGinnis. For the record, Leone was uncredited and taught his business - Adam still had to devise a downward circle in the ceiling of the orchards (a trademark that he would go on to put in all early bonds) - Baker had still to play and help produce the likes " Zulu "and" Robbery "- and go direct a Welsh television company called Harlech - then die tragically young. While Harry Andrews would go on to become one of Britain's most popular actors - Janette Scott (Thora Hird's daughter) would never do a really big time, but who could forget her in "Day Of" The Triffids "(though her bit was added later - for padding and happy ending) or" Crack in the World "? Sir Cedric was a theater, but he knew how to film - and Bardot ... was BARDOT, for gawdsake! But what did these stellar people do old nonsense in this camp? Do not ask me. The two main stars were nameless Italians - Helen had a mustache and Paris was pretty - while the British there were just for support. To sum up, I think you can only call it a major FLUKE. Stereo. To be honest, if I didn't see it - I wouldn't believe it.
