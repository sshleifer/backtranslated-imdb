Most Lorne Michaels movies seem to be failing because they're basically just extended versions of parodies that have barely managed to get people to laugh in five-minute segments. "Tommy Boy" is a character straight from "SNL" - a great fat loving (in their opinion) goof who knows nothing. David Spade gets the role of unwitting overwhelmed Everyman. He is paired with Annoying Overweight Slob and they suffer Miserable Misfortunes when traveling across the country to save Dad's business. The Beginner's Plot is Really Wrong. The whole premise - Dad is dying and the rich stupid son has to save the biz family - can be traced back to some movie you want. Like every SNL-style movie, it's reduced to simple motivation - empty, shallow; The only reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy is "funny" together. The film is great because the plot isn't outdated and recycled. It's basic, yeah - a guy who travels home for Thanksgiving, got stuck in a lance. But it's real, damn it. That's the difference. The characters are real, the situations are much more real. "Tommy Boy" is a pure grotesque and her ridiculous situation undermines the characters - we feel nothing for them and we don't care what's happening on the screen. "PTA" walked cautiously between the outrageous and utterly believable and relatives - "Tommy Boy" is simply absurd, with jokes like a simple deer-in-the-headlights that turns into a fight with a dead deer, really not dead, then wakes and break their car. The whole wrecked car is stolen entirely from "PTA" and it's scary how many things in this movie actually look like Steve Martin / John Candy movie. Farley is just too unpleasant to find likable - I've never noticed him watch in all the movies, and that hasn't changed my mind. Spade is given very little to do, serving as a film's most ungrateful character. Dan Aykroyd is useless as Evil Baddie, who plans to destroy Daddy's business. The end is a joke and not a "har-har funny" way. More like "oh god are serious?!" Some people kick it, it's okay. But I can't get into it, nor appreciate all the things that "lend" from - not just "PT&A" counting - without any credit.
