The most famous thing about this movie is that it was the first time Garbo spoke in the movie. In addition to this "milestone" (if you want to call it), it is a film that does not cross the creaking melodrama when Garbo tries to do his best not to fall asleep. The story involves Greta Garbo returned to the Father after 15 years abroad. Her father, who is a boat captain, is glad to see her, even though he is a little kneeling. He soon falls in love with an annoyed sailor who also notices that something, a barrier, if you want it, keeps her behind. By the way, both fellow citizens don't like each other very much and will soon hit Garbo when they disperse the situation by revealing their Great Secret, which is no surprise to us if you read the video box ( damn it, MGM !!) Garbo is nothing but guns in this movie, acting and acting. Two male wires are fine. Probably the best performance comes from the classic silent actress Marie Dressler, who plays a drunken captain who is a drunken girlfriend. What performance! It's too bad that the slogan couldn't read, "Dressler Talks!"
