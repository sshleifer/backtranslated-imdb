You have to love the Italian film industry. Someone came up with a "Road Warrior" action movie, and the Italians were busy for years when they followed each other. Then came another successful barbaric film ("Conan") and the Italians were busy ... eh, see above. In addition to many other theme variations (one of my favorites is Umberto Lenzi's "Barbarians" playing Paul Twins) the Ator series was created. And this, second, is probably the worst (or best, depending on your view). Ator is called back to the action of his old teacher who has discovered some kind of nuclear power that must of course be protected from getting into the wrong hands. The old man sends his daughter to Ator, and after a few complications, Ator, his sidekick Tong and the girl returned to the castle, which in the meantime had fallen into a criminal (of course, the old "class friend" Ator). Somewhere along the way the heroic trio forgets the plot and erases some giant snake worship cult for fun of it (not before some virgins are sacrificed). Just at a time when a madman finally loses his mood and kills a wise teacher, our heroes remember their duties, invent hanggliding and grenades and save the day. Included: horrible action by all participants (especially O'Keeffe)), incredibly cheerful "special effects" (just adore the snake scene that must be a hommage to "Monster Bride"), poorly staged combat Scenes, numerous continuity errors (Ator flies two different hanggliders during a climate battle, beware of it, just an example) and a total misunderstanding of the concept of history (cavemen, "civilized" barbarians, castles builders, all throwing in one movie). <br /> <br /> If you're, like me, dedicated to bad movies, this is one of the series you'll see, you'll probably end up with ROTFL. For records: the third part shot by Malta is actually quite observable. Due to Joe D'Amata's further efforts, this is probably his most entertaining movie because he has certainly failed to deliver traceable horror or erotic movies. . But I strongly believe that it was a coincidence. <br /> <br />
