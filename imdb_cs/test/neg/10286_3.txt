If you find that displaying violent murders and reckless police brutality expressed in a plot of less film with glacial stimulation fun, then you are required to take Surveillance. This film was a waste for the mind and the spirit. The idea of ​​being a "thriller" is comic; that would mean some kind of tension and twists. You waited for the story to finish "start". It will never rise above the celebration of weak-sighted violent criminals and individuals from all walks of life. Picture of all violence "No country for old people" without any kind of chase or sympathetic characters. Thrill-killers run amok. The game is good, mostly, but the script is a pile. Don't bother and tell your friends not to bother.
