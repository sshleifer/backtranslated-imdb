I've heard a lot about imaginative work with the camera and the direction in this movie. I thought both were messy <br /> <br /> also some really horrible acting. the main "heroine" in the film is irritating to the faith and has absolutely nothing useful to contribute in any situation. everything he does or says is stupid, and he usually seems to be just so absorbed. if she could fight, I could forgive her <br /> <br /> overall, all the women in this film are stereotyped 'widescreen' in the need of man to save them. and all the men in this movie are muscle-bound fat officers able to save anyone <br /> <br /> it's a bad movie, and I'm asking you to avoid it. instead, watch something like 'sword of doom', I hear his much better than the confused movie mess.
