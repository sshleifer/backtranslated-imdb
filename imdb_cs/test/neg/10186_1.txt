Im warning you people there, that's just a waste of time. I'm honest when I say it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's just a move about Christian propaganda! Don't throw your life away, you can't see it! I think they made the movie so that more people will believe in Jesus or something, but it works the other way around. Actors are all newcomers, the story is just fuzzy! I think this film is the work of the devil. This movie just isn't worth seeing, so please take my advice and not!
