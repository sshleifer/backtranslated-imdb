Director / director Larry Bishop has made a journey too hard with Hell Ride. The film wants to be irritable, witty, provocative, bizarre, biting, all in the style of Quentin Tarantino / Rob Zombie. But it's not nervous. Links appear to be forced. Dialogue tries to be smart and fails. Humor is never funny. Nice try to set a bold tone, but we need to take care of the characters or the story that they can succeed at a distance. What remains is the cool Harleys and pretty girls surrounding lots of tired, old and out of shape "bad boys" in what looks like an attempt to modernize western Sergio Leone. If this movie can make the newer generation interested in the 60s and 70s movies, kudos consider it. But it is somewhat boring and irrelevant. I believe it is a place for style over substance. But this film is not.
