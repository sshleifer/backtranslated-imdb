That's a horrible movie and I'm not even sure why it's so horrible. It is ugly, for one, with a fashionable style that at that time looked like a good idea, but which now allows a person to instantly recognize a film from that time as a product of the 1970s. The film retains the story and songs that made the scene a version of the musical such a hit, but the songs sound lifeless on the screen. But most importantly, the movie is upset because it's a powerful performance of Lucille Ball, which you think he could do as if he were human. She goes through the movie as a frightened actress who choked on her opening night and the film goes down with her. Even Bea Arthur, which I bet, was cheerful on stage, unable to breathe life into this stinking life. <br /> <br /> Avoid at any cost. <br /> <br /> Stage: D
