I saw it all. Just when I thought he couldn't get more pathetic and cheesy than "Woodchipper Massacre", only when I thought dialogue and acting couldn't be worse than "Nail Gun Massacre" just when I thought: Woods would keep your title as the most hearty Slasher movie ever, comes the "LAST WEAK PARTY! "This cheap, ugly manure will somehow obscure obscenity, but it's still horrible! I couldn't believe my eyes - I can't complain about too much (or in this case no) nudity in a movie slasher, but I still managed to make me carmine with embarrassment to rent it, I've never seen such horrible behavior, dialect, direction, writing, ... I could go on with this list forever! Here's a quick start: <br /> <br /> Mental Patient somehow he escapes from the loony, dresses like a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives, and breaks while his daughter has friends at night, then starts the dumbest killer spree (torn from other movies like party massacre and Halloween ") on this side of the universe, the characters have negative IQs, suggesting they are not human. no, because they tend to bleed Kool-Aid when they get cut because slasher likes to show use when holding their scapel to the camera in too many scenes. do we have to look at this scapel like this before it consumes the whole movie? ... which, in my opinion, wouldn't be so bad in this case! to make it interesting (second killer added), but unfortunately, it wasn't! And then even insulting, there's a stupid super-out-sub-end and even more stupid conclusion. Making a lot of sense, but I wouldn't like to give out the dumbest few scenes in the history of the movie to those two or th ree fools (like me) stupid enough to rent this drain. Certainly I hope that by writing it, I saved 80 minutes of someone's life. I'll get on my hands and knees to even think about letting somebody rent this: PLEASE PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE! This is a fan of the slasher genre to speak; I know what's good for you! The only real victims of this rattling Asinin nonsense are the poor morons who sat in the entire toilet tank! Zanatos score ... because there is no negative point scale, I have to give him 1, but below average 1 in that. Avoid at any cost .... please !!!!
