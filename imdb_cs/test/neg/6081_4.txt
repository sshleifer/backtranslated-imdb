As usual, leader Leo Gorcey (such as Slip Mahoney) and "The Bowery Boys" are hard pressed for money. After an unsuccessful attempt to sell their old jalopes, the boys are looking for help in a local bank. There, the unhappy Huntz Hall (as Sach) has his picture taken by handsome photographer Teala Loring (like Cathy Smith). Since the shot was shed during the robbery, Mr. Hall looks like the main suspect. With friends Bobby Jordan (as Bobby), William "Billy" Benedict (as Whitey), and David Gorcey (as Chuck); Mr. Gorcey wants to clean the Hall and collect a $ 1,000 reward. "Bowery Bombshell" goes through the moves, with Mrs. Loring a major force. Bowery Bombshell (7/20/46) Phil Karlson ~ Leo Gorcey, Huntz Hall, Teala Loring, Bobby Jordan
