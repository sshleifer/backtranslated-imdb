This movie was bad. It wasn't funny at all. Even the sarcastic scenes were not funny. Oh man, bad, so bad. Thumb down. Spoofed, Karate Kid, Teen Wolf, Footloose, Dirty Dancing, Some Wonderful, Soul Man, and Probably Next or Two. Chris Kattan in his worst position as a middle school janitor who is a talented dancer who runs a dance studio in a warehouse. She has a jealous girlfriend who breaks her ankle and her dance spot goes to a cute blond girl Chris has. I thought acting was really bad. I like the laughter of loud comedies, this wasn't one. "No More Teen Movie" wasn't funny, but he had a lot more funny scenes than Totally Awesome. "Scary Movie" is a suuuper funny. I always laugh when I look at you super nice. This movie, not funny.
