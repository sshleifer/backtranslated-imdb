It is the alleged life of Paul the Apostle. It opens with him involved in the hipster match match with the priest. The Pharisees said it because they "separated" from Hellenism, who were forced by the Jews by their rulers of the Gentiles. The point is that Saul would never be involved in the Greek-Roman struggle. PERIOD. Then we have two men (Saul and Priest, Reuben - a totally non-biblical fictional character) who was washed in a naked figure in a Roman-style bathroom. The Torah, which Saul followed religiously, was condemned in the strongest possible way by looking at the nudity of another man. Reuben is the one who pushes Saul into the destruction of the Church. Again, the text of Scripture does not matter because it is PAUL who says that it has wasted the Church and inhaled the threat and defeat of the Church. The film shows Barnabas' spraying. Paul - not baptized when Text Scripture says it was Ananias who did it. There is no mention of Mark or his turn, so script writers are forced to have Paul and Barnabas argue with Paul's desire to preach in Rome as the basis of their separation. No Silas about Paul's second and third missions; No Timothy ... EVER. No Titus; No Apollos ... No, NO, NOOOO !!! James is said to "know Jesus for a long time," rather than what the Scripture says, that he is the brother of Jesus. Why not just call the movie "Frank, a Fictional Apostle?!?!" At least it would be closer to the text of the Scriptures.
