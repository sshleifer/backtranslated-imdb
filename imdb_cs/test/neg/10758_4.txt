As anyone can praise this raw film version after seeing the amazing WATERLOO BRIDGE with Vivien Leigh and Robert Taylor, he's out of understanding. remake. He plays an ordinary American girl with an accent in Brooklyn, and "Yeah" reactions are a little uncomfortable when one expects a less rude character. DOUGLASS MONTGOMERY (billed in final credits like KENT DOUGLASS) is wildly unlikely because a soldier beats her no matter how many times she leaves it. BETTE DAVIS has no role in a small part. Their melodramatic confrontations during the last twenty minutes of the film are out of the faith (extravagant pieces of overclocking) - even though it's a more cruel version of the story when the sound was only a few years old and quiet playing was still angry. Just awful. And suddenly it ends when Clarke loses his life on a bridge bombing. End. In the 1940 MGM remake, he has none of the beautifully colored performances, including the pound ending. Instead, it is connected with low production budgets (and I think it's a chain budget) that has no subtlety at all. And in the scene where Myra tells the aristocratic lady, there is no pre-code bravery, why not marry her son, Roy. She just said, "I picked him up at Waterloo Bridge." Explanation. Nothing is bold. Summary: For once, the original is not the best version ever. VIVIEN LEIGH and ROBERT TAYLOR have never been overcome as Myra and Roy in a selection process, beautifully crafted by the 1940 film classic.
