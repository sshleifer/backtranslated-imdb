Visually, this movie is interesting. Light is literally thrown in a way, along with cinematography and an enticing introduction to titles that have had my hopes of starting, but then - b-movie is b-movie's b-movie, no matter how much it is seen. This film surrounds the life of Albert Fish, one of the world's most famous serial killers. Active around the early 20th century, Fish's life is hastily and blurry dealt with before it started killing children in old age. This film is based on two tracks: The Life of Fish and the Life of William F. King, the lead case investigator. What saves this film from becoming a theatrical spectacle and debacle of the usual kind, whenever it comes to serial murder movies, is the direction of a double edged sword; director Scott L. Flynn plunges on a b-actor to prevent their defects from showing too many times, but at the same time creating a genuinely blunt and stereotypical view of the American police through the king's angle. Of course, he met Grace Budd, the 10-year-old girl he'd killed with the Fish Meeting, quite thoroughly, though I'm not sure her mother was a media-crazy person that Flynn is really trying to emphasize. I miss more psychological diving in fish, not to mention the very little time that was spent on post-capture fish. All in all, interesting for those who are serial killers, but mostly offenders; however, if the director makes another film about another serial killer, I would certainly see him in the hope that the holes will be repaired.
