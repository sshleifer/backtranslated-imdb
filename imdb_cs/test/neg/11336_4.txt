This series, made for Televizión Española (TVE), is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in 1968, especially in the eyes of the youngest son. Against the backdrop of a historical event, such as the May 1968 uprising in France, the crumbling Franco regime, the war in Vietnam, the rise of imperialism, and others that specifically concerned Spanish life at this particular moment, the series to be a simple compilation of the characteristic foibles that are so obvious in this kind of entertainment. Light vein is generally treated, although at some moments that could be referred to as dramatic, the series seems to be aimed at people. about fifty people who can marry these times because it should be said that each younger either chooses to ignore such events, or is sharply occupied in other things. The best thing to say about this series Ana Duato is a mother-child mother of three: she plays very well the part of the housekeeper of that time, proving that the special Spanish hobby, especially evident among women, allows all her thoughts and her deeds were transmitted by the stimuli of her heart without resorting to the use of the brain. As we say in Spain, common sense is one of the least common senses. Imanol Arias offers very little, except that he is not his usual stereotypical tough policeman as in other TV series. Indeed, as an actor, he should not be trusted in anything that is not a television series. Its resources are too limited; however, his part as the father of a working class household is not at all bad. In fact, it is not recommended for any other audience, even for Spanish-speaking people in Latin America: topics are too parochially related to a specific place in contemporary Spanish history so that if the viewer doesn't live here at that time, he miss most of the links. It is even likely that some situations that cause several Spanish smiles would mean nothing to other viewers.
