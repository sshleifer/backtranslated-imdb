This 2.5 hours diluted snore-fest seems to be one of the poorest excuses for adaptation. With a clear budget allowing a breathtaking filming location in Greece, money could be better spent developing a coherent scenario with the development of characters and motivations clearly outlined; Especially since the law has gone through the problems of doing it. The illustrations lacked passion and direction, letting the viewer debate whether they should bother to worry about the demise of the protagonists at all. which brings another point - the main character of the original creation, prosperity, is not so named in this representation, although most of the names of the other characters are used. the charm and magic in this particular work is also missing. in fact, all the aspects that made the theatrical version of the "storm" full of miracles and intrigues were completely sucked out of this intricate version of a self-embedded, pompous butt that fails to figure out how to care for anything beyond the blur of its wealth and power. More precisely, the most beautiful effort at best and the brutally poor imitation of the intended inspiration.
