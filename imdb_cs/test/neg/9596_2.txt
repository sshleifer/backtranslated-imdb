Bog Creatures shows exactly what can happen when very enthusiastic people come together with a little money, some film-making knowledge, a mixed bag of novice actors and a lot of determination, all without the necessary knowledge and skills to enable them to do something more download. than a bad-looking After School Special (in the wrong way, not in a nostalgic way). I think it's such a good home movie / student movie stuff if you want to pass it on to family and friends for free. Luckily I found him somewhere in the basket for a discount. Sure, there may be some market out there for this sort of thing, but it's a market that seems to exist only by default because there are so many poor B movies out there. Even more now in this day and age. The only people I would recommend this move to are aspiring filmmakers. First, I would recommend that they follow a special feature that contains the disk. Check out movie crew enthusiasm, their hard work, joy and very high opinions on your own product. Then watch the movie. In just a few frames, you'll probably understand what happened. I was bored, I went through the whole thing, and the director and cameraman tried hard, but they just don't know what they're doing. They knew enough to talk, but in the long run, without the necessary skills, he interpreted it: They knew enough to be dangerous. This is like the bad movie Nickelodeon (as it seems to a more respectable one I think). A few actors did it well, and a cool stoner-looking dude with tattoos (real or fake tattoos I don't know) was probably not the best and most natural and I hope he will. But their natural acting talent was despite the bad film, the bad script, and so on. If the director spent more time helping these emerging actors develop their characters, he studied well-proven camera techniques and lighting principles to better direct his crew, and if the script was actually incorporated instead of a written week (according to a very lenient documentary), maybe it could be more of a movie. Instead, it is a film that has a sense of potential and has a few moments in it (it depends more on the genre than on the film itself), but ends in almost every frame that is NOT. If you want to see how decent a low budget horror can really look, watch Phantasm or even Laserblast. If you want a celebrated home movie (no joke), get a Bog creature.
