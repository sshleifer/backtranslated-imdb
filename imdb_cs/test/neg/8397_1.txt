As one of you gave more than 2 stars, it amazes me. I made an IMDb account just to comment on this movie cr @ p. The activity is cr @ p and the graph is crp. It would deserve no stars at all if it were not for the descent soundtrack (and yet there are still some inflammatory clownish tracks there as well, most notably those featuring oboe and sound as a black and white cartoon comedy background music and in not so as to fit the intended the mood of scenes that haunt) and high-quality cinematography. Dialogue and conspiracy are about as complicated as Dr. Sues. These actors are terrible. Actually, I was watching this movie right now, and with every word I'm impressed that you all swallowed it. The only reason I didn't turn off the movie was that I packed myself into creating an IMDb account and posting this review. I dig mainstream movies, I dig silly silly movies, I dig retro indie movies, and almost any other type / genre if done well. My brother convinced me to rent it because he said he heard it was good, and in general he had great taste in movies; From the moment he told me the title, I looked at him as if he were crazy. I have a hard time ending this bragging because there is so much badness about it. The only way I can rationalize a good rating here is that you have been paid to make this movie a high rating. It is so bad and not where dramatic, artsy, complex, well-written, well-presented or even bearable approaches. If it were the final product of my hard work, I'd be embarrassed to release her to the public, so I don't even like the director when she reads - what the hell were you thinking about a guy?
