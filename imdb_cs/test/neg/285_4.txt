Every James Bond movie has its own set of rules. Like every Indiana Jones movie has its own set of rules. And the fact that the scriptwriters do not violate these rules preserves the integrity of the characters. With a totally unnecessary twist plot, the integrity of both Ocean Films drops somewhere between the Airplane 2 and the Roadrunner cartoon. Imagine what would happen as he rides on a rope bridge outside the Temple of Doom, if Indy told Shorty and Willie that they wouldn't be afraid, because during the first two films she had super powers and could be fly to safety. <br /> <br /> Fun? Sure, for a Roadrunner cartoon. But Spielberg would never do it because it would destroy the integrity of the film. More importantly, it would be for the audience. They were already sitting on the edge of their seats in the 3-hour Indiana Jones movies and relied on Indiana to imprison them. Had he left? People would leave the theaters just like humans during the 12th Ocean. SPOILERS <br /> <br /> 1. Julia Roberts'character, Tess, breaks into the museum by disguising herself as ... Julia Roberts?!? Smart twist? Breaking through the fourth wall three hours after we met these characters? Is it Naked Gun 33 and 1/3? It's a textbook example of how cheap laughter can ruin the whole movie. But wait ... just in case you haven't come out yet ... <br /> <br /> 2. Tensions arise in the last hour of the movie - how the robbery will be downloaded - there are only 10 ... 8 .. 5 ... 2 days left! And then in the last 12 minutes of the movie, ONLY the fun part of this movie, we see that the robbery was made a few days ago and took Matt Damon for 30 seconds. Last 10 days? Full waste of time. BACK TO INDIANA JONES ON WORK JOBS ... "Just relax, Willie! I stole REAL stones about a month ago! Besides, I convinced them you were Kate Capshaw!" <br /> <br /> If you haven't seen it yet, reduce your losses and go to the Polar Express. I don't want to ruin your end, but it's really Santa Claus. Most importantly, you will not feel deceived from the theater.
