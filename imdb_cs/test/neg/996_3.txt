The black and white satire of the Madison Avenue advertising agency was taken over by blacks. It is headed by Putney Swope (Arnold Johnson), who is determined to change things. But it turned out to be even worse than his white predecessors. This is about as original as it gets. I'm sure it was considered bold and shocking in 1969, but it just looks stupid today. Jokes are either nonsensical (the president is a dwarf. How funny is that?), Cruel or obvious, and the film is full of immaculate characters. It's done in a very experimental way, making it even harder ... to understand. The film becomes more bizarre and unreal as it goes on. The end comes out of nowhere. To make matters worse, with the exception of Johnson, all acting is bad. Antonio Fargas (regular in these types of films) is especially annoying as an Arab. It gets three stars because commercial parodies (done in light color) are fun and there's a rare good line here and there. I heard it was a cult classic, but that's more interesting than good. Skip ... if you're not in the 60's experimental films.
