Barney and friends are probably the worst kids I've ever seen. They teach children nothing, the songs are sloping, it's not instructive, and the characters are just upset. I'm not the one who disagrees with those who hate the show. Honestly, I've seen more negative than positive reviews for this show. 75% of reviews are negative and there are a few really mature people. This show does not contain any educational value or age-relevant educational material. Other reasons why I don't like this show is because of crappy charts, kitschy dialogue, horrific special effects and abysmal storylines. In addition, he says you should eat junk food if you're sad and that strangers are your friends. He says that this is a "model of what preschool television should be", as Yale, Dorothy and Jerome Singer say, is a crap. He doesn't know what he's talking about. I would never recommend Barney to anyone. The reason some babies are still crying or becoming addicted to waste is because this show is poisoning children's minds everywhere. For people (parents / children) looking for a real kindergarten, switch to Nick Jr. instead. It's much better than this turd and five TVs once had the courage to put it on a "milk shake" but fortunately it took it. I highly recommend everyone to stay away from this show. Parents, I recommend that you keep your children away from this show. Thank you later. BOTTOM LINE: Don't bother wasting valuable time with this stupid show. It's Utter Garbage. -10000000000000/10. Grade: Z. Avoid as a plague! <br /> <br /> Thanks for reading.
