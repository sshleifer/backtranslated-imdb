It will be really blue Christmas if you tie your family to it. I loved the original movie, and this one wasn't worthy of continuing. In fact, for all intents and purposes, it is not his continuation. Only one character from the original cast is returned. It is true that this character has become a cheerful cousin to Eddie, but he just is not cheerful to be the protagonist of the film. His niche is that he is a crazy relative who performs zany antiquity - next to Chevy Chase. Chevy Chase was needed in this movie to be successful, and he was definitely not there. As for me, the film is not a "Holiday" movie unless Clark Griswold is a good clan at the helm.
