So Seagal plays Detective DEA named John Hatcher, who has lost his partner in drug investigation, a surprising surprise, Colombia! Not to boast or anything, but my father was born and raised in Colombia (my surname), and now he's a California doctor, so no matter what the movies believe, there are other things than drug dealers and cocaine that came out of Colombia! In any case, if the drug busts bad, Hatcher loses his partner and accidentally kills a naked Colombian prostitute, inspiring him to go to confession, somewhere that I've never seen him go before any of his films, sooner or since then. It was actually quite interesting. Seagal tends to leave as an almost asexual way he never cares about women other than conspiracy, and the way an occasional seduction attempt, whether a stripper or lover, never cares for the slightest bit of interest from him. All this is all that is wrong. But in the confession stand he admits he lied, sold drugs, falsified evidence, and even slept with informants to get the information he needed to get the bad guys behind the bars (I hope I'm not trying to get into problems with God by telling you?). The priest tells him to go to his family, so he decides it's time to leave power. Another third of the film is a paper characteristic of Seagal's films. Marked For Death is the story of Seagal against a group of mystical Jamaican drug dealers, and these guys have no discretion about moving their products in broad daylight. Hatcher returns to his old high school coach. Max (Keith David's minimal effort) and right in the middle of the practice are some of those creepy crackheads sitting there in whites who crack up on girls who look like high school witches. Perhaps I had a high school experience in high school, but I did not know that crack and crackheady traders were hanging in the school campus in the Middle Ages. In any case, it doesn't take long for Hatcher to know how bad these guys are. It's not just about cracking high school kids crack, but the coach regularly loses soccer players to their drugs, deals with smartasses with Max, and because it's not enough, his 13-year-old niece died of their crackhouse. Ah, OK. We'll get a picture. I'm sure they also torture puppies and beat old women, and maybe they stole candy from kids, just for good peace. Is it really hard to find out who the bad guys are? 13 year old niece died in their crackhouse. Wow. Anyway. Not only does the film not know how to develop villains without resorting to what is basically shrinking to film-calling, where evil deeds are assigned through dialogue, but they also do not know how to act. The drug dealer leader is called Screwface and I suppose he should tell you something about the type of film himself. Screwface is a cartoonish jamaican man with these bright, bizarre green eyes that I probably must be an important part of his character because he spends most of his time on the screen with his eyes half bulging from his head. His favorite means of intimidation is to scream out loud in his wildly stunned Jamaican accent with a face that is literally less than a centimeter away from the one he screams. This guy's trying to get into the boys' faces that he has to turn his head to the side so their noses don't touch. All I could think about was how the poor guys would deal with his breath. Man, they don't want you to forget that these guys are Jamaican by the way. Their accents are so exaggerated and exaggerated that it is almost impossible to understand for most of the film. No matter. No matter what they say, all you need to know is that everything that comes out of their mouth is some kind of drug-related bad thing, it's just psychics who spread drugs and kill people. The film must have been a huge hit in Jamaica! My biggest problem with the movie is that theatrics, especially bad guys, as I described, are spectacularly goofy, even for Seagal movie. They are so cartoonish and weird that it's impossible to make them like anything other than a goofball b-making movie, something slapped together to provide a feed on which Seagal can distribute its distinctive smack brand-down retribution. But there is also a bizarre kind of mysticism in the film that makes it all special. For example, a mystic, I think you would call her, at one point gives some kind of curse to the Screwface (if I remember correctly), spitting Bacardi's mouth on a live rooster that hangs upside down before pulling it down and dripping blood on it. picture Screwface. Hmm. Interesting. Sadly, she is the same woman who warns Hatcher that his family was "labeled" by these people, which means they have some voodoo hex on them. Not to hurt anyone, but if I were told that my family was cursed like that by people, I'd like to laugh at it. Hatcher won't make me a kind of guy who should take a lot of money in strange voodoo curses! <br /> <br /> The setting, as you can see, is very standard for Seagal. Unique villains, I think you might say, though not very impressive. Definitely the strangest movie of Seagal's early career?
