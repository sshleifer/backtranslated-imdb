This film is nothing but Christian propaganda. It started out as a good science fiction film and then works with a raw sweet Christian theme in a story that is totally unrelated. I had to turn it off half way, because I felt cheated to rent. The Catholic Church has officially announced that extraterrestrials are NOT in conflict with faith in God. The movie is still fun, but the dialogue is incredible, writing and playing is mostly garbage and all this is mostly a smelly movie that needs to be avoided. The filmmakers probably did some research in this phenomenon, but then you quickly realize that it is only for the purpose of exposing and pushing your own paranoid religious views into a valid, interesting subject. If you are a zealous religious fanatic who believes in demons and angels, you will love this movie.
