It's just a bad movie. Not as bad as R.I.C.C.O. but bad. He got me hooked on beginging then totally lost me after that. The acting was the way off then on the way so the way out off. Do not see this movie at any cost, believe me all my heart !!!! The directors who are brothers are not another HUGHES BROTHERS who have made really great movies like DEAD PRESIDENTS, FROM HELL, AMERICAN PIMP and MENACE II SOCIETY. a great actor one day if he makes better films than this. Christina Caparoula also did a nice job for what she got. I hope FITTEST is ten times better than this piece of crap!
