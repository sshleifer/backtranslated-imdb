In a sense, this film did not even compare with the novel. However, it was good to have a visual idea of ​​how Congo looked, and also the natives if you're not reading good visuals. I would never recommend watching a movie than reading a book. I hardly suggest watching this film, let alone other films based on this literary work. This movie; and many others did not fulfill this book. One important part missing in the film is MArlow's sense of how the government of scarcity in Africa formed early genocide. Also in the film, MArlow and his companions did not stop to get notes and wood. Likewise, Kurtz's African lady knocked on the end of the story, which has a great influence on the story, but was not in the book. In the novel, Kurtz died on the ship, however he died in his hut in the movie. The reaction of the fiancé to Marlow's interpretation of Kurtz's last words was also different. This film is only effective if you want to present the novel more clearly.
