If you think it's beautiful to be obsessed with who you are in love with, then I can imagine it will be a good review ... but I can't imagine this subject of obsession and little respect for others (such as Paulie's treatment) with teachers who are trying to help her) is something you would like to teach your children. Yes, it's as bad as Victoria treated Paulie, but guess what. That's life. Isn't it a more important lesson to learn how to get through these disappointments and make the most of your life? Or will there be better lessons on the roof to teach our children? Secondly, when Father Mary did not show up for dinner, and Paulie helped Mary loose her anger, Mary even said she wished he was dead ... Somehow I don't think it's good news to deal with your frustration through anger.
