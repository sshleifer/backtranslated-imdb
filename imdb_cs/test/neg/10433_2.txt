When I think about a 70's movie, I don't think about it. I don't want the monotonous soundtrack of Robin Trower; I want a soundtrack interrupted by the top 40 chewing gum songs of the day that symbolized the 1970s. Particularly unpleasant was the general karaoke-style disco music during the promo scene. The meeting (if you can call it) was very wooden and it seemed to be just a monotonous reading from the script. The quality of the film and the camera work was terrible; the dialogue was dark, the script seemed to be thrown together without much thought, and the plot was not thin if it did not exist. I can't believe people give it a high rating that I read here. Essentially a forgotten, bad attempt to rediscover the beloved era of the past. Two stars are all I can think of. Sorry, guys.
