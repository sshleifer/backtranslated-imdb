The film starts with its most intelligent joke, and goes downhill from there (pun intended). After that there is plenty of nighttime humor and sexual situation. Beautiful women were the best part of the film. Oath-puns are not intended as central jokes, but try it here. The battle between the two groups in the local city (richies and poories) is an old tried and true installation, how could it go wrong? Well, there's no reason to envy "wealth" or any reason to apologize for poems, so we can forget the central storyline. Situational humor is all a toilet or sexual goal aimed at teenagers, but just collecting giggles, no real belly-laughs. The only thing that saves the comedy for this film is the character of humor, with a blind man providing some rehashed, but rarely used settings, and a black bar owner providing formulaic "street" or "hood" humor. OK, forget about jokes, there must be some killer snowboarding shots because it was a commercial venture. Unfortunately there were only 4 seconds of action that could be inspiring. The rest was a class "B" trick or worse. The big moment, when the main character rides on a "goat" slope, provided one shot, where a small avalanche of a stuntman's dream. This was the best of this movie. Any serious snowboarder will be disappointed with the quality of stunts in the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the technical aspects of the film, the soundtrack was average, which surprises because the snowboarding documents are regularly supplemented with quality melodies. You can catch a lot of editing mistakes, and although it was filmed on a ski mountain, most "scenic" shots could not express any sense of real size. Overall, it may be good to see if you have managed to turn your brain completely away and you like silicone breasts. Even then, you don't remember any thing two days later. Snowboarding is still waiting for its definitive comedy, you'd rather watch documentary snowboarding.
