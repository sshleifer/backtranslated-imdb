I'm so disappointed in this movie that I can't express. I was so excited when I started watching this movie to see Mickey Rourke all the skin he was facing, and the kid from the Third Rock from the sun that behaves like me psycho. I thought, wow, this will be the winner, crazy 'Natural Born Killers Style. And it was better. The production value was great, the directing was great, the acting was great, the cinematography was great and the plot was, conspiracy, well, whats the plot? About halfway through this movie, I tugged my hair, "What the hell is going on?" and I mean it literally? Nothing makes any sense. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Aaaaaaahhhhhhggg !!!!
