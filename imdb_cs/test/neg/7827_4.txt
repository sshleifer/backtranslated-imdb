Asia Argento is a sexy beautiful woman who likes to run around naked, which is not a bad thing in her, but when her character talks about all the guys she served and seeing her with Michael Madsen and an Asian guy in the present time movie, I feel that I needed a condom over my eyes to watch this movie, as the disease will rub on me or something. The film felt like it was a love triangle / drama / action / ??? conspiracy, it seemed to go everywhere and nowhere. Playing was great, conspiracy, not so great. The director must at least choose the genre and practice, practice, practice before trying to do something as complex as it is again, because of course they are not very good at it.
