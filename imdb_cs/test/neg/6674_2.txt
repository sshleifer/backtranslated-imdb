Okay, so maybe it wasn't bad, but I'm writing this review as a public service to prevent anyone else who happens at the fascinating start of this phone to throw away two hours of his life and wait for some conspiracy development to never come. The Chief Investigator has a gut feeling that got rid of the missing Marine Officer (Guy), and few people who did not participate in it and her indictment seemed. So what's the point of staying with this drama? He's beating me. I thought (or hoped) there would be some conspiracy or new revelation, but no one was excited. In short, I can't think of a single reason to sit and watch this nonsensical TV movie based on a real story or not.
