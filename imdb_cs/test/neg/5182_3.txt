After a while I realized it was just my IQ slowly falling. Frostbite is one of those pathetic films where nobody, and I think, is trying. I took root in a dork hero to die inside that trashcan (how did he fit in anyway?), Traci Lords, Queen of B movies, was terribly unfair and tore me and my friends away by not showing her breasts Only time. "Characters", although I use this term freely, people are so exaggerated and one-dimensional that they can also use cardboard cutouts. "Jokes" (I use this term also freely) are simply merry. One fart guy causes an earthquake. Roflcopter! Our "hero" gets ass acupuncture Traci Lords. God, I can't breathe! Blind person uses word F repeatedly! This is too much !!! Tell what you want for acting, but I thought Adam Grimes did a pretty good job of playing a mentally handicapped snowboarder. In addition, the only source of entertainment value here is breasts. I think I counted three, maybe four pairs, scattered over about five minutes of the screen throughout the movie. That's five minutes worth watching from 83 minutes of rude garbage. Don't look at it. Watch Barb Wire with Pamela Anderson - at least there was a lot of nudity and action in that crappy movie!
