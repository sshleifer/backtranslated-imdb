Cave Dwellers, or The Blade Mater, or what's called, is in one word: VILE! I saw it on MST and I laughed not only at the great commentary, but also at the filming of the movie that was proven. Sunglasses, tire tracks and where did Ator get the glider? Then they pick up a few shots from another movie, Where the Eagles Dare, as Tom Servo points out. To show how cheap this movie really is, watch the scene where Ator and Thong have to fight the invisible swordsmen. Or better yet, look at the giant hose dressed like a snake that Ator must wrestle! And what exactly are these movie scenes related to credits?
