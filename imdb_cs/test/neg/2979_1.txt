This is the feeling that this is a full-length comedy-routine treatment that could also be said in a ten-minute short time. Technical credits are also supported. The film really feels like a film diploma project. The cast is a combination of experienced professionals and talented newcomers, but the problems are superficial scenarios. Their line seems to be constructed, just like the TV show material. <br /> <br /> The director does not take his protagonists seriously, so we will not touch their problems and conflicts. <br /> <br /> The film was cleverly sold and offers a unique point of sale, but ultimately disappointed at all levels.
