I was quite impressed with this film as a child of eight or nine. The Gangsters seemed very real to me and threatened me, and I could see why people would fear someone like Dillinger. When he saw it as an adult, it seemed almost comic, thanks to narrations and unpleasant details like the 1930s gangsters who were driving cars that looked like the 1950s. There is a certain bold, reckless reality about the way criminals are portrayed, but the overall effect is more like a bad soap opera. The most memorable and most unintentionally humorous piece that holds with me is the scene where Ma Barker and her sons shoot her with the FBI and the sons are killed. The narrator says something like "Maybe at that moment, for a single time in life, Ma Barker became a real mother". This is to be the moment of great tragedy and pathos when Ma finally realizes how she has destroyed her family from her own greed, but instead provokes laughter. A very special film that is rarely displayed these days. Gangster movie lovers can enjoy it, but rather curiosity than a real movie.
