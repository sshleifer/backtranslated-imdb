This is the worst movie he has ever seen. I've seen a lot of movies. Me and my friends rented this evening evening. We had a lot of fun. This movie is the worst I've ever seen. But it's laughing! U will lie on the floor and try to get some air. Wondering why? Just rent it and check that the keyboard plays the girl in that slim Russian bar. My mother would make 1000 times a better film about her cat feeding.
