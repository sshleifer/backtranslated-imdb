* Caution: 1 small inconsistent spoiler * You're right. These weren't the bridges of Madison County. As soon as the lonely woman and Richard Gere entered the big empty hotel, it was a lost conclusion that something would happen. The question is, how will this happen? The answer is a few stupid stories that are not worth it. In one putative experience with gluing, they get drunk and clean the box of old cans (that was my spoiler). LOL It wasn't convincing. I'm an old married lady like the one in the movie, and My friendship is more interesting than romance with Richard Gere. LOL. . . She had the advantage. You leave and go, oh brother. . . I could even write something more believable than that. I think my life isn't as boring as I thought it was when I could mock my romance with Richard Gere. LOL! And that friend inherited the totally contemporary, probably computer-generated lock, resting half in the ocean, from his GRANDMOTHER, who built it after the CIVIL WAR? Maybe her grandmother is Oprah and it was WAY after the Civil War? And yes, where was EMAIL? In what alternative universe do these people live? I never want to see another movie that pretends we don't have email and facebook or text messages. And OK, maybe these people have a terrible aversion to delivering messages over the phone, but don't ask me to trust anyone in this age of instant communication that someone will fall into your life without first calling.
