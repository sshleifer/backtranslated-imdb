I love Umberto Lenzi's cops - ROME ARMED TO TEETH is my favorite - and his DESERT COMMANDOS has largely legitimized the Italian euro war phenomenon by actually being a pretty good movie. Give him guns, machines, some guys to run around talking hard and hard to miss. <br /> <br /> What a pity it is to meet his EATEN ALIVE and CANNIBAL FEROX. They could be somebody, indeed, and one watches them feeling in the contract, he was told what kind of movies he was supposed to be, he was assigned and manned by the crew and had a budget, deadline, and scenario. Lenzi then went out and executed his films in the same way that a man at McDonald's fixes a batch of French fries. Of the two, EATEN ALIVE is a bit more original, which is amazing because it believes it contains extensive footage of three other cannibal films - and is easier to use than CANNIBAL FEROX, though not much. Allowing others to outline the story: What fascinated me about the film is how it all looks, and what the somewhat infamous reputation this film has is some kind of versatile attack on good taste. It's not even though the movie is a workout in bad taste, supplemented by a title-earning scene where two of the pretty supportive ladies are quite literally sliced ​​and one alive cannibals that is the movie's top. The problem is that Lenzi allows us to get a good, long look at the cannibal holiday scene and has a convincing ring of the third STAR TRE episode with a fake jungle for really bloody close-ups. And I don't know of anyone else, but if somebody sliced ​​my person's pieces and ate them, I'd just lie there and look desperate. My film problem may be that I have a lot of respect for Lenzi as a filmmaker, and that could be someone else. All your cannabis film conventions touch, but they never feel as if they were filmed with any real beliefs than trying to poison Ruggero Deodato from the sandbox. Both directors must have known and either had some youthful rivalry, or real dislike for each other and the conscious need to encourage them. Lenzi invented the cannibal genre with MAN FROM DEEP RIVER, Deodato blew away with JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, Lenzi fired with EATEN ALIVE, Deodato fired him (and everyone else) away with superior CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and Lenzi fired his last volley with CANNIBAL FEROX, which is about as realistic like the Krazy Glu, where the guy takes his helmet to the beam and hangs in the air. This film is less desperate and a little more hesitant to push viewers into the abyss. with all that is holy than FEROX, which remains as a misguided attempt to stagnate CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. This one is rather mish-mash, with an interesting jungle adventure crossed with Jim Jones as a suicide cult - cannibals seem as if they were added as an additional idea rather than a reason for making a movie. I think fans of this genre will get a better impression of the movie than Lenzi fans looking for something new from an impressive director. It's not as fun as SLAVE OF CANNIBAL GOD, adventurous as its own MAN from DEEP RIVER, and it definitely lacks the hooker CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. Combine these considerations with recycled shots, stomach backdrops of animal violence scenes, misogynistic scenes of sexual violence and stag, the wooden film making methodology, and what you end up is the OK Thai jungle with two or three standout scenes and Umberto Lenzi was able to do much more. <br /> <br /> 4/10; But Gore the madmen will go nuts.
