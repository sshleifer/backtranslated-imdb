That astonishes me that someone would really think about spending some money on a movie. Really. Forget a moment that the plot does not give any indication of originality ... Most of the movies today are based on stories of other films, so a "simple" lack of originality is not such a big deal. But I can't believe that any of the guys who took part in the movie never got on the plane before filming. Because, let's be honest, that would be the only excuse to come up with something so ridiculous. To be honest, I think a six-year-old child with a fake camera might have come up with something technically much more credible. Some examples that follow. The scene that is really crazy is when the engines turn off when they regain control of the plane. When they have to turn them on again, the radio guy says something like "Ok, press buttons 1 and 2 on the dashboard". They're not buttons now. They should not be pushed, they should actually be pulled towards the pilot. Is that something he only knows about an airplane addict? Poorly. The next scene can be viewed by their fingers by pressing "buttons" ... And of course the so-called "buttons" do not move at all! Not one millimeter! (And note that I didn't even mention that aero engines aren't like a car engine, you just turn a key and become a spell ... You have to do a pretty complicated procedure to turn them on ...) Come on, guys! You could at least fake the movements !! Not to mention the hilarious final impact when the plane hit every thing along the runway (light columns along the runway? What do they think ?!) ... And the wings can't even be torn off! It happened to me once ... Except that the plane was made of Lego! What about the stewardess? He is actually so skilled that he perfectly knows where the "aux 1" and "aux 2" fuses are, in the middle of the wires behind the cockpit. So should we mention that guy who can drive an ambulance and fly a plane behind an ambulance using a computer? And how did he turn to other aircraft engines? I could really go with the clock for hours. This is the dumbest movie I've ever encountered, and I'm including garbage like Alone In The Dark and other stuff in the list. Do you want to do a favor? Don't look at it.
