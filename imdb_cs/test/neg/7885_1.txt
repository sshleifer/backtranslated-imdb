This is one of the rare movies I never spoke to with my friends immediately. It wasn't because I was particularly impressed or impressed by it. On the contrary, it gave me nothing at all. Why? Because somehow everything was exaggerated that I couldn't take this film seriously. It was so much sex and violence that I had a strong impression that the film was trying very, very hard to be offensive, as if it were focused on superlatives in ugliness, rather than telling a convincing story about two women caught in a spiral of crimes. Baise-moi was described to me as "Thelma & Louise with real sex". It is true that the main idea is similar. There are two women traveling around the country because they have committed crimes and know that their lives are now completed, that the police will catch them, and they decide that now that everything is fine, there is no way to abstain. Baise-moi has been described as a feminist film where women who have suffered from male domination in the past have avenged the men they meet. something I have never interpreted into this film, simply because none of these women have ever been innocent, and because they are not only killing irresponsible, violent men, but also men who are seducing themselves men who feel they want to do a protected sex. And they kill women. No, they are by no means better than the characters they meet, and they are murdering in nasty, brutal ways. How easy are the "heroines" to murder and how much pleasure they take. it is absolutely impossible for me to deal with them or take them seriously. It was too much. Too much sex, too much violence. I felt that sex and violence were just there to create superlatives in ugliness, rather than in telling a story, or making a point. Baise-moi left me without an impression, hadn not set me to think, because it was so far from some real world. So designed, unrealistic and upstairs. There was nothing I could do with this movie, there was nothing about it that could be thought of than "why did this horrible movie?" If an intense inconvenience was done in this film, it would serve purpose, I would easily accept it. But since I found nothing because the film story seemed to be more than a pretext to get the most out of one movie and nasty sex ... I signed it under "unnecessary torture", decided never, EVER, watch this movie again and again I consider it the worst movie I've ever seen. Worst, not just because it's not really my cup of tea watching people being raped, rape, having sex in other forms and killing each other ... but because what it was that the creators wanted to tell the world their movie ... if they wanted to say something ... it just didn't work. And there is nothing else that could save this film because it is also filmed in such ugly style.
