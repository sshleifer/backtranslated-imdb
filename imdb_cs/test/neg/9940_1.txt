Heftig og Begeistret (Intense and Enthusiastic) is a documentary story of a male choir in Berlevåg in northern Norway where the weather is cold and hostile, the days are dark during winter and the city faces young people moving to more populated parts of southern Norway where the climate is warmer and there are more opportunities. <br /> <br /> The most beautiful part of this film is the people themselves. People in the choir who are between 30 and 95 years old have unique, colorful lives and are very pleasant beings. They are characterized by a harsh climate and recession in the north and adapted to the way of life. Throughout the film, we learned about a lot of people in the choir and followed them through the songs, some church and port events, and finally a trip to Murmansk. The exterior filmed in the film is very beautiful and characterized by Norwegian nature. Stage design is also natural and comes directly from the choir and from the lives of the people we encounter. Living room, bathroom, kettle on the oven; There is nothing artificial about this film, not people, not the environment, not their music and not their feelings. Everything is as real as it can be. It all loses when it comes to the story. It's very beautiful and real, but why do we see it? Is it because of the songs? Is it because of nature? Or it's just to see the story of Berlevåg Mens-Choir, their life and some of the ways they have. The message, if any, is that this small company will cope with life through such social events as the church. The choir has been keeping people for many years for many years. It's nice, but being so popular, as almost 200,000 in Norway saw it, is something wrong. There is no beginning or end. Nobody gets or loses anything, no one reveals any message or tries to persuade viewers that it's good, or that life is great there. Why was this movie created? <br /> <br /> I'm sorry. It's a nice movie about good people, but compared to the average European, Scandinavian or Norwegian film - it doesn't deserve 9 out of 10. It's 4 out of 10, and that's what I give it to. br /> <br /> If you see this movie in the theater, you should expect the average audience to be around 55-60. It is said to be consistently high in all theaters. Perhaps it is also the reason why she also received very high praise on the IMDB in the news and good grades: It's a film about the older, the older. It's a film "I regret nothing in my life", and the story says that life in a small town like Berlevåg can also be a nice life.
