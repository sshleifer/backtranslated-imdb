(Spoilers) "Cash Crop" is something like this. Down-on-their-lucky farmers grow a pot to meet. Agent DEA blows into town. Farmers hide pot. DEA Agent leaves town. End of the story. <br /> <br /> This movie features a solid performance of some second tier actors, moderates and so-called scenarios ... but has no story. And because the story is the basis of any drama, "Cash Crop" is a total failure. Too boring to recommend.
