The man, I just can't believe this movie. I watched it completely (believe me, I did it!) And the best part was the trailers at the beginning (and I hate trailers !!!!). No land, no play, no, nothing. I watched the movie and thought, "When it starts"? It never started. How can people spend money and time to make such bullshit? <br /> <br /> "The story": The dog gets a bitten bat and get angry - Okay, until now no problem, nothing special, but OK. The rest of the film will be - the dog will chase people !!! that's all, nothing else !!! Add to this some of the worst actors I have ever seen, some absolutely unrealistic scenes (and some others really stupid, like when a child doesn't breath and his mother gives him a big and strong hug to see if he gets better), and very lame ending, that's it, here's CRAP ... ops! .... CUJO. Do your favor and do something better, like playing chess with you. <br /> <br /> ZERO z 10. <br /> <br /> Gabriel.
