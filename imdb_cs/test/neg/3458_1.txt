CRAP! I inadvertently watched this movie-wondering that it was swimming upstream, which was released in 2003. I really regret wasting my hour of life sitting over it. Too bad who awarded this award. I totally hated this movie - I didn't really see it until the end. After an hour I couldn't stand it anymore. I am disgusted that people are amused by such a miserable scenario that attempts to break a dozen other stories of human interest and such behavior BA-AD. PAINFUL. I rate it 1 star out of 10. The amateur could do a much, much bigger movie.
