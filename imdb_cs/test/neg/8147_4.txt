It is true that I followed the version of this MST3K, but it is not really too bad, at least in comparison with others, that deserve my film hatred. The story focuses on a troubled girl improperly sent to a "reform" school called The Girl's City. There are races, redemptions and uselessness along the way. The story and acting are a bit flat as well as action. However, the whole thing is actually fun to some extent if you are completely bored. Overall, it's just a simple movie, but far from the worst movie ever made, with some bright spots in the movie (the Ave Maria sequence was good for me). <br /> <br /> If you have the chance to watch MST3K, you won't be disappointed. This in itself, not so much, but I can think of worse torture methods ("Spiker" anyone?).
