I can't believe any of the reviews in the reviews. Of course, the film is dated, and in our comfortable CGG age, many special effects are now deeply unconvincing. But even if he admits it, Helen from Troy is so bad that it's almost a laugh. Scripting is terrible, just horrible, without any characterization. As a result, you can see that Hardwicke and Andrews are writhing in the agony of embarrassment because they bring the most sensual shallow trite codswallop. It seems that writers feel the need to explain almost everything in a terrifying didactic scenario that allows the viewer not to decide on it at all. The beginning of the film explains the historical background as if no one had ever heard of ancient Greece; I know they had an American audience, but a hilarious way of telling them twice to make sure the action is really awful. Honestly, I can't believe the above comments that describe the movie as a great epic movie. Even with relatively primitive cinematography and the relative sophistication of today's audience, this film really stinks.
