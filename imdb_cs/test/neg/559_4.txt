I thought this movie would be a shame for the show. After all, Part 3 did not measure up to Part 2, and this is not what Daniel Sawn has. Miyagi's humor in this movie was not as funny as it was in Part 3, but it was funny enough for the film to be watched. The little girl was pretty good. He's a lost teenager who needs direction. I find it hard to believe a conspiracy. That aunt just agreed to leave his home and her niece under the care of Mr. Miyagi, the man she had just met. Of course he was her brother's friend. <br /> <br /> I appreciated the monastery. One might think of some of my other reviews that I wouldn't like dancing monks, but I thought it was fun. It turns out they know how to have fun. If it were monks in ancient China who danced on pop music, it would be a different thing. Probably the most intelligent part of the movie was when the girl thought it was stupid that the monks wouldn't kill the mistake. Miyagi told her that street gangs who are killing each other are stupid, peoples trying to destroy each other are stupid, but to be respectful of all life is not stupid. Miyagi also expressed such wisdom in other films. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 10. Sure, I liked some things. It wasn't as fun as the third part, and no character could live up to Sato in Part 2. This movie has no re-watch value. I can't imagine it again, but once it's worth seeing.
