What is this film. The script simply does not exist. The movie sometimes appears as a music video. But it can't be that the soundtrack doesn't really match. Pathetic way of combining action and rap. You might think it's a recipe for a successful movie ... here it will fail. The dialogues in this movie killed me. The scene when Harlan interrogates a policeman is just lamentable. Generally speaking, recent Seagals movies are barely observable. What the hell happened to this guy? I know he's old, but can't get "Hollywood" to drop a decent script or something? Is he escaping his escapade dough to India, which he takes for everything he serves?
