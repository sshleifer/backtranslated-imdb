My Take: Typically routine and lazy right on a video attempt from Disney. Disney has to fall in love with the family movie tradition, which is a family dog. Many films are dedicated to stories that focus exclusively on the best person. Disney himself made a handful. They also made a handful of those that are literally dogs. Add this to this game. <br /> <br /> I haven't seen the original for a very long time, so I'm probably not the right person to see if this straightforward video continues. . Anyone who is older than seven is not the right person to see him. Perhaps only the youngest of the young will want to see LADY AND TRAMP II: SCAMP'S ADVENTURE, and even grow up and say it's not the best kind of family fun they've ever seen. I think it's fair, I can say it requires a rental, but that's not much to say. <br /> <br /> This sequel will largely capture parts that have remained the original. Lady and Tramp now have a litter of cute Crocker Spaniel puppies ... and one mischievous cross named Scamp, who is from the old block. Instead of home borders, Scamp wishes to escape with the other martyr dogs of the city, unknown to his father's own past as one of those street hybrids. To capture the original magic, it throws in the same poor dog / rich dog love story, on the contrary. Scamp belongs to one of the mixed dogs named Angel (and who wouldn't have such a name and a voice that sounds like Alyssa Milano?). Que replay the famous spaghetti scene! Other than a "cute" factor, there is nothing in store for all viewers in this lazy-to-video effort. Stick to the original. <br /> <br /> Rating: ** of 5.
