Well ... there were some great, creamy smooth Marlene faces, along with her "shocking", gender-bender outfit (plus her unsurpassed "transmogration" from monkey to human being); but overall a generally unconvincing plot and an old acting performance - not to mention less than engaging melodies that come from Miss Dietrich's "baritone" voice - little to make Blonde Venus a permanent place in the Pantheon of my mind's memorable movies. Cary Grant - still in the throat of childhood film - seemed to be forever trying to "find himself", while Herbert Marshall apparently never had anything but Herbert Marshall from the day he was born until the day he died. Naturally, from a historical point of view, Blonde Venus was fun to watch if she was able to postpone ... "great expectations".
