This is one of the more badly made films I've ever seen. Truffaut must take something seriously; It's not just a B-movie that hit hacks. Truffaut apparently couldn't decide whether to make a noir or a sentimental chick. and Deneuve, whose dozens (?) flip-flops aren't just incredible - nor did he act badly; he just didn't act at all. Among other things, how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person like Julie / Marion is simply beyond the ability of someone to suspend distrust; the role absolutely requires someone who is not so beautiful. Belmond's actions also suffer, though his character is not as incredible as Deneuve. Unfortunately, the clich√© ending (which I will not describe) is too suitable for this complete mistake.
