I rented this movie with the kind permission of Netflix and thought I'd get the 1972 version. I was sitting helpless, watching this new version, thinking: Gee, the production values ​​were spectacular! I was convinced that the soundtrack had a mild 70s sound. I was even more convinced that it was a 70's movie when I thought (almost every five seconds) that one thing that was missing between Gene and Finney was an intense embrace, a full look, a passionate kiss. I'm sorry, even though John Knowles himself has hinted that this is not a homosexual relationship, it is painfully obvious that yes, that's exactly what it was. When people (usually adolescents) of the same sex have "intense" friendships, it means that all desires for love, belonging, desire to express themselves sexually are spilling out. These boys had to come together, but they were never allowed. Despite the spirited performance of Toby Moore, I never felt that some of the emotions were real. I never joined any of the boys because their relationship wasn't really honest. People want to live in fantasy and think it happened in the 1940s when these boys couldn't 'have these sexual feelings. But I say they did - at least in the book they did, and in this film Finney, almost painfully, for Gene. The "intensity" that John Knowles suggests existed among them, was the closeness of the wardrobe, the worship of heroes, idolatry - that would normally be expressed in a sexual way. Even if these boys were to suppress it, it was supposed to be crystal clear, but this film doesn't even suggest it. Finally, there is an incredibly bizarre moment when Finney, who broke his leg, is playfully jumped on all the other guys during the ball game. If they weren't just a bunch of nincompoops, they would know they couldn't throw bodies against them. Apparently this moment, which smashed the bones, was lost to both the director and the producer.
