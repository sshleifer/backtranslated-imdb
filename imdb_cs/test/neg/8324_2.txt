(This review is based on the English version) Orson Welles' legendary unfinished epic work was just that - unfinished. It should have been left as such, not thrown together in this clumsy, boring compilation of any material available. Although I am sure it was done with the best intent, the creators not only failed Welles' vision, but also managed to discredit it by causing the viewers to do so. <br /> <br /> The first thing that hits the viewer is the amateur sound quality. Not only are the newly dubbed voices rather poor performances, they are also inconsistent - the original Welles recordings (using their own voice as they often did) were kept in a handful of scenes. There was no slightest attempt at consistency. Add to this an extremely empty sound mix that has only a bare minimum of sound effects and atmospheres - a long sequence during a gigantic festival (including a bull run) sounds like it was recorded on a deserted suburban street with about three people. the sound of the crowd to be in the thousands. The real problem, however, is the inevitable fact that 'Don Quixote' was incomplete, and it is clearly apparent from this observation. The film consists of a handful of scenes that are linked together and dragged into ridiculous lengths to complicate the run time. The Case at Point - A sequence in which Sancho looks for Don Quixote in the city continues forever. It's just Sancho approaching people in the crowd, asking them the same questions over and over - there's no way Welles could ever have used every single shot in its entirety, but that's what appears here. It takes more than twelve minutes if in fact it would most likely take about two minutes of absolute maximum in the correct final version of the movie. While the beginning of the film is quite complete and fairly well done, the rest has massive holes that just can't be filled with the endless overlap of the Spanish countryside and even more shots of Don Quixote and Sancho back and forth. There's no end. No resolution, no conclusion, no punching, no point. Although there is material in private collections that was not available to the creator, it could not be responsible for what would be needed to make it happen. comprehensive and coherent work. Welles just didn't finish shooting, mainly because his main actor died before they could finish. However, leaving aside the fact that it was not complete, and can never be, one would think that you just need to see a collection of shots of this masterpiece that could be enough. Unfortunately, by putting everything in such a way, one of them has an overall negative impression. Especially what was obviously the amazing performance of Akim Tamiroff, how Sancho was utterly destroyed by the new voice and long, stretched scenes that eventually make him simply irritate. Orson Welles' vision this film was something much more ambitious and complex than the simple storytelling of Don Quixote, but it was trying to do it, and as such this point was lost. The only person who could gather all the material into something worth it would be Welles himself, and he wouldn't. The footage could have been much better used in a documentary film that records the whole Welles saga trying to make a film. Welles himself even came up with a perfect title for such a doco: "When do you want to finish Don Quixote?"
