I came to realize that I was watching this kind of movie that they don't like very much. Caged women are still more "women in prison" movies and like most of the rest of the genre; The plot is completely abandoned in favor of simply showing naked women. Don't get me wrong now; I like naked women, but I also like that there is some plot that goes with nudity, and because this movie has only basic "women in prison" that go through it (as well as the basic escape, of course), I'm a little bored before the end. The film is good because there is hardly a moment when women wear clothes, but that's probably the only positive element. Director (and writer, ha ha) Erwin C. Dietrich looks forward to displaying the details of a naked female body, but is never very erotic. The director has produced a number of films, including director Jess Franco. In my opinion, he should stick to production because his talents do not exist, and he does not seem to know how to film a sexual scene. This kind of material is a lot of time dry, but I think Franco could do more of it. Overall, it could be enough for people who are really into this sort of thing; but I can't say I enjoyed it.
