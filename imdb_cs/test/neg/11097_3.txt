A confusing, nonsensical script engraved with the size of the Eiffell Tower. Terrible meeting of all involved - no exception! Laughter and kitschy dialogue. Lame attempts at humor and romance. Extremely cheap special effects. All of this is for the tremendous clutter of the movie you can best avoid.
