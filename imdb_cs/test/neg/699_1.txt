I'm in a movie class and I know I don't know everything about the movie, but it's true one of the worst, stupid, delayed and lost times, movies I've ever seen and seen NAPOLEAN DINAMITE. both are equally terrible. Conrack is boring and nothing interesting is going to happen in the film, and that's not really a heart-stunned story, and Pat Conroy won't beat anything! I'm not saying there should be fighting and bullshit, but that would revive more than an unreal movie. children who like to play in this movie could be real kids from yammacraux island who sounded stupid and couldn't behave in terms of me, it was a stupid idea for a book and even worse ida for movie I don't know why this movie was even Made, Deviantly Five Worst Movies Of All Time.
