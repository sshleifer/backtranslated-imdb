One of the problems with popular culture, especially when discussing the popular culture of the 1970s, is that the mass media - especially television - is usually about four years behind 'underground' media, primarily music. Many people think that the 'Woodstock Generation' remained important throughout the 1970s, actually, it was all at Altamont in 1970. 1972, 'Underground' rock or 'counterculture' moved east to England and Led Zepplin, a black sabbath, and David Bowie, the early metal heads and so-called "glam-rockers" who were all "peace and love" - ​​no, even in a darkly different spirit was not Charles Manson's "family". This apparent TV show pilot (who fortunately never caught the net) is trying to cope with a culture that was as dry as yesterday's flowers. He has been around for several years - at the time he was made, writer Carlino has already earned recognition for the hard revenge of mafia revenge and cultural references are all "Easy Rider" and Woodstock (1969). in fact earlier, 1966/67 - at Woodstock Hendrix, Canned Heat, and Sly and Family Stone, this kind of folk pop was set into oblivion. The movie is about a middle class family that goes on the road to meet hippies. \ tWow, man, tomorrow, outasight, it's groovy blowing up on going bags. But politics counts for nothing - Vietnam ? some place in Asia, right? This average (meaning outdated and mindless) TV movie is redeemed only by Jeff Bridges' surprisingly mature performance as a young student who convinces his parents and grandmother to "discover" (hippie) America. All other performances are the standard television show of standard television actors of that time. The director will use some nice cinematography, but otherwise the film is a bad way to spend 90 minutes. I knew it was all when Sal Mineo commented on a young refugee (who says to others) who really are not there: "He is a latent existentialist." Wow, far, groovy. A few more points for being "so bad that it's funny", but if you don't care about the 70s TV version of the 70s, stay away.
