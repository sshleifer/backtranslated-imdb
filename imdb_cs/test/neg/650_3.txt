I really wanted to like this movie, but the stimulation was too slow. It was a nice story, but it was like watching a slug race. The movie would be better served if he had any other actions. I don't mean anything big but at least something in the background. It could also be helped by songs that set the tone / mood of longer-lasting periods that were missing in the dialogue. br /> <br /> It's about 10 years since I saw it, so maybe I'll have to give another chance. <br /> <br /> 3/10 or * 1/2 (out of four)
