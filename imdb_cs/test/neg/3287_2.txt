This show is just another bad comedy that will probably be canceled after two seasons. It's not just that jokes are sexist / racist / homophobic, but they're not funny and cliché. In the first episode, Father said something in the spirit of "I wish women wouldn't go out and get a job and have the same rights as men blah blah" That really helps attitudes huh? Then he made fun of his son and said he was weird. What parent says their child is special? Overall, this show is boring, unoriginal, offencive, cliché and above all NOT FUNNY. American dad is offencive. But it will also make you laugh and obviously marry. That's the difference.
