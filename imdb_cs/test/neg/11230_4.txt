Ken Russell directed this strange (not too) erotic thriller and if I didn't know I would bet my life that Brian DePalma was the director. Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma, from the gaudy cinematography that lights up too bright, into a home story that turns into a stem and slash, even the title of this scream "Depalma, DePalma, Depalma" Unfortunately, since Brian DePalma is increasingly perceived as a poor man, Hitchcock should try to emulate his own style over the years. Sure, a TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN-style erotic thriller would be bizarre with a big B, but at least it would be a unique film experience. Stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and persecuted by religious maniac were too common in the video market in the 1980s. Oh and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he has played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s. Yawning <br /> <br /> The only thing that makes a real comment for CRIMES OF PASSION is the controversy it caused. I think the studio was the happiest people who heard it because no publicity is bad publicity, but in terms of controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes? There is no and the only controversy I might think that China Blue controls a policeman with a baton. Needless to say, he did not walk quietly HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
