Yes. Those of my generation who grew up watched the old Sunbow cartoons. The 1980s was one of the best cartoons in television history. Well written stories, well-developed characters. It is true that it was nothing more than a glorified toy, but it certainly helped carry this toy. Fast forward almost twenty years later and enter Valor vs. Venom. The animation was average at most. The movement of the characters seemed jerky and puppet. The film felt more like the sequel to Little Soldiers than the story of a special military force. Then we have character development or lack. Dusty glad everything is Dusty? Slice and dice do things together? What? Did writers write a course on how they develop characters with a deep equivalent of Jar Jar Binks? As for the story. I like a little Sci-Fi. But the whole concept of converting soldiers into a mutant army was made to death in the universe of Joe. Mega Monsters or Toxo-Zombie Anyone? But I give the creators credit for making the fans of the boys happy by organizing martial arts every 10 minutes. I am not a big fan of SE and SS, but I like fighting scenes between the two. If you can appreciate VvV for what it will be like. I confess that VvV can't appreciate how I should. Again, everything Joe gets compared to what's going on in the 1980s, and honestly nothing will ever compare to GI Joe's glory days. If you can appreciate VvV for what it will be like.
