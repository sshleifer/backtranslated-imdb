There is something interesting about disaster movies. A simple, primordial premise can lead to several great stories. It is true that most disaster films tend to explore the known territory instead, but I can usually live with it. Unfortunately, the flood probably marks the lowest point in the history of this sub-genre. Robert Carlyle is undoubtedly the star of the movie, even though the screen time is divided between different places and characters. It gives hardly decent performance. Joanne Whalley is also very uneven. Especially bad is veteran actor Tom Courtenay (played in Doctor Zhivago for Heaven). His timing is completely gone most of the time and his characterization is very bad. This is an awkward performance for the man. The rest of the cast ranges from decent to really bad with one exception: Jessalyn Gilsig, whom I thought might be there as a fence / eye candy device, by far the most compelling performance. It doesn't mean much about how badly everyone else is, but it's still nice to see she cared. The script is really bad, confusing and clich√©. Some of the worse lines I have heard at some point are passed on to the actors one by one. You've seen this story a thousand times. It employs all the dramatic hooks and tears you saw in "Outbreak", "Armageddon", Poseidon movies (original and remake) and many more. The direction is terrible. No sense of timing, nothing inspired. The shots are faint, the dialogue and actions both fail. Editing is bad, but how do you edit such a mess? This film undoubtedly tried to rely too much on (rather poor) CGI. Human factor, drama, and character struggles are overlooked. Scenes where characters must actually face floods are rare and poorly executed. Felt-on-TV feeling sick. Any guy to go from a rope from a helicopter? No problem, let's show it inside the helicopter and do a really bad job of cutting and editing, and we have another shot with him safely on the ground in the most obvious way. The film's score is rather poor. All around, no timing. The end is probably the worst I've ever seen. It was as if they had lost ideas. Discard it, you can't escape from something if you never had it. Budget must be running out. This is really amateur work. I give him 2 for using London as a place, which is a nice change because Gilsig is really decent in the key support role and for several CGI shots that were decent (the ones closing in London and the gates). Do yourself a favor and check out the Day after Tomorrow or just some catastrophic movie before this. It includes older classics like The Towering Inferno.
