I like most of Full Moon Pictures, so I ordered this movie from the US because you won't see it anywhere in Germany. I thought it would be as enjoyable and fun as the Subspecies or Puppetmaster series because they were full of atmosphere. <br /> <br /> I was glad when the movie finally came. But after watching the cheesy movie, I was very disappointed. The actors (I think you can't even say actors) are boring and unreal. The story was a bad performance, and even the set and the monster were very cheap and miserable. I hope no one ever does the sequel or remake of this horrible movie. :-)
