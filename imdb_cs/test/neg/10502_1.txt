If you came here, it's because you saw this movie and were wondering what others had to say about it. <br /> <br /> I feel for you, I really do. And I apologize very much as Canadian (because that's what we do) that this movie had to overcome your eyes, even if only for a moment. I have heard that there is no cure for retinal bleeding that has been reported from each of the dozens of cases. I, like everyone else, believed this movie was a stupid B-movie ripoff Blade. I thought, "I could definitely use a good laugh for a silly movie." I'll give the creators of this film ONE Positive Comment on their 'creation': Thanks for removing REC XX / XX / XX from the bottom right corner of the screen. I see how it would be a distraction from seeing this movie. And for the record, I saw the movie but didn't look at it. The dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother's trailer, I swear to God. <br /> <br /> You know what? I'm not writing about it anymore. It's just too painful.
