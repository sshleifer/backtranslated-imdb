For all fans of matches, it is wrestlemania to forget. No logic of matches, some garbage tricks (doink clown and giant Gonzalez) it was a forgotten PPV something rare for WWE (F). The logic of Hogan, who won the world title at the end, made no sense, and many people feel he himself helps to put a nail in PPV. From senseless tricks of Roman soldiers to mere real bad wrestling (doink vs crush is the worst match) to just a bad match (Scott "Razor Ramon vs Bob Backlund, how can you have one of the biggest wrestlers on the matrix, doing a comeback, and working his the first wrestlemania, facing the power of a wrestler who was undefeated at the time), this is PPV that even WWE has since admitted, was the way down what he expected.
