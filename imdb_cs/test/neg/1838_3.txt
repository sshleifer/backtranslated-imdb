I was looking forward to this movie because everyone was talking about it as a good horror movie and finally a European movie. So maybe my expectations were high. It starts with a good silent sequence of horror / shocks, but lets you do it right in the following scenes where plot starts, like acting and motivation / life of characters is no better than any "TV act" drama. It keeps it that way. The horror part of the movie is definitely a good idea and another, but ALL scenes are of the kind "seen it before". Overall, my idea of ​​this movie was that it had a good concept that was embedded in the average story, bad play, and less than tolerable conspiracies. <br /> <br />
