As an ancient film fan, I have heard many times about the controversial film CALIGULA, which was ambiguously rated as one of the most realistic epics of some and one of the most disgusting porn movies of others. I decided to see it in the whole uncut version to evaluate it myself, hoping to find something positive that would justify the many accusations against the film. One autumn evening I sat in a chair and started to watch. Initial quote from the New Testament shocked me a little and caused me the first controversy ... why signify the punishment from the gospel of Mark in the pagan Rome movie? The overture of the pastoral scene with the young half naked pair (Caligula and Drusilla) of hopelessly running meadows seemed quite sentimental. Music that sounded unforgettable while credits also provoked me in a positive sense. The negative feelings in me grew early, especially at the death of Tiberius. Cruelty seemed very intense and exaggerated. But it wasn't so bad in the middle. During the second half of the film, I felt like I watched no historical epic, but very disgusting porn. Finally, I said, "This is one of the movies that one can really hate" ... I am aware that film can be controversial, but I never expected CALIGULA to go so far in eliminating all the taste limits. I hate this movie for many reasons, but especially one. CALIGULA does not serve the purpose of an ancient epic (which claims to be), but Bob Guccione, director and founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims to combine film art with pornography. This is, in my opinion, the most serious thing that the film can be accused of. The film is an art that should be driven by taste, message, some sense of epic grandeur, while this film kills all the boundaries of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most appropriate aspect of a human being in the most cruel, decadent way. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don't think there are people whose psyche will not be affected. Some say Rome was so brutal under Caligula's rule. Yes, it's true. Corruption flourished at that time, various sexual deviations were preferred to Roman citizens. Yet I do not think it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make them an emphasis on the ancient epic. I believe that this rather illustrates the bizarre psyche of producers and their strange tendencies ... <br /> <br /> BIG HISTORICAL ERROR: Gora Vidal's script is renowned for inaccuracies. This is evident, for example, with the character Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. However, the film shows him that he is a simple soldier, to whom Caligula carries his most possible ways of torture and rape. Moreover, Livia was not the wife of Proculus raped by Caesar at her wedding. What is behind the change of historical character stories into stories filled with incredible vulgarity and violence? Another example of a historic journey is the figure of Caesonia depicted by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula's wife along with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after his sister's death. Sexual abuse of his new wife in the temple is a cheerful scene without historical foundation. I also hated the moment with the machine - the director's pure imagination, which has nothing to do with historical facts. TECHNICAL ASPECTS AND CASTLE: From a technical point of view, the film is nothing special. Cinematography cannot boast of being exceptionally fine and the kits and costumes are nothing special. The only strong point of the film, however, is performance, especially Malcolm McDowall's Caligula. He does a perfect job in the lead role depicting the madness and cruelty of the Emperor. McDowall increases the value of the film. If everything worries you at CALIGULA, you can at least admire his performance. I also imagined Helena Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the film is based on the Suetonius gossip that Caligula loved his sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O'Toole as Old Tiberius are also unforgettable. O'Toole makes his best piece of playing in the Capri Cave sequence portraying the decadence and exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that the only ones I like about CALIGULA are performances. Therefore, I don't rate the movie 1/10. <br /> <br /> LAME CONTINUITY: The film's historical inaccuracy takes place in pairs with poor continuity. Let's just analyze the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri's cave, where she sees the terrible pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome, where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula's bed is a bad sign. And immediately are the characters back in Capri, where Nerva (John Gielgud) dies ...? <br /> <br /> All in all, I don't recommend CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read the wonderful novel by Robert Graves I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD, or watch the Herbert Wise mini series with Derek Jacobi's spectacular performance. CALIGULA is a sick film whose most serious crime is the destruction of art. That is, in his most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic. There are movies that are really artistic and sharpen the taste of people's beauty, there are films of average entertainment; yet they have a lot to offer, there are films that show extreme violence; yet they still convey some moral, <br /> <br /> there are films that show sickness and decline for themselves, and consequently damage people's minds, unfortunately, CALIGULA is one of the newest
