During my struggle to stay awake during this borefest, I struggled with my approaching rendition to discover some stupid conspiracy about fraternal schmuck, quite incredibly annoyingly unpleasant, running into problems with a psychotic, radioactively damaged half man / half cyborg named Splatter, who sends his soldiers to them for the murder of his prestigious, politically vocal leader (for which Splatter has been killed, put them to blame for being a leader). These false faces form a group that expresses its feelings anarchically, albeit nonviolently, living on the dilapidated streets abandoned by the "civilized world", expressing their concerns about nuclear disarmament. Most of the film has these five frats, who run along darkened streets with graffiti walls, as Splatter and his punks follow. Luckily for these guys, they find punk elegant to help them on their way out of this somewhat ugly terrain with which they are unintelligible. This area, where the Frata boys are immersed, is a true labyrinth of streets and alleys with the idea of ​​leaving the heaviest, especially when the madmen and the Splatter bundle occupy almost every turn. Yeah, I was cheated like others thanks to the HR Giger poster, which is very excellent. If he was just the designer of this work, it is not, and we, the viewer, have left the film on the pattern of all the films that seem to be, Walter Hill's WARRIORS, except that the film doesn't have the style or gravel that the film has. The film has a plethora of pieces and lame confrontations between the brothers and the punk, often laughing. The setting is quite interesting, and there are some atmospheric uses of neon light, but it's not an environment that is a problem .. it's plotting and characters in an environment that grow tedious. The saddlebags under my eyes weighed this film harder every minute. Yes, Texas CHAINSAW stars Edwin Neal (a pretty humorous voice-man who has a funny conversation on a DVD I rented for this flaming lawn movie) and Marilyn Burns have "key" roles as enemies members of their faction against the final conclusion within the building complex at the end. Neal's character Splatter uses these metal spikes that emerge from his metal arm to kill his victims.
