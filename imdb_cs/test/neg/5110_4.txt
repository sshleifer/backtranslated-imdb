Once in a while I will remember that I saw this bizarre fiasco, which is the cross between "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?", "Sunset Boulevard", Lana Turner LSD "The Big Cube" and the murder of Manson. which also took place in 1969, but perhaps before the so-called "film"! There are some land descriptions here already, so I'm not going into it. But it is worth noting that Miriam Hopkins plays a parody of herself: a quivering, ego-manic, faded actress. Maybe she thought she was making a film that was as successful as Bette Davis's horror. The old Hopkins Gallery has never stopped working, so you have to hand it over. It shows a bit too much meat in this movie, something Davis and Crawford would never do. And there is a scene with Miriam in a real delicious Hollywood Boulevard Christmas parade that had to be filmed by Xmas, 1968. Gale Sondergard is old, old, old. It's just shocking how wrinkled and terrible it looks. John Garfield, Jr. he looks a bit like his father, but not so interesting. I think one of the three Stoogs is a guide at the beginning. If it's not one of the Stoogs, it's someone. I was amazed to see this thing in the form of a commercial videotape that a friend gave me, who knows all about the waste. It's amazing!!!
