The aircraft carrying the employees of a large biotech company - including the CEO's daughter - is sinking in a dense forest in the Pacific Northwest. When a search and rescue mission is launched, CEO, Harlan Knowles (Lance Henriksen), joins a small ragtag group to carry out their own search and rescue mission. But what does Knowles seek and try to save, and just what he watches and watches in the woods? <br /> <br /> Oy, what was this movie! It was a shame, because for one it is Lance Henriksen, who is one of my favorite genres of the modern genre, and two, it could be an easy movie. It suffers from two major drawbacks, and they are probably both writer / director Jonas Quastel's bug - this movie (which I'll call his aka Sasquatch) has just about the worst editing I've ever seen next to Alone in Dark (2005), and Quastel's constant advice for the cast seems to have been, "Okay, let's try it again, but this time I want everyone to talk to each other, improvise non-sequiturs and generally try to be as pleasant as possible". The potential was there. Despite the rip-off aspects (any air crash related material apparently tried to take care of the Blair Witch Project (1999) and any titular monster-related material was Cribbing Predator (1987)), Ed Wood-like Exposure and Laughter Dialogue, Conspiracy had the promise and potential for finer and far less saccharide overtones. The monster costume, once we see it, was more than enough for my taste. A mixture of the types of characters crawling through the forest could be great if Quastel and co-founder Chris Lanning rejected the stereotypical notch from 11 to at least 5 and spent more time exploring their relationships. The "lair" monster had some nice design, namely the corpse decoration and the more primitive Jeepers Creepers (2001). If it were well-arranged, there were some scenes with a decent dialogue that could be easily effective. But the most frightening thing about Sasquatch is the number of wrong steps: For some reason Quastel thinks it's a good idea to chop up dialogue scenes that occur in minutes in real time, so we see instead several lines of scene A, then a few lines of scene B, then back to A, back to B, and so on. For some reason, he thinks it is a good idea to use frequently used black screens between snippets of dialogue, whether we need an unspecified amount of time to pass between irrelevant comments or irrelevant. It seems that the comments appear one by one in time as well. <br /> <br /> For some reason, he doesn't care whether the scenes were taken in the morning, afternoon, mid-night, etc. randomly. The scenes we've shown appear to be randomly selected. Important events, never or barely appear, and we are stuck in too many pointless scenes. For some reason, he left a film about cave art in the film when he needs more exposure to justify getting there, or it just needs to be cut out because it's not so important (monster intelligence and "humanity" could be easily shown in another way). For some reason, there is a whole character - Mary Mancini - remaining in the script, even if it is useless. <br /> <br /> For some reason, we're going to an extremely soft porn scene, even though the motif is never repeated. Br /> <br /> For some reason, characters still call Harlan Knowles "Mr. H" as well as stereotypes of Asian households. For some reason, Quastel insists on using "Blurry" Cam "and" Distorto-Cam "for a monster attack scene, even though the costume doesn't look so bad, and it would be much more efficient to put in a fine filter or something other than bad cinematography. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but you have that idea. <br /> <br /> I really wanted to want this movie better than I am I'm a fan of Henriksen, I was interested in , I loved the environment, I love hiking, and that's basically a tourism film on one level - but I just couldn't. Every time I thought it would be "better from this moment to the end," Quastel made another terrible move. , my score was 3 out of 10.
