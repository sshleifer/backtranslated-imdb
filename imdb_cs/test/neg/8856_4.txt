Well, this movie is really "PLUMPED" HAHA. This is a bit like the attitude of this movie. The storyline is just a copy of Pulp Fiction, okay it's acceptable, but make this piece if "PLUMP" (haha)! is really incredible. The story is so pathetic and the whole thing just got a few laughs. He tried to make a few jokes from various other films, and that mostly failed. I mean a sense of humor, but this is not really a way to laugh. Most of the supposedly "Funny" moments are absolutely ironic. The film is a quiet short run of about 75 minutes. They could have done a lot of fun, they seemed to be making fun of the movie blockbuster, they were gambling and hey! I think they got lost! <br /> <br /> In total PLUMP Fiction is "PLUMPABLE", but you won't collect much! <br /> <br /> Is it worth watching again and again? , in fact it's more than enough! So is it worth the rent? Ummm .. As I said, "PLUMPABLE", but you will only have a few "PLUMPS"! <br /> <br /> Total of 10: and 4 of 10!
