This is a weak sum of almost everything: refugees, relations between Croatia and Slovenia, globalization, sexual orientation. A very large clumsy metaphor about Slovenia at intersections between the past, which is a symbol of everything that a "virgin" becomes. The queen of the household and her future, which is symbolized by listening to music in clubs and being a lesbian and never having children. It plays a somewhat recent Slovenian virgin legend and "forest" king "provided that the goat shape (Zlatorog Beer shots are also based on this legend), but unfortunately, the treatment is very incoherent. that Weiss thinks the end justifies the means: he can use all sorts of "dreams" sequences to choose which ones are true and which are imaginary, how can a jeep ride with a "forest king" be real for all three girls but the scene outside the tent is only real in Simon's imaginary? The end just pulls and turns on (I can't believe the runtime movie is only 98 minutes, I watched the director's cut without knowing it?) When three girls had to watch the camera after for about 10 seconds while looking fearful and happy at the same time (so obvious). I never thought I'd be able to reveal bad behavior in a movie I don't understand, but it didn't take long for me to Simon "shifts most of the time as if she were playing in a silent movie. It wasn't so bad when I thought the director was just starting out and wanted to capture what she thought her generation was about film by doing half experimental film until I realized that the director is in the film at the age of 37 and that her work is probably "serious".
