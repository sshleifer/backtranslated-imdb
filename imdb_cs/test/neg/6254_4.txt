CHEERLEADER MASSACRE (2003), starring Tamie Sheffield, Charity Rahmer, Erin Byron, Leonard Johnson, Eddie Edwards, Samantha Phillips, GiGi Erneta, April Flowers, Nikki Fritz, Tylo Tyler, Brad Beck, Summer Williams, Brinke Stevens, Melissa Brasselle. Conspiracy: A group of cheerleaders, along with their coach and three boys, are on their way to the game when their delivery suddenly breaks and attacks them. in a nearby cabin. Soon they drink, have sex and are brutally murdered one by one with an invisible killer. good: A few laughs, a surprising killer identity, a portrait of Brinke Stevens, my favorite scene from SLUMBER PARTY MASSAGE is used as a flashback. Bad: I was excited about this movie, I loved all three slumber party massacres because they were so fun, and I was expecting a lot from this "Slumber Party / Sorority House Massacre with Scream Tones" but it was just licked! They turned it on "We are cheese but proud" and basically made soft-core porn, but with the good guy-dun-it. <br /> <br /> **
