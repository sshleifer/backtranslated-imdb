In addition to being a ruthlessly shot film (imagine bringing the camera to an average high school drama club), people who think that this legend is something "real" must grow. This is the 21st century. Guess what: ghosts don't exist. Most people learn from their mother when they are about 5 years old. You really need to grow up. The fact that fraud was committed almost two centuries ago does not mean that it is a fraud. The fact that a large number of Inbred villagers from Tennessee believe they won't. Go to college. Or at least finish high school.
