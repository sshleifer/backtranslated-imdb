This one isn't alive enough to be fun. Something's out there, tearing people off the screen after a spacecraft crash (off-screen), while government executives are investigating (off-screen) and bad actors saying silly lines (on screen), including a guy who looks like Jim Carrey with a hangover. The "monster", when finally displayed, looks like an extra from "Robot Monster", but there is not enough monster fu. Fortunately, it's pretty short. Skip it if you don't want to get bored from your skull by this
