Poorly directed short "movie" (shot on hi-def or betacam seems). Screaming student film / video all the way. The assumption is a limited range and the short actually feels much longer than it runs. Some interesting acting moments and some decent production value, but not enough to pick up this movie from the "hole" it fell into.
