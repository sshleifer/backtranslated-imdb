This is easily one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There's so much in the house that goes wrong that it doesn't happen that it's not even funny. It is admitted that this is a movie that means it will not happen in everyday life, but this film is much more appealing than a theory that no child has left. All these people are in the house and no one has noticed another, not to mention the heck that seems to be everywhere but in the cage. The first time I managed to deal with the Soviet joke, but after an hour I just can't take it, I'd rather kill myself than see the damn owl again. Did I laugh during this movie? No. Not even once? No. Terrible, Terrible, Terrible. The fact that this pile of garbage is closed with Ashton Kutcher bending his boss and taking his pants before everyone just makes this movie getting worse. But wait, the day is saved because the damned owl can fly. THIS, WONDERFUL! However, I give this movie some credentials, its not as bad as Epic Movie .....
