** Can contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> Carefree Islander South Sea is executed by other (Caucasian) natives after acquainting with visiting scientists Tod Andrews and Tina Carver. Meddlesome scientists kick him and find out that he took the form of a humanoid tree. It revives and continues to rampage and quite certainly that the 50th boogeyman, A-Bomb, is blamed for this deviation. To say that this particular monster walks as if to stick his ** would be pointless. Suffice it to say that the creatures play together, just like the film itself, cast their enemies into some clever sand and give the main characters one more thing to make silly notes about it. Paul Blaisdell created a tree-man suit and it's hardly his best job. Over the years, this film has been screened in many commentaries like "Hell It Can Go!" Personally, I think it's the best movie I've ever seen.
