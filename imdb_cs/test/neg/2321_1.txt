Absolutely different film with Abbott and Costello. Even our little children would become angry with this complete movie mess. Abbott as Dinklepuss. What a look on his face. Sure, he must have been part of this horrible movie. Did anyone notice that Costello's mother sounded like a Fay Bainter in the movie? Fortunately for Mrs. Bainter, she's not in the movie. There's really no excitement for kids. Jokes, if any, are quite outdated. Some songs are pretty done, but the lyrics are ridiculous.
