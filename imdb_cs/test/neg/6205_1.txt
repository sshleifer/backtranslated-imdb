Soon after this film was released, Salman Khan was handed over 6 years in prison. (Read on to know why I mentioned it.) <br /> <br /> And I sighed relief. Not that I was happy that he got jail for something because he was a celeb but I was happy cus it meant no more Salman Khan movies, nothing more of his histrionics and nothing more through hyped Acting (read Overacting). This film made no sense at all. A scene where a child belonging to one of the families makes a rocket that has been activated by voice. According to the film script, it would chase anyone. But in the end, only Salman Khan Bare Chested finds it. Well that's what happened. Rocked is activated in another stupid way and you have to have IQ .001 to believe it. Then he pursues Salman Khan, who has been on his jet ski and the pursuit continues if he does not do all the pieces he could show to the foolish audience. (In my opinion, all those people who gave this movie 5 or more if they're not paid for it.) Another breathtaking, incredible scene was at the end when all the marriage measures were made and Salman Khan and Govinda come in disguise and stop marriage to some of those very unwanted songs. Later, though, everything is done and the mere confession of govinda and Katrina Kaif katrina's father and Bingo is ready. Everything is fine and Govinda marries Kartin .... That made me wonder if the conviction was so easy, why they didn't, and they tortured us for so many hours and wasted money. This movie has to avoid and it doesn't even think it has a scene that is worth watching. The storyline is too disconnected from the characters that appear from where not, and eventually disappears ... for ex Choot don ... What is a waste of characters. After this movie, I took the promise not to watch Salman khan Movies for the rest of my life unless he wins Oskar ... (hahahah ... which means I would never look)
