The guy mentioned to sue for 1.5 hours wasting his life, I can't disagree that one. The film began as a thing of the cam project class and ended up in a dark room. Whenever girls, where there is naked magically, appeared with light, I know that dint write script or have something to say about it. But this is like a bad remake of a saw with a bad end. Thinking about the person who wrote this story, sick. This is a really shocking movie cant to say that horror cause its not. Her mere brutality and the violence that made me sick. It's really frustrating to watch a movie with no ending like his bang on his face. the movie is ready now you can go home. cons -cam-lighting (althrue think it should be) -overdone -sickening <br /> <br /> cons -real in your face-was good in my opinion -it sucks You Are in <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is not my taste of the witer movie we wanted us to know that these things happen, and the man wrote his own little imagination. If you've ever seen movies seen? they all had a moment of comfort in something they held. This? No. Maybe it's just me that I'm too soft, but this movie trembles me and the story is really short, the sick person slowly kills the girls. But the actors dragged you into this film every blow that you could almost feel. And, to be honest, should I have quickly assessed this, his terrible movie? no it is not. it is an exaggerated example of reality, it is real how it could get. Don't watch this movie if you expect a big secret or a real storyline, or even a story. one gets girls into a dark room and kills them one by one, that's a fact.
