Even Disney is guilty of cash sickness of the cow, after the roaring success of The Love Bug in 1968, the house of the mouse flopped with Herbie Rides again, Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo and Herbie goes bananas. Neither the sequel capturing the magic and harmless challenge of The Love Bug back in 68, in which we find racer Jim Douglas and his sidekick Wheely Applegate, entering Herbie at the Monte Carlo Rally. Of course, off-race things are starting to take over priorities, being mixed in a diamond robbery, and Herbie falls in love with another car! The stunts are, of course, easy and easy on the eye, and it would be an honor for me to really vent poison on such friendly pieces of hair, it's just that the film doesn't go anywhere fast and I personally see it on the coin as motivated work. You still see that Herbie is bathing, wrapping behind the scenes and of course dancing to the lady in his life, so I think something for everyone ................................ 4 / 10.
