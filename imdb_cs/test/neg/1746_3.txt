See you. This movie is a lot of things for different people. Finns, as comments have shown, can be okay or horrible or boring. Other people may be different. First, if you do not speak Finnish, you will understand half of what is happening because the headlines are terrible and even the name is translated incorrectly ("Paha maa" would probably be idiomatically translated as Badlands in the UK). Why I don't like it? Because it's a Tarantino-style movie: it just takes a very cruel reality and throws it back to you as brutally as possible. However, I am not an American, and therefore I am not particularly fond of this procedure, because all it does is to show that the director has nothing new. Technical prowess (working with the camera is brilliant), the (non-original) scenario will not save the film from where it belongs. If you would like to see a Finnish film, then go to one of the Kaurism√§ki brothers who are talented and directed with very good actresses and actors. This director should review his intention and priorities: none was understandable, and so this film failed. By not watching him, you will not miss much.
