I walked into the Heart of Gold and thought I'd follow a documentary about Neil Young. Instead, I witnessed a self-service tribute to the arrogance of an aging boom who had lost their edge and forgot their roots. Heart Of Gold is highly rated by aging critics from the child boom, directed and performed by more aging boom boomers. Neil Young and the crew have long since lost their edge and want the others to join us on a cushioned medium-moderate rocking chair. What happened to the stupid guitar of his earlier solo effort? I think all his fuzz boxes rusted and his excessively driven vacuum tubes exploded in the hot air of his generation. As for Demme, is he a brave director of Something Wild & Melvin and Howard? A film director could make a bolder film than this poorly visualized surface performance film. Don't waste your $ on the Heart of Gold and go straight to The Last Waltz and Gimmie Shelter. And if you really want to dig deep into the rock and roll personality icon, scrounge up a copy of Chuck Berry: Hail Hail Rock and Roll, which is very out of print. And the baby boom, don't bother arguing about how young the younger is getting this review. I am also one of those baby boomers who listened to Cinnamon Girl on acid and danced in the streets on Stones' Street Fighting Man. Go back and look at the Look Back or Gimmie Shelter and then come back and tell me that the Heart of Gold has some value as a document.
