I read the book after I saw the movie and didn't care about it, and I found it somewhat delicate; but kitschy books often make good movies, and that certainly might have. The story of a teenage girl examines her attractive power over the boy, whom she considers irresistibly encouraging because she is dubiously controllable and has an even stronger grip on her than she would be with a normal girl because her werewolf affects her. - This story would have an obvious attraction for the young audience for which the movies are made: the attraction of one kind for girls and another kind for boys: and I don't see how filmmakers could be blind and turned the story into one with little attraction for everyone. Begin with the title (which is the best thing about the book): it is derived from Hesse's quotation, also used as an epigraph, a person who acts in the mouth in fear and tastes blood and chocolate, one tasting the same bad as the second. It's a wonderful metaphor for the heroine's state: torn between her human and wolf side, enjoying everyone but equally afraid of both. The film publishes an epigraph and instead represents a character who works in aunt's shop. I can understand how the title of the book could suggest the filmmakers of the erotic-like "Like Water for Chocolate" and lead them to join the same symbol with werewolves. But they didn't; So why is it in the movie? In the book the characters are in high school - or in and out, as with a five, teen gang who favors black jeans and t-shirts, and falling somewhere between being a heroine's nemeses and her pet peeves. Twenty-member club guests became decadent in the film. In the book, the heroine is 16 years old, only when she discovers how her sexuality affects the boy she wants, as well as on herself; it is the one that initiates the contact, then returns, initiates again, and so on. The girl is no longer a girl, but a woman, and the guy is no longer a high school poet on the edge of school life, but a refugee by law (and a comic book artist to kick off) is he who comes for her in a way as appealing as her cousin. At first he puts it aside, but then gives up because he is sure that: hey, you know you want it. I think the director would have a chance that the book offered the female protagonist an uncomplicated, proactive role; but not. In the book the clan of the hero is expelled from home because of the delinquent behavior of the fives; in the movie it's because she went to run (!). He is a great runner, prone to digging out of building walls, and she and her clanmates are measuring buildings in the trice; as heroes of martial arts movies and unlike wolves, or something similar. They do not become real wolves in the book, but things greater than wolves; in the film, they're just ordinary wolves. In the book they transform into "Howling" style, with crispy spines; This is one of the things that make a heroine aware of the pain her body brings to her, as well as the pleasure. In the film, werewolves became magical acrobats who took big swan dives and turned into air, glittering yellow like Tinker-Bell; it looks fine, it doesn't mean anything. In the book, the clan is a slightly whitish family that has moved from West Virginia to Maryland. In the film they live in Bucharest, but they all speak in different accents, no Romanian. In the book almost the whole package wants to lead a normal life and agrees to ensure that - and indeed their survival - one of the necessities is to keep their true nature secret from humans. And so the characters in the movie still say; but the clan's head is some sort of underground boss - but apparently not the boss of the crimes because he despises the criminals - and has a steady deal with the police that gives him "meat" for the pack. It seems to be a great exception to the rule that people need to be prevented from knowing; but perhaps the police are considered safe because of their known tolerance for eccentricity and cult murder. At the end of the book, the heroine learns that she cannot be something she is not when she tries to live a divided life, gets stuck between human and animal states unable to be one or the other. Her boyfriend is not sure or strong enough to accept her as she is, the package can't risk having it, and both are forced to separate. In the film, he rescues him as Lassie and leaves for Paris (why Paris?), In the end, which is a smile, but is not really happy, because the conflicts between their nature - amongst them - remain unsolved. Br /> <br /> But the difference in the film that prevents the enjoyment of the most is that while the characters of the book behave conventionally, in the field of young adult novels, those who are in the film for some reason have been made as unpleasant as possible. Every other line is a threat or another kind of one work: you will regret it; you do not belong here; you won't get rid of me; I gave you a chance; etc. I prefer to avoid the people who deal with it. There were many good vampire films, never a good werewolf movie. If this was the book, maybe it was the first. But no.
