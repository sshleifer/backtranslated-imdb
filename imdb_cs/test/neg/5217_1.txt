Boring, worthy of a criminal conspiracy, some of the worst directions I have ever encountered, leaky play and terribly clich√©. The film ends with one of the main characters awakening from the dream. What's wrong with that? Even JR from Dallas couldn't survive the lame twist. You have what can only be described as an inappropriate relationship that develops between the main character and the young girl who is supposedly intended to be paternal, but who comes as a perverse one. You have freshmen from college at school who have Kimberly Hole size gaps. It's like kids of corn meet the Passion of Christ imposed on an endless loop of educational government video - at the end of it, if you're not thinking about ending it, you don't have a brain. Don't bother.
