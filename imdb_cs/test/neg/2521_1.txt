It's hard to criticize a movie called 'Deathbed: The Bed That Eats', and includes the spirit of the narrator who is jailed for a 2-way image that he drew, and a bed that snores and? if I'm not mistaken, she masturbates. (Now, it returns to its human companions!) In addition, the foam (in orange, for whatever reason) absorb food lying on its surface, including apples, wine, fried chicken and, of course, people. Again, it's enough to say that don't expect too much when you see what I think is stomach acid ??? the last remnants of everything orange foam takes ?? dissolving only certain things. It will drink wine, but the bottle is fine and it will eat at the chicken bone, but the bucket is fine. Damn, the bed even replaces unused containers. Merry, Pepto-Bismol descends in one place. I had to laugh at it. I don't think they really want to take you seriously. It is a low budget and it is very easy to find out where the costs and money saved are reduced. I thought in a world that could be a 'Lift' and 'Blood Beach' killer, this 'Deadly' could be fun to watch. For reasons that could include costs, 90% of the film is vocal, no one is screaming or showing extremely low signs of fear / confusion, why the bed could attack (I think it would be one - the kids who jumped on the bed) and to suspend your mistrust of faith. (The victim loses all body on his body, he barely says "ow.") Only one scene that went too long was a little tense? the woman tries to crawl out just to be dragged through the sheet. Where are the MST3k guys?
