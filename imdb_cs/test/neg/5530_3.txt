I'm so glad I just got this movie for $ 5. Anime is expensive, no doubt about it. I looked at this for a while and finally saw it on sale. I grabbed him now and took him home just to hang his head in disappointment. This film was sucked. I've heard people talk about how cruel and violent this movie is. It really isn't that cruel or violent. I watched it three times, and I think I was wasting my life on it. Demons are given that they are unique and sometimes cool. Sex gets a point because it's almost non-stop. Horny old man gets half a point for being horny and still has sex drive. And the main character (which is called, which I deleted from my mind) gets half an hour for the great design of his weapon. I saw the main connection between this film and Demon City Shinjuku. Both have the same style of animation, it is obvious because the director, both have lame soundtracks that suck like the Antichrist, and both have terrible ends. Avoid this movie if you're not on anime sex.
