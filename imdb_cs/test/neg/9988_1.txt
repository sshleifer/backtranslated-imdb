I am currently slogging over Gibbon's' fall and fall of the Roman Empire, so I had all things Roman in my mind. I'm not far yet, maybe two hundred plus pages, but it's amazing how many of these Roman emperors were killed. I believe I have read about 15 emperors so far, and only Antonius, Trajan and Hadrian have not been killed or at least suspected of being killed. I was also fascinated by the mad excesses of many of these princes of Rome. The smallest of them was Caligula. This brings me to review this film. I am thinking of a film on a historical basis if I understand it from Gibbon's explanation of Rome, as well as further research on some good websites and some novel novels that dealt with the times. My opinion is that I do not think that this film is what many of its proponents are supposed to be. I do not think that the corruption with sex and the terrible violence of this film considers it accurate. General movie ideas seem to be accurate. Caligula is exalted on the island, expelled with his family, and fears that he will be murdered by an increasingly insane, suspicious and strange Emperor Tiberius. He grows paranoid and afraid and can never shake the cutesy nicknamed by his guards, Little Boots, which helps him grow up in a sense of abuse and helplessness. He is handed over to the Empire after Tiberius dies, the Senate hopes to turn away from informant units that brought the death of the whim of a former vicious paranoid tyrant, and led Rome from the madness the dictator settled him. Caligula begins as a respectable emperor when he finds himself in his hand, but falls ill, almost dies, and returns from the brink of feverish death to a true monster. His perversion with his sisters begins here, if not earlier. He has Macro and many others who were his original supporters. The actions of madness seemed not to be the murders of Caligula, just as his new thinking about himself as a living God. He saw talking to Jupiter's statue as an equal condemned to him. His violent crazy excesses would have condemned him anyway, and three years seemed quite decent to the successor of Tiberius. Basically, the film keeps on these lines, while it is coherent, which is not common because it's all over, it does so when trying to shock viewers on all rounds, in every single scene the film asks you to be disgusted with corruption of Ancient Rome. The shocking scenes are what this film is built on and where it completely fails. It's too much to see how murdered, rape, torture, without any reason, men were murdered and raped by men. The images of violence are perhaps, but probably not, accurate. Certainly murder was a day of day in imperial Rome. But the director's visions of these deaths and the bored amusement of their protagonists, while watching the stray-eyed stare, simply don't see that look like that. The death machine, the executioner, is certainly something you have never seen in movies, and something you have ever seen will probably never be forgotten, even if you wish you could. Drinking wine while the penis is tied is the same once you have seen this shame it is your forever. These things I think of the director's and the pornographer's imagination. They came out of their sick thoughts and not of any proven record. Acting is pretty good. Actually, I think McDowell is the weakest link. Mirren is always something he looks at, and here in his teen years he is impressive and beautiful. The images of Nerva and Tiberius are highly respected by their respected actors. The film could do much better story telling, it's such a failure that it's just another layer of what a shame. For example, he could express his opinion on how and why Caligula went crazy, or showed that he was angry, paranoid before his illness, and that the fever then violated the mental constraints he had previously owned. It could have shown Claudio's weakness and the miracle he had survived Caligula. It could have these and many other things, but sad nightmares stuck to it. Finally about sex. It's porn. It shows these sexual acts are done throughout the palace by many people. Man on woman, woman on man, man on woman. It's passionate, disgusting sex. Sex that if you want to get it, I seriously doubt you could. Both Tiberius and Caligula could have been dependent on sex, and orgies may have been fairly common, but the visions in this film seem to resemble more Greek time than Roman. I do not think that this kind of acceptance of homosexuality or orgy right in the open was common up to that strange, corrupt government of Elgabalus, and was killed for it. This movie should never be watched, if you are curious, let it go. It's something like I said before, if you follow this, you'll unfortunately keep your sick visions in your eyes for years. I do not think it is an accurate historical picture, even if it is a historical whole.
