I expected this movie to be absolutely awful. Like "What Dreams May Come" or "The Truman Show" or something. Well, they sold it for Â£ 3.99 in my local HMV and Giovanni Ribisi was on the cover, you know you can't help but I love him, so my friends dared to buy me. and I was sure it would be waste. maybe that's the only reason I could sit in this movie because my standards were never that high.
