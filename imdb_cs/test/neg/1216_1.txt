I like to think of myself as a bad movie expert. I like to think movies that most people have described as the worst of all that I can easily endure. But ... there are exceptions. I can only remember the three movies I had with the disaster that I repeatedly used the quick story button. These movies are The Mighty Gorga, The Night of the Seagulls, and the little bullshit, Deep Blood. <br /> <br /> It falls off the scale in the jaws world. Deep Blood has no realistic story of the original crocodile, nor the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent, nor Tintorer's commentary. No, instead, we are being treated by several juvenile juveniles from any randomly malfunctioning sitcom who is in public access to the 80s who are battling violent and local sheriffs. Shark attacks are made by a quick cut of documentary shots with actors who argue in the water, sometimes with a bit of what seems to be orange-ish color thrown into the water. There is not even a minute of the original shark tracks in this cellulite waste dump. Under normal circumstances, I, or someone like me, has read an unfortunate review like this, and I say "cool, I have to find a copy of it!" I've read another viewer review on this site. How bad I was. <br /> <br /> So ... from one bad movie fan to another ... let it collect dust on the shelf ... grab the depth or a great alligator instead of satisfying your need for something that lurks evil in the water.
