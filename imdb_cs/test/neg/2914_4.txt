I would have little to add to the bowlofsoul23 bull's-eye comment here. But as the first Brazilian (born, raised and living in Rio de Janeiro, in the neighborhood just a few miles from favela Vigário Geral, pictured in the film) to comment on US "Favela Rising" funded from the US here on IMDb, I have mixed feelings: on the one hand, it is good that the desperate situation of Brazilian favelas gets more attention from filmmakers and the media, both from Brazil and from abroad, because local governments seem to have long since abandoned. On the other hand, it is incredibly frustrating that "Favela Rising" will prove to be such a missed opportunity to enlighten non-Brazilian viewers on this issue, as the first directors, Jeff Zimbalist and Matt Mochary (who are from the US and, of course, newer on the subject) turn biography of the leading group AfroReggae Anderson Sá on charming canonization in this superficial, one-sided, insufficiently explored and misleading document. Good intentions, confused results. "Favela Rising" looks like a TV commercial, is shallow as a TV interview in main time and taken as a promotional video. "Favela Rising" is unpleasantly fake for a Brazilian viewer and not just because of his hype visual treatment of a dreary reality, and his bad feeling-good happy-ending. "City of God" is an obvious reference here, with COG actors Leandro Firmino and Jonathan Haagensen came for no apparent reason other than "hype". "Favela Rising" is allegedly a documentary about AfroReggae and its leader Anderson Sá, but beware: when you see scenes shot in favelas overlooking the beautiful Rio line, you can also be warned that Vigário Geral (home of AfroReggae and Anderson) is located in the Rio area far from any beach. Strange choice of location, at least. "Favela Rising" is probably confusing for non-Brazilians who will not know many of the interviewees (and the film won't tell them) and will have to wait for final credits to find that many songs on the soundtrack IT'S NOT AfroReggae Band (Even if you suspect when you start to hear Pink Martini, of all people!). Nor will they know that important questions were simply left unnoticed: why does the film push the idea that AfroReggae is a one-man project? Why not recognize the many partners that supply it with significant financial and logistical support, such as the Rio City Council, private Brazilian corporations, multinational record companies, and international non-governmental organizations, without which AfroReggae might not even exist? Why not make it clear that Vigário Geral is still plagued by violent drug wars and that his people still live in constant fear of trafficking in human beings and cops? Why not make it clear that many of the archive footage records that show police violence and corruption have not taken place in Vigário Geral? HOW AND WHY does kid boy Richard Murilo finally join AfroReggae? Why wasn't he interviewed again at the end of the movie? As for Anderson, the film leaves the viewer many free ends: what is the story of Anderson. two "mothers"? Is the child holding his son in his arms? Why is she inspired by Shiva? Is it a Buddhist? Why does Candomblé appear on the beach when Anderson's "miraculous" cure from an accident is mentioned in the movies? Is he a follower of Candomblé? Why not let him explain the contradiction in setting up a drug-fighting group while praising Bob Marley? If AfroReggae is also a pride-building movement for favelas' blacks, why are AfroReggae girls restricted to bouncing prey routines? No, you won't get any answers to these questions. Instead, filmmakers are interested in making Anderson Sá a composite of pop-star, Malcolm X, Gandhi and Christ (check out). the last picture of Christ the Redeemer on Corcovado Hill, immediately after Anderson "miraculously" went through his operation. And that's the worst thing that filmmakers could do for Anderson and his thing: turn it into a special CHOSEN (while they show their scar surgery, you're ready to believe it's a God mark). Given that what is remarkable about Anderson - who is the most common person you could ever meet - is that he has helped to change his environment NO by being "special", but copied and edited winning projects (like Olodum). movement in Bahia, among others) to its own community, with strong support from friends, artists, intellectuals, politicians, entrepreneurs and the media. If you don't speak fluent Portuguese, you probably won't notice that Anderson is not particularly clear or articulated (unlike his sharply humorous partner José Junior), just as he is not particularly gifted as a singer, lyricist or musician. But his "ordinary" might have been a real "inspiring" core of the film: to show that EVERYTHING with idealism, perseverance, and stable support can actually make a significant contribution to his community, there is no need to be an incarnation of Jesus. Because it really matters, there is movement - AfroReggae - not the guy, you see? Didn't we have enough cult of personality? <br /> <br /> At the end of "Favela Rising", you probably won't know much more about Rio favelas than you did when you walked in - you'll just see what some of them look like.
