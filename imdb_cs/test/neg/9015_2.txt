Another winner of the 1950s, the 60s, I love so much because of the comedic value they give with every tracking these days. Corman will never let you go with these movies, take them seriously and have very low budgets, a recipe for good tracking. Ed Nelson very competent actor started with Corman, as well as many other favorites who appear in Superman and many of the westerns of the day. The costume is bad enough and the sound of an extraterrestrial speaker, but reverence was a bit gone, but that's beauty. The film does for love it, not seeking perfection just kicking the action to do it, it comes over. These movies are fun! Even better is the MST3K !!
