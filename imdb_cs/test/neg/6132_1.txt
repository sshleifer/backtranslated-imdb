Here's a fantastic concept for the movie - a series of meteors hit a small town and the resulting alien infection is captured on one local camera as the city takes over. Leave it to Albert Pyun! Don't get to the 100 feet of this movie! Holy crap, what a bomb ... it could still be Pyun's worst! The crazy thing is that here is the germ of the creative idea - the whole outbreak told from the POV dashcam. When I heard that I was back for a while, I imagined the car breaking into things, people running and the infected people breaking the windshield and the car in chaos. Would that be okay? Instead, we have a leader who moves all the time in circles in a wooded area, sometimes running into three infected species who just stand there. The last bit is literally a 15-minute shot where nothing happens in front of the camera, only the sounds are heard off the screen. Don't come close !!! On a somewhat reluctant note, I think I officially called the end of my Pyun, who was watching ... just took me 20 miserable movies to realize I had better things to do.
