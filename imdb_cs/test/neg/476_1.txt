Guys, what can I tell you? I'm Bulgarian. I can't remember how many times I talk to the Americans and let alone that they have no idea where Bulgaria is, but they say things like, "Is there a war, isn't it?" or "I never imagined that they had the Internet on the site like people from Bulgaria" Go watch Bruce Campbell is "A Man with a Screaming Brain". I was curious about this movie, Way 1) I'm a fan of Bruce Campbell - "Evil Dead" trilogy and "The Adventures of Brisco County Jr." 2) The film was shot entirely in Bulgaria, the second after "Alien Apocalypse", which is also almost unnoticeable. 3) I enjoy nice B-movies <br /> <br /> Well ... The film presents our country as never-ending Gypsy Town, where it attacks your car, ripples around illegal weapons and you can kill every now and then. And Bruce's line "Bull $ h1t Bulgaria" is more than offensive. Ted Raimi and Stacy Ceach make a great team, Bruce makes his special - hitting up and that's it. Nothing more to see here. Peoeple gives this film 10 just because of Bruce's cult status, but doesn't deserve more than 3. Film Waste.
