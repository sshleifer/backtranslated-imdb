So this ugly guy with long, ugly hair and his girlfriend will end up in this house and argue and argue about their old girlfriend. It was supposed to be something terrifying, but I didn't see anything scary at all. There is some mention of the demon from the sea, but it is not going anywhere. I wish he did, because then it would take the tension from the jealous love triangle. The film's title seems to be a scary and exciting movie, but it's so far away that I couldn't believe it. I waited and waited for it to end and was so happy when he did. It wasn't to live up to the title as it should have so boo hoo hoo. The envelope had a great picture, but I shouldn't judge the kitschy film by its cover.
