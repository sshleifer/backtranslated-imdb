This whole show is, it's the same chart. Kuszko (spelling?) He is in danger of an unsuccessful school, he must go through to become emperor. She needs to learn something she thinks is stupid, then she uses it / learns more about it and realizes it's not that stupid. Eezma, acting as the lead, tries to turn Kuszko into an animal to stop him. Every episode. Movie jokes are copied (Eezma's incredibly complicated plans, Kuszko constantly smashes the 4th wall, squirrels.) They should try to hire some writers. <br /> <br /> 2/10
