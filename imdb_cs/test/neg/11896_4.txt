In this sequel to The Naked Civil Servant we see Quentin Crisp's last years in New York. John Hurt is again Crisp (to figure out who else could play the part?) And his role he occupies to the point of disappearance. Crisp is hurt for me, and I've always considered it very hard because he was hurt more than himself. His masterful performance. His equality is Denis O'Hare as Phillip Steele, Crisp's longtime friend and confidant. Unfortunately, it has little to do with the film. To be sure, the movie gets the details right. The film shot in and around New York looks and feels like New York and its surroundings, but dramatically its kind inert. His sharp conversations with people are funny, trying to cope with the world as he is (he eventually regretted some badly selected words about AIDS) and dealing with the weaknesses the old age put on him. Quentin is always interesting, but his life is not really. I'm disappointed with the movie. I have always admired a man and his unique look. I wish that this film better served his life.
