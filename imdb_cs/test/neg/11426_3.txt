Because I would never see this movie to the end. Although there are some, but not many, funny moments in this movie I could not understand more than about 15% (fantasy English couple in the third story included) about what people said. Three short stories, none with a real point, just some of the most horrible and lifeless I could imagine, and a lot of bad language. It didn't seem fun to me, it wasn't considered fun, there was no point in it. 4/10
