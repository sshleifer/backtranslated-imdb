Looking back at 2006, one of the things I remember is "Snakeamania" on the Internet for a movie called Snakes on an Airplane. After seeing it, I feel it's the best B-movie under the steam. Husband and wife get on the train to go to Los Angles, get help from their uncle's husband who is a shaman. That's because the wife's family doesn't approve her marring him, so they put a curse on her that snakes did "stand her". He thought about sixteen hours drive to Los Angles and a group of passengers include an ex-Narc cop and some drug dealers. will they take over? View of the film: First effects: I have to say that while some scenes with smaller snakes look good, they are the main effects you have to see eighty minutes! Sadly, bad to completely kill all the good memories of the movie (The movie's 198os video game look like T2 next to this !.) One of the things I noticed is that there is no credit for a movie! and directors make the film so anti-climatic that it destroys the film. The Ultimate Movie View: <br /> <br /> The B-Movie sub-par, with an incredibly bad ending.
