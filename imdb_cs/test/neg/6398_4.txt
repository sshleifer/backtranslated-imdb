"Blame it on Rio" is a romantic 80's comedy, with more than an eye full of sex all the time its 101 minutes of running. The story relates to two middle-aged men in crisis, one of whom classifies by divorce, while others deal with the possibility of the same prospect. Both good friends, they decide to take a vacation in exotic Rio de Janeiro, each with a daughter on their side. Complications occur when one of them engages with another's daughter. This potential story clutter is quite funny and there are some good lines, but it never happens as it might have. Any attempt to solve a moral problem does not work, and maybe Donen should get stuck in the humor of the situation. It's not a bad movie, but what really goes wrong is horrible Michelle Johnson's performance as a naughty little tempter, Jennifer. While she uses her body to take full advantage, it's the only thing she has. Michelle's brave bravery leaves much to be desired. No wonder we didn't see her in anything else.
