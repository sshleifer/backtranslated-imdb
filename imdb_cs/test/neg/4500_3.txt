Gamera vs Viras was made lazily and much of it suffers as a result. So they send another ship that can kidnap two young boys. The aliens then took control of the Gamer and forced him to attack humanity. First I have to say that I really enjoyed a monster fight at the end between Gamer and Viras. Viras looks like a big octopus with a beak. It has no energy and does not shoot any rays, but it can close the pins on the head to create a sharp pointed weopon. So overall, it's not a bad monster for Gamer to fight and is decent. Viras really injured Gamer badly by stabbing his underside of his shell with his pointed head and I was surprised by Gamera was able to survive this. Unfortunately Gamera vs Viras decided to use footage from previous Gamera movies to fill the time for this movie. They show battles between Gamera and Barugon and Gamera and Gaos when aliens look at Gameras past battles. However, when they show the Gamera battle with Gaos they show the battle between Gamera and Gaos in the city first, then they show the last battle between the two. After showing re used footage of the last battle between Gamera and Gaos, they point to the first battle between Gamera and Gaos !!! Talk about how to show battles in chronological order. They didn't even have to show the first battle they were about to stop after they showed the last battle between the two. Another problem is that they decide to re-view the Gamer shots attacking the city when the aliens instruct him to attack Tokyo. So they show the scene from "Gamera vs Barugon" where he destroys the dam. After the show scene from "Gamera Invincible", which is a huge problem for me. Especially because "Gamera Invincible" was in BLACK AND WHITE !!!! The use of footage from the black and white film in COLOR is really lazy and that's not a good thing. Also dubbing is bad again. Two small children are not so annoying, but it would be nice to see the movie Gamer, which does not include small children. So despite the use of footage from other Gamera films, this film is discouraging. The last game is amazing, so basically I recommend skipping to the last ten minutes and watching this movie. The rest is something that has already been seen.
