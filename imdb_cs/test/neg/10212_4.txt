Being a fan of the match, films about the match generally suck (Backyard Dogs, Bodyslam, Jesse Ventura's story) but this is not the worst I've ever seen. Yes, it's bad, but better than some of the others I mentioned. Hulk Hogan basically plays himself, and for some reason the rival network wants to beat him because he doesn't want to be on the net. Let me explain this so that everyone can understand .... picture of US network with Rip ... and TNT will go to any length to make it. <br /> <br /> Does it make sense ... no? I don't feel bad because it doesn't make sense. Nor does it make sense to have a legit ex con to have a REAL fight with Rip at the end of the movie. None of this movie makes much sense, but compared to other movies and later Hogan's movies isn't that bad. <br /> <br /> 4 of 10
