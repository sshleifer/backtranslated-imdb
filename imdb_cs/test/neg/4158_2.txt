There is nothing worse than sci-fi created by people who do not feel it. Taking a concept that wouldn't be so terrible in itself (the future where cloning is common enough to make it a crime for you to be genetically genetically too close to you), the writer has decided to allowed his sick. appropriate imagination to run wild. When Tim Robbins' character was able to guess the security guard's computer password simply by telling him to give him one thing about himself, I knew I was in for trouble. This ability was later revealed to be due to Robbins having taken an "empathic virus", viruses being used to grant immediate (or almost instantaneous) skill updates to their users. Robbins' love interest complained about his own experience with such a virus - the Chinese language Mandarin virus that allowed her to speak Chinese, but as she complained, "she couldn't understand what she said." Well, first, empathy, no matter how intense, isn't ESP. Without incorporating some aspect of true mind reading (such as an empathic virus that actively releases virions into the neighborhood, infecting close people, selecting bits of its memory, then leaving for the original host - which you may say), you cannot justify that you are able to identify a specific detail like someone's password just by "listening to things you didn't say". You can't even get the ability to speak a language without understanding what you're saying - a virus can't infect your vocal cords and translate for you because the virus can't think. To give you the power to speak Chinese, such a virus would have to change your brain. That would have to encode knowledge between the neurons, and once it is there, it's * your * - you understand what you're saying because you have to. To do your own brain, you must understand this task (for the most part). If, of course, the movie does not suggest that the virus was intentionally designed to introduce some bizarre mental scheme with more personalities, where some of your personalities act as a built-in, one-way compiler. The degree of language that the characters express is fair enough, though nowhere in a remarkable remarkable spot does it justify all the lovers of love they have given. What's more, all the multicultural inserts in the world can't replace the simple, frustrating fact: Dialogue stinks! It's slow, it's fleeting and it's unnatural. Again, I am sure the partisans have convinced themselves that the boring weirdness is simply the result of an inspired genius that creates a truly futuristic (and therefore language drift) form of speech. I disagree. Good dialogue is a good dialogue in any era - and the same is true for tripe. Finally, I will return to the central concept of film - the ban on sex with myself. Wide cloning is a nice, classic sci-fi theme. Likewise, global warming leads to environmental devastation (which includes Code 46). Unfortunately, the two don't go together! If you have an environmental catastrophe that is heavily confined to the available living space, you are not running around cloning people! You have problems with the population enough as it is - you don't add them to the re-questions. Regular, old-fashioned sex-and-birth provides all the inhabitants you need, and cloning of any kind would be ruthlessly suppressed. <br /> <br /> To be fair, the film wasn't completely wrong. She had nice cinematography. Maybe if I watched it be muted, I could have enjoyed it.
