The best scene "People across the lake" is a really scary, night-time opening scene with house, murder and lake. After that, it's pretty much downhill from here in terms of horror. The family (mum, dad, sister and younger brother) is full of (slightly) dangerous suburbs and decides to go and live near the titular lake. Since then, the film features too lame a happy family-related doo-doo near the lake, with occasionally some corpses emerging here and there. Several scenes where they discover bodies are quite convincing (in terms of haunting), but they are in sharp contrast to the rest of life (representing only the family's everyday life in which the family is settled). The truth about things (the secret about who does the killing) is too early to know, so only the family does not know and the viewer yawns during a non-threatening final (representing a basement discovery and running around the house) as if it was done It's supposed to be a horror movie. It's not really bad; content and story is not interesting enough. The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin, although his performance / character is just a little goofy to be taken seriously. Blond cutie Tammy Lauren (daughter) could be a recognizable face even for passionate horror addicts because she also starred in "Wishmaster" (1997) and based on TV shows like "I Saw What You Did" (1988) & "The Stepford Children" (1987). But there is not much to do in this movie. Skippable, but attentive, if anything.
