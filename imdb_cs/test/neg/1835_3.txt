This film had such a good prerequisite to begin. Tension, slashers, secret society, and you really couldn't figure out who those cowards were up to the last quarter of the movie. But it contained so many stupid clichés from the worst of old American slasher / horror movies. Now I like slasher / horror, but there are all the old clichés that have long disappeared from the American film. For example, old "I hear the sounds in the basement and I'm home alone and the basement light doesn't work, so I'll go down to explore" clichés. Three examples of these clichés really annoyed me at any end: <br /> <br /> 1) When Potente discovers a medical school can be a secret society that carries out living bodies, it continues to ask questions and say ALL - very publicly. Basically he says, "I found you. Come kill me because I tell everyone your secret." And then he wonders why he finds out that the blood has spread all over the bed and brought her finger to the roommate in the towel. 2) Even one man she met two weeks ago ends up at an autopsy table and Finds out about this secret society as she feeds on living people goes to a lab where all the dead bodies are stored 2 -3 times more times to investigate. 3) Her roommate is killed. She is being persecuted by a murderer she knows, does not report to a university or police, then leaves school to go home to visit her parents. Then he returns to school, apparently thinking that this guy who tried to kill her would leave the past and not try to kill her, even if he knew his secret. She was obviously bad. For someone who was supposed to be so smart (she studied as a doctor at the best school in Germany), she acted like a cliché in horror movie. These things made the potentially good movie very frustrating and made me end up even earlier. In the middle of the movie, I stopped looking and wished she would end up on the autopsy table.
