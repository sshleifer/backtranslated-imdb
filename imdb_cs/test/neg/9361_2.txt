The woman finds herself in an apparently unexplained rash of suicide. Then are these really suicides? It looks like there was a ghost. Guess what? The ghost has long black hair hiding his face, and moves around with his head or hands twisted in this way, or being a very strange looking ghost. Repeating thematic music plays from unexpected places to announce the advent of the spirit, and bizarre sound effects - which resemble the sound of small twigs that break - always accompany this unhappy spirit. Does any of that familiar sound? If you've seen several Asian horrors in the last 10 years, it should be. This film, which borrowed heavily and carelessly from "The Ring", "One Last Call" and several other recent horror hits, is trying to culminate in an uninteresting and worn-out plot, but we've seen it before. Avoid if you are desperate or have seen no other Asian horror movies in the last 10 years.
