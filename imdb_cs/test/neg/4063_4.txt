I'd give this movie a stellar voice if it wasn't for the laughter I got from it. Some of the dialogues were just so lame they laughed at you! How could anyone talk like that. Not to mention that the bodyguard Majors (Antonio Sabato Jr.) flew 747 years as a pro and Michael Whare's team, who were able to thrust into a gas-filled gasoline and blow up a huge boulder. Did anyone notice lame tribute to "Fantasy Island" with a guy saying "Boss, plane!" Michael Pare, like the 747, comes in sight. The only saving mercy was cute girls and even more frightening kidnappers. Not to mention that the main kidnapper deserves to die on the lame death he made for being such a joker !! Imagine you were running so that you were bound just to shoot "crossbow". Hello. Bad pilot probably died on the plane while everyone ate steak and had rum! Just for laughter they should do the sequel to show us how everyone spends the night in the middle of Hurricane Category 3 on Neptune Atoll. I hear Michael Pare calls it "the best honeymoon resort in the Pacific". Now that would make an interesting movie !!
