I never intended to write a review of this movie. Actually, I was just in sight and looking for the name of the movie star, and then I started reading reviews ... I guess I'll never know. This movie is terrible! I will not justify my comments with specific reasons, because it is really hard for me to believe that someone with any taste really enjoys it. Guilt delight? Well, I think. But the film so bad that useless talent so good (Caine, Gelbart, and Donen) is the reason for the sadness is not a pleasant distraction. A low point for everyone involved except perhaps Bologna, who must sit the night trying to figure out which bomb was a bomb that destroyed his career.
