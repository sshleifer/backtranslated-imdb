Although I tried to avoid German films recently, positive reviews lured me to rent this movie. There I am again confused by the German media, which repeat the domestic flicks over and over again. It's no wonder for me that no one abroad wants to see that stupid thing. The idea of ​​not having this movie at all (I think a fool read an article on a women's dating magazine). In short: Characters (which are not), dialogue and content are so trivial, trivial and cliché-ridden, I continued to watch because I couldn't believe what I saw. BTW, to call the flat theses that were delivered by numbers (certainly from the above-mentioned magazines), would just be wrong. Acting is up, I can't remember worse than on screen at long time. You have to guess that the director had no idea at all. Surprisingly, distributors and manufacturers around the country are still interested in why German films (with rare exceptions) do not provoke interest worldwide. Why? Because it's a waste of time and money.
