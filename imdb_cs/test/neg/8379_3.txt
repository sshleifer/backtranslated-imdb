The two most notable things about "I'll Play" are: It won the Academy Award as Best Two-Reel Short Film 1944; and it was driven by the silent era leading man Crane Wilbur. The story of this run-of-the-mill short is insignificant, the dialogue lacks sparkle, while acting is no better and nothing worse than that found in most of the 1940s themed Hollywood war films (in other words, it's horrible). True, there are times when "I Won't Play" is funny - Janis Paige is a totally artificial look and the line of delivery is rare - but one laughs in the picture, not with him.
