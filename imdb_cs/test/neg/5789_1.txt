Oh, man, I hated the movie. It is true that the placement of the site was great, but that's probably just the positive thing I can say about it. Now I will say right from the start that I am very critical of the way weapons, especially firearms, are displayed and processed in movies. Being a war movie, the display was fine, but the awkward handling of weapons in the film would never be tolerated by the real SEAL team. Acting was more wooden than my first sailboat, the equipment carried (or lack) was ridiculous and the dialogue was, say, missing in any interesting way. Well, with the exception of a journalist who was actually prescient. Watching this movie was comparable to watching "Palmetto" with Woody Harrelson, where each scene was so bad you couldn't turn it off because you had to see if they could get worse with the next scene. Like Palmetto, yes. The scene in the water, where, after filming the first enemy, BLOW DAMN BOAT UP, and so faced with possible drowning, made me laugh so hard that in a millisecond I almost thought it was worth waiting through the movie for. Then Charlie Sheen decided to drag the surviving enemy into the depths of the ocean (as it was filmed, with many camera cutouts, seeming to have descended about 80 feet). the throat was so damn stupid, I was stunned. Then again, the whole damn movie. I like action movies, but not this. NOTE: The version I watched was a TV version, a pan & scan. I can't imagine that it would change, except that the whole thing was shorter!
