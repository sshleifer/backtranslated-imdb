The whole movie wasn't at all good, the whole movie was just Grudge around and killing random people out of nowhere. Random people who have nothing to do with the story are killed, such as 3 schools. The family at the beginning has nothing to do with the story. a family who never went to the house and never had anything to do with the Grudge murders. I didn't forget about me at all, I wasn't afraid, I didn't jump on any part, and the whole movie was just a random piece of crap to get more money. Makes Gridge 1 look crap as well, which was actually fine movie. I believe The Grudge 2 is the main movie of The Grudge 3 if they ever do it. They shouldn't even call it Grudge 2, they should call it Grudge 2 prologue, and see if you've watched it because I won't spoil anything. Not that it matters anyway. 1/10, it's not a frightening, bad story and it's just random.
