The story is derived from "King Lear"; setting is a farm in Iowa. Here's a test of this kind of thing: if you find yourself asking, "Why are they doing so" and the answer is, "because it happened in" King Lear "," you know the movie has failed. That's what's going on here. The father's character in this story does not live his own life, imitates the fictional. But the film is more than this bad. Jocelyn Moorhouse is ambitious - much more ambitious than I think he realizes. He tries to take the story of King Lear and completely change the setting. This is a task in itself. The most likely result is that the transplant story dies, and no one will be able to find out exactly why (although there are enough successful transplants, such as "West Side Story" to be worth it). But she is also trying to revisionist. In "King Lear" he wants to create, Reagan and Goneril command our sympathy and Cordelia is a villain. This is also a task in itself. Success on both tasks is difficult; successful with both at once is impossible. In fact, succeeding at one moment as much as an attempt at another is impossible. If we are to look at the same events from a different moral point of view, then events must be the same events - which means that the settings cannot be manipulated. If the story is to be transplanted, alive, in a different environment, its moral heart must continue to beat all the time - which means that the ethical perspective cannot be manipulated. Moorhouse was only forced to fail in one, but in both of her efforts. And so she did. ... Of course it is possible to try both tasks, fail both tasks, but some fluke hit on a work of art that is good for independent reasons. I mentioned it because I didn't read Jane Smiley's novel, which is good for independent reasons. But the movie isn't. If there was nothing wrong with it, it would still not be around the fact that it was so thorough, unbearable DULL. Corn fields themselves are even more boring than it would be in real life - which may not be the case because I can think of four films from the top of my head ("The Wizard of Oz", "North of the Northwest") "," The Straight Story "," Kikujiro "), in which the cornfield is not boring at all.
