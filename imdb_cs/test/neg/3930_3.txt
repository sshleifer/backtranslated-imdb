An inexpensive and indifferent movie with indifferent characterization, lots of indecent style emotions (I think Chow Yun Fat in better tomorrow) and some kitschy clich√©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a couple of poorly executed sudo roles on John Woo. Even squibs look terrible. At no point in the driving does it look far away as America. Three unpredictable old cars do not make the earth. The Mustang even has a wobbly right front wheel. The plot, as it is, is so derived and predictable that the end is like killing mercy. It couldn't come soon. Even robbery jewelry looks like the cheapest jewelery available. Terrible dialogues and hopeless overclocking anyone who cares for real waste of space and time. It's worth watching if you want to know how to make a cliche-ridden low budget movie.
