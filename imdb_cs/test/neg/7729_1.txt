It's almost embarrassing to say I've even seen this movie. I think it's not much to make a good zombie movie next to good special effects, lots of blood and gore, some scary moments and a decent plot. Is House of Dead 2 right about any of these things? No, not one. Of course, it's not as bad as his predecessor, Uwe Bowle, and that's the only thing about this movie that scares me. The dialogue in this film is notorious, with lines like "What do you do for a living?" in response "I'm killing zombies" and "I've never been a jockey, I was a soldier." Special effects are embarrassing for a TV movie, I mean seriously, zombies all seem to have bloody lips that are cracking. The military base in this movie is a parking garage with a desk and an open gate. This movie is so low in budget that they couldn't even get a co-ed locker room. In fact, the whole movie seems to have been shot in high school. Also why is it that all the female soldiers in this movie are models? And that's why everyone in this movie is so clueless what's going on, they just stand around and let them kill them. Heck one guy even tries to give food to zombies. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie makes even the worst movies Scifi Channel looks fantastic.
