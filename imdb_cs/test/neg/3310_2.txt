Great music, but aren't PATHETIC people?!? The actual track The Trippy Sixties, and that left me depressed. The director painted the wrong side of jetset's life and stabs like a hornet's nest. If the culture of time has led people to do these things, it seems to me that it was the whole journey without discovery, just despair. I tried, really tried this movie, but these people are nowhere on my page. Yes, it would be nice to see the world, leave for a while, but I always plan to go back. Drugs are not the cause of the fall of these characters, are they their miserable attitude? These guys passionately drink their poison cup. They make their lives cheaper and ultimately make their lives cheaper. Does romance ever have darkness? Cheers: Interesting scenery. Great soundtrack Pink Floyd. <br /> <br /> Warning: Dated. Drugs. Depressive. Thoroughly unlikable characters; They are not children of flowers. <br /> <br /> Curious only because most of the packages wash Pink Floyd. (Rare Floyd has never heard many songs before, because FM is not what it was.) <br /> <br /> Rating: Two stars.
