This catastrophic film is a remake of a 1973 movie of the same title, based on the novel Sakyo Komatsu. Japan is located next to Pacific Fire (an active volcano) as well as along the edges of the plate tectonics, which will cause an earthquake and tsunami to sort (Japanese term itself for tidal wave). This naturally creates a natural premise for a disaster image that has a daytime day with Hollywood movies like Armageddon, Deep Impact, and recently, The Day After Tomorrow, which explores how global warming becomes a catalyst for the natural disasters that have disappeared around. world. But I have to say this: Sinking of Japan does all the mentioned films, they look like classics. This catastrophic film is a disaster and a huge one. Having to look at my watch every 10-15 minutes is a signal that the movie is not involved and feels like it was over-the-clock its runtime. <br /> <br /> Special effects are wonderful to look at. From images from the satellite space universe, to the lively recreation of every imaginable natural disaster that can hit the land of the rising sun, the effects are the star of the show. However, with the spectacular computer generated graphics it is not in itself to make the film tasty, as too much good stuff just plain boredom. <br /> <br /> If you've seen a trailer where you are attracted by the effects and specific scenes of chaos and chaos, then yes, in fact, these are the scenes. There are no details and everything is visible from a distance, in a mode similar to God. Things happen just like the screen, with a nary attempt to try to delve deeper into the close up questions. It is similar to Godzilla, who knocks over buildings, and it is as if there were no people or loss of life through this single act. Morbid, as it may sound, show us sacrifices! A popular nation like Japan does not suffer from a disaster only after a disaster with an extremely low number of fatalities, not when filmmakers break out on such an epic scale. Trying to film romance in the movie, sticking out like a painful thumb. There are many characters in the film, but each one lacks real qualities, or humanity, and looks like wandering zombies, without expression, without emotion and certainly very stiff and unconvincing. Heroes get stuck in generic statement, instruction and form control rooms and respond to incidents as if it were a computer game, all solved by pressing a button. These are characters that don't give you a hoof. If I can only use The Day After Tomorrow as a comparison, while there are amazing effects, there is at least an attempt to provide a microscopic view of the entire disaster from the perspective of the individual. Inside, there are lots of action sequences, large, such as disasters alone, and small, focusing on the triumph of the human spirit, which makes it quite convincing. Unfortunately for the sinking of Japan, this film should preferably be one to sink and tank, and hopefully undergo a short and quick death at the local box office to make way for better things.
