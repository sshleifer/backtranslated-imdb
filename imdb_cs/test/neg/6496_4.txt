Most critics ravaged Michalk's film, but I wanted him to see himself. And unfortunately they are right. The film had the largest budget in the history of Russian films, two international stars, colorful mass scenes, apparently shot quite close to the Kremlin - but in the end it seems to be nice, sweet nothing. You wouldn't believe this director had done masterpieces like Urga and Burnt By the Sun before. The characters in the story are not convincing, not even Jane, neither McCracken nor Andrei. It is worth mentioning only General Radlov. He stays on the surface all the time. Politically, it is for me the praise of the army, especially Russian with values ​​such as honor and duty. And when he lived for at least half a year in Siberia: My Russia is much more than the one shown in Michal's film. As far as "Burnt By The Sun" by the same director as a non-question-10-point movie, one of the best I've ever seen in my whole life, I was completely disappointed. Excuse me. Nevertheless, Michalkov's unique talent is still there in delivering stunningly beautiful photographs.
