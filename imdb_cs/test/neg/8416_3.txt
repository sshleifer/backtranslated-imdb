This is a stupid spoof of private eye thrillers as a novelist (Michael Cain) is called to 'ghostwrite' autobiography of a colorful, waning Hollywood star (Mickey Rooney). Sometimes, stupidity becomes unpleasant. This is not Cain. Rooney's over the top. Notable support from Lizabeth Scott, Lionel Stander and Nadia Cassini comedy. It's not easy to watch.
