I was wondering when someone would try to turn the entire Matamoros into a goreporter. Here are some things I've learned about Mexico from watching this movie. <br /> <br /> ~ All Mexican Women are Super Hot - Remember this Small Desert Town in Unearthed? Yeah, it must be a Mexican sister city. Don't even bother with the hookers, just a few smooth movements on the hot bartender. He'll be as hot as a prostitute and probably won't have any kids! Half of Mexico is dominated by the mad cult Palo Mayombe who worship Satan. Â¡Ay, caramba! The other half, as everyone in the US knows, is controlled by drug dealers. Fortunately, it doesn't interfere much with sex-touris and our extremely low pay factories down there. Mexican cops are useless. Don't go to them. Go to the nearest occult bookstore and ask the hot chick behind the counter what happened to your missing friend. It will be much more help than the cops. When you are trapped tortured by the aforementioned bloodthirsty cults, don't go into reciting psalms or any part of the Bible, really. You just mess up mojo.
