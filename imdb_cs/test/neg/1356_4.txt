Crazy really. Although you have not seen George Cukor's original film with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and the actor of thousands of other stars, you can reject this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What did she do to herself? Her face barely moves. That in itself reflects Norm Shearer's miles. Annette Bening should sue DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? The actresses without a connection in the public subconscious try to pass on to their friends, totally unconvincing. Eva Mendes in Joan Crawford is an outrageous piece of misconception. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a trans-gender performer with no taste or subtlety. Bizarre think that a woman has adapted and directed these women. The only positive things I can mention are a short but very funny performance by Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as a housekeeper.
