Sci-Fi Channel movies have become boringly predictable. Seemingly low budget, originality and conspiracy. In this creation, the government is out to get a lot of telekinetics and recruit the poor soul with malicious means of help. There are plenty more than worked recycled twists on the topic of bad government organizations. black coats, shadows, short nonsensical lines make these one-dimensional cartoons. Daniel Dae Kim performs as a good actor in a small role. He brings a bit of style to his "angel" character. It is difficult to omit the reference that his character "Crusade" was a telepath and that is a film about telekinetics. Was it a Sci-Fi casting move to try out fans from another show? Who knows. Fortunately, a decent actor and joy to watch. The movie is definitely a low budget. It reflects Sci-Fi channels the current model of Canadian location, a few familiar characters, a few effects, and a pitifully horrifying plot and character development. You'd think he believes sci-fi fans will see something called "scifi". If you want a good telekinesis movie, check out "The Fury" (1978).
