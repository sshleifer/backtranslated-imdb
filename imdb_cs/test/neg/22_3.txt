When you make a film with the presumption of a murderer-children, there are two effective ways to reach it; you can either make it as realistic as possible, create credible characters and situations, or you can make it as fun as possible by playing it for laughter (something that creators of "Silent Night, Deadly Night" did for example controversial theme: killer Santa). However, people who have made a "bloody birthday" will not do any of these things; they simply rely on the shock value of a child's image of a gun (or knife, loop, or arrow) in his hand. The result is both offensive and stupid. The whole movie looks like a bad idea that has been rushed through production (and then held since release for several years). It's a redeemed little bit of good performance from kids, but it's very sloppy. (* 1/2)
