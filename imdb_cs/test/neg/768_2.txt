Tom & Jerry visits Africa and disguises himself as "Amos-n-Andy". They even act and speak differently, with standard humiliating use of extremely poor grammar associated with the stereotypical image of blacks portrayed in many era cartoons. In addition to offensive images, this cartoon is not very good. Why did they go to Africa first? Obviously just to give the audience another Amos-n-Andy and an exaggerated cannibalistic portrayal of indigenous Africans. The only reason I got 2 instead of 1 was a decent few seconds including an octopus. He stands behind one glance that keeps you shaking your head and wondering how ignorance could win ... <br /> <br /> (Note: I consider some cartoons containing such racially stereotypical images to be It all depends on whether there is good content in the cartoon, or whether the only reason for the cartoons is to create in other words, if you get rid of "Mammy," shuffling feet, bad grammar and black faces with giant lips, in the case of "Plane Dumb" is not there.)
