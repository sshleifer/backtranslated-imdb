This episode sucks. Over the past few years I've been watching all the "Next Generation" and "Voyager" episodes and now I'm watching "Enterprise" <br /> <br /> I am thoroughly enjoying this series. Do this episode. I stared at the screen in horror for the destruction of character and fun. It's more like a slapstick attempt. Builds characters, but throws them to limbs - and lets the audience gasp. It does little to build the series. Why it was ever allowed to go into the air stuns me. Was it writing? Was it overhead? Was it a manufacturer? We'll probably never know. But one bad apple isn't bad. I say hoping it's just one.
