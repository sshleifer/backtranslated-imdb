I recently watched this movie because I'm a big Kinski fan. But my God. Don't get me wrong. I love this guy. But in this film, his whole work is simply a refusal to work! But fortunately, no one is to blame. First, the whole story is very weak and they are gunmen looking for a murderer while Kinski got stuck in prison for a crime he didn't commit. That is all. All dialogues and characters are so bad that they make you scream. But maybe it's fun. If you know the Kinski biography, it is clear that Kinski didn't care about these movies at all. Especially all its Italo-Western roles. He just took the money and that was it. again, this whole movie is totally weird. Only for hardcore-fans of the genre.
