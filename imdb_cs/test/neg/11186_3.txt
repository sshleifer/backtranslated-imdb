OK, it's a piece of a historical movie that caused a stir, shocked people and was banned. I'll give it, which is why I put it 3 rather than 1. It may be before the times, but it's definitely behind the times now. I'm a LARGE Dali fan and I loved Un Chien Andala. The short one was enchanting with one creative scene after another. L'age d'Or was too long and boring - just a confident piece of pompous film that was created simply as a faint attempt to try to make Un Chien Andala by creating a feature film (and the shamelessly acting Dali's name and fame, though nothing to do with it ). Total waste except (very) several shots of "shocking scenes" separated by long stretches of dull inactivity. Wasting time and money. Both thumbs are down, down. It will go to my shelf, which I will never follow again.
