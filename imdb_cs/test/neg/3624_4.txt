That was another of the samples I watched to root out the positive elements, and since I've been a Nick fan for years. Some of them would be stage design, B-land, guest stars, and a few major actors who were good. At the show, I dabbled in high school when I grew fast and despised Jamie Spears, along with the other chicks on a show that couldn't act. The only characters I liked were Dustin, Quinn, Stacey, Michael & Logan. Quinn is the perfect outcast that eventually began to fit; Stacey is a complete weirdo; Dustin gets through a lot of strange, random situations; and Michael is a kind of comic true man, Logan. There is a remarkable difference between the quality of the performance and the acting quality of the B-fences that concern them, and the A-plots that showed a lot of girls and the iconic "Miss Perfect", repeating bad lines and obsession over the boys. This show would be great if the main parcels contained the quality of the secondary land, but the main parcels do not give anything. When he recently returned to repetition and tried to follow it again, I was more confused about the horrible behavior of the girls and had to change the channel. However, I will give the previously mentioned credit characters because they made the show more or less worth my time.
