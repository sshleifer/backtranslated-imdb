I can't believe the actors agreed to this "movie." I couldn't stand to look at it for a long time because I was worried about losing I.Q. points for every second. I think no one in the network that was broadcasting this dribble watched him turn it on. IMDB ratings go just low, 1 for horrible, it's time to get some negative numbers in cases like these.
