This movie is bad because we all knew it would be. Mostly I usually like the bad 80s / early 90s basket-comedy (haha no pun intended). I list ski schools, career opportunities, hot shots, summer school and many more of this time. This has even a classic but forgotten comedy Dean Cameron (aka .. ski school section 8 instructor and Maniac page for summer school). But this movie is only slow. It takes almost 30 minutes for you to get there and we have to sit in the senseless dialogue between half-boys Sheen (E&C). And yes, I can hear bloggers dying to be fired with "obviously you can't watch 2 and 1/2 men." Charlie wasn't at the level that is now in this movie ... not that he wants to watch Charlie now shining when his teammates support him and Emilio is no more than an exaggerated miraculous bra that offers little support, he actually wrote this movie by Emilio and shows he has no real ending (come to Emilio, even at Ski School 2 writers barfed out end) .Now, as every problem brought is solved, no hot babes, no swearing to relieve bad plot, characters, acting ... I'm tired of this tirade now. and watch the movies I mentioned above and enjoy them much more.
