'Bloody Birthday' is a strange and occasionally humorous low-budget horror movie that moves in the spirit of 'Mikey' or a less intelligent version of 'Good Son'. <br /> <br /> Set in a small California style, three children are born at an eclipse height where planetary alignment means that they are born without emotion in some way. Ten years later, our three little psychopaths set out on a deadly spree to get rid of their parents, siblings, teachers, and anyone who irritates them. Only one teen girl knows she can stop them. There is no explanation as to why children around the world born at the same time are not as twisted, but you go there! For the film slasher, it's very tame about violence and gore, which I think points to the problem of casting children's characters as murderers because it's so little that you can expose young actors. Instead, it is fun and a little worrying to see three ten-year-olds who portray murders and make plans using weapons, knives, and crossbows. The main reason why the descent is not absolutely absurd is that the actors are very convincing in their roles as they ominously play with small innocent people in front of devious adults, while showing their dark side to a girl who knows the truth. 'Bloody Birthday' is somewhat mediocre as a horror swing, with a few fears and little blood, but because it has a shock factor to have children as murderers, it's a little unique in this way. One looks at nothing else.
