I'm sorry, ELO fans, but I was disappointed with this concert at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. It's good music, but the presentation is just boring - big-time. Most songs sound the same, and lead singer-writer Jeff Lynne is about as animated as a shop mannequin. He has a pleasant voice, but he doesn't look much. She just stands in one place and sings for an hour and 40 minutes. All songs sound like gum from the 70s and 80s of the 20th century: pleasant, but not exciting. The only song - out of 23 - that creates some excitement is the last one: "Roll Over Beethoven." Now, if only a few 22 songs had such an excitement, it could have been a much better concert DVD.
