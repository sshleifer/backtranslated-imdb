Very boring, laborious adaptation of Amis' amusing satire. The hero is portrayed not as a likable loser but just an oafish cretin. Most of the rest are purely cartoons, with only Helen McCrory giving real quality and providing something from the novel's joke. The period was as if it were the 1920s, not the postwar period of horror comics and rock'n 'roll. The real bagpipe even standards the bad UK TV. <br /> <br />
