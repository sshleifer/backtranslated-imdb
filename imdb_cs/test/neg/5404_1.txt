I have very little to add to what all the other reviewers have done more than clearly! This movie is terrible! Beyond Horrible ... In fact, so unbearable that they have yet to come up with a term to describe the terrible that it is "Skeleton Man". If you expect your movies to contain minimal logic and graph, you should stay as far as possible. Sure, a lot of people are killing this skeleton-puppet wearing a ridiculous raincoat, but no one ever bothered to properly explain what it is, where it came from, or why it is so angry in the world. It looks like a switch between Skeletor from "Masters of the Universe" and "Sleepy Hollow" rider and runs on some god-forgotten desert. Setting "Skeleton Man" is another completely retarded aspect! For almost half an hour, I assumed that the film was set on a small isolated island, but simply played on the mainland, where luxury highways are passing through the woods and power plants at the end of the forest! Huh? Why do they all pretend to be trapped when they are like millions of escape routes? Anyway, after a few totally accidental murders, a special commando arrives, led by poorly washed Michael Rooker to come and hunt a monster they know nothing about. Fortunately, it is how each member of this group presents themselves as an expert in a particular field (we have a sniper specialist, a tracking genius, an exercise instructor ...), but they all die before any of them can. Show Your Allegedly Mastering Skills! The horror of the Gods must really hate Casper Van Dien, as he is once again, portraying a heroic soldier who steals a truck for no apparent reason, crashes on the highway, but somehow gets back to the center of the forest to die there. Right, that makes sense ... In addition, the characters steal cool monolayer from the "predator", the church horse constantly changes colors, helicopters slope with bow and arrows, ordinary missiles cause trees to explode and totally useless Vietnamese memories haunted Michael Rooker. I say we all join forces and vote in this pathetic move to the top of the IMDb 100 ASAP!
