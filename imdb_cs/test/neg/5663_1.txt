Have you ever gone to Youtube? A certain question is YES. Do you see ICarly and Nickelodeon boats? No clear answer. Many people think ICarly is a boring and idiotic program, and others think it is the best program on Earth's surface. I have seen many of the many ICarly panning reviews in my head and some give a bouquet of roses. In my opinion, Icarly is for kiddies, but the show is just awful. <br /> <br /> If you haven't read the last review, here are the reasons 1-8: # 1: Steryotypes # 2: Goofed-up Drama # 3: Everything's Stupid (For example, Taco Truck) # 4 that she is pretty but she is thinking # 5: Anyone who is above the age of drinking is stupid # 6: Sam is petite but strong? # 7: No Real Companies # 8: Medium Teachers <br /> <br /> # 9: Websites Overfill 3DFX. Just look at the website and understand what I mean. # 10: The website also spills out personal information. # 11: Almost every glorious thing is offended. Icarly offends the Japanese race, Solitare, Mercades-Benz and Pac-Man, to name a few. # 12: There are too many reoccuring jokes (Sam's obsession with meat, Freddy's computer, Gibby's pulling a shirt, etc.) # 13: Show suck based video games. # 14: Freddy's lack of masculinity. Why? It's unoriginal. # 15: The show is aimed at the female audience. I also hate shows directed at male audiences, so I prefer Icarly to both sexes. # 16: "nub" and "no chiz". # 17: Overuse of Laughter Tracks. Part 3 Comes Soon in Spring! Just in time for spring break!
