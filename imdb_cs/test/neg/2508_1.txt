This movie is so incredibly awful! All that was was waste. You can't say anything good about this movie, acting, script, directing, effects are just as bad as everyone else. even wood could do a better job than that. I really recommend staying away from this movie if you don't waste about 100mins of your life or how long the movie was. I forgot. this is the first time i have written a comment about the movie on IMDb, but this movie was just on TV and i had to let the world of movie lovers know that this movie sucks balls !!! so if you have all the decency in you. go and rent a much better bad movie like creatures 3
