This is the ultimate Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie! This is the only Kung Fu movie I've ever seen! I give this movie too much credit! My best guess for the reason to do this movie is that someone wanted to show off the skills of someone else's martial arts, but realized that you can't just shoot a guy who fights another guy and have him watch, and that's the story behind him . fight ... and people still didn't notice it. The film's story was thin. This meeting was goofy and stereotyped from any Kung Fu movie. Dubbing was literally the worst I've ever heard. It seemed that if you played a small part in this movie, like that fat guy or two guys trying to catch the main character of the network, it didn't matter who your voice did. It could have been dyslexic with a faint stutter and nobody would say anything. But besides all this, the film creates itself with somewhat amazing combat scenes. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes were definitely what this movie was about. But the struggles of the fighting were absolutely absurd! In most cases, one will either emerge from tall grass or look at the main character from a distance and then attack him. But as soon as they began to fight, things came to terms. But there were only two things that really hindered the fight. These constant "wooshing" sound effects that were added to each swinging fist or foot or sword, and bad adjustments that made 25 percent of the fight VERY nervous and choppy. Someone would find himself in the middle of the back flip and then suddenly find himself on the ground where he would be kicked, and then he should immediately return to his feet to block the punch. But while editing and embedding was more annoying than anything else, it didn't actually affect the overall movie. Finally, it wasn't a great movie, but I wasn't expecting a great movie. A great movie is not something you should expect when you see a box like this movie. All I saw this film was a way to go through an hour and a half of boredom. I rarely say that, but this was just one of those movies for which you have no practical use, so you're watching it whenever you have some free time. Enjoy the movie if you decide to watch it! Hello gentlemen. <br /> <br /> -Scott-
