How unfortunate, but also happy that two films about pot-holing-The Cave and The Descent - should arrive at the same time. Sad for The Descent's release in the UK on July 7 coincided with the London day alone underground tube / metro terrorist cruelty that killed nearly 60 and injured hundreds - not particularly good night / weekend jumps to the cinema, especially seeing a haunted movie about sympathetic women trapped in a deep, dark, claustrophobic underground cave system. These two films have practically the same elements - half a dozen characters lost in the unexplored cave system. Lots of water, caves, dangers ... then eventually some evil human beings or human-derived beings who are determined to loot on them. Where both are so different, the cave is unbelievable, absolutely incredible, more sci-fi fantasy adventure than horror or drama. The relatively minuscultural British film (filmed in southern England, although set in Appalachians) is a scary five-pair pants, a heart-stopping shock, so that the stomach turns out that people come out of the projection early in shock. She falls to girls in any old order - you don't even know what you're waiting for - certainly not her! Descent is also illuminated in a naturalistic way, making it somewhat scarier, unlike the dazzlingly lit cave, which resembles a huge magical Christmas Cave of Santa Claus, a cathedral room across a room that reflects in a wonderfully blue light ... who knows where while torch cavers are employed exclusively in artistically light granite-joked heroes (each more puppet-like than any Team America / Gerry Anderson / Thunderbirds creation). We must not forget the fantastic amount of equipment, but despite the incredibly deep expression of the actors clearly forgot to wrap up any sense of impending danger, drama or something worthy of horror film - this is strictly assessed by PG. And in this case, the actors emerge exactly what everyone expects from them - I quickly wrote a list after being introduced to each character just to get Piper Perabo out of sequence. The cave scenario is completely by number, unlike Shakespeare, a chimpanzee room would eventually write in a week. "How many times have we been in this situation before the bud?" - "Too Much" (Morris Chesnut answers). I swear you heard my suburban London audience gasping for that commonplace. The scariest thing about The Cave is that at the end there is a clear opening for 'continuation' - 'The Cave 2: Overground' or whatever. Don't worry, be very scared ... Or instead, grab The Descent and be really scared, you're very scared. RR
