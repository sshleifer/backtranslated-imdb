"The James Dean Story" is introduced as "Another Kind of Film," explaining, "The presence of the lead character in this film was made possible by the use of existing film material, tape recordings of his voice, and new technique resources - dynamic exploration of photography. "The only" recordings of his voice "is worth mentioning one of Mr. Dean's short footage when visiting his family in Indiana; he wanted to record some family memories of his great-grandfather Cal Dean, taken because he played similarly named" Cal "in" East of Eden ". Dean asks if Cal Dean was interested in art and learns that the relative was an auctioneer, James Dean was interested in art and had a warm relationship with his family, the only 100% accurate revelation in this document. art and had a warm relationship with his family. <br /> <br /> An amazing "screen test" / "outtake" from "East of Eden" appeared near the film, a black and white scene between Dean (like Cal Trask) and co-founder Richard Davalos (as Aron Trask) Dean is at his enchanting best.If this scene appeared only here and the movie "East of Eden" was not completed, this documentary would be a necessary, high-rated film. perfect "10" isolated, should be considered "east of Eden" in addition. Dean's film "Traffic Safety" is also worth a visit. <br /> <br /> Interview with family and friends expected. My favorite was the guy (Lew Bracker) who went through the box of things Dean had left with him and Dean's family. Aunt Ortense wasn't good enough, and a letter from Dean to his little cousin was very nice. Further reading Dean's letters would be welcome. Dean's unknown writer seemed to have a better job for the film; directors may have considered her development as the main focus. Robert Robert Altman's reading of Stewart Stern's screenplay by Martin Gabel is terrible. What did they think? Perhaps the filmmakers may be forgiven for the proximity of Dean's passage. Don't expect "The James Dean Story" at all. This film is more about Dean's influence on people (both fans and filmmakers) than the man. This is a very early piece of mythical creation of James Dean's legend. Tommy Sands sings "Let Me Be Loved". The story refers to Dean as "he" with god-like air. Shots of Dean's family seem to "know" the moment they die, they are really pathetic. James Dean's Story (8/13/57) Robert Altman ~ James Dean, Martin Gabel, Richard Davalos
