Totally non-funny "jokes" that fall straight, amateur gaming (with one or two exceptions), boring characters and dialogue, that's at best average. After watching this movie, you have to wonder how a producer might come across such a project on the ground and think, "I have to make this movie." No wonder she couldn't get a theatrical release.
