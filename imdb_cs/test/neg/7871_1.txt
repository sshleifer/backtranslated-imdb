That's 1 hour and 24 minutes of pure boredom !! <br /> <br /> In this 'Action' movie, the Baldwin gun uses (HK G3A3) sucks. It was sent for recycling by armed forces worldwide in the mid-1980s, and is now used only by terrorists, bank robbers and military museums. <br /> <br /> If I knew this movie was so bad, I'd rather watch 10 MacGyver episodes saving the planet. <br /> <br /> No groove, no drive and no feeling. Watch Tupperware Channel? it's more than we apologize for the movie. This film doesn't deserve '0' on the scale. Next time next time, Baldwin. Until then, I'm sitting here watching my nails grow? that's far more than "Target."
