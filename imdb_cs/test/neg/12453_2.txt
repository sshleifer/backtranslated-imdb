Jane Russell was an underrated comedy and singer (see SON OF PALEFACE and GENTLEMEN PREFER BLONDES), but you would never guess from her screen. A real stink, produced by Howard Hughes in his overly successful attempt to kill RKO Radio Pictures.

In his autobiography, Russell apologized for his "Lookin 'for Trouble" because he was reportedly so risky - you can show him on Disney Channel today. (By the way, the mention of autobiography has a photo of Russell in a bikini that is slightly larger than anything else.
