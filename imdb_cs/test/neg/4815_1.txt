Deeply thought-out foolishness that the "Bullwinkle" cartoon made fun a quarter century earlier, NO DEAD HEROES proves that you can copy a good film (MANCHURISH CANDIDATE) without copying a single source of quality from the subject of your robbery. Playing barely registered on a cable access television scale, the plot is less nuanced than the old comic "Sgt. Rock". This film achieves unusual performance, it's too bad, too stupid to be used with your thumbs.
