I was actually planning to see this movie when I noticed it in my TV guide but after about 5 minutes decided the time is definitely more expensive than "Who's the girl" can sometimes be worth it. Describing how bad Madonna works is impossible and the end result is one of the most annoying characters ever captured by the film. This crap is an insult to movies and intellect. Almost never! to evaluate a movie that I don't see from start to finish, but in this case it is not possible. 2/10
