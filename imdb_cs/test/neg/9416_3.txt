Mario Van Peebles is trying to go on the Jean-Claude Van Damme route and play a renegade robotic soldier who goes AWOL alone, but the government won't take it lying down, so among the simplistic conspiracy Van Peebles protects the villagers from rebel forces and defeats an improved version of herself in this unsatisfactory film. This sharp ripping of a universal soldier (which is much more fun than this) just does not go anywhere. The main problem is that the film is so incredibly inert. Van Peebles just waits around and there just isn't enough ass-kicking to justify viewing. On the other hand, the film resembles the respective version of R.O.T.O.R, although where this helpless bad movie was jolly, it only brings occasional laughter in its ridiculously unconvincing action sequences. Like R.O.O.R, he has no sense in his narrative and basically, the film is amazingly boring. Plus the villains are disappointed weakly and basically the film needs a real action scenario because the material is too dull. In all respects, Solo is a very weak film. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4- (Weak)
