Honestly - this short film sucks. the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made, but still fake enough to destroy the viewing experience. The Unearthed DVD is sharp and clear, and I don't change it if it helps or prevents it. If the film were a little grainy, it could contribute to what's going on. I have no idea why this movie has so much hype that it's different than the theme - but being honest necrophilia scenes in movies like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q are more shocking than in AFTERMATH. This whole story of loneliness and all the other ways of deep philosophy is a bull ****. This is an expensive, beautifully filmed lawn. It's not that shocking, it's not so disgusting. if you insist on viewing it - rent it. I give it to 3 that not many people make necrophilii explicit movies (it should definitely be a bigger choice for us sickos;) - filming is good and has some "gore" (if you're looking at a rubbery looking doll) get cut open is considered gore ...) but other than that - absolutely nothing that would be this exaggerated mess. On the other hand - GENESIS - "The Continuation" of Cerdy on AFTERMATH (now available as "double feature film" released by Unearthed) is an absolute masterpiece of a short film that really shows what good director Cerda is when he is given the right material. Although I do not care about AFTERMATH at all, GENESIS is so well-made that I will forgive Cerda and be sure to look after him in the future ...
