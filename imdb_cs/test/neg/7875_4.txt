I saw it in my local supermarket and I knew Debra was in it, so I decided to buy it (out of support for this sexy woman!) The storyline and acting in this movie was horrible (except for Debra Wilson; I'm not just saying that because I love her, she was really the only actor or actress who had some emotions in her performance and voice!) What I didn't get at the beginning is why the woman did not return her car instead of running randomly. It was so stupid. And it's LA (NOBODY saw she was kidnapped on a public, residential street - NOBODY ... yeah, that's realistic!) Also in the park, when Charlie stole a woman's cell phone (for some stupid reason), they were hell bent to find him (and in one place) when they had it, they had it at the shooting range - via CELL PHONE! In fact, I doubt the LAPD would get out of the way like this for a dumb cell phone! Ms. could go to one of many of these mobile phones and have her exchanged! The kids were also sucking the skills (I think they read from the cue card, or someone in the camera whispered their lines) because they would ask questions and look around and then answer with a questionable voice (ie, yes - yes, yes miss daddy ? ") Also how could they be all the tree snipers and on the roof in LA without seeing them? I see it playing at 3:00 in the US. <br /> <br /> Debra Wilson Fans She is the only actress with any real acting skills (Debra, sweetheart - stop making these cheap D-grades, right on the movies ... maybe it will change with the upcoming Whitepaddy movie). the superiors come and ask her who she is talking to, shouting at her computer and going "Damn, Charlie!") I gave it 4/10 ... 4 just because of Debra's good acting skills.
