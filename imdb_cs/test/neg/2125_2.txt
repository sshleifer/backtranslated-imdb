The farthest of all disappearing rip-offs has become one of my favorite directors. Lamberto Bava (here under his pseudonym John Old Jr.). You know how it goes in these cheap European imitations, right? They just want their monstrous animal to be bigger, more sick and more threatening, but more than often it leads to the opposite effect. Bava is a humongous sea devil creature and it's more than just a shark! It seems that we are dealing with a prehistoric monster, with jaws and great white tastes, but also with octopus tentacles! It depends only on a few oceans who love dolphins to find out how this monster has survived all these thousands of years and why it has just begun its deadly spree. The scenario "Monster Shark" makes a few sense and most action takes place on the mainland. The shark itself is unintentionally a ridiculous creature, and it was a wise decision by Lambert Bava to show him only vaguely and quickly. The performances are above average and underwater photography is surprisingly clear and well-processed. The twists in the plot are predictable and you'll probably have the funniest observation of detailed character information. For example: count all cans of Dr. Hogan drinks throughout the movie!
