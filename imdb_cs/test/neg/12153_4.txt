This movie didn't smile. On holiday in Turkey, I noticed that it was playing in a local cinema and decided to see it. The action sequences in the movie are well choreographic, but the story goes in the middle of the movie. One thing I didn't completely follow is how Borte was able to raise money for bribes. The Rangers. Another thing I didn't particularly like was the missing part of Khan's life. He did not go into the details of how bad people could find him and imprison him again after he had been lost for so long. Overall, I rate this movie and (4) because I enjoyed the action sequence, but there were too few to justify a higher ranking because the dialogue left me less than impressed ...
