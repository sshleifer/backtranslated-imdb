I saw this movie in a sensation and I thought it might be a good Sunday night movie when there's nothing else to do. So I bought it, 3 DVDs for $ 25. Although it was cheap, my money would be better spent on nails to go through my leg. The movie started nicely. Kinda Dark and Mysterious. As a child, I was always fascinated by vampire and samurai films. I thought the combo would be really cool. The first battle scene was pretty cool. I was excited about the rest of the movie. Then the film began to dive seriously. <br /> <br /> I understand it was a big hit in the East. I think it's because of the twins. But I don't see it. This film, except for the first 10 minutes, was terrible. So many films in this genre have the potential to be great and to throw it away. That's just another victim. Jacki Chan makes no sense at all in this movie. Proƒçyyyyyyyy? Complete stupidity. Probably made him a few bucks. The only great thing in this movie are the swords they use. Good idea. <br /> <br /> I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
