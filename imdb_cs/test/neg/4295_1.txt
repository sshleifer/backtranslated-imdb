I just wrote a commentary on "ACES HIGH" (1976) and this reminds me of this movie I watched as a child when it was released; I've only watched it once and that was more than enough. As Kevin well says "it's a complete waste of time". In addition to the dog fighting, which is nicely done, the rest of the sequences of badly bent scenes with actors fighting the miserable scenario and the same miserable direction. I don't remember the stupid German accents Kevin mentioned in his commentary, but that's another pathetic mistake; if Corman was trying to characterize German pilots more convincingly, why didn't he use German actors or let those parts dub? On the other hand, it is a good example of the scary Hollywood style of filmmaking with their "villains" so clearly identifiable, not only by their cruel actions, but also by grotesque accents. We talk about this cruel act. "The ridiculous scene was Lieutenant Hermann Goering murdering an English sister during an attack on an air base is a totally outrageous piece of propaganda made with a" historic look back ". If you want to see the factual, moving, very well-played and directed film about the air war during World War I, watch "ACES HIGH" (1976) or the wonderful classic "DAWN PATROL" (1938), you won't be disappointed.
