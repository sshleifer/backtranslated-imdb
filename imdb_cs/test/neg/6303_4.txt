Shaggy, a friendly but frustrating film, has the same old message: if you want it to be in this world when it's not imaginative, you have to live in place in society and that means living according to (heterosexual) rules that rule us. Drag queen comedy-drama from Australia is mostly an optimistic journey of three passenger friends through the Outback on their pink bus, baptized by Priscilla. While not as a formal movie by itself, there are mandatory "road movie" sequences (sticking fire, facing down a collection, etc.). Writer-director Stephan Elliott follows every potentially lively moment with a bit of humor and sympathy, but in his narrative there are mysterious gaps, a terrible subplot about the relationship of a gay man with his ex-wife and estranged preschool son. who is comfortable - and child wise - with his lifestyle), and the third act without energy. It has some evil transvestite humor and quite a game cast, but a script that seems to have been watered along the way. ** of ***
