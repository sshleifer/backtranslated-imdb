If you are a Catalan nationalist anarcho-socialist with incredible respect for the mythology of the Spanish Republic, this film may be for you. Two brothers, real people (one of them himself Marc Recha), re-sketch the fictional version of the path of real life they have made through the spectacular Catalan landscape, and history is evoked (pans of perforated walls, artillery booms on the soundtrack), but not shown. There is very little dialogue, and most of it is random: the story is told in a third-person voice-over, the voice is that actress impersonating a real-life sister of real life brothers. Images have little to do with what the story is, which is not much. Many of them are stunning, tense basins across sharp, semi-dry mountains and rivers. . These are best suited in the amazing natural sound environment of the movie and without tedious narration or even occasional background music (some pretty good, some somewhat strange, but all unreasonable). The best that this movie says is said in these sequences, with the occasional inclusion of power stations and dams without comments. The relationship between brothers is left superficial and general; the main character is human-biting catfish, never shown. The more Catalan-nationalist anarcho-whatever the director has accepted, the more rich, unspoken the film's message is subverted, and the more the narcissism gets irritated. Although the director said at the NYFF that the film was conceived from the outset with his third person story, I would like to see his version without narration or music and with only a natural soundtrack and minimalist dialogue - the result could be more mobile and in no way should be so much more confused. Meanwhile, it is most likely the only movie you will see this year in which a guy walks into the frame with a penis hanging from his penis (a suit he wore?). This is one of the few moments in the whole movie in which your interest (sorry) is plucked by something that is actually happening on the screen (what is it? Why is it hanging there?) But as usual no answers are available. Very Warholian, very sixties, and not a bit tiring.
