In short, this film was terrible. I understand it's a Disney movie, which is usually a shallow movie with average graphs and poor gameplay. But I have to say it's the worst of all Disney movies, with bad acting, LOTS OF IRRITATING SHRIEK TEEN GIRLS (my god) and an extremely unrealistic storyline. Even as a 12-year-old, there's no way I would like this movie. The only way this movie could get worse is to try to put it in theaters or try to sell it to a local video store. Do yourself a favor and change your channel before watching this, no matter how bored you are on Sunday afternoon.
