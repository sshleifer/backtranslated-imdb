This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and the worst thing I'll see. I see no need to redress what everyone else said before, just be careful ... <br /> <br /> It's not one of the bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of which, his simple BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD. <br /> <br /> This movie is the equivalent of having "pet rock" as your friend. Wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen. Unfortunately, it never does. At least with pet rock you knew what you got into. The Lion's Gate to this bomb is totally deceiving ... No ... this is a disaster. After watching this movie, you would have sworn that George W. Bush had his hands throughout the film ... yes, his idiot. Stay away if you don't of course watch the worst movie of all time. Probably as the Lion Gate imagined making some money from this piece of dragon.
