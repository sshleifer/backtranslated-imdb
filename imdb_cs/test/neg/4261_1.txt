And the worst part is that it could be good. But something terribly wrong. At first they should not occupy Amitabh Bachchan in this film at all. It is too iconic to solve such a delicate and controversial topic, let alone the role. Second, Ram Gopal Varma should be ashamed of taking the classic story of Lolita and turning it into a pathetic predictable slut. His Lolita is named Jia (played by the newcomer Jiah Khan) and when we meet her, he is without any signs of stolen innocence or the gentle naivety that one would normally associate with the complicated story of the original Lolita, which in the original story becomes gradually a nymphet . Varma's Jia is already an eye-slut bitch, even before the camera meets her. And in his films that lead his nymph, he does not exercise any chastity. Mr. Varma made sure that he did not leave one person less than uncomfortable with his voyeuristic angles of pedophile cameras, from his crotch shots to fixation on her vulgar gestures and mannerisms. No, let's not talk about the nonexistent chemistry between Jia and her so-called girlfriend Rita (the daughter of Bachchan's character). These girls are supposed to be the best friends, yet they look like the worst enemies before anything goes wrong. Nothing they do together is plausible until they become enemies. Perhaps Mr. Varma should work on this aspect of his script instead of focusing on destroying any credibility that Amitabh Bachchan could leave as an actor. The worst part of the film is perhaps a subordinate picture of Bachchan's character. Her role was so underwritten and ridiculously wooden that it was impossible for her to truly feel any compassion or concern for her. Actually, I felt as if he had reached the screen and slapped her for not responding like any normal woman. Instead, she stood there and looked irritated and helpless because I think many viewers of the movie might feel after watching this movie wreck. Watch at your own risk.
