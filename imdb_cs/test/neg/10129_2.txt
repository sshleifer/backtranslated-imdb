I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show. It's so boring. Jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny. It's like, Alex said something that wasn't funny or interesting, and then the sound suddenly laughed. My friend and I looked at each other with a blank look as if to ask, "What's so fun? !!". Seriously, every time we watch this show, you wouldn't hear any laughter or cough. Just a blank look. So we stopped watching. Personally, I am a fan of sitcoms, so I tried to watch the show. But to show us such disappointment. This show could be one of the worst comedy comedy ever ...
