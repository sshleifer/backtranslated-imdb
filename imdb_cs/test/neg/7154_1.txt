I was looking forward to this movie. I like road trip thrillers. I like sex, drugs, youth, action and great soundtrack. Especially I was interested in a film trip around Europe to see if I knew any of my own travel spots. However, since the first scene, this film was not suitable. What makes Guy on the wrong side of the road? What could blow up a van that gracefully rolled across a shallow grassy slope? If they are such bad drivers, why should they have a job? And that's just the first scene! It's not bad enough to be camping or stupid. Just terrible! Grapes! Grapes! Waste of time. Go for something ... anything else!
