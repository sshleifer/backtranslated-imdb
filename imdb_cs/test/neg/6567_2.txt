While the Star Trek movie was mostly boring, Star Trek The Final Frontier is absolutely wrong. In this horrible sequel, the crew is on shore on shore when they receive a federal distress signal that Ambassadors representing Earth, Romulus, and Kronos (the Klingon Homeworld) have been kidnapped by a Vulcan renegade seeking to reach the Starship. get into the big barrier. He hopes to find God. Using mysticism and bad writing, he convinces many of the senior Enterprise officers to betray Kirk and catch the ship. They get into the big barrier and find a planet where they meet a divine alien. This one is so bad that it's hard to know where to start. At the core is a good idea that has never developed. The story goes nowhere instead of where no one has gone before. It's almost like writers had no idea how to end this fiasco. Action scenes have no tension from Kahn's anger, philosophy is boring and humor is outdated. Now I'll focus on most of my anger at William Shatner. When he takes the director's chair, the ego increases. Most attention is focused on him, Spock and McCoy, but he doesn't give others enough to do it. In addition, while Shatner is usually guilty of over-playing in previous movies and TV points, he is simply mean in this one. Now Kirk is a reckless, practical joke and stupid. One of the worst scenes includes three leaders who sing "Row Row Row Your Boat" in a round at a campfire. In any case, it's the worst of the Star Trek series. I should have given three out of ten instead of five.
