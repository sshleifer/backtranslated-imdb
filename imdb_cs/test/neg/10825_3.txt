The scariest thing about this horror movie is that the end refers to the sequel. 'The Cave' is a really disappointed action movie. A team of cave and undersea explorers are leaving for Romania (one of these cheap places to make a film, at least for the time being) and enter a cave that turns out to be an empire of underground monsters. Or are they demons? The film never decides if it wants to be action, science fiction or horror, it's a mixture of everything without salt or fun and acted in a wooden way. The best in film is cinematography, but the dark landscape of the cave is soon bored as the film lacks pace and characters are simply not interesting. Waste of time.
