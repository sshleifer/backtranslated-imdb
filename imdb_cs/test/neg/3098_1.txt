This film was a memorial to film shooting on a colossal scale. I am a huge fan of Burt Reynolds, but even in this movie he was terrible. The only redeeming quality of this movie was a chick who smoked all the time. She was so attractive to him that she could look at her. Otherwise, it's a waste of time and energy ...
