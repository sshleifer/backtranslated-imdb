Eric Phillips (Don Wilson) is a secret service agent who prevents a senator's assassination, but on a journey where he finds a plot and has a tracker on his tail. Tracker by the way is bent to end Phillips. Of course, Robocop is the most obvious inspiration for this low-budget action movie, and while the film has some imagination and real energy, it has the real life of kickboxes running away from the robot. The film is not so bad because it is simply empty and repetitive. The story is written in clich√©s and the characters are set to be limited by different shootings. As usual, Don Wilson is terrible in the lead role. <br /> <br /> * 1/2 of 4 (bad)
