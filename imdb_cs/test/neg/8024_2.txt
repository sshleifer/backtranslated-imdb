It's funny ... one day before I saw the movie I was watching the documentary about Leni Riefenstahl, so the kind comparison came automatically ... of course there is no :) <br /> <br /> the movie is weak in all aspects ... acting is not convincing (especially the one who plays Simon ...) and the unnatural ..., the cut in confusion and always leaves the taste of the unfinished shot, the music does not fit, the story does not flow, it is boring and the film goes much longer that's ... oh, and the characters aren't very well shown, in fact you can't say much about girls (except what you see). .. The film also tries to shock with explicit curse (which is very ridiculous :) <br /> <br /> Sat ... 2/10
