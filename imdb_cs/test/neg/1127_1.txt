Quoting Clark Griswold (in the original Christmas holiday): â€œWORSE? Little Chevy Chase knew he described "sequel" to one of his best films. Christmas Holiday II sets new highs (or maybe it should be LOW) in bad movies. My wife bought this DVD and thought it would actually be the continuation of the original, but we were very disappointed. This movie is LAME. He disagrees with the original, is an absolute waste of film and embarrassment to otherwise good actors who were unlucky about being part of it. Must have set up an IMDb record for the worst reviews. I really think we have a good case to win a class action lawsuit to get back the money consumers wasted on this film.
