In Madrid I was able to see a copy of this film. Wow! Gallo is amazing about that. Very unusual performance he gives. But in addition to Gall's genius, the film is a boring film I've ever seen in my life and sometimes it's so bad that it borders on laughter. I'm also a fan of Val Kilmer, so he was part of the reason I made such a great effort to see the movie. The problem is that Val is really just in one scene. Having his name in cast as leadership is an insult to my intelligence and the rest of the cast. I only saw the Strand of Directors of other films. Both films are far below average, but both contain very interesting performances by Vincent Gallo. If you're just like a Gallo fan, as I then see this movie no matter how bad it is. If you don't like Gallo, then ZERO is left to love.
