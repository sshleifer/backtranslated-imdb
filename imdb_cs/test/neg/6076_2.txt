I made a big mistake to see the movie. This is a lottery when I see movies. After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker, and I fought hard to stay in place - the old "lost two hours of his life" kind of feeling. The basic problem is that without the whole "historical accuracy" of the review threads, the scenario is painful, painful, bad. The first thirty minutes could be spread over an hour to be credible, the real estate development. Instead, it emerged from one abnormal "dramatic" event to another. Having a girl crying at the beginning of the film doesn't make sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point. And that all went to sunset through the long grass field at the end, what the hell was that? Even the great Ed Harris couldn't save this. He almost felt his pain on some of the lines he had to say. The most fabulously horrible was, for no apparent reason, looking at the girl when she copies her work in her apartment, looks awake, it all goes a little blurry romantic kind - lighting (or dreaming) and he says, with authority in his voice, /> <br /> "WASH ME." And he will rise and wash him with a sponge. "Wash Me" WTF? It's merry. And then there was music. The long extended session, when it was just Beethoven's conducting and the 9th symphony pouring out of the cinema surround sound, and the choir awaiting, waited and stood silently in what seemed forever. And then he finally starts a huge sound. It was amazingly furry and I dare say that it brought tears to my eyes. So that's where the movie captured two stars. The only part of the movie where Beethoven had to say exactly what he wanted to say. And I believed him.
