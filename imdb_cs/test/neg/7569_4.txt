It is a family film that was founded in 1950 in the countryside of America about a boy whose uncle charges fees for killing sheep against his dog Drum, starting not only with family law but also with social disagreement about how their city starts to get married. This is a formula movie that tries to be very touching and sweet. The biggest weakness is that the only ones who could really act were Scott Bakula (Advocate), Ron Perlman (father / Druma) and the dog. (John Shuck and Kathy Garver, "Sissy" from the original "Family Affair", as an uncle and his wife, were all right.) The kids weren't so good (basically they looked like they were acting) and that's a problem when the movie is around they really do (Aaron Fors, who plays Donny's tyrant, I wondered what actor Russell Crowe had to look like a kid, only without talent but a lot of ham). Favorite line (said the prosecutor after Scott Bakula closed the test speech): "We'll be lucky if they don't lynch us." The favorite line that Ron Perlman talks to (after his son is tying a tyrant): "Now, if you make him your friend, it's going to be a hard part." <br /> <br /> He's pretty cute to hire / buy used.
