I tried. God knows that I was trying to like this Swiss cheese from the movie, but the story was too full of holes, some of which were big enough to drive through a horse-drawn carriage. The overall acting performances and characters that emanated from regretting the death of recently sprayed cockroaches scattered to die their own terrible deaths. Overall, however, it wasn't too scary. Finally, we saw scary fast-moving characters in the background because "Brood" why back when / and it was scary then only briefly. This film never solved the basic points of the conspiracy and that is the writer's work. Of course, you would expect the director to realize that the story doesn't make sense. What was the secret room behind the wardrobe, why the blood of the hungry ghost did not die when it adopted the nails, how does the book that they read earlier prescribe? Why did the computer say "game over" for Frankie's character, even though he lived? The list goes on and on. I do not feel that I would recommend this movie because you feel like you are wasting your time unnecessarily and there is not enough money in real terrifying moments.
