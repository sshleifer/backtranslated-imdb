A friend warned me that it was the worst movie he had ever seen. I was curious because it developed a bit cult status. I like a lot of special independent cult movies, so I did. I have to agree with my friend. It's a smoking pile of dung. I'm sorry for the people who love this movie, but if you want to watch a twisted Indian cult movie, I can recommend you much better things. Try Peter Jackson's Dead Alive (aka Braindead), a cemetery (aka Dellamorte Dellamore) or a modern vampire.
