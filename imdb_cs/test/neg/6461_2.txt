This show is amazing and we enjoyed it thoroughly. Set in Alaska, I disagree with homosexual content on today's show. I feel you are pushing too hard to bring New York to Alaska. His one thing is that the New Yorker is fighting on wild Alaska, but trying to change the city of Alaska to New York? This is a nice show about elegant women and true Alaska men and bringing the same sex couple into the mix is ​​throwing a balance path away. Alaska should be portrayed as a man and New York as a woman. I think the first 9 shows have a perfect balance with what you do. We can't have a nice show without nature imbalance.
