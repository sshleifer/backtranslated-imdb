This may be the worst remake Hollywood has ever made, and it says something. I'll take it farther than that and say that this movie is so overwhelming that it's wrong to be seen. I don't know if I can handle all things badly - just as the casting director seems to have pulled out the names from his hat, or that he could be carried away by the spirit of Richard Gere's characters. at the end, leave without a jump (I'm sure people say, "It's just a fiction who cares" would have no problem if it was a former al-Qaeda worker who wants to return to his home country) - so I'll be Give your review complete revelry, which is mainly the scene where Bruce Willis tries his weapon. <br /> <br /> In the original version, remember, the jackal is practicing his killing on a pumpkin. The pump explodes on impact, an effect known as "understatement". In this version, Willis prepares the pumpkin target, but he does not use a sniper rifle - he uses a gigantic remote controlled cannon that costs tens of thousands of dollars and can only be stored in the back of a huge imaginative minivan (this man likes the challenge). He reveals the cannon by pulling the tarp on which point Jack Black, who is there to watch, jumps and says, "That ROCKS! This ROCKS thing!" about 18 times (I think Willis didn't have to dismantle it first, just pick it up, sail it and all of it from the back of the van, though it weighed a few tons). The scene then turns into Austin Powers when Willis lacks a pumpkin and pulls out a tree. Then Black walks through the mud, his pants fall and finally blows his whole hand. Pumpkin falls to the ground, without damage. <br /> <br /> If I can recommend this movie for ONE non-ironic reason, it's a character for Diane Venora as a tough Russian major who becomes romantically connected to Gere despite face distortion - a bold move for Hollywood feature. I really liked this character in the middle of the movie, so it was a shame when she had to be killed. I'd like to see a movie about her. In addition, this pile of crap is only useful as an objective test of intelligence. 3/10.
