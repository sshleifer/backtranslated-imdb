This is the worst movie I've ever seen, maybe the worst I've ever done. I find it unbelievable that some people rated it as 10. It has an overwhelming lack or rudimentary traces of realism. Almost every war movie clich√© appears in this movie and it is wrong. On the other hand, if I wasn't so remarkably bad that I would enjoy it, I wouldn't see it until the end.
