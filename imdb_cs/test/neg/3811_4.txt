I first heard about this movie in "Flashback Weekend" in Chicago 2007 for "Nightmare on Elm Street". Robert Englund really talked about the movie and he was great in his "Hatchet" section. The same goes for Tony Todd. Knowing it's a low budget, the first time the director / writer brings it every bit as well as a big budget and also a portrait of "Holloween" (2007) remake / re-pose. <br /> <br /> Technically it's not a few places. The sight of the alligator was too dark. When that happened, the dark head of the alligator against the swamp, which was fastened to black trousers, became almost invisible. The mood music in the swampy scenes was too loud and conserved as a bad sitcom. And like "Holloween" (2007), someone is smart enough to have a gun, but of course the killer is just a pause button for the killer. The end, well, once I saw where it went, I knew what would happen, not too original. The highlight of the film are characters and their interactions. Unlike "Holloween" (2007), we had to meet people and take care of what happened to them. Ben (Joel Moore, who is also leading the "Spirals") sulk lead and Marcus ("no other teen movie") as best friend and humorous man root for during the film. Shapiro (Joel Murry "Dharma and Greg"), Jenna (Joleigh Fioreavanti) and Misty (Mercedes McNab of "Buffy The Vampire Slayer: The Series", "Angel: The Series" and "The Addams Family" Movies) give a compelling reason for topless women. Mr. and Mrs. Permatteo played TV series (Richard Riehle "Grounded for Life", Patrik Darbo "Step by Step") because the older couple you know has no chance, even the Shawn Wizard (Parry Shen) is a fanciful character. I hope to participate in it all more, but I think it will play better on home video than in theater, sorry.
