Writer-director Patrice Leconte takes a universal and potentially bottomless subject - friendship - and turns him into a flat and insignificant farce, despite A-leaf actors, fine cinematography and elegant design design. It's all on the property and the story is ridiculous. "Learn how to be likeable", art dealer François Coste (Daniel Auteuil) tells a random stranger (Dany Boon) and summarizes it. We are learning besides nothing about friendship and Daniel Auteuil can be a great actor, but we do not believe for one minute that he could be an egoist in the throat that depends on him. Just as we hope honesty is over, Leconte pulls out one of his usual third acts, which take place quickly, and quickly renounces disaster damage. Like François's precious Greek vase, everyone in this film is fake. Leconte's only asset is Julie Gayet in Coste Catherine's business partner, who looks outward and sexy despite the big hairstyle disaster.
