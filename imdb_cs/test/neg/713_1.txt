This is not a movie. This is a collection of random shots taken in a fascinating part of the world, dubbed with some random text. The shots aren't that great and the text isn't so big. The end product is unbearably blunt. <br /> <br /> On DVD, turning the commentary can provide some fun value because the director makes a rather rude argument that it's a sci-fi movie. It is also fascinating to read about the extraordinary risks and difficulties that the crew has collected. Too bad it's waste. But I think "Fata Morgana" would be a fascinating film like "Ed Wood".
