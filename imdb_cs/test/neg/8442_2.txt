Let's see: What are the advantages of Piranha's observation, Piranha? If you've never seen anything in common with Venezuela, there's plenty of travel footage of both Caracas and the landscape (and the jungle) and the various indigenous peoples at work and play, as well as lots of indigenous peoples. wildlife. If you like William Smith, he plays a little git (as always used to do). And that's about it. If it wasn't for William Smith, it could probably go like a fundraising film for Save the Children or some other organization that benefits from the "Third World." The only time you really see a fish title is during the opening credits. No mutant killer fish like Roger Corman is called Piranha. You would have twice with fish in the title that twice as many monster fish would appear on the characters, but unfortunately it is not. The Story Starts With A Photojournalist And Her Brother Comes to Venezuela to tell a story at one of the last untouched places on the planet, but their motivation quickly turns into wanting to find diamonds that are apparently abundantly there . There is not much real action or danger in this movie. What could be an exciting motorcycle race is numb with the mass of landscapes and animal shots that are inserted into it to draw movies running time. It's not much more action in the last fifteen minutes of the movie (which is about how long the movie will last without the whole trip). <br /> <br /> In my opinion, the only way the movie can really be BAD movie is boring or incredibly stupid. Piranha, Piranha is sure to qualify for this former badge, and he's damn close to the other. The only reason I don't rate it is that the added shots are more interesting than the rest of the movie.
