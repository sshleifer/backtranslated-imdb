For many years I've seen this movie as a real ninja movie, but after studying more about this culture, I can only think it's just another karate movie. Black shinobi and some weapons don't make a ninja, it's much more. Ninja are the most dangerous fighters of Japan because they are trained in every aspect of life to survive on anything and kill anything they try to stop them. This film is not just about a ninja warrior about a clown trying to be something he can't understand.
