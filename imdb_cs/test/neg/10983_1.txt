This woman is a terrible comedian. He can't crack a joke. He has no real character. This is another example of typical American waste people laugh at because they have no idea how to react, so they say, "Well, it's a comedy show," so I laugh, I think. I can't stand this poor woman and her bad pi $$ comedy. She doesn't deserve anything but booing. Why America cannot please this kind of pleasure and go for something that actually contains humor. Not at all. Why why and one person like this idiot?
