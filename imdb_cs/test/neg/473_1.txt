We'll get one thing out of the way. I am a huge fan of Bruce Campbell, I have an Evil Dead series, I have action figures and I've seen Bubbu Ho-Tep. I'm a fan of cheesy, ridiculous horror flicks and know how to appreciate the whole "it's so bad it's a good" deal. I wish I could say the same about this movie. I watched this movie with high expectations, I wanted it to be good, campy, something we all knew about BC and love. It started pretty promising, but after the first 20 minutes I stayed to watch the rest of this excused excuse of the movie, as if I had been shot by a sedative arrow. The idea itself is not bad; two men, do not go together, both killed by the same psycho woman, half the brain of one man is transplanted into the other's head, argue, disagree and follow comedy. What killed me is how extremely unorganized and boring it was! She had the potential, even if the camp stepped up to be much better than it was. The story was boring, even Bruce's zanyl physical slap couldn't work. The word cannot even properly express the absurd robot that ends up Bruce's brain when he gets into it. Easily the worst robot I've ever seen (even for movie B). The whole idea is stupid. What the hell has gone through Bruce's mind when he made this smoking pile, he's behind me. Why Ted Raimi did not go to his big brother and ask him to make some sense to Bruce and not to mention some lessons that he should take care of the film, he is behind me. !!!
