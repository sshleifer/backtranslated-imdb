Yeah, sure, the movie his visuals were already looking horrible, and not very hopeful, but the assumption and cast looked good, so I was still expecting to be entertained by this movie. Unfortunately, this was not the case. The assumption is good, but the story is filled with improbability and is logically wrong. This movie is potentially flushed down the toilet. The main plot is interesting and somewhat original. It's good enough to make a good adventure movie of you would think. However, this film is not entertaining and I think it is the biggest movie. Maybe he'll take it too seriously, and the film wouldn't hurt a little humor. Instead, it is now nothing more than a lame and a cheap-looking movie, filled with one unlikely event after another, which also steals a little more from other, more successful films. Apparently mainly "Jurassic Park". The characters also don't help make the movie more compelling or at least interesting. I still think Edward Burns has done quite a decent job as the hero of "heroes". However, the remaining characters get into the film and are very interesting. The film rather relies on its visuals, which are extremely poor. Catherine McCormack also plays a very irritating character. Basically all her character complains and talks about how genuine and the rest oh so bad. Her character is simply not likeable. And the rest of the character ... but I forgot their names, I think that's enough about them. Surely it is true that the performance of Ben Kingsley himself makes this film worthy of attention. He is really great in his role as a malevolent businessman, but from the moment he disappears from the movie, the movie really goes downhill fast. <br /> <br /> Visually, the film is extremely poor. It has some terrible looking CGI effects and they couldn't even get more simple 'blue-screen effects' seemingly in the movie. The kits are also terrible and cheap, as if they could fall and break every moment. The film will never become tense, exciting or adventurous because the story is brought in the least interesting and engaging way. . It's a very distant movie with distant characters that can't impress. There are many action sequences, but all of them are so fearsome and far from believable that they will never become tense or pretty good. So basically this movie is missing in all that is needed to create a film genre like this good and successful. It is sad to see how low director Peter Hyams has sunk for the past few years after having done some good movies in the 1970s and 1980s. <br/> <br/> 4/10
