I literally ran to look at him, expecting a movie that would cry or touch my heart. What I found was not heartbreaking, but lame exploitation of 1 strong human character. Intertwined between a pair of young lesbians and an obese man. <br /> <br /> In an essentially sound-free environment, not to mention the most common. It wasn't entirely BAD, as I saw the worst - and I left the cinema $ 10 poorer, but wiser - that FILM well advertised isn't the same as FILM WELL-MADE.
