While this film has had some horrifying moments (making great use of musical and film angles to build tension), it is clear that director Ethan Wiley and screenwriter Ellary Eddy wasted no time exploring their subject; which also challenges my assertion that the exorcist scenes were under the supervision of a true Catholic bishop. Among the many inconsistencies: <br /> <br /> * Jacob Roman Catholic priest, when we first meet him outside the church, wears an academic robe over his clergy rather than the typical white, chasuble or surplus. Academic dresses are commonly worn by Protestant ministers in liturgical denominations, not Roman Catholic priests. Jacob the priest quotes some dark and disturbing scripture about angels taking weapons. He attributes it to st. Paul. This verse is not from the writings of st. Paul, or the Bible. I can't even find it in the Gnostic script. Jacob tells his bishop that he does not believe in the possession of demons and refuses to ask for the study of exorcism, but does a complete 180 (later on the same day?) within a few minutes of talking to an obsessed Isabelle. Sure, it's possible; but a little unrealistic. Look at Father Damien as a priest / psychologist in the original EXORCIST for a more realistic picture of a skeptic-turned believer. Miguel, a former priest turned to a farmer, is the first to try exorcism at Isabelle. Quotes the Bible and quotes back. He says, "I see you know Psalm 65" - correcting it "It's Psalm 67" - both are bad. Miguel, a former priest who has just carried out exorcism - made the sign of the cross, called for the name of Christ, used holy water, etc. - telling Jacob that he did not believe in the church and did not believe in God. (Maybe it's just a contradiction?) Jacob allows him to put on his home robes as well as others. * Miguel, a former Roman Catholic priest, crosses backward (or Eastern Orthodox style). As a Hispanic Roman Catholic who used to be a priest, he crossed his forehead to his sternum, left on his right side of his chest. I had to read into small side stories, Satan fiddled with the whole family, not just with Isabelle; but even at the end it was difficult to say with certainty whether someone had actually committed a guilty picture in his head, or if it was all demonic fraud (except for the sheriff - it is quite clear that he was guilty). On the positive side: Isabelle was CREEPY - in my opinion it was the best part of the whole movie and I liked the plot conspiracy with Claire. I'm not sure if the movie was meant to be serious or spoof. Listen to the running comments with Cameron Daddo and Ethan Wiley, I'm inclined to be a joke.
