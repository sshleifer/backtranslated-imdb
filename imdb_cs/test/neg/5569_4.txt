I really like this movie because it is refreshing from the horde of clones of everyday horror movies and I appreciate the fact that the creators are trying something original. Unfortunately, the plot did not stick together, and none of the characters were really loving to care for them or their fates. Visually Toybox was quite interesting. The director has taken a lot of risky moves, such as adding small pieces of animation (Flash-look) to parts and really some special effects (such as light from a particular amulet). Sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't, but it deserved to be an attempt, and cinematography was generally of high quality. Unfortunately, when this same approach of throwing lots of things on the wall to see what the sticks were applied to the plot, the results were not very good. The film never finds the tone he likes, moving schizophrenic from a black comedy to a family soap opera until the 80s witchcraft, which plunges into the nostalgia of childhood to a family with crazy families. The bits and bits of each of these elements work quite well, but nothing happens to a satisfactory whole. In addition, large pieces of conspiracy are never really explained. I'm not the one who likes to feed me with a spoon, and I like movies that leave things to the audience to decide, but the parts that are left out of Toybox seem to run out of money. They could explain it to them, or they didn't really think what could start. I'm looking forward to the next director's project, because I think there's a lot of talent under the surface, but I can't really recommend Toybox for my own merits.
