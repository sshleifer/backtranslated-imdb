I'm a lover of bad movies. I own "R.O.T.O.R." and "Boa vs. Python" and I'm working on building my collection for such big titles as "Troll 2" and "What is Superdoc?" But "Storm Trooper" is not bad enough to get a list of beautifully horrible movies. It's just lame. Whoever said he has a better dialogue with his pot plants is right. Everything about this movie is stupid. When the robot gets into the car, it seems as if he knows it will blow up. "Judge, Jury and Cat," "The perfect cop ... but they went too far," I mean, why do people bother doing these movies? R.O.O.R. It's because it's hysterically awful, but Storm Trooper is just a waste of cinematography because it's not bad enough to be so bad that it's worth watching. This is part of a collection of home movies that they can be proud of, but that's it. I am p * ssed off it was on the HBO channel (with only 1-star, which is why I watched it) because it didn't belong there. Even if you like bad movies, don't take this movie. It's shameful.
