This is the situation of Emperor New Clothes. Someone has to say, "This is not a funny and original movie (etc.), This is a subtle movie. Don't waste money on it." The film is cheesy and the people in it are embarrassed by the worse trailer. They are just too realistic for themselves. They have no lines, they do not. The American dream is not to create awkward movies without any qualities or anything else that is sloping and not-good; is to achieve something of quality and thus success. Only people who are desperately trying to commend any movie that was not made in Hollywood (it could not be made in Hollywood, can it?), Would try to attribute this film to any quality. It's worse than "Ed Woods", another film about no filmmakers. These movies should not be made and you should not go see "American Movie".
