Altioklar's populist approach manifests itself in all his titles, from the worst to the best. She doesn't care (or has no idea) about art, all she cares about is getting people to think they have a kick in the groin by watching his movies. The problem is that the effort is too evident, and as the events unfold with all the nonsensical exaggerations that get into them, the effort fails. the originals were made because it was extremely Hollywood for me), Altioklar tries to be a Tarantino. (Mr. Tarantino, if you read it, watch the movie for the best of your life comedy!) He doesn't use subtle moves to do it, all he does is use extreme things and it is excruciatingly absurd and laughing. Levent Üzümcü as a forensic guy with cows licking his hair is just cheerful. I hope to meet him personally and ask how he felt about this film himself. Because I found him offensive to him. Demet Evgar, who was groping her genitals, was also unpredictable and did nothing but look false. Another specifically idiotic aspect of this movie was a 100% erroneous tempo setting. When things are to be taken slowly, the scenes are flowing. And at other times it makes drowsiness to watch the slow ridicule happening. If Altioklar is so deeply in love with lame Hollywood's shallowness, he should use Michael Sixarrows as his name instead. Even such a move would not be as ridiculous as what he did on this film. First, he should learn not to emerge directors whose levels never come, and then realize he is not in Hollywood, and then take private lessons from Zeki Demirkubuz or Reha Erdem about how to put the thoughts into a plot. These useless films could not be saved even by those, but maybe in the future they could make films that could be watched by these steps. , and I still can't move away from this being the worst Turkish movie ever.
