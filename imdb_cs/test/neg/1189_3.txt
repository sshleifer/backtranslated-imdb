If you watched the series and love the league, I'm getting ready for disappointment. I went to the cinema with a group of tough league fans and we all agreed that this movie wasn't as fun or dark as the three series. In my personal opinion, it was a spinner money. Writing was conceived and a conspiracy confused - not confusing just what she was trying to do. It was her own enjoyment of the worst kind of writers who are much more talented than my pitiful critic. I hope that the league can be at least honest and acknowledge this film worse than three outstanding series. I will not buy it, even though I own most league memorabilia.
