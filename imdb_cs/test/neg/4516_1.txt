That's really pointless. I just got a copy of "Disco Beaver From Outer Space" after I heard good things about it, and I must say that it was so incredibly unreal and bad that it would leave you numb and mystified as it happened. /> <br /> I mean, what was that? Is it typical humor in the late 1970s? I do not think so. That's so bad and believe me, I don't mean "so bad it's good". This is a collection of extremely unreal parodies, as if you were watching cable TV. Sure, it was the HBO program, and to think it could be considered pioneering is scary. In it there is one somewhat pretty girl and there is some old NHL record from NY Islanders hockey team, which is fun to see, even though I am a lifelong fan of the NY Rangers. But they even go wrong because they are trying to get some humor from two hockey players who roam on the ice as if they were "dancing" and even worse is turning a videotape of two hockey players fighting to make them look like they have sex. How funny! In one mild bit of cleverness there is an interview with a hockey player named "Chico" who resembles NY Islander Chico Resch, but even throws him out by wearing a Rangers shirt! Well, maybe it was intentional, who knows. The bottom line is that "Disco Beaver" is just so badly awful, so incredibly bad, you'll definitely feel cheated after watching and wasting almost an hour of your life. You are wondering what the creators of this waste might have thought there was something funny about it, and you will also wonder why these parodies can't even come close to the worst Saturday night dinner. Incredible. Just incredible.
