I was totally disappointed with this. After reading the amazing Oscar Wilde story, I was hoping to translate at least a bit of magic to the screen. There was nothing. This version played as a condensed, dumbed down Reader's Digest movie. Not only did he feel rushed, he was cheaper and unnecessarily rewritten. The main characters and plot points were either changed or completely removed. I appreciate the difficulty in trying to bring a novel to the screen, especially as to what can be a very limited (television) budget, but there is no excuse to make such a great story go wrong. I strongly recommend reading Wilde's story of corruption, which exists in the most beautiful exteriors. But I can't advise anyone to rent this travesty.
