Skip this Hollywood version, a real piece of waste. Inexpensive insult to the brilliant original "Spoorloos", or by an English title also called "vanishing". Absolutely missing a brand in a typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually because of a lot of talented, corporate bean counters who have no vague idea of ​​something artistic, they just look for a "successful formula" and want it to apply to everything for profit. Just like the scary "Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, which twisted the original story around so much to suit the MacDonaldsland crowd that it became aberration, not even bastardized, but a pile of goats that were similar in shape but doesn't look, feel remotely resembles the spirit of the original. In addition, the film had at least Gary Oldman, who is interesting to watch anything he does. This dog has nothing on it, even the usually very talented Jeff Bridges is embarrassed. A great tragedy should never be a "good film of the year" but rather one or more sadly too frequent tragic events in life and allow the reader / viewer to draw a sense and look into the human state. Br /> <br /> Do a great favor if you are looking for a rental and skip this grotesque waste and pick up an original made in Dutch / French cooperation in 1988. That's a great movie. That's a terrible mess.
