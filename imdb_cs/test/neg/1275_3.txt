Maybe I don't get it right. I mean the movie. That doesn't mean I'm happy or what to do. Maybe because of my mood. Anyway, it's a simple family movie with kids for actors. Admit that - all films of this kind cannot pass a barrier of 4 out of 10 who play in the movie (eg Antonio Banderas played in such a movie ... two or three of them don't remember the exact number). I'm bored. I almost fell asleep just because the topic was so clich√© and the acting play was so predictable. But I'm sure my baby will love this movie when it grows up ... Hey I'm not a monster I've found some merry or good moments in the movie. The owls in the movie were cute. Trick with painted police car windows and hits that guy got into the head with a golf ball ...
