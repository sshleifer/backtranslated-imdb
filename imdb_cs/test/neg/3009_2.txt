Most of the movies I like are art-house fare and rarely appear on the box office top-ten lists. I said "Northfork" is completely incomprehensible. I have no idea what it was about. Stephen Holden, who wrote another film in the New York Times, once noted that some people think they can throw anything on the screen and let it work as a fairy tale. I was thinking about this review several times while watching "Northfork". On a scale of one to ten, I gave him two.
