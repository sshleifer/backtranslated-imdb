Some of Janape's modern horror movies are very good. Strong plot, frightening moments, good playing, while others are just .... unfortunately, Uzumaki belongs to the second camp. I will evaluate the film based on 3 elements: Fence, Scary Factor and Acting. 1) Fence - True to the name of the film, the story moves in a circle and never explains. OK, the city is enchanted with a spiral curse, but why? And why do people act so stupid? There's a fleeting attempt to explain what's going on reporter .. unexpectedly ... <br /> <br /> 2) Scary Factor - if it was to be a horror movie, it failed miserably. I can't remember one good scary scene with plenty of time. 3) Acting - very monotonous. People walk around and say meaningless phases. I can't really feel the empathy for our tragic heroes. All in all, there are much better modern Japanese horror movies with a coherent plot and strong characterization. Don't bother wasting your time on this wannabe.
