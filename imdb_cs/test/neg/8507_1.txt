Debbie Boone had a monster hit with her pop song "You Light Up My Life;" the movie of the same name, Didi Conn, was a terribly embarrassing flop. Conn plays a stereotypically little girl-vulnerable girl who is in love with Michael Zaslow, who plays the stereotypical yuppie-wannabe guy. They're engaged, but everyone knows Zaslow won't marry what's not blonde and built, so only Didi is surprised to be fired. Needless to say, Didi is embarrassed. Fortunately, she does a little songwriter in her free time and comes up with a tune she thinks she's pretty. Does it say - can you guess? - "You turn on my life." She hops in the car and goes to the big city to sell her song and make a new life. Now I remember sitting in the theater watching her hop in the car to go to the big city, thinking, "Well thank God we finally got the whole exposure out of the way. "And something interesting happened. Credits were rolling. Yeah, that was it. Not only was the film bad, poorly written, and badly filmed, but it was just in the middle. and we're not talking about a cult movie, we're talking about an unreal flop, a real yawn from start to finish, and if you like Debbie Boone by all means, buy a copy of it, don't waste your time or money on this. glad you missed.
