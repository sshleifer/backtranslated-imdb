Is it just me, or is it AWFUL? I'm going with AWFUL ... <br /> <br /> Knowing it's a good guy (usually defined as full of chases, falls, shootings, explosions, etc.), I still expect a little degree of credibility. If I can't believe in the assumption in any way, the movie won't work. So we get to the problem with "Assault on Precinct 13." <br /> <br /> Not one for spoilers, I never give details about a conspiracy. However, I will make an exception here because the plot is SO inane. Bad guy is trapped in precinct 13. Bad guys want to break him. Surprise. Bad boys guys are actually corrupt cops. Fearful, worried, but a heroic young cop saves the day while looking at the girl. UGH. Yes, it's really simple and stupid. "Attack on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. It's not a bad environment for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months at the end of 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Yet it is incredibly violent and offensive to Detroit police and citizens. I spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I can't imagine the ultimate chase in downtown Detroit falling apart. I had to skip it ... <br /> <br /> There's no substitute for watching bad movies. Save your money. There were too many good movies in 2005 to waste even $ 3.00 at Blockbuster on this one. <br /> <br /> FINAL RATING: 1 <br /> <br /> (Just because I've seen worse movies.)
