This is one of the dumbest movies ever, not the dumbest mind, but the dumbest. That's 96 1/2 minutes of sleep inducing material. Probably Jim Varney is the worst movie ever. The last 30 seconds of the movie is the best and most fun part, but it is hardly worth sitting around with the film. On the other hand, if you are a fan of the dying Jim Varney / Ernest, then, like me, you have to add this movie to your collection. It has short, rare moments of humor, even though there are few. The mere fact that this movie is so hard to find is a collector item and must have an ernest collection for your collection. I was lucky to have found this movie online on dirt cheap prices a few years ago. I believe I paid 1.99 plus shipping for it. And it was the only copy I could find anywhere. While this is really all around a horrible movie, it is still a must if you are a fan of Jim Varney and Ernest movie collector like I. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give this movie 2, but that's just because Never before I haven't seen 1);
