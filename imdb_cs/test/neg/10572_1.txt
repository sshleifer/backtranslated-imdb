He went with his friends and one of my friends, I think it would be a good way to start on spring break, but the movie was terrible. We all agree it shouldn't be PG-13. More like R material. Lots of sexual dialogue, cussing and referring to parts of boy and girl (under the waist). It's not worth the time or money. Definitely I urge you not to go or rent it when it comes out. If it ends, don't take smaller children. It's not the type of movie you see with your family! If you're curious about the content, check out the content section on the Superhero page on the IMDb page. Most of the content that was supposed to be fun was extremely rude. Especially when they are made from Steven Hawking.
