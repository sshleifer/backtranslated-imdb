Once in a while I like a good horror movie so I thought it would be a splash and gore movie. But it was a boring boring movie, maybe because I saw a cut version because where only two things are a little splashes, once where some cut one's hand and where someone shoots a hand, but where the only things. Wismaster for example had more cold senes then evil ed, its more boring ed than evil ed. and some actors who are miserable
