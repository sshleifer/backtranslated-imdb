Sometimes when I hear an A-list cast will be put together for two hours in the movie I hope and pray it's good, not because of my $ 10 or 2 hours but because of these actors' careers. In the case of "Be Cool", everything went to waste. At the beginning of the movie John Travolta (aka Chili Palmer) and music manager James Woods go in the car talking about film sequels, and how much is not good. If you look at this scene being shot in the same way as Quentin Tarrantino filmed his scene in "Pulp Fiction" and you listen to the dialogue, you can't help but think about it being 1) a disclaimer for the audience that the movie will be suck, or 2) an attempt to get the audience to laugh at total humor 2 people talk about continuing the sequel. Oh irony! (In case you were curious, option 1 is correct.) Cool and slippery Chili Palmer from the first and good movie "Get Shorty" is revived to play a gangster who has gone through the music. She steals a young hot singer (Christina Milian) from her ghetto who scared a Jewish manager (Vince Vaughn) and turns her into a singing feeling. Of course, a movie about a former gangster can never be complete without the new gangsters causing confusion. This time around the election gangsters are Russian, played by American actors who can't act Russian if my whole family hit them head with Russian bare hands. As a Russian, I was not so much offended by the way this film portrayed the Russians, but instead of being a writer, I was more offended by the horrible dialogue. This film tried to make the audience laugh. This changed potentially good redundancy lines. Russian, black and gay jokes were the same ones that were only overcome several times. After calling The Rock is character af ***** (playing gay bodyguard on Vince Vaughn), and Cedric Entertainerer character ***** (played by a black rapper with an escort that threatens those who don't play) his tracks with weapons) Wanted I go out of the cinema because it was painful to sit. If it was "Get Shorty", none of this would have to be in the movie to create drama or really bad laughter. <br /> <br /> What Missed Short Short in this movie was Chili's hot spicey attitude. He's a completely different person in this sequel. Old Chili would have had more dialogue. John Travolta has no more than 20 speaking lines in "Be Cool" because he is out of the line with repetitive lines, and a hundred and two portraits of the most casual personality. I will not destroy the shock by revealing all the portraits for those who are really planning to see this film (PLEASE NO!), But I will say that it will always amaze me that these people have agreed to be in the film of such innocence. What was even more stupid was the very poor dance sequence with Travolta and Uma Thurman (played by James Woods' widow, whom LUCKILY kills during the first 10 minutes of the film). Tarrantino never did Pulp Fiction for an idiot like "Be Cool" to play with him. This dance number was boring, long and simple pulsating. Black Eyed Peas playing in a club with a total of 10 people made the scene unforgettable. There were so many plot holes that I left the theater asking myself Why?! Everything about this film was a big question mark. I just didn't understand anything. I couldn't even explain to you why the Russians were all over, or why the movie was made because I'm confused. All I took from this movie was that everyone in LA has a sidekick, and the only way this movie was probably funded was through all the ads of Diet Coke, Yahoo !, Honda Insight Hybrid, T-Mobile, Trimspa (even even the spokeswoman is in the film) and Bad Screenwriters Guild. Fence holes, stupid dialogue, too many random portraits, horrible gameplay (even professionals) and a not-so-fun attempt to emulate "Pulp Fiction" make this film the worst movie of 2005 and it's only the third month. year.
