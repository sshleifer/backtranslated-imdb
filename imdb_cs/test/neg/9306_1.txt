That worries me when I talked about Australian film, but Mr. Accident is one of the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even more tragic is that it doesn't fit into the category "it's so bad it's good". What worries me most about this film is the relatively large amount of money that has been embarrassed by a senseless, unfair, underdeveloped scenario. Silly Performance (What Do Garry McDonald and Elisabeth Gore aka Elle McFeast Do in this Basket?), Inadequate Direction, No Conspiracy, and Generic Sense of meaningfulness completely take away an intriguing production design and leave a really horrible taste in the mouth. Comedy! Ha! Do yourself a favor and stay away!
