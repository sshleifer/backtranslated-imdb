This film was bad at many levels. Writing was terrible, so even the best actors couldn't watch this movie. It's a shame because they had some good actors in this movie. I mean, if anyone saw any movies from the Police Academy, you would know that Steve Guttenberg was good. His character in this movie was very serious, which was a big difference from the characters I saw before, so it was a plus. And I think Steve Guttenberg was extremely hot in this movie. With or without a shirt you can't deny having a great body! Sexy face too. He loved the look for 5 hours, it looked dangerous. On the one hand, in the film, he is in a bed without a shirt and I have to say that I would like to jump there and try to get rid of his problems! So honestly I would watch this movie again just daydream!
