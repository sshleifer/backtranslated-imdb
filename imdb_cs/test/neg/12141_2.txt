I grew up on weekends at the "Bowery Boys" and even at a young age I could say that this is a low rent thing, as the name suggests. It was still fun to watch Satch (Hall) win better Muggs (Gorcey) after Muggs defeated him. Things East Side Kids have never been shown, even though it was public domain, and probably cheap to make it just low for kids to tune in, even though we had only 5 channels to watch. Enter 2005 and I'm repossesin about my childhood. I can't find any Bowery Boys on DVD, but I found East Side Kids on the disc and also on publicly accessible sites. Fortunately, I saved the dough and saw Bowery Blitz on the web for free, and it really blows. Now I see that there are some Bowery Boys and maybe Monogram bad movie lovers who gave this melodrama crap 7 out of 10, but c'mon people, it's not even trying to be funny. It's East Side Kids drama, not comedy, so it's not good. The best part was that Muggs was fighting at the end, reminding me that my school days, which I liked as a girl when I got into a fight, was a little rough. Leonard Maltin in his mini bio said this movie is one of the best so you can imagine the rest. If you want to see some half-day decent East Side action see Ghosts on the Loose maybe, but the bottom line is usually a comedic team starting strong in their career and tapering, these mugs chucks soon on then slowly picked up until Hall's antiquity dominated case. Stage 2 is below the three blades that they imitate, but amusing for those who grew up with them. This feature will not bring back pleasant "Bowery Boys" memories and it is best to leave the Monogram fanatics.
