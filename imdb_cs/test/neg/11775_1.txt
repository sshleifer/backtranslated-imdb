Nothing is looking here. Everything was done (and better) before. Who cares about this woman - insufficient in every way - like a mother as a wife and a friend? At one point, when she could go on a high road - she jumped on both sides with both legs and held her breath - for nothing better than "me too!" If she wasn't a pretty and young person she portrayed on the screen - but she looked more like a real human wreck, represented by our family members, neighbors and friends who really suffer from additions, we would change channels in a nanosecond. This film starts at the bottom and goes down. Nothing redeeming, no lessons learned - by no means uplifting. Neither of the main characters induces compassion, let alone empathy. (Well, maybe the snake.) I'd have more fun shutting the door. Who needs drivel like that?
