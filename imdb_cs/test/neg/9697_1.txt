This film could have been an impressive epic, but the creators seem to have done everything in their power to make it look stupid. Even God himself is not spared in this film because His words are dented by childish jokes. The result is blasphemous and unpleasant. Only people who are not interested in cheap parody on the Bible story may be watching this film without embarrassment. The creators of this weightless production should see Il Vangelo secondo Matteo, a film by Pierre Paolo Pasolini that shows that it is useless to reverse the Bible to make it a good story; The most striking result is the sincere rendering of plain text itself.
