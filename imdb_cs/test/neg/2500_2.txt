It's strange, while the movie contains full X-rated sex scenes and violent murders, it's never as shocking as it should. A group of scientists set off on an island in the Caribbean to investigate a radioactive incident. After their arrival, the mutated islander goes on a happy business to murder a man and have his way with women. It doesn't always work like this. Among the poisoned acts we find some lesbian encounters, three-way with male prostitutes, multiple heterosexual mating and rape of a dead body. . Although it is all fully explicit, it can never shock or stir as it is meant. Once sex becomes pornographic, it only loses its edge; Suspension of distrust is broken and we realize that we just watched people who have sex. There is some blood and gore with murders, but since it's a D'amato movie it's really tame. For a much more rounded experience, watch similar "Erotic Night of the Living Dead". <br /> <br /> 2/10
