In the twilight years of his career, Charles Bronson forged a long-running partnership with several directors, most notably J. Lee Thompson and Michael the Winner. He also made two films for one-time director Bond Peter Hunt - the first of them was a decent action actor Death Hunt of 1981, the other was this indifferent political pursuer. The assassination is quite boring, if the truth is known, and the end comes, you will find yourself in the desire for something with a little more passion and pace, such as Wilby Conspiracy (which resembles in this movie). Bronson's sleepwalker with his role as bodyguard Jay Killian, whose job is to protect the wife of US President Lara Royce Craig (Jill Ireland, real wife of Bronson). Killian believes that Mrs. Craig was focused on murderers; he thinks he's an overly paranoid pessimist. It turned out - a surprise, a surprise - that Killian was all right all the time and someone was really out there to remove her. Both of them go on the run, tracked by the murderers. Everyone knows that the president's wife is known as the First Lady. For some reason, they have renamed "One Mama" in this movie! What it is about is that it is someone who guesses, but it shows the absurdity of the film as a whole. Most movie performances are lazy and the script takes a long time to get where it goes. If I were to mark an assassination in a particular genre, I would say it should be a "thriller". I would say with some reservations how to say it is a thriller that has a rare excitement.
