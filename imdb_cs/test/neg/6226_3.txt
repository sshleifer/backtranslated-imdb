This is a new approach to comedy. It's not funny. The joke is that it should be funny in itself. The story is based on a French story in Paris and the characters have French names. Louis Aubinard, for example ... played ... Bob Hoskins? The film also plays the same French Jeff Goldblum and Natasha Richardson. The situations are similar and the characters act as if they were in those Carry-On movies back in years. I believe these are also jokes - to cast these actors who are in no way attempting to act in French to have them dealt with in the comedy of a wide English ballroom, leaving bloom the secret to unexplained viewers. It's virtually Algonquin's round table in the humor department, isn't it? The film tries to be charming and unpredictable, and I think these qualities are a bit funny. It's not as fun as Duck Soup or Love and Death, but maybe more fun than a deer hunter or Potemkin battleship. It's an example of personal filmmaking. It does not make any real effort to reach out to the audience and share it, but it remains true to its premise and inner logic. Although all situations are incredible, they are logical within their own bizarre world of film. I like this kind of eccentric movie in general, but I thought it was too slow to be boring. , tedious, and give too few pleasant surprises or real jokes. This is just a kind of meander in predictable and sophomoric ways, and wastes some amazing talents along the way. It must be the lowest point in the career of each of the major stars who are all differently distinguished players. I found it the biggest loss of talent from The Betsy, and I wish I had never seen Goldblum and Hoskins on this. <br /> <br /> So call it an interesting discount and pass it as a rental if you don't really have a lot of time to kill. <br /> <br />
