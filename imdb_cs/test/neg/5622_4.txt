Another movie that will punish us for the "Pulp Fiction" crime. <br /> <br /> If you like watching people kill machine-gun fire in an hour and a half, it's likely to match your account. The fans of the debut episode "Aeon Flux", in which the title character kills literally thousands of seemingly anonymous soldiers, are really going to do it. In fact, it's just an excuse for a bunch of young people to act rude and shoot people. Sometimes the whole scene goes and the only thing that happens is, you guessed it! someone gets shot. Or, to spice it up, there were 20 people. He sits there first, the next minute sits there dead. Yahoo! Rough plot: Young American goes to Paris (American in Paris, get it?), Hires a prostitute (ethereal Julie Delpy), gets in touch with some old French friends, one of whom has AIDS, planning and attempting a bank robbery. Of course, the film convention states that no bank robberies on the film will disappear as much as possible, and this snag takes about three-quarters of the run (it's like "Doggy afternoon" without the joke, patience or humanity of Sidney Lumet). While at the bank, things go wrong (surprise!), And Parisian with AIDS, goes wacko with his Uzi several times. No spoilers here, but just say that you are at such an emotional distance from these characters that you are unlikely to worry about who lives and who dies by the end of the movie. <br /> <br /> Some have called them stylish. Maybe it's, but it's someone else's style, it's a movie that's been done, and "Killing Zoe" is imprisoned by convention. Nowhere in the film does the director (Roger Avary, co-owner of "Pulp Fiction" Oscar) do anything original, stylish, funky or outrageous. If you do not take into account the fact that no film that takes place inside a bank has such a high number of bodies, there is nothing else but to oppose it.
