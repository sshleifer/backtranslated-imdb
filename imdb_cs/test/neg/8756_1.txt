Most of the exclusively produced low budget films from the 1980s are worse off than old socks. This particularly unhappy and amateur-not-budget Chicago-negotiated basement "ugly necrophiliac nutcase for loose" bloodshed serves as a depressing confirmation of this borderline inevitable reality. Bearded, tousled, long-haired, beaded and wild-eyed shirts psycho hippie fruitcake embarks on your standard random fearsome killing, graphically killing libidinous young couples who engage in strenuous coitus whenever mansonesky crazy attacks fall apart. (Hmm, I find that there is a clear, confidently Puritan "having sex and dying" message? Gee, it could be, man.) Boy, it's a mentally unbalanced sicko one way away puppy: After sacrificing his wives, Our killer with proven biscuits looks forward to love for his freshly killed bodies. (WARNING: Possible * SPOILER * forward. At the end of the picture, the crazy body that spears the corpse is severely interrupted by the cops while in the midst of an unthinkable dead dead dead body, provoking a fragile pervert that loosens with understandably anxiety. Nooo! ") Now, isn't this gonzo a man and a half? Too bad is that it is badly done; If it was just with the modicum of taste and skill, it could be a little gem of horror exploitation. Unfortunately, Wally Koz's ham-fisted direction, Lamar "Larry" Bloodworth is stubbornly static and stationary cinematography, Frankie "Hollywood" Rodriguez is crazy, monotonously head-banging "hard rock" scores, woefully cheap and unconvincing makeup f / x , an apartment, a strikingly unpleasant plywood acting abominably versatile inches and a non-crawling non-pro-cast, lethargic stimulation (too much time on screen is tirelessly wasted on police efforts to catch a wack), especially lame would be a shocking "surprise" ending The killer is guaranteed to be a whimper in disgust), uniformly boring, constant bickering and positively braindead characters, and a steady succession of dark soft-core sex scenes that are about as erotic as watching two friends in the slums. Minutes straight all add up to one deeply ugly and relentless limp, soap noodles crumpled clinker. To be fair, this film has one stellar virtue: the insane dog slasher undoubtedly has an excellent taste in the crystal-tropical, louder than thundering daytime Hawaiian shirts.
