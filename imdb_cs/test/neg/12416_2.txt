Probably the biggest thing about the Wild Rebels, which is most harmful to her, is the hero. LOSER is written above it, but it doesn't stop him from "getting a girl." Probably one of the world's worst racers can imagine deciding to stop racing after a car breaks down. Well, his new job is still racing because a bunch of types of cyclists choose him to drive his escape car when they commit crimes. There is nothing to force you to Rod, even the situation in which she is drawn is stupid enough. Finally, on the lighthouse scene, you'll want Rod to kill all the cyclists. Get it: He shot twice, once in his arm and once in his leg, and yet he manages to climb the stairs a little. If only a Jeeter had a better goal ... <br /> <br /> Avoid this if you are not following the MST3K version.
