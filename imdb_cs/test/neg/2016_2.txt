A spacecraft sailing across the galaxy hits a mysterious cargo ship that appears to scatter in space. The crew is investigating, hoping to demand his cargo and acquire the ship. However, once aboard a sinister ship, their own ship mysteriously shuts down, leaving them to take care of themselves and fight anyone other than Count Dracula or Orloff, as this creature is called itself. It is not a bad start. This means that it monitors any number of typical sci-fi / horror charts. Genres were about enough that even the most original story inevitably triggers a comparison with some other film. But when you start with a rather typical horror convention, the legend of Dracula and vampires in general, and combine it with a rather typical sci-fi convention, the crew is going on something and becomes exploited to fight anything they have to face. film managers should have a smarter sleeve to print their own stamp on well-known genre basics. So, no, Roodt and Milborrow have nothing to their sleeves but their weapons. This film begins ominously enough, with the very poorly released Caspar Van Dien voice, which basically provides enough exposure to explain who the crew is on his ship. I would also like to point out that Van Dien's character is Van Helsing. And, so very cleverly, this character of Orloff is from the Transylvania region in the Carpathian system. No fun. I mean, come on guys, we get it. And again, don't be punched and don't use names if you don't have something special in the store. So after the Van Helsing crew, we basically have a film about this crew trapped in a spaceship with a lurking vampire. I'm a very forgiving viewer of low budget movies. Occasionally, they may be brilliant, seeing Raimi's first two Evil Dead movies. Dracula 3000 had a decent budget, enough for some decent special effects and pay for third riders like Van Dien, Erika Eleniak, Coolio, etc. However, unlike EVIL DEAD, there's no talent behind the camera. Talent is tiny in front of the camera, but I give the actors some advantage of doubt. They don't seem to know what to do. The best bunch actor, Alexandra Kamp-Groenveld, kills fast and the increasingly fun Udo Kier is limited to the show car for the viewer as we hear and see the dead captain through a video diary. Grant Swandby is also fine as a professor, but in 3000 it's hard to take a scientist wearing glasses and riding a wheelchair seriously. And yes, it's a WHEEL chair because there's nothing futuristic about it. As for the rest of the actors, well ????. I'm sure Coolio really tried to be scary after he turned into a vampire, but well, I don't think irritating qualifies as scary in most people's book. Tiny Lister and Erika Eleniak don't provide much. Lister is never more than the big black stereotype. Eleniak seems unhappy in the film and never tries very hard. Eleniak is a pretty girl, even in her mid-thirties, but she looks a little worn out and doesn't care about the duration of the movie. This brings us to Count Dracula / Orloff, who plays Langley Kirkwood. To be honest, I can't remember exactly who the vampire is. He introduces himself as Orloff but at some point he acknowledges himself as Count Dracula as well. Go find out. In any case, you will be absolutely amazed at how lame this vampire is. Have You Ever Scene Those Cheesy Horror Show Hosts Local Networks Should Their Creation Function Time Slots? Yes, it's so bad. Langley Kirkwood, the actor playing Orlock, had to find almost impossible to focus on such a ridiculous outfit. I'm sure his friends still have a hassled. There's not much to plot. Vampire is the last of its kind and wants for some reason to go to Earth, and there is also some blow that wants to beat the character of Caspar Van Dien, Van Helsing. Most crew members have turned into vampires, including Van Helsing, and the crew uses conventional machine guns and pistols to try to beat them before they figure out what the old share of the heart routine is. Yeah, that's right, bullets, and yes, year 3000. To stay in that confused vein, one of the main areas where the crew is developing while fighting vampires or a vampire because there is never more than one who threatens them is full of old Soviet posters and insignia and the like. What is it? There are also references to God / Religion being old-fashioned systems. But these links just confused me. Did the Soviet Union make a comeback? Is there something Roodt and Milborrow want to do? It never goes anywhere, it seems to be stupid and posters etc. They just look cheap. <br /> <br /> From a positive point of view, the film is appropriately filmed and modified. Cinematography is nothing spectacular, but it is clearly done by professionals and I have no problem with special effects. Ships look like ships in space. Although, as I write, I remember how the god of the Captain looks terribly dead when the crew finds him. What did they think? Why didn't anyone say anything? See how difficult it is to say something positive about this movie without going back to the negatives? Ultimately, this is the thing. No matter what you try and give this sci-fi / horror debacle, you will be amazed at the lack of quality. Poor Udo Kier.
