I won't even make any more comments on this movie. Instead, I will make recommendations for all those Euro-horror fans: If you want to see a nice low-budget movie called Vampire, check out Nattens engel (1998). Has everything Razor Blade Smile lacks: playing, nice places, amazing scores and less hissing vampires ...
