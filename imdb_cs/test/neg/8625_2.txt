Many things are wrong with this movie. Jeff Bridges Strange Accent. Rity's ability to break password code <br /> <br /> The entire script <br /> <br /> End - esp the last scene where two coffees are brought to the table for Jeff and Rit and the publisher . J & R laughs and says, "Not anymore; drink coffee already". Why then ordered it ??? Of course. If it wasn't and the waiter brought every coffee by default, there would be three coffees. <br /> <br /> Total Tosh.
