I took this DVD out of the cheepo basket at Walmart because the cover showed one of the aircraft I flew during the Viet Nam (C-123k). I didn't fly for Air America, but I knew he was a C-123 pilot, I knew who did it, including those who flew in my reserve home. I'm not a film critic, but I'm thinking about the subliminal motivation of directors and writers doing movies like this. The best part of this film must go to the cameraman. Flying shots and stunts (though totally drawn) are excellent. The film starts with a popular Hollywood boy in 1969. But the fact is, Nixon didn't start Air America, he didn't start a lie. Johnson was responsible for Air America and Nixon inherited lies, war, and Air America. It's not fair or accurate to portray Nixon as a liar on Air America. All Presidents have inherited the lies of their predecessors. No one smart enough to fly the C-123 was stupid enough not to know what was joining them. This makes Downey's character incredible. The C-123 was a rough plane. It could easily fly on one engine, or two auxiliary jet engines. It is more likely that three shooters shoot a duck with one shot. Pilots who flew with Air America were civilian CIA employees, not ruthless soldiers lucky. They had good reason to behave and believe in the future if they survived their extremely dangerous work. They got twice the retirement pension. They were not obliged to sell drugs or weapons to get a good pension. Dope was legal and the way of life in the SEA as it is today in Afghanistan. If the individual pilots tried to make money on the side, it wasn't the CIA policy. The CIA fought against the war against communism, not drugs. The writer based his story on "war stories". Pilots love the BS of everyone who buys them and listens to them. A writer and director who had an ax to crush Viet-Nam and Nixon. Watch the movie and remember how it starts - accuses Nixon of what has existed for years. Remember, he didn't become president until January 20, 1969. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene is uphill landing in the jungle. Air America pilots put airplanes in places where aircraft designers never thought possible. Their plenty of funny stories that could be shown. Instead, the director decided to use an oversized rubber scene to show how much the CIA was stupid. This scene shows that the director and writer fell on some pilot bar to talk and the joke is on them. MDS Fort Valley, Virginia.
