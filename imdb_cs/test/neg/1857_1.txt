When I say worse, I think less fun. Todd Sheets seems to have learned some silly tricks since the last Zombie Bloodbath that makes the film even less tolerant. There was no special camera effects in the last movie, where we were processed into a shaky camera and constantly switched to black and white. It is also called Zombie Bloodbath, despite the fact that zombies are hardly in this. The film begins in 1945, when some satanists kill a violent thief and put it as a scarecrow. In modern times, some children have a problem with the car and go to the house, to the same house where Satanic murder happened. Some people try to rape children (or something) and bring thief thieves back to life, who will return with some zombies and now speak like Darth Vader. Mr. Sheets language has spread and reduced violence. If you want to see what a bad movie is, check it out! <br /> <br /> My rating: BOMB / ****. 96 minutes. Not rated, contains violence and language.
