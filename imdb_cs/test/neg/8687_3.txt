Evil Below begins at "Straits San Sebastian 1683" as a treasure of the 17th century ship El Diablo falls in a violent storm. Jump to 'Straits San Sebastian's Day', where two divers are exploring the beautiful underwater coral reefs that are rich in wildlife, bumping into the sunken wreck of El Diablo and exploring, but being attacked and killed by something that looks like a vicious eel. Captain Max Cash (Wayne Crawford) owns and operates a boat rental company called "Vagrant Viking", which is designed for tourists who want to fish, dive and generally explore the islands. Sarah Livingstone (June Chadwick) is an art teacher diving for treasure as a hobby (we all have to do something to spend the time right?), Hires Max and his shy assistant Tracy (Sheri Able) to try find El Diablo and get rich. The discussion of the sunken treasure excites some of the unscrupulous members of the local community, because they avoid criminals and criminals who are paying attention to Max and Sarah that El Diablo has a sinister past, a past that still maintains a supernatural heritage. Even now ... Director: Jean-Claude Dubois, according to IMDb with a little help from Crawford, although the version I only saw in Dubois, I thought Evil Below had some potential and a little different, but unfortunately it is not enough to save itself from sinking to the bottom of the sea like a stone. Arthur Payne's script is all right. Both divers who have been killed by a sea creature, but this opening is NEVER mentioned, the creature NEVER sees again and no more supernatural murders. Evil down then suffers from a serious and terminal case of identity crisis, it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be because there are bits of different genres from underwater adventure, horror, action, thriller, crime and crimes. it even has time to plunge into a mysterious murder and religious nonsense. As a result The Evil Below feels very bitty, fragmented and because the best scene in the whole movie is the introductory sequence I found myself sitting there more and more frustrated by the lack of any consistent horror as it went down quickly & the fact that we'll never see sea ​​creature. The Evil Down is boring, slow, unequal, predictable, stupid and lacks any magic or intelligence, in short The Evil Below does nothing that a good movie has. Director Dubois fails to revive things, although he obviously shot a lot of underwater material as I thought I was watching a National Geographic documentary with all the fish, coral and wildlife footage in general. Forget all gore, some blood stained with water and blood cough is about as bloody as it gets me scared. Technically Evil Below is very basic, it's bland and totally forgettable unlike nice underwater fish photography. This is a point and shoot stuff and as a whole the production values ​​are very low, even the place where it was shot does not look very sunny or attractive. Behavior is bad, but then did you expect something else? Evil Below is a bad movie, it's a basic story everywhere and can't decide what it wants to be & consequently end up like a mess. Add to the low production values, the fact that there is no gore and absolutely minimal horror content that you have with the movie you can best avoid, if your absolutely desperate and even surely there are no better ways to spend 90 plus minutes of your life . .
