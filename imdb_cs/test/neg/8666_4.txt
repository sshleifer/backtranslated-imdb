In 1999, Mansfield Park's adaptation is much better than this seemingly more faithful film. The 1999 movie is animated by many Australian purists, but I admire the work that Rozema has done to make his own Mansfield Park. It may not be strictly Mansfield Park, but at least it was well written, beautifully shot and well occupied. I don't see how Austen's purists can be happier with this 2007 version of ITV (and rebroadcast at Masterpiece Theater / PBS). The scenario is delicately glued and crazy to the shoe, the production values ​​are bland and the cast (except Jemmy Redgrave and Blake Ritson) is largely guilty of misconduct. I can't think of the worst miscast than Billie Piper as Fanny Price. Her appearance was absolutely bad (faded hair and dark eyebrows?) And her talent was simply not suitable for material. Sir Thomas seemed to be constipated all the time. Michelle Ryan as Mariah was on autopilot as well as actors who portrayed Crawfords (when I think how excellent Alessandro Nivola and Embeth Davidtz were in the '99 version, I just shook my head a little). I haven't seen the 1983 version, so I can't comment on it, but I'd advise anyone who is curious to give the '99 a chance. Read the novel before or after and create your own mind.
