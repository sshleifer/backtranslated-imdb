Okay, now I've seen George Zucco in at least four separate horror / thrilling films lately when I tried to go through 50 different collection packages, and I have to say that the guy was limited in scope, but he was in what was good. did. He wasn't Karloff, but the CLK was lucky to have him. But the poor guy was imprisoned in a horror movie ghetto, and he wasn't good enough to take them to the next level of interest. - Short scenarios and overheads and budgets under which he worked. That's the case. This film is, very well, slower, embarrassed and inexorable. The "heroine" seems to be doomed to become a version of Judy Garland, who is the center of rent, the "hero" is as bland as white rice, and the poor man who plays the monster doesn't even have a good transformation scene. store. His make-up effects are not scary at all - he looks like a rather furry version of a farmer's hand, that's all. It is not a complete waste. Zucco looks good on the camera, eats the scenery and at the same time can bring some terribly affected and fanciful speeches without spinning or losing flow. There and there are some whimsical black and white shots that don't suck. So everything in fact ... this movie has helped some "C" to "Z" players pay the rent for the next month and never drops below a certain level of quality. Watch it once if you like George Zucco, or just feel the need to see every wolfman-themed movie ever made.
