Probably not the same version as most other reviewers because there is no real hard sex. What do people think under the hard core? Some explicit hard sex to see in the movies starring Traci Lords and "Big" John Holmes? Still, it's a really bad movie, I doubt I've ever seen so many great actors wasted in the movie. The script is really poor and clueless, directing and cinematography is terrible and editing doesn't exist. It's a really horrible movie. You can watch it ten times and you still don't understand what the hell it is. The only unforgettable scene is where people are buried in the neck, and a giant lawnmower comes along with them. Yes, you read it right, the movie in Roman times has a scene with a chopped head mower! <br /> <br /> Trivia point. Many years ago, the pirated copy of The Thing (1982 version) made bicycle rentals on my island and was copied to CALIGULA rental tape, which means that the pirate version of THE THING begins with the first few seconds of CALIGULA man and woman walking through the forest then the sequence title begins. That led the people who saw the pirate tape to believe in the forest scene, the opening of John Carpenter's 1982 movie and were very confused about what it meant. Well that's what you get for hiring pirate videos. But when I saw all of Caligula, I don't know what that means
