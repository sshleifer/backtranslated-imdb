He watched this movie with an audience total ... 5! She had a choice between Lakshya and Asambhava ... (I realized I was going to Lakshhya). Typical land ... India in Pakistan .. but just not cricket as you have Kashmir in the middle. The Indian super hero goes on a mission to rescue the President of India from some Pakistani insurgents who are involved in mass drug trafficking. I left the movie half as it was just boring and the plot was confusing and everywhere. The songs were also terrible, the film tries to hide the flaws with its special effects, but unfortunately they are too outdated. <br /> <br /> Overall ... Avoid, if you can, be the worst movie I 've seen this year.
