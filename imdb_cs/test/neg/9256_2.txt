Of all the movies I could choose, it had to be this. When I was last in New York, I went to Times Square and I chose Joel M. Reeds Bloodsucking Freaks (1976) from the hundreds of DVDs on a double-function DVD that included Seeds of Sin (1968). I'm sorry? Read on to find out. The film opens on an island (near Staten Island in Milligan), where two lovers walk along with a massive parasol apparently made of paper, giving it a gift as a gift in one place. Colin (Hal Borske), a retarded hunchback, suddenly emerges and kills both of them unreasonably. After the initial credits, which are associated with one of the worst headaches I have ever heard, I have at least got used to it because it is constantly used throughout the movie, we are introduced to three couples. Wives are all sisters, Vicky (Ann Linden) and Ricard (Fib LaBlaque), Veronica (Eileen Hayes) and Bill (Don Williams) plus Elizabeth (Carol Vogel) and Donald (Richard Ramos). Each of them receives a letter from lawyer H. Dobbs (Neil Flanagan) who asks for a meeting to read his late father's will. Dobbs informs them that they have to spend three days in 'Crenshaw House' and fill it with 'sexual harmony and love', which they never knew because of the tense relationship between their father and mother. Informs couples that the will is very irregular but legal. After three days the inheritance will be settled. Couples are also told about servants, Martha (Veronica Radburn), Hattie (Maggie Rodgers) and retarded Colin, who welcomes couples by killing and biting pieces from the rabbit in front of them. Later in the night, left of a dead rabbit, he is in one of the pairs of beds, noting that "blessed are humble because they inherit". This begins with a series of events that end in terrible murder and reveal dark family secrets. Co-written, photographed and directed by talented Andy Milligan. It's a horrible movie in every way. Let's just go through some of his mistakes. Music, it's horrible and induces headache. Sound, you barely hear what characters are saying, and some scenes have no sound effects and at certain points you can hear Milligan screaming orders to their actors, oh, and there is also a constant hiss on the soundtrack. Negotiations, probably among the worst I've ever seen. Very extraordinary effects, Colin puts somebody in the opening sequence, it's the size of a tennis ball, the part where someone is tied and my stomach open with the saw looks really awful as the hands and feet are cut off. Photography, Milligan has absolutely no idea of ​​how to stage or film the scene, regularly cut to the top, bottom or sides of the people's head and face the screen, and his camera jerks and shakes around him like someone who is constantly on stumbles. There is also at least one scene so poorly thought out and filmed that a crew member is seen. Often the film is so dark that you don't see what's going on. Editing, again some of the worst I've ever seen, seem to cut off the scenes before they finish, while the characters are in the middle of a sentence. The script, if one was credited to both Milligan and Hal Sherwood (It took two people to write it!?) Is everywhere and is incredibly stupid. There is one incredibly bad succession when a killer follows a victim down the basement, the killer walks behind him, the potential victim turns around in one place. What does a killer do to avoid being spotted? Boys straight out of him, killers close enough to give boys oral sex, but he doesn't notice them right in front of him. You have to see this sequence to believe it, I still can't believe what I saw. The bizarre parcels just happen and then disappear completely, check the scene when Richard has to borrow money from his brother Walter (producer and co-founder of Hal Sherwood), who turns out to be a gay priest with his incestuous relationship. brother before he was married! Strange scene that there is no reason at all. Martha, the housekeeper, responds to the first murder, bothered by the fact that she is fired from the dinner schedule! There's also a crazy insane dialogue, Patty and Martha discussing Colin, Patty says, "If I didn't beat him so hard," Martha responds sympathetically with "You must Patty, you must!" And don't start on how ugly the wallpaper looks in the whole house! The only good thing I can think of is to say that the costumes look reasonable, for the time they're supposed to be planted. Maybe I could go all day about how amateur it is, but I think you have that idea. One to avoid if your serious masochist! Unfortunately, unfortunately, I didn't say I bought or watched.
