I watched the first 10 minutes and it bored me to death. So I progressed forward to the end. This film must be the worst of all low budget science fiction categories. Bad Gaming, Cast, Directions, Lara Craft Custom Imitation, Story, Conspiracy, Everything! Throughout the film, I think there are only 6 to 7 people in the entire cast, but ONLY two of them have started throughout the movie. I was expecting something like a Trooper starship, but it was nothing. I was confused with the title of the movie and the picture on the DVD cover. Don't waste your time watching this boring and bad movie. Think about it, I wonder why they even bother to make bad movies like this?
