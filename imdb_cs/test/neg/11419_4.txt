Other than that, the characters from the first movie and gave them more backstory. Basically, Lucian Lycan (werewolf) fell in love with Sonia Vampire, the Romeo and Juliet scenarios you know will end badly if you saw the first movie. So with absolutely no tension, we commit ahead with two hours of constant CGI and actors with little or no presence on the screen. Everything shot in the monotone color of the first movie because nothing was shot in daylight. <br /> <br /> It's worth your time .. probably not. In fact, quality has decreased, even CGI seems to have been cheap, you don't buy per minute that these are real werewolves.
