As a fan of the ZaSu Pitts comedy, I thought it was worth trying. I was quite disappointed. <br /> <br /> (The version I saw was on TCM, but consisted only of Niagara Falls, Miss Polly was missing.) The performers' talents are a waste of one of the stupidest stories I ever had when I met him. Summerville (Sam Sawyer), who, if he has any talent, has not shown it here. ZaSu Pitts (Elly Sawyer) is great but not big enough. The biggest laugh in the movie is when they're under Sam under the table. The only one in the movie that makes any sense is Tom Wilson. Margie (Marjorie Woodworth) is generally unreasonable. Although physically very attractive, her personality and attitudes make her completely undesirable. Elly, Sam, and the hotel desk clerk are just complete fools. Sam and Elly give up their honeymoon at a crowded hotel for Tom and Margie. But then they take it back. Sam finally jams Tom and Margie in their room. Most of the movie is that they try to break out, but Sam, using a rifle, always puts them back. At the end comes the worst part. Tom, who is finally about to escape, runs to the Minister on the lower floor of the hotel. Now the guy who, as I said, is the only one in the whole movie who has his head on his shoulders, suddenly, for no reason at all, decides to marry Margie! He pulls the minister into the room he just ran from, but Margie doesn't want to marry him. She gives her a kiss, and now, one kiss, she feels compelled to marry him. Finally, Sam has the courage to tell Tom: "You deceived me," when it's practically the only line Tom had to Sam before, "We're not married," Sam replied, "Do you think I believe that?" Idiotic.
