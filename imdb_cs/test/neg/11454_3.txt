Cimarron, like many movies from the early days of sound, must be seen as a historical interest rather than a convincing pastime. Hammy's acting actor Richard Dix, best-nominated, can be excused as a relic of the silent film school of acting. However, even though they give rise to doubts, Cimarron is a poorly shaped piece of drama - a bloated film that moves from an unrelated sequence to an unrelated sequence with little dramatic impact. The film is officially two hours and four minutes; You feel like four hours of watching him. There is no reason to waste time on it if you do not want to see every Best Picture winner or you are very interested in early sound days. In my opinion, Cimarron is the worst choice for the best picture in academic history and the prize was to go to City Lights or Little Ceasar. Cimarron is barely remembered today and would have remembered him if he hadn't won for his Oscar.
