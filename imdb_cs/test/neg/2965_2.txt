Glory did something special. It was not the only musical that was originally created for the screen (most are based off Broadway musicals), but it spawned the television series and Broadway musical. Correct the sentence. Fame is not a musical. Musicals have song numbers to advance to the storyline or feelings of the characters. Singing in this music is not used to do either; in fact, there is nothing at all. People just sing randomly to fit into a conspiracy. And that's not the kind of musical I know. The so-called Fame Conspiracy has the onslaught of characters (who are all introduced once - I last saw it in [Gosford Park] that had disastrous results) who compete and get into, New York High School for Theater art. They are all for a variety of reasons - ie. acting, singing, etc. The drama of courage unfolds when these middle-aged people pretending to be teenagers go through four years. My biggest complaint is that high school is supposed to be selective. After all, it's a free college, and they can't let everyone in. So how come some people who are really bad get to college? Of course, the drama could arise among all these different people. And why is the person above charged even in the movie to the end, without any reason, except that we feel uncomfortable? There are a lot of worrying situations that these uncomfortable people get, but they don't feel bad for them because you don't know who they are! These relationships occur among people whose names you don't know. And these characters are aware of things about themselves during the movie, but you don't realize it because you don't know what it was like. As far as singing is concerned, it will appear at random (and is it to be funny?) and does nothing. When the title song is sung, it is played in the middle of the street and before you can say it is Ferris Bueller each in the middle of the street, wild and off-beat. The song itself is fine, but the whole scene, like the whole movie, is useless. Fame is an unpleasant film, at least. I'd say more, but most of the movie fortunately came out of my head. I do not see it. You'll do a favor. <br /> <br /> My rating: 2/10 <br /> <br /> R rating for language.
