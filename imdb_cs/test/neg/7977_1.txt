I bought this rental for $ 1.99 in hollywood and overpaid. I didn't expect much, but I thought it would be something that would at least fall asleep. I quickly noticed a very weak storyline, gross exaggeration by everyone (nobody speaks like this except cartoons) and seemingly let's-make-it-up-as-we-go-along direction. I know the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed, and I feel that it has not helped any career. When it comes to this 35-year-old film enthusiast, she has now prepared the answer to the worst movie you've ever seen. <br /> <br />
