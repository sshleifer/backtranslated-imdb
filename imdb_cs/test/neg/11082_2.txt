Cavern: 2 of 10: The Blair Witch meets the cave and gives me a headache. <br /> <br /> To ask all film schools, could you please teach future directors how to hold the camera firmly. Moving the camera around like Aunt Betty with 12 drinks causes headache. Also film is primarily a visual medium directors may want to show their cameras in the general direction of action. The film also requires light work. You might want to use a light source so you can see action on the screen. I know it's a cave movie, but there's nothing scary to watch the darkness of the pitch for a few minutes at a time. <br /> <br /> The fact that the film is pointing upside-down does not mean confusion on the screen. editorial stand. Last director's note: I'm sure there's a good reason to have a terribly fake CGI campfire. I honestly can't think of one for my life. Now on the screenwriter. Try to make at least one character sympathetic. I prefer two or more, but one decent person I can take root or take care of. Also, if you are going to have flashbacks make them relevant to the story. <br /> <br /> If you have a surprising end, it's probably best if it doesn't interfere with every thing that comes before it. And try adding some fantastic spelunking terms to the cave movie. Maybe you wanted to start with spelunking. The Cavern is a pretty bad movie, badly filmed with confusing, unlikely and anticlimactic ending.
