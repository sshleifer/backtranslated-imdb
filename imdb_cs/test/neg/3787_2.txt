Quite awful, but not completely unnoticeable. Another review mentioned "predictable" - and that is almost underestimated. You can make a game of guessing what will be the next line. Each character is either stereotypical or archetypic. A good guy in a bad situation, a struggle between an elder and a younger priest about acceptance and discipline, a repressed, sexually / emotionally neglected woman who returns to a small town after failing in a big city, engaged to a helpless, weak-minded beau from youth, indestructible bad guys , two "lost boys" looking for a sense of family - all here, and none of them even with the furthest rotation of something new. From the first few minutes you can find out exactly what will happen to the movie's end. The story is not completely lame, but the direction, playing (even from casting with some talent) is all thrown without skill. As for the story, we've all seen it in a movie called "Sister Act." This is also one of those films where the inattention of small details appears in even brighter light. (As an example: a nurse and our hero are leaving for a city, but parked a few blocks away from their destinations (post office and hardware store) - but both go through empty car parks for no apparent reason, which should appear in half an hour, the film is filled with such things and then it is tagged for unlikely denouement.
