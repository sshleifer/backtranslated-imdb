I went to this movie and expected to hope to break out from the seventies in the 1970s, but what I got was rather bizarre pseudo-western with too much talking and not enough action. It is clear that this film was made from the budget; Places are drab and poorly shot, while acting leaves much to be desired. The story focuses on three robbers (father and two sons) who, after killing some miners, steal the gold load. They come across the cabin occupied by a young girl and her stepmother ... and all that in the flashbacks is told by a young girl who is currently living in asylum. It is clear that directors Louis Leahman and William Sachs thought they were doing something really shocking; but despite his best efforts, the South of Hell Mountain is too boring to shock the viewer. The film is about eighty minutes long and most of it consists of boring characters that are based on a boring and prolonged dialogue. The only good thing I have to say about the movie is with regard to music; which is good in places. The end is the only other good thing about the movie; And that's just because it's the last thing that happens. I wouldn't recommend to anyone who watched it ... in the 1970s there was much better waste.
