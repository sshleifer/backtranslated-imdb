I usually love "Stranger In" thrillers. Some good examples are "Fatal Attraction", "Single White Female" and "Audition". Well, they can be a lot of fun, and they're worth an hour or two fixed shocks and scares. Of course, the opposite can be true: poorly executed, can be tedious and stupid. "The hand that jumps the cradle" is one of these. Bartels, Claire (Annabella Sciorra) and Michael (Matt McCoy) welcome another member of their family. But busy Claire is convinced Michael to hire a nanny. One day a woman named Peyton Flanders (Rebecca DeMornay) appears, and since she seems perfect, Bartels hires her. As they appear, their idyllic life slowly falls apart ... <br /> <br /> This film suffers from a plethora of problems, but the biggest thing is the manipulation of the villain. Peyton is never believable. Part of it has to do with how it is written and how it behaved. The things that should put us on the edge are so fanciful that they are ridiculous. De Mornay doesn't help much. He draws Peyton as two different people. While it is true to be the perfect nurse while hiding her psychotic tendencies, De Mornay's performance creates a division between two aspects of her character. But the other actors are good. Annabella Sciorrra is amazing as an asthmatic Claire. Sciorra is very natural in this role, but unfortunately, the script leaves her down. Matt McCoy is almost invisible. However, Julianne Moore is nice as Claire's girlfriend Marlene. Moore is a fireworks display, but unfortunately it is only on the screen for a total of five minutes. Curtis Hanson is a good director, but you don't know you can watch him. The movie has some decent shocks, but it's a bad pace, and the climax that creates some tension is actually a bit ridiculous. As already mentioned, he works with a scenario that at best can be positively called pathetic. Believe me when it comes to nannies, stick to Fran Drescher. He should go to a directory with direct video transmission.
