Step Up is a fair dance movie about some kids who have a great performance. The film is average in every way with a little more for the viewer. Jock struggles with external prejudices to become a dancer with a perfect partner and a teacher who sees something special. Behavior was fine, but dialogue and direction had little to overcome a predictable story. Yet you still feel pretty good about the film's result. There were some dark scenes and some typical generalizations about dancers who went a little overboard. This is a class B + movie with slight errors of continuity and disaster. The scenery was good and the characters were faithful to life. Worth Watching If You Like This Movie.
