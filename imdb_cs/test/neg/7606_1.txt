I made the mistake of watching "Dark Star" (1974) late at night many years ago. It was one of the stupidest movies I've ever watched: <br /> <br /> 1. Bad behavior. <br /> <br /> 2. Bad writing. <br /> <br /> 3. Scientifically stupid plot. (Destruction of the whole planet because its orbit is unstable or just going to get worse on the way: instead of having one large, easy-to-avoid object, you'll have thousands of smaller but equally deadly and more difficult objects to watch.) <Br / > <br /> 4. Completely unrealistic characters. Painted beach ball as an extraterrestrial space? Writers had to do too many drugs. No wonder most of the actors who played in "Dark Star" never did anything else. Of those who did something else, most of them never did the Dark Star again. Therefore, having Dark Star on one's acting biography was a deadly star for one's acting career!
