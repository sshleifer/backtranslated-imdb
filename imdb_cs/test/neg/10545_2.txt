the first film of toxie was dark, bloody and hillarious. This film is an impatient battle to enjoy jazz music, without gore and the worst mask I've ever seen! His deep voice is now a light, happy voice, the characters in the first part appear in actors who look like NEVER (Claire, Mom Junko), the characters' names change (Claire or Sara?). He lacks brutal violence, dark humor and political misstatement of the first film. If it wasn't for nudity, this movie could be rated PG. Really lame. I'm a huge part 1 fan though, I just can't build this one.
