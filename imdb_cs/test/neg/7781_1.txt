If you want a complete waste of time because pulling the fluff out of your belly button or cleaning your wax from your ears or pairing tiles is your idea of ​​carnival thrill ride, then you won't want to miss this. br /> <br /> For one thing, forget the VHS cover. No body in this movie seems attractive (ie Indian girl). Someone else said that anyone who would stand on the envelope is not the same girl and I agree. The cover is the most interesting thing about this movie. To put it in perspective, I bought this VHS for 99 cents for K-Mart and three minutes, no, 40 seconds for the movie, I knew I was ripped off. I finished it with observation, because 1) After all, I paid 99 cents and 2) maybe it could be, maybe it would be a chance that some scene in this turkey was worth it than a tight loaf. <br /> <br /> Not. Good sadness, Fonda. I know you did it when you did it, but this is under you.
