I wanted this movie, but there is very little about it. It starts with Jean Stapleton and Randy Newman's song in Iowa (I think it's Northwest Iowa), reminiscent of Norman Lear's cold Turkey, which IMDb was one of the best movies ever made. So far so good. And the idea of ​​Archangel Michael living at Pansy Milbank Motel on Earth? Well, give him a chance to be a comedy. All right, all right. But Michael does things that an angel would never fall, would never do, and that would totally throw away any credibility a film might have. Other characters in the movie don't have much to ask. Michael brings the dog back to life and we should be in awe. People make songs from hardy countries. Eventually, Stapleton dances with Travolta. Big deal. Had she been smart, she wouldn't have been in this movie. When it ended, I thought, "Gee, what a stupid, tasteless, boring, ugly, sacred movie!" It is not advisable for children or anyone else to see it.
