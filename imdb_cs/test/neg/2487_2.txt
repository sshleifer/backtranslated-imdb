An anticipated documentary that seeks to explore science fiction films of the 1950s and how they influenced America. Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, Ridley Scott and James Cameron are interviewed and Mark Hamill tells the story. <br /> <br /> Pretty awful. These insights are nothing new - for example, the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war have hit a whole generation of children. Okay, duh! He tries to cover all the different sub-genres of science fiction films of the fifties - big bug movies, space movie attackers, etc. Etc. That's good, but they pick the most visible movies and they've been over analyzed to death already. It was great to see clips from "Rocketship XM", "Destination Moon", "The Forbidden Planet", "The Thing" and "The Day the Earth Stosed Still", but all the directors said was so incredibly clear to the viewer it offensive. Even though it is less than an hour, I was thoroughly bored for 30 minutes. This gets 2 clips, but nothing else.
