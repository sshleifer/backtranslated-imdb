Don't bother checking logic. Is none. But on the other hand, I have really great movies that completely lack logic, so why bother? <br /> <br /> I like and don't like this movie. I like it because action sequences in the air are really great, you'll see a lot of fighting. I also like the F-16, which is a very cool plane. But there are too many to really enjoy it. I think it is not fair to wish there was some kind of continuity because it is hard to make a really good fighter movie - but I also think there should be some sense of reason. I have a question: do they fly from California to the Middle East in the F-16 without refueling? I'd like to see that happening.
