Asmali Konak has probably become one of Turkey's best TV series. Thanks to his unique cinematography and visual approach to filming, the series has gained a broad base with continuous record ratings. Personally, I do not agree with the singers who become actors (ie Ozcan Deniz - the main actor), but I think the characters speak for themselves. In the context of the film, it was disgusting to see how much someone could destroy such a conspiracy. Years in this film, this film was able to oversee every story of the descent that existed within the series. Not only were cultural mistakes unacceptable, with an idiotic scene involving family members dancing (Greek style) and breaking plates, which nowhere exist in Turkish culture. Some claim that the film should be taken as a separate film not as a sequel to the TV series, but this theory has one major downfall, the way the film was sold was that it will pick up where the series left and close the series once for always. . So with this note in mind, I and everyone I know would ask for a refund and accept that they will stand out of the theater to warn other victims.
