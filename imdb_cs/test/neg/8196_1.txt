One night on an independent channel, famous for showing off the wall, this monstrosity was broadcast. Though we are tempted to shut it down, we watched it to the bitter end, hoping to see some semblance of redeeming value. Unfortunately, nothing was. Absolutely nothing. The quality of the film was cheap; the soundtrack was muddy; the cut was ridiculous. Then little was saved again. After a few minutes of the doctor's character, Cameron Mitchell, who talks about his patient, the viewer is tortured by no conspiracy, pathetic writing, unpleasantly horrible action, and complete lack of coherence and continuity. Rotting cherry at the top of this mess was the most horrifying "special effects" and "makeup" to be reflected on the screen at any time, even for television. The main character stumbles through his role in a dimestore rubber mask and a pair of washing gloves that appear to have been submerged in glue and rolled in beads. Perhaps the illumination and the quality of the film movie was going to cover up how bad the tenth strength of makeup was. One can only hope that at least one deliberate decision has been made during this hopelessly amateur video. Seriously, a handful of three-year-olds could create a better project. Poor Mr. Mitchell returns at the end (how desperately he must have been for the money!) And cast out some nonsense to combine this pile of crap with the AIDS epidemic. Please spare you and your loved ones with the inhuman cruelty of sitting through this. It was so bad that even the Mystery Science Theater 3000 couldn't save it.
