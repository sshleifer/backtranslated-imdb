I'm not sure who has more fun, people who wrote reviews or the film's director. I couldn't go longer reading this comment or watching this movie, I had to say something. I see a low budget Western movie that is done with passion and interest in detail, but using a garage with Art Deco inscriptions, pastel colors, actors who look like they sleep because the script is so boring and the boom gets on the road camera every two scenes, which is definitely not my definition of "one of the best Western movies created in the new millennium". <br /> <br /> Please, if any of you had friends in the movie, say it!
