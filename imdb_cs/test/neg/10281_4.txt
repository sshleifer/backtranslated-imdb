First Off, I'm a huge fan of Robert Blake, I've always been. This film came to the Film Complex last night on 10/13 and the title captivated me and of course the star. But after I watched it, I was more confused than I was before it started .... There are some good scenes, and I thought they were going somewhere, but they didn't, it turned out to be "anti" -cop "" anti-buddy "" anti-hippie ", almost" anti-all film ", with an extremely confusing plot that also went nowhere. Robert Blake is great as a leader, just as big as someone might be with this bad movie, I'm still a huge fan of Mr. Blake and I love his gambling in such a stupid way ... impudence, well ... keep away from this ... And the end of what shit.
