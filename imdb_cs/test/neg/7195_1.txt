It appeared on a DVD that my friend bought for me. They had it listed as "Savage Guns" which was a completely different film. Obviously, people who packed DVDs never bothered to look at what burns on the disc. Anyway, this movie is about as bad as it comes. The soundtrack is a combination of TV Batman / Early James Bond / Spaghetti Western. Lots of galloping around this music. The guy seems to have galloping between scenes to burn some time and give people a sound track of doing something. I wish it was a little worse, and then it would have some feelings for Ed Wood's movies. How it is, it's just awful.
