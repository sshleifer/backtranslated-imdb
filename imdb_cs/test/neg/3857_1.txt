I can't believe there are people who voted 10 for this waste! Did any of you gain access to a computer in a madhouse where you are undoubtedly held, or is there a special colony where people who do not know about them are secretly imprisoned? <br /> <br /> If I were to say what I really thought about this movie, none of it would be released. If you want to start with your star, it's not a talent idiot that behaves like a bad publisher, Jim Carrey, who has enough of the Angel dusted his nose to recover in the Sahara desert. His name will be an absolute guarantee that in the future I will not be watching a future film - even if he plays on a rock hidden by the crowd. <br /> <br /> As for 'conspiracy'. One more crime we can attach to the Nazis is that they were so terrible that they could be considered a fair game as "baddies" in the trio; mere criminals and murderers would have viewers on their side in trice. <br /> <br /> To the people who made this film - give up movies and if not, limit yourself to creating ads where your efforts will at least have the virtue of being fleeting in duration. Finally, Criticism of IMDB - Why Don't You Vote for 'Zero' for a Movie? Or maybe not. To express my contempt for this impudence, I would have to vote twice or something.
