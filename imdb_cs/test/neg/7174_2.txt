This is a terrible re-make a very good movie called "Up In The Air" starring Frankie Darrow, Mantan Moreland and Marjorie Reynolds. I was only able to get about 20 minutes before I turned it off. Almost all lines are identical, I have no idea why they would do the movie again. I totally disagree with the previous post that doesn't like the song (that's the same thing), in the original singing is the first course, I'm not sure if Marjorie Reynolds actually did her own singing, it's hard to say because vocals were usually added later, and songs They are very good, surprising in the "B" movie. If you have a chance to see the original it is available on DVD. You will be pleasantly surprised.
