The bipolarity of this film is crazy. One moment it makes fun of Latin America, American tourists and banana republics in general, the other wants to be touching, with burned villages and orphans. Even a serious revolutionary hero becomes a revolutionary parody in one place. However, parts of the comedy aren't even funny because it's probably stolen from Star Wars. Yes, Star Wars, the "hero" is basically a villain with a heart of gold. Add to this stereotypical sound effects, Latin Americans who speak English together, and the villain who simply disappears from the story. And what's the point? It is essentially revolutionary, no-resolution propaganda and no planning (because there is no way these people can lead the country). The US government is bad, but who's going to earn it? He's not a poor farmer, that's for sure.
