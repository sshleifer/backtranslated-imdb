There is only one word that describes this movie: BAD !! I have no idea why this movie was even made, or how it got into this movie, Dennis Hopper. Stuart Gordon is a better director than this and Hopper is a much better actor. The film is simple stupid. I liked the idea of ​​"square pigs" and there was an interesting love scene with a cyborg, in addition to avoiding this film at all costs.
