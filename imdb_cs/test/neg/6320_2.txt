In the opening sequence "Where is Poppa?" George Segal gets out of bed one morning, shaves, showers, puts on a gorilla outfit and walks into his mother's bedroom, realizing later that we give her a massive heart attack that kills and pulls her out of life forever. This is the level of humor that can be expected from most of this image: madness, mixed with what might be considered morbid daring. Segal plays a New York attorney who lives with his supposedly senile mother (Ruth Gordon), whose life is even more complicated when she meets a girl with her girlfriend who takes care of her old bag of Dreams, Pleasantly Proud of Trish Van Devere, Decorated as Florence Nightingale. His dilemma: how to integrate a beautiful nurse into the life of his annoying mother. Segal's performance is about the only thing that keeps the picture together. His frustration, his reaction, his comic timing is almost reckless (what happened to that guy?); where the film fails, it is in other areas. The characterization of Ruth Gordon is terrible as a mother. At first you can't figure out whether her nature is senile or just deliberately vague to leave her son. At the end it is clear that it is just a nut. When Segal brings Van Devere home to meet her, Gordon's brow furrows and she gets a mean, sinister look. He wants the intruder to be removed in his son's life; counts. This is not the way of a senile person. You are not getting consistent performance throughout the image, which is probably the director's error (Carl Reiner) as well as Gordon's error. Ruth Gordon's old lady in "Rosemary Baby" is much more successful because with the kind of grumpy, cloning person Ruth Gordon generally plays, the audience reacts to it as annoying. But when Mia Farrow is too shy to defend herself, Gordon becomes more cloying, her fangs deeper and deeper, and we're scared for Farrow; This kind of storage is really scary. Here we are asked to laugh at what we would normally find uncomfortable, and if Gordon had been playing so helplessly all the time, we could. But she is also selfish and so is, and it dampens what's little humor. However, there are some good laughs. The courtroom scene with Barnard Hughes as a military officer and Rob Reiner as a contraultur punk is quite cheerful, and Vincent Gardenia will make a nice turn as a Lombardieque football coach. There is also an inspired piece where Segal's brother (Ron Liebman), who was stripped of naked muggers on their way to where they segal, asks him for something to wear at home - and he gives him a gorilla outfit. But a lot of the script is badly designed and just doesn't make sense. Why is a New York lawyer with his own practice at home first? Why Segal, if his mother is senile, tries to think logically: "If you spoil it for me, I will crush your heart." Why does Liebman still walk through the park when he knows he'll get? Why would he take a taxi after leaving Segal with the gorilla clothes? Why didn't he take taxis? The funniest would be Liebman, like a gorilla, terrorizing muggery. Why Does Van Devere Return - After her first husband was a kook, why does he want to join this bunch? I suppose if I gave it to Carl Reiner, he would say, "These are crazy people, they don't make sense." Which is a convenient way to excuse a lousy script that is full of holes. The immediate behavior of the characters does not necessarily make sense, but their motivation, and that is where "Where is Poppa?" rozpad√° se; situations are created just to have a gag, and gags are mostly disposable, do nothing. Carl Reiner is the most guilty of this whole fiasco. How he gained this acclaimed reputation as a pillar of riddle comedy me; his career basically consisted of holding a microphone in front of Sid Caesar and Mel Brooks when they were entertaining with funny voices. His son Rob has ten times more skills and intelligence as a director. In terms of show-biz, Reiner pushes buttons; the monkey could do her job. And this is most evident in his framing action. Why is all New York shot in close and close shots, but the scenes in the country are distant and panoramic? This is director Carl Reiner's mentality, claustrophobic for the city, space for the country. In the final crazy scene of old people at home, the camera is so far away, you can't even find out what's going on. The sudden end suggests a resolution that Segal could easily get ninety minutes ago; it also suggests that Reiner couldn't figure out how to end the picture. So it just shortened it, as another example of "madness". Reiner seems to think that stupidity equals madness, and insanity without logic is always funny. It's not, and the creators of "Where is Poppa" are as demented as Ruth Gordon, who says Pepsi in her fruit loops.
