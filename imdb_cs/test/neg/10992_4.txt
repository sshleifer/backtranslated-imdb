You know, this is one of those "emperor's new dress" movies. It's like, so out of the wall and weird that you're SUPPORTED to make you enjoy it if you're really in the movie. Well, I think it's bologna. Such films, which are hidden under the cloak of Dada or surrealism, make me nuts. Some people have this bad dream, maybe brought to Bologna the aforementioned bed just before bedtime, remembers most of them (unfortunately), and then puts it on film and we all should admire their creative genius. Sometimes I also have bizarre dreams that don't make sense, but I don't feel the need to put them on film, expose them to everyone else and call it art. Strangeness in itself does not mean something interesting. A true Dada or surrealistic expression has its intention and intellectual thought. If others don't get it, it doesn't mean it's deep, it's just incomprehensible. Bizarre for bizarre sake, for me, not good, let alone big, art. And comparing "Tuvalu" with "Delicatesen" is like comparing "Godfather I & II" with "Godfather III" - the same genre, not in the same league.
