Not only do the effects and play in this movie bite, but the story was horrible. The scientist finds that a comet fragment hits the moon ... world leaders ignore him ... he builds shelter ... then everyone is upset that "plays God". <br /> <br /> How lame! Did he build up why everyone is "authorized" to access it? Totally lame story, don't waste your time!
