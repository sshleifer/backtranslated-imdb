George Zucco was like Boris Karloff in fact, no matter how poor the movie he appeared in, he would always keep a sense of dignity and turn into great performance. "The Mad Monster" is no exception to this rule. It is in all standards a poor (if entertaining) movie. The creators apparently did not know how to make the most of their low budget, and the scenario seems to have happened in one or two days. Yet Zucco is fine and believable as a mad scientist. The film itself is pleasant at the camp level. Normally, horror movie fans will not like the PRC movies. However, these "Poverty Row" productions have a small but loyal cult following. Occasionally, their limitations would emerge, arguing that a "detour" is the best example. They usually looked like this. For all its technically bad features, "The Mad Monster" is a fun enough way to kill a rainy afternoon. The Retromedia DVD is recommended because it is paired with another PRC production "The Black Raven", the original theater trailer, and the best of all Glenn Strange talks about his role in this film. (4/10)
