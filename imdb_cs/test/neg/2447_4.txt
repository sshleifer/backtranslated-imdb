Standard "Outbreak disease in remote areas; an expert who happens to be on holiday in this area takes care of" film. There are only a few deviations from the norm. One is that the children involved are quite reasonable from the beginning. Usually, they are monsters that repeatedly chew works until they finally buy. Next is that a local medicine man / doctor witch, who is usually an obstacle at the beginning, is never completely discounted or redeemed at the end. Maybe because it seemed to be created for a faithful PAX channel, they didn't want to seem too credible about believers. Finally, there were no evil local politicians / free-time commanders trying to cover the whole thing up. The lack of these stereotypes has been refreshing - if we believe we thank for the PAX channel, I may have to try a few more of their offers. Besides, it was pretty standard stuff. You've seen it all before.
