Whoever wrote the screenplay for this film probably never consulted on Lucille Ball's books, especially her autobiography. I've never seen so many bugs in biopsy, from her early years in Celoron and Jamestown to her later years with Desi. I could write a whole list of factual errors, but that would continue on the site. I believe Lucille Ball is one of those inimitable people who simply cannot be portrayed by anyone other than themselves. If I was Lucie Arnaz and Desi, Jr., I'd be upset about how many bugs were in this movie. The filmmakers tried, but the film seems horribly sloppy.
