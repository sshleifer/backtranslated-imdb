This movie came as a huge disappointment. The Anime series ended with a rather stupid plot and a hasty introduction of a pretty lame rascal, but I expected Shamballa to tie all the loose ends. Unfortunately, no. It added more plot holes than it solved, and confused more than it clarified. Animation and voice playing were great, but with an idiotic plot, boring settings (most of the film doesn't even take place in the dark WWII Earth than in the world of alchemy) and the unsatisfactory ending (Ed is wasted for the rest of its world) days in a world without alchemy, and he dug Winry?), It was quite bland. Do yourself a favor-- ignore the last half of the anime just like this movie and read the manga.
