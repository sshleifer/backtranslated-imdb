If you asked me 1 month ago how it would be a movie, I would probably be out of it, but I'm a fan and like any fan I visit movie sites, often when Super Troopers came out, I visited this site after DVD release and was Addicted Yea is a difficult place to stay on, but the good ones are usually like good families stick together. What story does this company / comedy troops have.BEGGING people come and see there movies on the corners of streets, universities, anywhere they can, and all for free and after all, to develop a great fan base after several years that CRAP on IT and opt for Close there websites that helped them, and was created for fans, but the worst thing about it .... They didn't say any of it. They just decided they were better than us, wanting new fans not fans who helped them get where they were. The still intelligent crew they released the best Super Troopers movie and noticed that they all had the attention and thank God for having sucked in everything else. Good for you way to go to the mainstream, just remember when you realize that your material is not so good and you have no new fans. FANS ARE WHO ARE NOT OTHER WAY. Never burn your bridges
