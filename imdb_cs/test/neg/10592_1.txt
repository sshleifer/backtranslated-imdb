Mod Squad is not a movie, it's an emptiness. Is that the most interesting thing about it and the thing that followed me? I've never seen a movie that would have offered anything before. It is a film without any reason to exist at all, seemingly consciously designed to appeal to anyone as if it were made purely as a contractual obligation to someone whom the studio really does not like. There is no conspiracy, there is no characterization, there are no scenario action scenes, there are no scenes as such, just the progress of more and more empty shots projected at 24 frames per second. I'm not talking about empty as in a stupid summer blockbuster, but empty as in "We don't have pages yet, so just point the camera at something and stop when you're 90 minutes." You will appreciate the "artistic achievements" of Charlie's Angels and S.W.A.T. much more. What he has to offer is too much Giovanni Ribisi at his wildest executable action, which his bastard son of a thousand morons, who follow the Marlon Brand routine, is Michael Lerner dancing with Omar Epps and? No, that's it. Clare Danes has a pretty smile in one shot. And Dennis Farina makes sense to kill soon. Indeed, the totally absurd film ever made is like L'Humanite without jokes, but, you know, for kids.
