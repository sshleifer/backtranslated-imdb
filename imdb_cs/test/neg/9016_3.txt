WARNING: SPOILERS Dear Roger, <br /> <br /> During your outstanding career you have made a wide range of entertainment, some good, some unrecognizable. The "Night of the Beast Blood" falls into the second category. It's not as incredibly horrible as he says, "The Phantom From 10,000 Leagues" or maybe "The Dunwich Horror". However, one of my greatest criticisms of this movie is that I could do it faster, better, and cheaper. <br /> <br /> Let's start with leading and major titles. Roger, missile sequences look like something from Disney's "Man Into Space", of course not so well. The futuristic rocket aircraft currently doesn't look like anything at all in 1958. Why didn't you just use Vanguard, Atlas or even a Viking? Better yet, why not completely launch the start and start shooting the space and capsule that floats in it? That's what I'd do for you, Roger. Second, why did the ship hit the spaceship? Even a high-school physics student could tell you, your astronaut would come to Earth extremely crispy and largely boneless. I would like to show that your astronaut has become an "obsessed" monster (perhaps using the big "negative / positive" thing you used in "satellite warfare"), losing ground and landing in the wild. It would also explain how a "blood beast" could impregnate your astronaut during the reentry's immense heat, but still be destroyed by fire. Even with these stupid things. The first half of the movie is pretty good. If you spent some money on decent music, it would be as good as the average "Outside Limits" episode. But again, your writer describes Ed Nelson as a landing system designer, then gives him some stupid dialogue about magnetism. The biggest problem of the second half of "The Blood of the Beast" is Michael Emmet. He's terrible as a condemned astronaut. You should have fired him in place and replaced him with Ed Nelson. You could join Nelson's duties with those of John Dunlap and save the cost of one actor. I don't know if you really pay for any of these people; But at least you would save the cost of eating three meals a day. I also tossed the "burnt parrot" costume and used the make-up to make the astronaut a "blood animal". Maybe it was too close to "Creeping Unknown" for you, but that would surely help the pace of the other half. if you have a "blood animal," wouldn't it be good to show some blood? Yeah, I know the title comes from the embryo's blood of an astronaut, but Kowalski could do a better job for you if he poured some chocolate syrup. After all, it looks like blood in black and white. What cost you, maybe two money? I also used some detailed images. For some reason, bad dialogue and bad behavior in details don't look so bad. Watch the almost 70th TV series and see what I mean. Oh, in the end, Roger, a message to his writer. You can't use a fluoroscope to show a bad schmuck full of foreign embryos when you have no electricity. Remember that you fried the generator in the first winch? And I almost forgot. Roger, can't you afford a fake knife? You know, the kind where the blade goes into the handle. I had one of those when I was 9, which also happened that the year "Night of the Blood Beast" was made. \ TIt costs, maybe another two money. I think I knew enough then to make you a better film. I know I know enough now. So, Roger, if you decide to remake "Night of the Blood Beast," or if you're looking for a writer / director to work with you on ANY OTHER PROJECT, I'm your man. I work cheaply, because I'd like to make a movie for you, Roger. I gave the "Night of the Beast" "3". SPECIAL NOTE: If you want to watch kitsch movies like "Night of the Blood Beast", the DVD I bought for $ 3.99 was very good. You can also get "Night of the Blood Beast" along with many other horror horror / scifi movies in places like Bestbuy for about $ 6.
