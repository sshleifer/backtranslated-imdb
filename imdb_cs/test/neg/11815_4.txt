Pam Grier is a super soul sister of the 1970s, appearing in many blaxploitation films that have recently been rediscovered and appreciated by the new generation. I can say for sure that BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA may be the worst movie I've ever seen in Pam Grier. Grier's Lee and Margaret Markov's Karen; they are two prisoners who fled prison after Karen's revolutionary friends attacked a paddy car. The film attaches to itself and the film becomes EMPLOYED ONE for women, but has three separate plots: a fat criminal (Filipino sleaze star Vic Diaz) wants Lee dead, a cowboy rental hunter (excellent Sid Haig) looking for two girls; and Karen's revolutionary friends are looking for her. The film eventually becomes so convoluted and uninvolved with two women that the title should have been MEN CHASING WOMEN. Grier, an action star, has no chance to participate in any of the many (too long) action scenes. Markov is excellent because Karen and Grier are all right as Lee, but both are eventually forgotten in many podplots. One interesting scene is to hire a bounty hunter to force a police officer and his boss to drop their pants so he can shoot the one with the smallest penis (judging by his whore), but is easily forgotten amid all the chaos. BLACK MAMA, WHITE MAMA Starts great as a film in a women's prison, complete with lesbians and a shower scene, then completely switches to a film of persecution. If director Eddie Romero (famous for the director of Filipino horror movies) met with WIP, he would be fine. Instead, BMWM gets a real old real fast and surprise ending just makes the viewer wonder why they sat through a 90-minute movie to end up like this! Another problem: where should the movie be set? While some of the accents are Hispanic and the cities have Spanish names (Los Robles, etc.), all natives are probably Asian! Hmmm ... Recommended only for hard Grier fans who will be disappointed anyway.
