Sorry, Randy. I love your comedy, but in this case you really laid the 'Golden Turkey' egg. The story was thinner than a single layer of my skin, more wooden than the giant Redwood, and I think the direction was nonexistent. Certainly it seemed to be a miserable attempt to take off other films, Jaws and European Holidays, to name just two. <br /> <br /> If my memory serves correctly Eric Idle played the same type of character at Nat Lamp European Vacation, but much better. I wonder if Chevy Chase and Beverley D'Angelo have come closer to continuing this sequel. If so, they certainly knew what they were doing when they turned their parts down. In my opinion, no one can better admire Chevy and Beverley in their roles as Griswolds and Randy Quaid. movies. Randy Quaid should leave National Lampoon while he was ahead of us.
