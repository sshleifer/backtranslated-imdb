Let me make this clear ... "The Church" has a "lock-down" security mechanism that keeps the spirit going, but the final solution is to bring it to the ground! LOFL! Maybe I'm missing a plot. Maybe this guy is from Ed Wood School of Film Making or something. This film is about as useless as the church itself. Hey ... maybe it makes sense. The whole part of Rosemary's Baby-esq was cheerful. I can go to my halloween costume shop and get better drag than that. The entire film must be reworked. Correctly. There were so many things to play ... so many things that could jump out of my seat and ceiling. I'm not sure if the mistake lies in writing or editing, but what I saw should not have this high rating.
