He walked through the television and saw that the Secret Life was on; he gave George Duran a chance to be a host. I know Jim O'Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as he was, but George was boring. He didn't want to be a host; his voice calls were monotonous, not involved with the guests. He seemed to be interviewing guests for Unwrapped, and he just happened to be in the shot. I don't know if George gets "better" to host this show, I doubt it because he now hosted his own show. The show seemed to pack more information, but only because we saw less hosts. The pattern of this show was very delicate and I'm afraid it is now disturbed.
