Brodzki's work is a great example of how NOT to make a film. First, the book was written with great humor. A book that has a lot of fans who would like to give help when the producers decided for the first time to employ people who hardly heard about the book. Then came the script as humorless and full of nonsense. At the same time, the script was written to allow only those who actually read the books to understand any of this plot. It's not that something in this movie makes sense (eg, "I'm like an ice shard. You can burn it," Yennefer said as a warning word - a warning that logic is something that this movie is really missing). To add, it is worth noting that, regardless of the amount of money allegedly spent on film, everything looks like amateur production with two (2) computer effects, one of which is a transparent dragon. Even the costumes seem to be borrowed from a really poor theater. They look better like this. And to add that we have a few "nude scenes" that are there just to be in the movie because they have no explanation about what one can mercifully call a conspiracy. The film has only one power that can hardly catch up with the rest - music is not bad. Though if I had to choose, I'd rather have it separately. It sounds better if you don't have to look at this superproduction failure.
