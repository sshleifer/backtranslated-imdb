"The Cellar" is an unbearably dull and overly friendly 80-year-old cheese parade, directed by Kevin Tenney (creator of much better movies "Witchboard" and "Night of Demons") and plays the incredibly unbelievable Patrick Kilpatrick, allegedly portraying a guy with feelings. The stimulation is really slow, the plot seems too familiar, monster effects are all but petrified and the film opens and ends in a boring narrative that somehow touches on the real subject of the film. Voice-over keeps bothering about wind and creatures on the wind, but what the hell is there no wind on the land? Like many 80's horror films, "The Cellar" deals with cursed Indian landscapes and versatile mythical monsters hidden in basements and quagmires. Mance Cashen and his family moved to a house built on what once was the home of the Native Americans, but then the white people came and turned the land into oil fields. Half of the scenario is unnecessary in explaining the origin of the monster, but I can simply summarize it for you: an ancient Indian witch called a creature (which looks like an oversized paper rat) to destroy white people overflowing with him but to bury him again because, and I quote, SOB kills i Indy. Mance's extremely irritating son accidentally awakens the beast and naturally can't convince his parents of the big hungry rat in the basement. Allegedly emotional family situation (Dad always wants his son to love him) is very pathetic and redundant and the film needs more bloodshed; children's movie or not. The teenage hero (Chris Miller) is quite annoying, but in the 1980s we certainly saw worse actors. "The Cellar" is not highly recommended unless you are a fan of kitsch and typically 80s monster designs. The big rat is a real fun you see.
