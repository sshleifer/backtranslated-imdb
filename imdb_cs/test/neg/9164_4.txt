The story of three singing chipmunks, as cute and adorable, doesn't seem to have enough meat to keep him for an hour and a half. I thought the first half hour of this movie was worth watching. It was fun, she had some laughter in her, she was full of energy. Then it somehow lost. I wouldn't say it disappeared because it seemed quite sudden. Entertainment was gone; laughter disappeared. My daughter also noticed. She is 4 - in the first part of the film she laughed several times and then her laughter stopped. Maybe it took too serious a tone - a bad film producer working on chipmunks. Anyway, something happened and it wasn't better. Of course, the film tries to tell a story about how chipmunks started (Alvin, Simon and Theodore). Everyone knows a Christmas song. Here's how they met Dave and started their start. The film is updated to the present, although its true origins are recorded by Dave Street from 1958, which was the year when animated singing rodents were first created. Jason Lee did a pretty good job because Dave and chipmunk voices were also pretty good. David Cross as an evil Ian irritated me to be dull, and I couldn't figure out what character Claire was playing Cameron Richardson. She added little to the movie. It's a movie you can watch with kids - it's probably a movie you'd really like to watch with kids. He'll get me 4/10.
