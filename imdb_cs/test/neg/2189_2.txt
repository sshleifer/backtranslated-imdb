It's getting pretty good, accident and decision not to go back to LA. But everything falls into place too quickly. In the end, there is a decent plot, but so many scenes that make no sense. Randy (played by Brian Austin Green) returns home angry and ready to face people and he takes the time to marry a club when he parks his car in front of his house in the middle of nowhere? I don't want to spoil it, for anyone who decides to see it, but the last 45 minutes is ridiculous. Even playing that was not bad at the beginning becomes bad. Don't bother if you don't want to see how bad it is.
