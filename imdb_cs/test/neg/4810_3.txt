I can't believe I actually bought the movie! It's shit! ... Where I Live Mexican Movies Mexican movies are never advertised or available ... you can't find them at regular rental sites ... so I had to buy it ... I like Mexican movies! They bring me closer to my roots and my people and are so different from what they usually used ... but this was predictable !!! Yours could guess what happens ... I'm not a horrible movie! It's just not worth what I paid for it! jaja ... but if you have time and are really bored, then you should watch it .. but if you love mexican movies and love the theater itself, then you don't have to watch that it will be painful! lol
