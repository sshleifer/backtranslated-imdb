"The Quickie" tells of a decadent Russian mob family who lives in Malibu and ... well, frankly, this terrible attempt at drama is not worthy of commentary. Jason Leigh introduces himself to Mob-guy as "Pacific Exterminators" with huge letters in the back of his eyes, which call "West Coast Exterminators". Eventually, the good guys become suspicious because they exterminated in the bedroom. (duh). In another scene, Mr. Mobguy plays Russian roulette, which gives the hooker $ 4000 to bet whether he will live or die. It has 5 chances of 6 to keep the money if "live" bets. Well, she bet "die". (double duh) Later he complains that it's not fair and wants to play again. (Triple duh). The list of shortcomings goes on and on, while this intelligence smells offensive film and sinks in the horror of miserable music, average camera work, wrong direction, boring story, etc. on this loser. (D) <br /> <br /> Note - The Barebones DVD I rented had no English subtitles or closed captions.
