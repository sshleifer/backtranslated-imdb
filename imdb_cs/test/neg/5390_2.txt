Most other posts beat this film and deservedly so. I just had to embark on the technical awkwardness of filmmakers. It would be nice if the director had at least lunch with someone who knew what weapon he was because he had no idea. <br /> SPOILERS AHEAD !!! YOU WERE WARNING !!! Stupidity: <br /> <br /> The Spec Ops team is made up of various military units whose members have never met before. Maybe two people in the unit had guns that used the same magazines, parts, ammunition, etc. <br /> <br /> The sniper school instructor uses a sub machine gun (pistol caliber) as opposed to a rifle that we would assume would be more proficient. One of the poor night vision team members optics weighs more than the rifle does. You can say when it can make it BIG top heavy. The team leader sends a team member to "challenge" the human skeleton when they first confront him. Challenge 200 year old reanimated Native American skeleton with long spear and attitude riding undead war horse with heavy nose? I don't think so, Bubbe. Bullets don't jerk when they hit trees, Director. (A few people have already mentioned it.) Air Support teams consist of the ubiquitous "black helicopter", only this one has several side rockets hung beneath them. Someone forgot to tell the crew that the Skeleton Man was not flying, and they were above the American heart where there would be no enemy aircraft. Instead, they should instead point the air to the ground. The ground to ground air consists of a semi-automatic AK-47 (or 74?) shooter. Needless to say, it will only hit dirt. Should bring a belt feeding a light machine gun. The door sagittarius later finds that the grenade launcher is pretty useless anyway. The wooden arrow from the scary recurve bow does not down the helicopter, Mr. Director. I couldn't take very well after this point (about 30 minutes) and gave up. You seriously need morphine drip to make it through this film, it's just that painful.
