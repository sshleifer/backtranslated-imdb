Andrew Gurland's "Cheats" is his fictional "true story" about four college friends who maneuver cheat on tests. The Quartet is: Enthusiastic School-Hating Trevor Fehrman (as handsome Davis), his equally good-looking friend Matthew Lawrence (as Victor), their chubby school hating friend Elden Henson (as Sammy) and the crooked geekster Martin Starr (like Applebee). Adults include high-strung North Point director Mary Tyler Moore (as Mrs. Stark) and pornography-loving father Griffin Dunne (as Mr. Davis). High jinks begin with Mr. Fehrman and Mr. Lawrence, who allegedly urinate on a teacher's textbook. Put it at the bottom of the pile; and be grateful that it doesn't go on anyone's permanent record.
