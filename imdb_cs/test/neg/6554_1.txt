This film is incredibly unreal because it makes a man who wants to cry, clich√©s are deployed on thicker than 5 year old peanut butter in a way that actually sucks humor from the heart, every single joke was badly timed and wouldn't be fun if he was timed right. <br /> <br /> You don't see this movie, there's a real chance you'll never be able to enjoy comedies again. ...at all.
