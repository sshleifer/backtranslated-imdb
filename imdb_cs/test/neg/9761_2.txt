Don't get married because the assumption of this movie is good. It's, but it's not a good movie to make. <br /> <br /> Comedy requires a well-honored script and a masterful direction. Unfortunately, he does not have this poorly made film. Leconte, a good director in other genres, does not give another example in his comedy farces (Les Bronzes series). The comic timing is terrible. Some jokes are wired. Some are re-hashed from other movies. Others just sit there, as if they gave you time to laugh. The storyline has a messy subplots (an allergic daughter, a lesbian co-owner) and doesn't even develop the viewer's cover. It's not fun and it's not even a second credible. Compare it to any Billy Wilder comedy (Some Like It Hot, etc.) or Leconte's compatriot Francis. Veber, a true GENIUS in French comedy (Le Diner de Cons, Le Placard, Les Comperes, La Chevre, La Grande Blonde, etc.) And you'll see a difference in their tense scenarios, great comedy acting and timing, with every joke leading to the next. Watching Mon Meilleur Ami twice would be a cruel and unusual punishment, not a good sign for a comedy.
