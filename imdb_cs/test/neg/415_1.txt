First, I loved the book, more than the popular Da Vinci code, and although the DVC movie was not well received, I liked it and bought a DVD. However, there is no chance that I will ever want to watch Angles and Demons again. The film hardly resembles a book, in fact there is only a general assumption of the story. I was disappointed from the very beginning of the film, in the book Robert Langdon received a call and a fax from Maximilian Kohler, director of CERN. Who will find the Father's body (can't remember the name) and then ask Langdon to use the super-fast plane ... There were only those people who knew about this technology that they created the Father and Daughter team themselves. and the cameraman ... But the film was a massive team ... so there was no tension there ... as they found out etc. <br /> <br /> Skipping or changing the whole story was a huge mistake and it was in my mind what made her the wrong movie ... it changed everything that happened since Camerlingo was confronted in the Pope's locked room, it was to be Maximilian Kohler, filmed a video from a wheelchair, the commander hurried to get a cameraman, but Olivetti was shot, the room commander was in the movie, and Olivetti was shot ... Bored and can't remember the events in the movie) ... <br /> <br /> Not interested in love In Vittorio and Robert and a book that was not at CERN when it came and was actually brought from her research work. In the book, all four preferratti were killed, but in the film the last of the four survived the fountain. Vittoria was kidnapped and Robert had to rescue her and they were the ones who killed Assassin in the Illuminati Church, not blown up as if he were in Camerling's movie. Where Robert was trapped under a stone coffin, he wasn't there, saved by his Mickey alarm. OK in the book we are led to believe that Langdon rescued from the helicopter, well enough to say it was a bit far stretched, but in the movie it was important because he had to race the movie ... There was no mention of how Vittoria and her adoptive father were involved, which was also important to the character of Vittoria. <br /> <br /> In all the worst movies I saw, I left early. , but my brain was numb and I temporarily lost my feet. Really really reeeeeaaaaaaallly a bad attempt and not one of Ron Howards best, in fact, how to get the job again is out of me !!! I want my money back !!!
