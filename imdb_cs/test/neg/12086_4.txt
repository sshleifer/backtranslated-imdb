Despite the strong performances of Minnie Driver and Tom Wilkinson, this film cannot ignite the viewer's imagination. By the way, what happened to the lady driver? She had such potential in the film industry. This was almost like the 1850 version of Yentl without musical fanfare for me. With the death of his father, the driver occupies the position of governess of a Christian family, hiding his Jewish identity. Although I realize it is a period of peace, it was terribly boring for England in 1850 and Scotland. The lady of the house is most irritating with her voice singing songs. I expected to turn to the driver at any time. What is Mary Blackchurch's name? I know the driver is trying to pass as a Christian, but does this name mean all the way? Meanwhile, Mary finds love for her young hubby father (Wilkinson) and his emotionally unbalanced son. Finally, the only thing we see is that Mary found a vocation that would allow her to photograph her family. Did we really have to be subjected to what's going on in the whole movie? Early scenes of Judaism practiced in England in the 19th century and the cholera epidemic at the end could be played more. Wilkinson's family has a basic sense of anti-Semitism, but it can never come out.
