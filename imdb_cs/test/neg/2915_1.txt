Remember the old kung fu movies we watched on Friday and Saturday late at night when our guards guessed we were in charge? This film plays just like one of those movies. Patsy Kensit's greatest claim to fame was the interest of love for Mel Gibson's character in "Lethal Weapon 2," and this show was one of the reasons she never did the big one: she's a terrible actress. <br /> <br /> In "Lethal Weapon 2," I thought she was cute. She's cute enough to look at some of the other movies he was in, including "Loves Music, Loves to Dance," another great devastation I wasn't even impressed with. But as appealing as my eyes, my soul screamed at me to turn it off because it played another cheap, predictable role, and it did very badly. In this film Kensit plays comedienne (and not one good) who works in clubs in France (he couldn't cut it in his own country, so TheIR makes his bleeding ears) who's on her Happiness, but even worse, the French government wants to blow it out due to expiration of the visa (or maybe just caught her act). But she married this Casanova (Freiss), which is just as lucky and predictability begins ... awful! Is there any way to give this movie a NEGATIVE rating? 1 of 10 Stars Rated!
