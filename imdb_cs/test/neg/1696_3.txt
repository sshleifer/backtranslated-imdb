Pat O'Brien portrays Knute Rockne, All-American football coach Notre Dame. There is no doubt that this film will be much more attractive for those interested in some aspect of "Knute Rockne All-American Notre Dame Football" - probably the most interesting for serious Notre Dame football and / or football followers. You will see some good movie footage in documentary style. Otherwise it's difficult to recommend as a FILM. It's no more than a historical documentary. "You'll know" that the end is close when Gale Page gets cold - and don't blink or you miss Ronald Reagan of all the things, "Camille"! Knute Rockne - All-American (1940) Lloyd Bacon ~ Pat O'Brien, Gale Page, Ronald Reagan
