The storyline in this movie is very thin, and not much acting. Val Kilmer - I don't know why he agreed to this movie - he plays a small role as a gang leader. In short, the film is tedious to watch. One person who resembles a professor of archeology / religion is exploring the underground area of ​​Moscow, which has some history associated with the construction of railways and the Bolshevik. revolution. Church tragedies in this history make the survey "spiritual" and the spirits of malevolent intent to persecute underground ruins. Professor's friend decides to find his friend underground and hires a couple of Russian guides. The whole film is based on this conspiracy and contains much repetitive shots of the underground and some camera effects; similar to "Day Watch", "Night Watch", etc.
