Well, I awarded, I'm a fan of low-budget horror, which comes with an occasional piece of waste that even the hardest fans of camping dudes can't bare to witness ... TRANCERS 6, DEMONICUS is Jay Woelfel. Firstly, the TRANCERS series, which began in the mid-1980s with Charlie Band and his Empire Pictures, is basically a franchise that is due to Tim Thomerson and his excellent portrayal. Trancer Hunter Jack Deth. Well, low and lo, thanks to the falling Full Moon budgets (which, in spite of what people said, actually brought high quality features like HELL ASYLUM and DEAD & ROTTING), Thomerson didn't return after the sixth installment. Full Moon writer Courtney Joyner returns once more and brings another sub-average scenario that includes Jack Detha (played by Thomerson ... in flashbacks that are extremely badly inserted ... has a different hairstyle like every time when it is displayed, and some "shemp" that lies on the table and goes down to his daughter's body. Well, out of here, you have "Jo Deth" who acts like Jack ... but it's a shame he doesn't really release the same screen as Jack Deth. The movie, shot at 16mm, is simply said, the embarrassment of the name TRANCERS ... no attack on anyone in Young Wolf Productions. I mean, I respect you that you really want to jump out and make a TRANCERS movie without Tim, but with a little more time (despite it being shot since December 2001) it could have been better. However, check out the Full Moon DVD of it, which is a dual feature with original TRANCERS, and feature trailers for the last 10 plus full moon features. <br /> <br /> Overall, I would probably like to do more if she doesn't have the name TRANCERS, but like anything, you can judge it by someone else and you have to check it yourself!
