When this film was made in 1980, I was a teenager on football stands playing as part of the audience. This was done at Mooseheart, Illinois. Capital letters spelling "MOOSEHEART" at the top of the stands were covered with a banner in the film. The headmaster would tell us to be loud at some points, as if landing. St. Nicholas Repair Center Charles is a real place that is less than 30 miles from Mooseheart, though I think it may have been recently closed. During one scene, they show a black man and a white man in the audience watching the game. Right below them you can see Sister Noel's head (she was 11 at that time). In VHS, I only see the top of my head, but when I saw her on TV in 1981, I saw her whole head and sister Jacqui. <br /> <br /> I thought the movie itself was fine for a TV movie. Since there is already a description of the film, I don't have to repeat it. Worth seeing at least once.
