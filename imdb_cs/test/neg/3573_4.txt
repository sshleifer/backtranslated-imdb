This is what I have asked myself during many fighting, gaudy struggles, curses and general confusion that have been in 84 minutes. The comparison will also stand when you think of one-dimensional characters that are so deep that it's virtually impossible to worry about what happens to them. They are just poorly written cyphers for the director to hang his multicultural beliefs, a topic that has been much better in other dramas on television and in the cinema. I have to admit I am not really one for spotting bad performances during the movie, but it has to be said that Nichola Burley (as the heroine's best friend) and Wasim Zakir (as ugly, bullying brother) was absolutely terrible. I don't know what kind of acting school they did, but if I were theirs, I'd ask for a rush. Only Samina Awan in the lead role can impress the cast of the so-called British talent, which we will probably never hear. At least that's hope. Next time, hire another Boy Scout. Another interesting idea is the nasty fashion soundtrack featuring Snow Patrol, Ian Brown and Keane. Now I'm a bit of a music fan and I'm familiar with most of these artists output, but I didn't know any songs during this movie (except the ubiquitous "Run"). B-sides, anyone? We get many, many musical assemblies that telegraph how we feel. These are accompanied by so surprisingly original paintings, such as couples kissing the swollen lake and canoes in the doorway. This is a problem because none of the songs effectively mood and we realize that the director lacks the ability to convey the emotional path to the audience through the narrative and dialogue itself. The end is probably meant to be just desserts because everyone gets their arrival and there is at least one big shock in the store .. But I remained resolutely motionless because the scenario gave me no root. It is not enough to solve the hot button problem, you must actually give us a plot that has not yet been made to death and individuals who are more than window dressers. As it stands, this film is a noble failure, only a promising leading actress and a few slightly deflected strokes that will save her from the trash. 4/10. Must try harder.
