Oh yes, there is an absurd excuse that the elephant was convicted of "murder" "and sentenced to death, and that it was a fair and humane" execution ". For all people who are satisfied with this sophistication, please fill in the line on the right, I'll give you a great team of Three Stoogs slapping their heads. 500 years later, people are still a lot of sages I see. <br /> <br /> What next? We arrest the birds for stealing our blueberries? Waiting, that would be interference, right?
