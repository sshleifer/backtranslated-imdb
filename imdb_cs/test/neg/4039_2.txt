As you can say from other comments, this film is just about the WORST movie ever made. Let me find out how many different words I can use to describe it: Boring, Unbearable, Sad, Delicious, Stupid, Terrible ..... <br /> <br /> I could continue with such descriptions, but you probably get a point. I'd give it 0, if possible - bad behavior, bad leadership, poor production, bad conspiracy. This was done in 2001 and looks more than 1965. Very low budget, boring land, horrible gameplay, really bad special effects, etc ... he saw a Sci-Fi movie that I think is wrong. That's garbage. She has nothing to do with it. As far as "B-movie" is concerned, it is the very bottom of the game. I think I'd be more amused to stare at blank paper for 90 minutes. Junk this gives a good low-budget "B" movies a bad name. This makes Ed Wood films good. <br /> <br /> Watching movies with live video is just when you think you've seen the worst, you see something even worse. DJ Perry is a terrible actor and has no individual qualities that would make him stand out. <br /> <br /> Avoid this waste at all costs! Oh humanity!
