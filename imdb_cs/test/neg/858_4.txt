"Duke" is a film based in the heart of the British aristocracy where Old Duke (John Neville) dies and avoiding his great fortune and enormous wealth being taken from him after death by two sinister aristocrats (Oliver Muirhead and Sophie) Hey, man); he will pass on his duchy to his dog. The dog's "best friend", an American girl named Charlotte (played by Courtnee Draper), whose parents die, becomes a former Duke's orphan because she is her great uncle. A young chef named Florian comes with him and Charlotte instantly unites the creation of a romantic subspecies that in their own way act as an undertone for the main plot of conspiracy, the activities of Hubert, "Duke" and his many activities. love interests with other dogs. All this is being watched by James Doohan, who plays Butler, who is determined to try to serve his old duke by trying to serve his new master Hubert. Doohan acts like an older character here to provide comfort and advice to young people, while looking at his new master and performing various ridiculous tasks. A gentle comedy show mixed with drama elements towards the end of a gentle and influential career. Although technically, I don't like this movie when I just watched the discovery of James Doohan's role. Although the plot is good, the elements of writing and direction must be covered. Ignoring the absurdity of "Doggie Duke", I personally do not like it through the use of comic and outrageous jokes on "bad" characters due to their ridiculousness. Hygiene-related humor, as you like, is too obvious and the general stupidity of many characters doesn't attract me. Director, Phillip Spink, uses too long images with too much voice or affecting the overall sound quality. In addition, Muirhead and Heyman's acting, while good in dramatic and romantic sequences, will drastically reduce the fulfillment of the wholesale requirements for the role. But as a mature movie fan it is easy for me to be above a critical simple family movie designed to make you laugh. I can admit that I found that some of the pieces are funny and other pieces touch together with a conspiracy that can be far drawn but has some connections. I do not recommend this movie to adult movie fans, but I recommend it to dog lovers, families who want to enjoy a fun movie for their child and fans of James Doohan who wish to see 'Scotty' in his latest role.
