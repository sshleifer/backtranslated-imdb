Paul Telfer, who plays in this TV movie Hercules, must be the hottest thing on EVER's two legs. Wow. This film, however, represents a 100% distortion of Hercules' story. Like "Troy," this film has nothing to do with the original story. Zero. What is particularly offensive is that they have actually devised a homosexual figure so that people can hate it, which has made it so ugly and evil as any character in television or cinema history. This is threefold offensive because the Hercules may have had a wife because it was the anticipation of the old days, but he also had at least a dozen lovers. So it is ironic that they should create a gay royal adversary for this film. No, not ironic. Evil. The creators of this journey should hang their heads in shame.
