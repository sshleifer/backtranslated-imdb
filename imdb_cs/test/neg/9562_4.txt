The reality of a mafia environment is absolutely dog-eat-dog, where a gangster will be killed for showing any indication of weakness because it becomes a responsibility. I have no problem with how the human side of gansters is portrayed, but Bugsy is too far in the direction of the soft, comic, men. The film is pleasant, but it's just a light fun and not a biot of a man who, though exciting, was extremely dangerous and fearsome. <br /> <br /> Acting is all good and direction very solid. Places and era are very well represented and topics very interesting. Did Bugsy really want to kill Mussoulini?
