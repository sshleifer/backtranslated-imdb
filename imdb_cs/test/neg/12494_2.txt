Obviously, this film was made with a very low budget, but did they have to do it so clearly? They seemed to make no effort to make the "future" look the least futuristic. For example, the first scene takes place in an 80s office building and all the cars that blow up are from the late 1970s onwards (I suppose they don't want to blow up a car that costs over $ 500). In addition, its pretty obvious that Don "dragon" drives his personal car during the movie (after all, he partially financed the movie). Finally, at the beginning of the film, they point out that all kinds of drugs are now legal in this new cyberpunk company. Not only will this never be important in the movie, but later when Don needs surgery without anesthesia, why doesn't he go out and get legal heroin or morphine? The whole movie is so sloppy and totally anticlimactic, because Don easily throws out "unstoppable" Cybertracker for about 25 minutes into the movie. However, if you find this movie cheap or free I would watch, the last scene is almost worth taking with this entire movie.
