I can imagine what happened to this film to create: a bunch of studios sitting around, drinking gin-tonic, maybe common, and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a movie that would surpass the generation a gap that was about as far away as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that would be equally interesting to university educators and their parents - perhaps for a variety of reasons, but still a ticket. What interest hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism and wild suits and costumes. What was their concern about their parents? Musicals, eye candy, feelings and nostalgia. Very good, then, "Lost Horizon", old classic, like music, in color. You can't miss that? It was a bomb. The lost horizon, James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In broad terms, he outlines a utopian society in Shangri-la, "Valley of the Blue Moon", near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully satisfied villagers who serve the abbey of the <i> very </i> long-lived monks. Entering Paradise is Gilligan's Island-like Aircraft outsiders (veteran of WWI, missionary, etc.) each with their own spin on the situation - what plot is the reaction of each of them being presented with in a paradise, or try to return to the twentieth thunderstorm. Taking it to our own imagination, it is a subtle, pop-lit fuzz that presents its own conservative British views in "oriental" dresses, both exotic and so-called lucky cookies. As prisoners of honored monk guests, it is forbidden to leave the valley, but never push into work or prayer (not that monks do too much of themselves), treat themselves royally and give simple but luxurious accommodation - who would you like to escape? In this Central American heaven-on-earth, monks are cultivated and wise, the climate is warm, the food is rich and delicious, the villagers are picturesque unconventional, and nothing changes. Nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look nice and even flirt a little (the reason is one of the most misplaced explanations of tantric sex I've ever read). Even their religion is inviolable: revealed as the best mix of Christianity and Buddhism between the two worlds, there is little to offend some but the bravest fundamentalist or oddballs who really knew about Tibet (which was a very small number in the early 1930s). Like Capra, which focuses on adventure and character angles, it was charming; and maybe Steven Spielburg could do it if he was around. As the early-1970s Hollywood product, the adventure was over too quickly, and an updated list of characters too bland, making a lot of impression. Deprived of the superficial, suggestive qualities of classic BW, the monastery reminds of de luxe beauty in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the monk's garments have tried for historical accuracy, most other prisoners looked as if they were on their way to a morning massage and fango bath, afternoon with a few holes. Perhaps Stephan Sondheim could restore some chest to the story, and play a real conflict within each character's response; just five years after, Brian Eno would capture the tranquil atmosphere to T; instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David got the job of writing songs that marry Muzak-like tunes with some of those clunkiest new Agey texts always wrote. Naturally, every song calls for a dance number all the time, ranging from totally forgotten to totally boring, as well as a scenario that has no line to quote. Ties with this movie were legions - there was everything from cookbooks to posters planned to support this movie, and such was the hype that I actually went out and bought the sountrack album. The only good thing I can say is that he made me feel pretty impressed to write this review from memory for almost thirty years after - next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of Bardo Thadol, and therefore learned about the real Tibetan culture. Moan. <br /> <br />
