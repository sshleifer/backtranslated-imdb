Another horrible Hollywood movie. This time the woman is helping to revolutionize Central America. Yes Yes Yes. Hey, he'll leave the film without any sense of realism EVERYTHING. I'm so sick of movies like this. Actors and actresses are miserable, the effects are shameful and the dialogue is terrible. And suddenly I see John Rhys-Davies as the evil president. From Gimli to Hugo Louis Ramos. I bet he's very proud of it. Well, I shouldn't have expected much of this movie and I didn't. And I'm glad it sucks bigtime. I wonder what people like this movie. My guess is younger people aged 12-16. And I think some people like Kristin Dattilo. Well I am in none of these groups and I hate it. Rating: 2
