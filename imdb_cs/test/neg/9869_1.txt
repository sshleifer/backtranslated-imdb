I have always loved bad creations, rhetorical criticism, and my film professor has confirmed it to me in college. This is not as bad as the Star Wars Holiday Special, there is nothing at the bottom of the box than the bug. This film The Fantastic Four, supplemented by Dr. Doom's I-have-no-idea-why-hes, is high on the list of colossal mistakes. Doom's dialogue "Kill him! ... Let him go!" It is classic because it is stunning in its merriment. The cut is good and the director of the photo is not half bad ... these are the main pages. However, I cannot subordinate all my friends to watch in full, but if I can get the chance to show them, "Jonny and Sue can come with us in space!" the scene I'm doing. I also include the last scene of the scene where Redd Richards gets into a limousine in his FF outfit for some reason ... the reward is a farewell hand when they leave. Most people have complete mistrust that something like this exists.
