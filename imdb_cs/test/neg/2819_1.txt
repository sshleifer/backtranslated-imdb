This film was an absolute waste. Director and stars (?) Should be excluded from filming movies forever. The paper story relates to a slender director, who is played in the series by the director (now actor) online advertising for women who play in a snuff film. There is no horror at all, girls look faded and bored, the direction is unnecessary, the music is badly placed (heavy metal in the library scene?) and the lighting is terrible. The director had to pay for a few shopping trolleys full of aluminum cans and got the script, sober actors and a few light bulbs. As it is, it is one disgusting, ugly, worthless film confusion.
