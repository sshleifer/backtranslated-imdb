The depiction of ex-Kaishakunin's refugee Ogami Itto Wakayama Tomisabur was completely natural. His behavior, his voice, his appearance - it all spoke to dislocation. As he entered the room, I could feel, like the characters on the screen, that he was not there and that his determination to be spelled out there was. Somewhere I read that Mr. Wakayama actually took Kendo (a Japanese fencing training) to explain his comfort with katana, which was beautifully shown in every cutfest. When you watch movies, from the moment he reaches the moment he sends the sword, you feel like you are witnessing something inevitably ugly. He would even turn the katana quickly to get rid of the blood before rinsing it, and that would happen at the perfect moment. Nakamura Kinnosuke's release comes as a release. He feels as if he is trying too hard to be someone else or to tell someone else's story. As a result, every time I tried to get involved, I lost my grip because it didn't seem to have a strong role. As if it was unpleasant for him. Fencing in the TV series was also a completely old Hollyweird school. The camera cuts to disguise Mr. Nakamura, awkwardness with katana, slow action, goals that were sitting, etc. Extremely bad, from the viewer's point of view. In the episode of The Castle Wall Attack, there was a moment when Mr. Nakamura took out his sword as a child. It was embarrassing. He did it as if it was hard! I almost fell off my chair. Frankly speaking, the story is about excellent swordsmen. Time. Swordmanship is a problem. However, Realism is not: the sword in the movies was excellent and the manga-like, as intended, I'm sure. (The buggy was equipped with an automatic high-speed musket that ran for 3 years old? Yes ... manga-style.) It's how the story smoothly intertwines historical cultural accuracy into a basically fantasy superhero that makes movies charming. (Read Yoshikawa Eiji Musashi [% Historical Legend]%!) I couldn't really sit in episodes of TV series. They just felt cheap. Check out the movies first and you'll know what I'm talking about.
