This film is like so many movies from bio-TVs I have seen: formal, exaggerated, poorly behaved, and most importantly, happening too soon. I mean, the film was filmed and for that matter, aired before Michael Jackson was released from charges of child molestation, which in my opinion was one of the most important periods in Jackson's life and career. It would probably make a big end to this dock-drama. However, this movie already bites away more than it can chew, cramming too much detail in this overly ambitious project. There is no doubt that Michael Jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far from any musician, let alone a modern day pop star, to date, and his story would probably take six Behind The Music specials to say exactly. This film tried to tell too much in three hours, and no need to say that it failed. Flex Alexander did what he could while playing Jackson, but he looked more like a cartoon of SNL from similar people Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler. It would certainly be difficult to find someone who would accurately capture Jackson without encountering King Pop himself and studying his madness methods. However, in the line budget, one can only rely on what they see in the tabloids, and they do not necessarily provide an accurate representation. In addition, the director's effort to make Alexander look like Jackson is completely foolish. The Caucasian make-up on Alexander's face tends to be the opposite of a minstrel show, and anyone in the grocery store knows that Jackson's nose is not as big as Alexander's. It's also amazing that the film is documenting Jackson under a knife to get a cosmetic operation, but in the next scene, Alexander still has the same nose. This kind of suspension of distrust that the director expects to be unable to hold onto TV viewers in the 21st century. It was even more intrusive when the footage of the real Michael Jackson (ie the Time He Hanged His Infants Over a Balcony in Germany) was screened in real time. It was a nice attempt, but it just didn't work. <br /> <br /> If this movie, released into theaters, would only gain profit through its stickyness. Compared to "Mommie Dearest" it fades, and it says a lot. Above all, it was a movie that was probably rushed to creation, as well as many TV movies that are not on HBO. It could be much better if he was just talking about one aspect of Jackson's life. Even if they were accused of harassing children, it would probably be much better and even more interesting.
