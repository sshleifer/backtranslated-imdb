The fuss and the atmosphere this movie has, but unfortunately the press I just saw. Raymond Massey provides the reckless Sherlock Holmes, almost comically so in the early scenes in his robe, who trades for workers' clothes to explore the haunted castle of Dr. Rylott (Lyn Harding). It wasn't clear to me why Rylott wanted his stepdaughters to die. If, as in the case of Helena (Angela Baddeley), he didn't want her to run to marry, he would do the same by sending her. . After she and Helen set an early wedding date, the fianc√©e is no longer heard from the rest of the picture. The presence of a band of Gypsies at the time of the violent Stoner's death is merely a diversion, and what might have been an interesting instrument of murder, a poisonous snake, is diluted by the fact that it was not a cobra, musical creations Indian male servant no matter what. Athole Stewart competently portrays Holmes's assistant Dr. Watson, though he gets used to the fact that Nigel Bruce is your cup of tea. As Rylott, Lyn Harding is sufficiently threatening, a feature that would be put to good use as Holmes' nemesis professor Moriarty in two later films - 1935's "Sherlock Holmes Victory" and 1937 "Murder at the Baskervilles". With a repetitive choppiness and unstable camera, it's surprising that the story line isn't more disturbed than it is. Its integrity is generally maintained even if it reaches a little to fill the gaps. I think it would be my main complaint with the film because the mental bridging of some of the jumps in the picture turned out to be a real pain in the ashes.
