This is a terrible re-make of French film Ma Vie en Rose (http://imdb.com/title/tt0119590/). The only scenario I can imagine in which someone (Sinise?! Bates?! Butler?! What did they think!?!) Agreed to be associated with it, MacLaine is seeing the original, being rightly impressed and getting a friend ( With no credit writing - or talent! - in his name) translate themes for the American audience - whom they both agreed to be stupid, stupid, stupid. Then she took other friends to register, and they did it as friends - not merely on the merits of this pathetically conceived scenario of everything, but on the kitchen sink. I'm not a French movie fan, but Ma Vie en Rose is a gentle, thoughtful and hungry provocative treatment for sensitive cultural problems. I would like to see that it is a wider exposure among English-speaking viewers - and if it means American re-make, so be it. But puh-leeze! little respect for questions And audience intelligence - and a better direction for actors who couldn't decide whether they work for Tennessee Williams or Jerry Lewis!
