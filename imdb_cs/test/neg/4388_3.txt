Check out all the positive comments from users of this movie and check how often each one adds user comments. They send once. It seems that companies are probably paying for the services they post after unsolicited pro-movie comments on IMDb. This movie was terrible. The story was stupid. Behavior was wrong. The jokes weren't even funny. The film included less nudity from what looked like porn actresses, but none of the other characters. It was clear from the first 15 minutes that the film was not funny. There was some grotesque here and there, but most of the humor was to be derived from the characters who speak and spread rumors. It didn't do well. Every joke is obvious and you see it coming. <br /> <br /> The movie is worthy of fast forwarding or better than watching. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry to watch this movie and if I could charge the studio fees and the distributor for 1.5 hours stole it from me.
