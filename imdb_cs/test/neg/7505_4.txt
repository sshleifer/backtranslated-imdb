Planet Zombie looks like an example of good ideas and commendable ambitions exceeding budget. I thought the explanation for zombies was genuine originals and harsh, and loved dog munching in the exposure scene. The rest of the gore was effective in a low budget a little way, but too far apart in the whole movie. The problem was that it was too long and anti-climatic. Sure, they had an interesting, if derived plot line, and a similarly familiar but cool environment, but the low budget zombie movie really needs to be goretastic to make an impression and there just wasn't enough red moments in this for me. I believe that the excess of cheap-looking and bloodless battle scenes was excessive, especially with regard to the generally minimal grue. In addition, for a two-hour film, there is very little closure at the end, and although it is a little bit to watch Planet Zombie 2, I felt I was cheating. So perhaps it's worth looking for two.
