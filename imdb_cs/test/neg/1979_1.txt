Final Fantasy: Advent children are and will remain a classic example of style over a bad substance. Instead of drawing on unforgettable characters and captivating mythology of the original game, Enix Square was frightened by the frivolous assembly of unintelligible battle scenes. Yes, I said "incomprehensible". Did you know that Tifa knows how fast Kung Fu techniques that magically cause the camera angle to move every second? The Cloud can hang effortlessly in the air for an entire minute, with its two-ton sword turning wildly? English oak is average. Although it is not incredibly bad, it is not far from well produced. The quality is comparable to the average anime oak quality. Here's what I'd like to say to hard FFVII fans who can't skip this movie: Advent Kids are the best fan service you could have hoped for from Enix Square, but also a delicate CG that is like Galers: Rion had a better story. You will be embarrassed by this film and its lack of thinking at the right time. The days of his novelty are numbered. Films like Advent Kids challenge me if Square Enix recognizes the potential of its franchises. After all (and no offense), it's a Japanese company. Japanese developers can provide fun games, but most of their offers are disappointing shallow. They are absolutely psychologists in terms of production quality. Advent children have some of the most breathtaking renderings in CG history, but it doesn't save from its intricate plot and cardboard figures. Every fan who followed this movie knows Sephiroth is coming back. Bending the story to adapt to his resurrection was a big mistake. on Cloud is an effeminate Caucasian head.
