With actors like Depardieu and Richard, it's a really difficult task to make a boring movie. But Weber is a master in setting the slow pace and making allegedly funny scenes without any wit and depth. This film is high on the story, but low in character. You never know any of the characters except the superficial slapstick. Unfortunately, Weber has no idea what it is all about. His style could be described in hit and miss. Of course, some people laugh when they see someone slipping on a banana peel. Weber directs his humor to this game. It's a shame how badly he uses good talent. Many good French comedians have been wasted by average directors.
