I really enjoyed the movie. Sometimes it was really cheesy. (They destroy the villain with hair dryers - but where are they attached?) Is this a unique movie though, and I enjoyed acting by Courtney Draper and Tamara of Hope. I also enjoyed Fanuel (whatever you write ...) he likes because she called him Dweeb. In addition to acting, "rewinding" and showing what happened on Ariel and then Megan's view was very interesting. I've seen it twice and I'll see it again
