Another demanding movie by Vicente Aranda. If "Juan la loca" shinned the same, at least its quality was excellent (mainly thanks to the great performance of Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala), but "Carmen" is boring and full of themes (hot brunette with a dagger in stockings, poor man dragged to madness for passion, Sierra Nevada Gangs, "toreros", ...) <br /> <br /> Paz Vega is a beautiful woman, but his talent is more doubtful and Sbaraglia's role is so stupid that the results are almost incredible. The script is weak and Aranda's reckless character affects the entire film. With these components, the result could not be good. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but a complete failure, in my opinion.
