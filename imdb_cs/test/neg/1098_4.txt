This film is like any other modern horror movie. It is predictable in the way it is built and progressed, and nothing original or shocking can ever be brought on the screen. This is really the biggest disappointment of the film, which overall has a promising mainstream concept for a movie of its kind. You can call this movie a great cliché of modern horror film. It has all the elements in it that make modern horror movies often not so great ones to watch. One of these aspects is the moans and the very naive little child. Why do they keep putting such things in movies? The same applies to aspects of drama that relate to the family. It just doesn't work for the movie and is by far interesting or effective. This often causes the film to stretch in parts and become uncomfortable to watch. So he has all the clichés present, but they also fail to bring any of these clichés to the screen. As a horror, it's just very poor. His horror and tension can't handle this very well. There is very little for the fans of the genre. The film's story is not very well connected and is being built in film. Too often the film sleeps on parts and it never allows its horror to fully dig inside. The movie is also often too dark (no doubt as an attempt to hide its relatively low budget) and it also shows very little gore, mainly because you just can't always see things so well. You can only say that by looking at this film, which director JS Cardone does not have too much talent for the genre and does not know how to properly process his current ingredients. He has made several attempts in the past, but all of his films have failed. Unfortunately, she just tries. Who knows, perhaps with the right people behind the camera (like Tobe Hooper, who was originally tied to direct directing) this movie could still be decent. It's a badly cast movie, mostly with big unknowns in it. The biggest name of the film is Ben Cross, but his role is too small and in a way also for film and his story is not relevant enough. He didn't seem to enjoy a lot of fun with him. <br /> <br /> Skip it. <br/> <br/> 4/10
