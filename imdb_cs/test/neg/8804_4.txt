(spoiler) It could be the worst movie you see, maybe you'd like it. It's one of those course films. There is a man who has seen having a day in life. Blacks rats some, as he regrets (which I think was a good idea). <br /> <br /> Killer rats with friends with a two man big man come to make a feeling unwanted, so a man set a killer rat on them and floor the floor both bodies covered with big black rats not so much blood. but think about big black rats all over your body) but start with small killing people, but rats are bored excessively until rats kill their friends and friends, one scene there she was sitting in the toilet while the rats go to the pipes leading to the toilet and the rat goes up, you know and get out of your mouth, which means the rats must be laughing for weeks in the body I should have been laughing for a few weeks <br /> <br / > Why I like this movie, yes, it's different than the rest, I like it for the ONE when a little creature is on humanity. <br /> <br /> If you've seen any of these movie slugs, glide them, spiders, snakes, shaking, cujo, crocodile, shark, octopus. <br /> <br /> If you liked and check Hood rats, <br /> <br /> is better than Terror toons that all I can say! 4/10
