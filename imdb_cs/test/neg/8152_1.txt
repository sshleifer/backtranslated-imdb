Being an independent filmmaker myself, I really understand what these guys were trying to do, and that sounds like a good idea. On paper. On 16mm film, but it's terrible. I didn't realize that the thing came into being in the mid-1990s because the film was so grainy and bad that I swore it was one of those thirty-year films when porn producer tried to go into the mainstream. A sound! Ugh, I don't know what kind of microphone they used to record, but it sounds like somebody's walking on dead sheets all over the thing. I think I shouldn't judge too hard how many feature films MY has? None, but I'd like to think we have at least a good picture and sound quality so we can go with our bad acting, writing and directing. + For idea, F-- for execution.
