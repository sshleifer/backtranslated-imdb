Like most of you, I watch a lot of great movies; Among those who often either voluntarily or mistakenly find films that are so absurd that we think why someone would. That's exactly what I can say about the Dead Man reward .... <br /> <br /> The least I can do is try to "warn" some of you. If you enjoy having a movie for story, acting and intensity, before you want to choose something else. Now it's not all bad ..... In fact, if all you want is creative movie editing and unique angles along with the original music environment than you think it's okay. As someone who values ​​movie charts, gaming and entertainment, it's true that I thought this movie was so awful that it didn't happen. I could easily find a place for him on my list of the worst movies I've ever seen. As for Val Kilmer in this, it is true that he was probably cast as a favor to the director; As a fan of some Kilmer movies, I can't understand what his motive was. The film seems to be part of the western part of the romance ......... Finally, I'm sure most of you can agree with me that it's just a gross loss of our time. If you didn't see this movie, it would be my recommendation to avoid it altogether.
