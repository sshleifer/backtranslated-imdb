Almost everything that Stephen King ever wrote seemed to be turned into a film or television series; in fact, I am surprised that no one has tried to produce a mini-series from a grocery store list. Let's face it, if they did, it couldn't be any less interesting than corn children. Based on one of the many stories of the King, this 1984 horror movie looks at Linda Hamilton and Peter Horton. a couple on a long car journey who plunge into a place where they bother to find themselves in the sleepy city of Nebraska in Gatlin, where all the adult children murdered children who worship the ancient evil lurking in the cornfields. Although <br /> Although director Fritz Kiersch manages to build a sufficient amount of atmosphere at the beginning (after Hamilton's silly song and dance, but before we get to meet with the strange Isaac, the leader of the killer children), he is totally thrown away with endless intrepid scenes where Hamilton and Horton were hunted by the murderous half-boards of the city. Courtney Gains, as a violent redhead Malachai, can look really menacing, but the rest of the children are not the least threatening; As a result, many of the movie 'Scary' Moments fail. Towards the end of the film, when we finally look at the malevolent power that inhabits the field surrounding Gatlin, the film descends into an excess of visual effects of the 1980s. Today, but look positively ridiculous. Corn children might be interesting for King fans who want to see how the writer's work has been translated into a big screen, but your average horror fan will be the most.
