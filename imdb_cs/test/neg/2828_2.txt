This film comes along with "Gli fumavano le Colt ... lo chiamavano Camposanto" and both films leave much to be desired in the form of their DVD copies. First, both movies are very dark - sometimes it's hard to figure out exactly what's going on. Second, no movie has subtitles and you are forced to watch a dubbed movie - although "Il Prezzo del Potere" seems to have a better oak. Personally, I always prefer subtitles, but it's not a problem for non-purists. However, these DVD problems are not the fault of the original filmmakers - just a careless package that is sold four decades later. As for the film, it is the assassination of President Garfield. This is a major issue because Van Johnson looks just like Garfield as Judy Garland. She doesn't look like Garfield in any way. He lacks a beard, has a bad color and hair style and is by no means so close (believe me, I am an American history teacher and we are paid to know what things are!). Real Life Garfield was a Civil War general and looked like guys on the cough boxes of the Smith Brothers. Plus, using any other actor to provide a voice for Johnson in dubbing is simply surrealistic. Never before or since Van Johnson sounded so pretty macho !! He was a great actor ... but certainly not a convincing general or a macho president. In addition to the stupid cast, President Garfield's death was by no means like this movie. Obviously, filmmakers are actually choosing crazy speculations about conspiracies about JFK's death, not Garfield. Garfield was shot in Washington, DC (not Dallas) by a solitary shooter with severe mental problems - not a group of men with rifles. However, according to most experts, what actually killed Garfield (over two months later) were incompetent physicians - who probed and probed and probed to obtain a bullet (to no use) and never bothered cleaning their hands or tools in the process. In other words, just like George Washington (who was basically killed by repeated bleeding when he suffered from pneumonia), he died due to neglect of due diligence. They had nothing right in the movie ... nothing but President Garfield was actually shot. Because the film has almost no resemblance to real history, it's like a lesson in history, as taught by someone from another planet or someone with a severe brain injury. Why not ninjas, fight robots and Greek gods when you're on it?!?! In addition to some decent gaming and production values, because the scenario is totally cow, I do not recommend that anyone watch it. It's just a complete and utter mess.
