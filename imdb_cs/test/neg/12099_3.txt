Cheesy 80's horror co-play genre favs Ken Foree and Rosalind Cash along with Brenda Bakke are some of the featured players in this story of the scary health club. Goofy dialogue and some nasty gore effects make this movie traceable. It's not bad, but no big shakes. <br /> <br /> Recommended for bad dialogue and action. B. Movie fans only. <br /> <br /> B
