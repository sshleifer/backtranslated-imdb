Making American divorce with more money than brains buys a neglected villa in Tuscany. (Much more money, while she has to change for a price, then she can cook luxury buffets for her workers and wander around Italy indefinitely without work or obvious means of support.) There is endless boredom and an inevitable Italian lover; this is a cub that moves in this pejorative sense. Lane acts as a poor quality clueless teenage ing√©nue - which dynamically interferes with her serious-looking gaze - along the path breaking into various (mostly Italian) cardboard stereotypes, dykes, divas, senile contessas and gigol between them. Most absurd sketches, the most sensual being the clumsy-embedded and pointless recreation of the fountain scene in 'La Dolce Vita'. (A similar conceit has been used in an effective and appropriate narrative context in 'Only You', Norman Jewison's tremendously excellent ode to Italy and romance). The "Tuscan Sun" can be the most comprehensive film of the last decade, despite its panoramic views of Italy.
