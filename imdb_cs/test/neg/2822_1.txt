Sex, Drugs, Rock & Roll is undoubtedly the worst product of Western civilization. Monologues Are Uninteresting and Nonsense In a rare monologue that captures the attention of the audience, it quickly disappears due to too long repetition and unnecessary additions (Hells Angels comes to mind on McDonalds) I think Bogosian's male man needed some filler material to give length, o who thought he justified the price of admission. I'd rather sleep with my aunt and be hung upside down and exhausted from my blood before seeing sex, drugs, rock & roll again.
