It looked very much like CHILD'S PLAY except for a lot worse. A lawyer tries to save a criminal who was convicted of killing his son from execution. He will not succeed. The lawyer's daughter then finds a puppet that the killer buried with his son and is immediately attached to it. After several people are seriously injured, they find that the girl secretly talks to the doll and says she has not hurt anyone. During this film I found myself asking myself, "Why did I watch this booze?" Again and again. The end sucked so badly that I went and watched the version of Disney's cartoon right after I slept with the light.
