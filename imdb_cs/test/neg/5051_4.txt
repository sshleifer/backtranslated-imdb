The only reason I watched this movie for the second time was to learn the name of the "second banana" girl playing opposite Katie Holms. Her name is Marisa Coughlan. I've never heard of her. She is amazing. Interestingly. With an animated face and a cute point, he's very vigilant ... He's right, "Poisenality" ... More than just a moment of vibration Grace Kelly ... with youthful enthusiasm. I think it's Irish in the gene pool (my favorite female DNA), so it makes sense that it would look like the most beautiful Irish American. The film is remarkable, Katie Holms is a classic beauty in the body. But Marisa Coughlan is the one you watch with your eyes. In 1999, when this film was made, she was about 25 years old. This reminds me of another stupid, worthless film whose only redemption is Pretty Girl in it. It was a "career opportunity" when I first saw Jennifer Conoly. Or "Grease II" first saw Michelle Pfeiffer.
