CONGO is probably the worst movie about big 90s budgets. It is so bad that it is observable again and again. A bunch of people with different agendas probes deep into the darkest of Africa, where they meet the temple of wealth, as in the myths of the SOLOMON kings - but with the cannibalistic gorillas that guard the wealth. On their side, people have a "talk" gorilla named Amy who helps save the day in one place or another. So much for the plot. Dialogue throughout is ruthless, almost uniformly cruel, certainly campgrounds (Tim Curry and Ernie Hudson are both at hand to ensure the ham factor) and the special effects of the abysmal. Wait until you see cannibalistic gorillas. And lava! Oh yes, did I mention that there is a volcanic eruption that results in a grand final? Laura Linney of all people is for this most challenging ride. What could she have thought? That's okay at the same time she appeared with Richard Gere and Ed Norton in PRIMAL FEAR, which helped her guarantee her star.
