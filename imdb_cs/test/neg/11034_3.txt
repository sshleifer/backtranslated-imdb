What did Rajiv Rai do for himself? Once hit by the director of movies like Tridev and Vishwatama is now making one bad movie after another. I was initially excited to think that Rajiv Rai had returned to the action genre, but that soon disappeared. As a Rajiv Rai fan, I thought I should at least leave it, but I left after an hour. One of the reasons I left the movie so early, so the amount of film in the movie wasn't in Rai's previous project. Many directors have tried Pak-basing, but I wasn't expecting from Rajiv Rai Another drop was music. Rajiv Rai has always had good music so far. There is only one good song, and that is Tere dekh dekh Ladgayan. The performances are not up to zero, even from Rai Loyalist Naseer-Uddin-Shah. Avoid fare from my favorite director.
