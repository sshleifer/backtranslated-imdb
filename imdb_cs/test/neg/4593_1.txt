"Speck" was apparently intended to be biopic related to serial killer Richard Speck. There is, however, not many killing to be found in this film, and none of it is explicitly shown. Perhaps the most disturbing scene in the whole movie is when Speck stamps one of the eight unhappy nurses to death in their own bath, but that is only implied, and not shown, except for a few unconvincing downward blows from Mr. Speck's legs. The most entertaining part of this movie is most likely a voice-over that should be a testimony to the mind-insensitive boring nature of this film. Every aspect of this film is terrible. If you don't want boredom, don't bother. This movie just hours in 72 minutes, but that's like eternity.
