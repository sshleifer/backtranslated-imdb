Cyclone is a piece of dreck with little redeeming value, even on such a bad front. My friend took the tape from the overflowing shirt on St. Vincent DePaul. Well, that might be a bit risky, but it was supposed to be a dress shirt, not a lousy old VHS basket, something less fortunate members of our society don't really need to make their lives better. It could be considered mercy. Watching a movie like a cyclone would really only add to their problems. The basic assumption of a woman with a super powerful motorcycle, which is equipped with rockets and lasers, is not even properly used. The two "high speed" sequences of pursuits include vehicles that run less than about 40 KMPH hair boosting speeds, and a super fast motorcycle that is in danger of being overtaken by a lousy old estate is not what inspires you when you get down. it. There is only one scene where the wheel of a goofy weapon is used, at the top of the film, and it is ridiculously ineffective, or just laughter when it is. This includes laser beams that look like they should come from the hands of the evil sword wizard and witchcraft of the 1980s, which caused great flashes of flame that seem to have no significant effect on their targets, even if they hit directly. The rest of the film is difficult to follow the fill. Lots of bad actors, yes Combs and Landau suck in this, most of them seem as if they were picked up from a porn movie set standing around exchanging a really bad dialogue in a desperate attempt to pus forward barely a coherent plot. There are several badly staged combat sequences and some unbearably unreal comic relief scenes with some cops and the owner of a motorcycle repair shop. Comedy Subny Benny Hill Horny old man can't stop staring at a woman leading a chest variety. Basically, the "money" is the scenes that relate to the motorcycle, actually little and lame, and the rest is the clumsy filler material. Skip it.
