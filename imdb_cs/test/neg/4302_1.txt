Just as we can welcome a movie that deals with people who have different challenges in the field of romance, I can't get rid of the feeling that this movie was intended to be a movie with direct access to the C video, in which either A) the actors made explicit Scenes or B) Manufacturers ran out of money to rent inserts (a great thing if it was true). I had to go back to sensation. why I rented it on Earth, which was due to the undeniable amateur credibility of the blister packs that seemed to suggest that John Waters humor-fest humor with a sexual theme. Well, I laughed a few times and certainly had a sexual theme (though most of them could never be described as stimulating). On some movies, however, you can rewind to make sure you have heard the dialogue correctly - in this case you are fast forward because you already know what they will say. But there is nothing that can be quickly moved forward, so fast forward on the shelf.
