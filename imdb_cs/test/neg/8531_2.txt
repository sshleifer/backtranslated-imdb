Well, at least we have to admit that the big Hollywood horror producers are finally smarter and more responsive. Instead of waiting patiently for the purchase of Asian horror hits and then reworking them in America, they have now found that they could simply hire Asian directors and assign them to make the brand new spirit story right in the States. It's like killing two birds with one stone; way to go guys! "Messengers" is largely identical to any other supernatural cooler that has come out of the Oriental lands since "Ring". Roughly translated, it means it's a boring, elongated and totally gore-free movie, but it contains a lot of false fears and embarrassingly weak "have we scared you yet?" moments. The Pang Brothers (Danny & Oxide) have previously made an extremely overrated "Eye" and it's a tradition for them to build a story with clues and hints to the point where it's almost impossible to meet the expectations of their curiosity. viewers, but they do not seem to want to change their formula soon. And they are also ruthless to recycle the same old and repeating themes of ghosts again and again. Restless ghosts of previous residents trapped in the walls of a distant farm? The protagonist family torn by untreated traumas from the past, so that they must first restore faith and mutual trust? Give me a break! Throw a videotape and a seven-day curse, why not? Even trying to jump into your place is too déjà-vu and won't scare anyone over the age of 7. Door slamming, dirty and increasingly growing stains on the walls, creepy appearance, noise coming from the cellar. The endless overuse of cheap tricks like this is almost offensive to horror fans. "Messengers" revolve around the family on the road to a new life in the country as sunflower growers. The situation in the family is somehow inoperable because a personal tragedy (which is not revealed until the end of the film) has caused their youngest son to stop talking and parents distrusting their rebellious teenage daughter. Soon after, children will experience a strange presence in a remote farm, but they will not be able to persuade their parents to leave. That's almost the end of the film. Little Ben sees things but can't talk and Jessica repeatedly attacks supernatural forces, but nobody listens to her. The basic assumption of "The Messages" is largely derived from the immortal classic Stanley Kubrick "The Shining", but it lacks a sinister atmosphere and a disturbing tone. The script is taken too seriously, although it is relatively easy to predict the final denouement and the total absence of violence and bloodshed is unforgivable. At least "Eye" at the end brought some real shocks, while the joyful joyful joy of the end of "Messengers" is only pathetic. The only positive elements I can think of are the beautiful rural filming locations, adequate editing work and the promising young acting talent (and beauty) of Kristen Stewart. And there is a mysterious but unfortunately insufficiently developed supportive role for William B. Davis.
