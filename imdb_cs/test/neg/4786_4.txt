People seem to be attracted to shows that show poor lives that have no purpose at all. For me, I give NBC sincerity for their desperate efforts to make new changes to TV by making songs laugh free. They seem to always find great success, such as the Office. When I first started watching, it seemed to me that it could be a potential hit. But after several episodes, I really felt like going to church and donating every penny to my entire bank for the pathetic people who presented themselves in these low lives, the poor, the shameful areas. And the end, where together they show Earl and brother in bed, it seems to me that this show is trying to show the bad side of life like street beggars or people trying to pay rent and have no sense of the real world of normal people in society. It seems to me that I am always disgusted when I watch the dirt in which people live in this show. It's like Venice Beach, California, beautiful, but so much hobo. Believe me, I'm not a rich man, middle class, not a pure fool, or a little sloppy, but it seems to me that the show just can't come out of all those horrible people who go there, have one leg. I just want them to show a little more class, not all dirt and poverty and trailers and just below average life, it just makes me difficult. For me, this show is nothing more than a show of what to do in life, what is not. It also shows that education is the most important thing you can have because apparently these two don't have an ounce of smarts. This is schmuck-u-mentary.
