This film has so much in it. Prehistoric society, adventure, romance, true brotherhood, violence, sex, religion; all displayed abundantly .. without saying a word !!! And how come it's so bad? This film will lead you to rethink the origin of mankind. If it were an anthropology product, they would rather resist Darwinian theory and Hegelian synthesis. You can't carry to watch it even if your brain shuts down. And now you think, "I have to see it." I warned you. I do not accept any responsibility if you regret spending more than an hour looking at this work of art. Well, I warned you. This should be forgotten and buried forever.
