First, the Mexican werewolf in Texas title is misleading as many others have pointed out. It's actually about El Chupacabra, which is similar to a werewolf, but it is by no means the same. When it's over, I probably wouldn't be able to provide a very accurate description of what exactly Chupacabra looked like, because whenever it was in the scene (despite one or two exceptions), the camera turned to everyone, the monster is clearly visible. Special effects were ridiculously bad, but this is to be expected from a low-budget horror movie. <br /> <br /> Along with terrible production, bad actors come. Now the couple is giving a rather credible performance (Erika Fay and Martine Hughes), but then there were bad actors (everyone else) who seemed to have no emotions when people died. Then there's an absolutely terrible actor (Sara Erikson) who gives one of the 2 worst performances I've ever seen in the movie. I mean God, she was indescribably wrong. The story was very simple. Basically, Chupacabra is in the small town of Texan, where it kills locals and a group of adolescents stop it. However, even if this plot is this simple, a couple of holes have escaped. By the way, a horrible movie. However, if you are looking for a movie that would have fun with you one evening and laugh with friends, it would be pretty good. My friends and I had a good time watching it. Probably the second worst movie I've ever seen, 1/10. Terrible.
