The storyline of the film is very simple: the viral outbreak turned the population into corpses that fed the body. Those who left have become "hunters." First of all, it's not the worst zombie movie. The worst are "Zombiez" and the infamous "Zombie Lake". In fact, I think the idea of ​​"Quick and the Undead" was very good, just bad. Given the budget they had to work with, this film looks very good. I wasn't bored while watching. Special effects were solid, even though they used CGI (fat zombie that got into the head) once, but everything else (gore, guts) was good enough. But behavior is terrible. Our main guy looks like young Clint Eastwood, other "actors" aren't worth mentioning. When it comes to conspiracy, they didn't work enough to develop the story. Bad: acting, low budget. Good: special effects, movie idea. Overall, this movie deserves 4/10 from me. It's not as bad as people say. Imagine ZOMBIE WESTERN, then watch this movie.
