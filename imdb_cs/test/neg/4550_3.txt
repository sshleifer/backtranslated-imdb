If you like soap-series, you may like this movie. I recommend this movie to fans of Dutch series like GTST, Westenwind or even American stuff like The Bold & The Beautiful. If you don't like such things: stay away from this movie. It has the same kind of visual style, the same quality of acting, directing and writing. The film was a big hit on the domestic territory, but was not sold anywhere else outside the Netherlands and Belgium. Quite so special for a commercial movie like this. Maybe it says something.
