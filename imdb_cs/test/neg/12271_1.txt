For those of you who don't remember movies - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080120/ - it came out in '79 (I think enough time, so naturally Nunzio thought he could just re-do this and said he wrote it - yes, right!). Negotiations in this direction are overboard - "tough guys" walk around with their shoulders bent forward and giving the impression that they are bigger than they are. Indeed, even a "hero" seems to have a passion for snorting, and rolling eyes in a bug-eyed kind of way to express anxiety / anger to the celluloid eye. There is some kind of racial message here, from the Sicilian perspective (you think this is about a third generation by line ... the original "wogs" came to the OZ after the war and during my childhood - yeah I'm Aussie - "it was a lot of dilution - it even sounds like a real blue Aussies - nowhere is the flicker of" dago accent "anywhere (there is another slang for ya, nun!) Maori with sunnies (sunglasse) ) at 4 am - must be cool to be sun-blinded in the middle of the night and it seems that Redfern is at the lengthy end of the movie. Nunzio tried to copy the taste of the fighters, but he left too many holes in the story. What about coincidence? The warriors had a gang of baseball guys controlling bats, with white-faced make-up chasing heroes at the train station and fighting them - Nunzios gang chased at the railway station gang stick to control the guys wearing whitish masks. The fighters were wrongly accused of firing / killing another gang member - the Nunzios gang is wrongly accused of rapeing a sister of a large Maori gang boss. Warriors are lured into the room by a gang of girls attacking them - the Nunzios crowd wants to crash in the friends' house that is inhabited, the yep, a gang of girls - there are almost too many copies from Warriors to stay around. I'm sad that people don't want to see other moves from OZ because of this class - how about Mad Max - Commander and World Champion? Not all films are made by actors who are so bad that they have to fund their own movies. As for the other actors in this show, they seem to have taken their instruction from "Nun" because everyone is as bad as the others - don't bother with this movie! I can't get my money back - so save my!
