Is Cannes a controversial meter remarkably esoteric, or is it that we Americans are so insensitive and cynical that we never bother to read between the lines again? Whatever it is, with a lot of careful analysis, "Falscher Bekenner" does not seem at all to be confused about the controversy he allegedly brought to Cannes in 2005, a mysteriously dull and aimless film that lives up to being American rebel. -title ("Low Profile"). Building on familiar Bourgeoise angst themes and subsequent sexual liberation (of a kind), it's definitely a film that is not without its surface interests. It starts with grabber because the haunted shot of a desolate off-highway road focuses on a juvenile rogue who eventually walks in the sum of a car where a supposedly brutal hit-and-run has left the driver dead. bloody mess. Amazed, he does nothing but pick up the scrap of the remaining engine. Just outside school, drifter turns out to be Armin Steebe, a product of German suburbs with minimal ambitions. Steadily exerting pressure on his caring, but somewhat annoying parents to find a good job, he keeps the conversation after talking to each promoted interviewer with him, each with the same infertile result. When this happened to him, his highway meeting soon called for his first act of rebellion: he declares responsibility for a crime he did not commit. He pretends to fill more applications and will be an increasingly bizarre interview at sunrise, participating in road sexual fantasies and tiny vandalism after sunset. As the days get shorter and the nights are much warmer when they live in their suburban surroundings, as if doing nothing unusual. <br /> <br /> If you feel what's going on, don't be afraid to be the only one: it's as far and coherent as the story gets. The story seems simple enough, and perhaps due to its seemingly direct goals, "Falscher Bekenner" becomes meaninglessly complex, becoming in love with endless false conclusions, dream situations, and graphic sex scenes to attempt to enlighten a story lacking clear logic to a vague argument (allegedly soul-numbing effects of modern suburban wasteland, or something about youth fascination with crime. Spends a lot of time creating many symbols, both tangible and surrealistically allegorical, but they don't really symbolize anything interesting. <br /> <br / The most serious mistake, however, is how filmmakers paint all the characters in a rough vanilla shade, barely distinguishing features to help understand their purpose, and how the secondary characters (especially the confused relationship between Armin and his rather normal - perhaps even too normal family) catalyses so little r an "underdeveloped" situation that is still underdeveloped. How do we identify with the rising of this young adult, with little sense of the world he lives in, or with the prominent figures that make him up? Many people leave the film and leave it (including Armin's friend Katja, and a strange, rich visitor who for some reason finds the pleasure of watching the protagonist eat biscuits) and it seems that There is no reason. Eventually, they seem to be a prolonged pad for a slim story with nonsensical undercuts that continue to prove that the film draws a blank space on where to go. And even a movie that allegedly plays with reality (especially with Armin's night-time exploitation) ends with a literal, almost moralizing-scratching head that seems to stop questions on a "story" that does little but build it into a state of meaningless exhaustion. Without any color, it is not possible to overshadow anything that is important.
