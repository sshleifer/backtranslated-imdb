Professional production with quality actors who have never touched the heart or funny bones no matter how hard they tried. Good casting, a sharp environment and excellent kinemetography made you hopeful about Fargo or High Plains Drifter, but sorry, the soup had no spice ... or meat. And 3 (10) for effort.
