I had great hopes for this after reading the back of the DVD: "In the Spirit of American Pie and Animal House ..." After suffering, I realized that I had chosen only $ 2.50. This movie started slower and only slower ... the short and ephemeral moments of the Levity showed it was in the spirit of American Pie if you mean "spirit" as a dead thing. not too fun or fun! Don't be fooled as if I were, and expect something barely noticeable because this movie will be more than fun to you. "It is necessary to fill in three more lines for this stupid movie that does not deserve any trouble ... what a stupid piece of an ignorant crusader. This movie has started, even a short nudity!"
