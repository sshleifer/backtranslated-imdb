The sound is terrible, the picture is worse than worse, acting is terrible, the female lead actress is plump and the story is ... wait a minute ... There's no story ...! The plot is really bad and the title of the movie is misleading. If you expect to see Piranha, you may be disappointed. This film has nothing to do with Piranh's 1978 and 1981. Actually, I can only think of one scene involving Piranhas. The only thing I liked about this movie, except the fact that it only runs for about 85 minutes, is the song at the end. It is written and sung by Jim Stein and is called "Love all the things that love the sun". <br /> <br /> I don't recommend this movie. It's so bad that it's not even funny to watch. After the first 20 minutes, I fell asleep and I am the person watching something.
