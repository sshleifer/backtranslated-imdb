I can't understand why you should give this movie over 4 ... Enough to come back to the 80's and the "good old days of horror comedy" but that genre hasn't improved since then - it's still 'LAME Low budget - low tech - bad story - not scary at all and it's not funny ... in fact, it's not very good that I could say about it. The so-called monsters are just horribly wrong! I mean, we came back when they were made of plastics and shot scenes in the frame ... I really don't understand why anyone would invest some money to get this script into the movie - but I think it could be almost okay if it was a bigger movie budget. <br /> <br /> Recommendations would be - please don't make a mistake by wasting your time if you don't want to get tips for bad Halloween make up! Personally, I like independent movies and anything outside the box, but that wasn't for me at all.
