I appreciate the satire that goes against my own thoughts, but it must be funny and well placed. This movie is ... how can I explain it. It's not the slightest attempt at subtlety, much less intelligence. In fact, it is scarcely horrible. Dead soldiers come to life, but they are not interested in the brain, only in voting booths. Why? Cue a never-ending stream of the dullest, banal, bloated windbags of "bad president, bad conservatives, bad Republicans." What is a self-indulgent, schmaltzy, maize piece of beef dung. Although he agrees with the "points" of the episode, only stupid liberals would say he enjoys watching. Then again, assigning a degree of stupidity to a crazy, angry, hostile, antisocial, and anti-anything halfway to a normal liberal spectrum is a high challenge in itself. Avoid as a liberal convention.
