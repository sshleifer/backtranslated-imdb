What an uninteresting hodge-podge. It could have been more, but there was no imagination in the script or direction. His wife and her lover are for murder. Conspirators do quite a thorough job of making him look guilty. But the man (Richard Thomas), whose psychiatric records reveal him as "stable" and "unimaginable", can escape from prison, defeat him on a conspiracy beach house, and secretly record a conversation between them in which they reveal their guilt. Then he accidentally drops the tape recorder with all the evidence of it into the sea water, but manages to load it. He shows a heck of a lot of creativity and improvisation skills for an unimaginable guy if you ask me. The tape is now a damaged item, but it's enough to break down the wife's lovers and he sobs out of his confession. Bad people are punished. Good people are saved. <br /> <br /> On-site photography is impressive. The beach house is nothing more than a wooden exterior that is fired on Fort Fisher Battlefield on Cape Fear Peninsula. The house was pulled down immediately after the packed production. <br /> <br /> It's a nice place. Unfortunately it's a bit hard to see because someone seems to have shot every scene through a pair of pantyhose stretched over the camera lens. It's all very fuzzy. And for all the natural splendor of the place, the viewer never gets a real sense of place, what sand feels, the texture of gray bark on dwarf evergreen. Acting is fine, but artists have nothing to do with it. Best performance, as is often the case, is Dick Olsen as a lean but not unsympathetic advocate. Virginia Madsen radiates infidelity with every rhythm of algae. Ted McGinley is within his reach as an immoral weakness. <br /> <br /> The music score neatly combines ominous with mysterious and effective. If you want to listen to the original from which it was ripped off, rent Hitchcock's "Vertigo" and listen to the exciting theme of Bernard Hermann. utter boredom.
