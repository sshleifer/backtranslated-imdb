I watched Halloween episode ... oh my god, I wanted to die. The deal was just terrible. The lines were utterly unconvinced. It's also a bad show idea, I mean, who would watch a web show like that in real life? Miranda Cosgrove was great at supporting the role in Drake and Josh, but she doesn't have the power of character to anchor her own show. I'm even more upset because her departure is the main reason Drake and Josh have finished. She was approached by her own show ... jumped to the ship Drake and Josh. Then they decided that they could do something with Drake and Josh in college, explaining the loss of Meagan as a character, but Drake had thoughts that he would go on to bigger and better things, and when Miranda did it, why he couldn't. He. The best part of the performance was a thematic song ... catchy, good melody in the mud of mediocrity. Of course Drake Bell dubbed Miranda's voice for the whole thing and wrote a tune ...
