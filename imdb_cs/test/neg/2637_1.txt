Stay away from this movie at all costs. I bet on watching this movie at stake to see which of us knows the "worst movie ever". Needless to say, this won hands down. It is long and drawn and has no purpose or conspiracy of what I can gather. A film about a killer boy grown from a fetus that has been grown outside the uterus has no place in your vcr. If you are extremely bored and you have no life to watch this movie. But if you prefer to keep common sense, stay away.
