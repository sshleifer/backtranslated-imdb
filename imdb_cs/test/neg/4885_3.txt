I'm trying to watch 3 bad movies in a row to see if watching 3 bad movies in a row could bring amnesia. Now let me go down the points Music score: poor quality, but at least it suits Story: it's about the guy who goes to town and he meets his sheriff's brother and they fight for the farmer's land and he allies with the Mexicans drive them it out and Trinity and his brother are trying to teach them how to defend her - the last scene of climate warfare will confuse anyone who is #### good guys Conclusion: better than I thought, but I have to go ahead to Watch Dolph Lungren and Jean-Claudde Vanne Damme "Universal Soldier" Pray for My Common Sense
