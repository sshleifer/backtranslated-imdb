My first IMDb post must (unfortunately) warn others not to waste time with The Cavern! There is no story, no character development, no fears and no good lighting. That doesn't make any sense. If you like bad acting, people run through small parts of caves, bouncy cameras represent bad angles, and people shout while the screen is in complete darkness, you'll love this movie. I could turn off the lights in my house and scream too, and I wouldn't have to pay for the rent. The only thing that frightened me was that someone actually made the film so horrible. one of the worst movies I've ever rented.
