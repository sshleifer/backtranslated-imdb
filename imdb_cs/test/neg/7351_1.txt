I agree with "SpecialAgentFoxMulder" that this episode is terribly the worst of the show. Now I'm not excited about the many episodes of the later series, but this takes a biscuit! It was rude and unofficial. As for the end, I'm sorry, but it disgusted me more than other combined episodes. I mean, the boys think they meant it well, but the ending was so exciting - that they thought the whale was on the moon and we saw over the credits that he died. Wht could save the episode was if the pranksters were able to confess for what they did. <br /> <br /> There seems to be no outgoing message. Okay, South Park can be guilty of too much preaching and always nice to see one unexplored (eg Make Love Not Warcraft), but this episode was just bad!
