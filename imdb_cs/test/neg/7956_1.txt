Deepa Mehta, Arundhati Roy and many other so-called intellectuals gain the title of intellectuals because they love the depiction of India and Hinduism in the wrong light ... and Deepa Mehta makes money anyway. Anyway, Hindus are too gentle or afraid to protest against how Muslims are protesting, so everyone can take any freedom with Hinduism. And that is the fact that during the 1930s, women in the West were also sick when they were widowed ... just that no one likes to point out anything bad in the West or anything other than India and Hindus. She paints incorrect views of India and the situation of widows there. Nowhere is it mentioned that child marriage is illegal. The film ended with 34 million widows living in India. Of course, there will be so many widows among a billion people. But how many of them live in the movie? Deepa Mehta finally sells India and poverty to earn dollars. How pathetic.
