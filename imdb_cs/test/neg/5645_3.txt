The growth of tax funds and sales and leaseback schemes has led to a number of unstable films that collect dust in laboratories and safes across the British Isle because they seem to be made purely because they meet financial criteria rather than any potential audience. Happiness has a few weeks on a small canvas in London before it goes to DVD, but The Riddle is characterized by the fact that it totally bypasses cinema, television, or even the rental market for the premiere as a free Sunday DVD gift. It is too easy to understand why it ended up literally gone. Except for a few defects (the mike boom is clearly visible in one shot) it is not particularly bad, and while Vinnie Jones comes as a modern British cinematography Freddie Mills Mills as a greyhound reporter who wants to move to a crime table and supportive cast from ham to vague nobody is characterized by being either extremely good or extremely bad: mediocrity is more of a norm. The real problem is that, like so many sales and leaseback films, it's a "soft" movie - there's no reason to watch it. It exists because circumstances existed for it to be done, but it lacks speed or momentum ahead. It seems to be aimed at a Sunday theater television audience (even if it's shot in the Scope), but it doesn't. There are a few good ideas in this definitely inhospitable story of Charles Dickens' unpublished manuscript and some suspicious deaths in modern Limehouse, but the mystery is so painfully evident - how is the last-minute supernatural twist (you) I never guess who Jacobi's literate hiker really is what you guessed?) - that you almost expected Scooby Gang or Double Deckers to turn around to solve it. It's a very bad movie for all kinds of reasons: several cast members play a double role when they shouldn't play one, and the whole shock revealing the truth of Dickens' manuscript is totally confused because it's all told in the first Dickens. than the supposed character of the novel. The main murder in the film is clumsily integrated into the main plot, with the characters suddenly reminiscent of Vinnie that he is forgotten on that already already, ushering in ever more desperate last half hour that sees evil developer Jason Flemyng secretary puts some Rohypnol in Vinnie's drink so she can \ t have your evil way with you and leave the photos behind you to "look with your girlfriend," which would make her dream where she talks to Charles Dickens ("You're Charles Dickings" "What's in Name?") that offers a slightly less than likely suggestion that you "read too many books". But this is nothing compared to the finale that falls into total absurdity, with logic and common sense, which stands out completely from the window, as it looks like some bizarre tragedy in Jacobean revenge with small arms on the banks of the Thames, with two-day stars for Flemyng guests and Vanessa Redgrave appear to be somewhere else (Mel Smith appears in a one-day portrait, so it's clear that the "names" of the movie are mainly there for easy $ 10k or for their maintenance). The final picture of the film is so utterly absurd and absurd that it's almost so worth watching, though. One curiosity is in the first period for Vera Day, a prototype of Liz Fraser and basically a one-time base of British films from the 1950s - a bartender in hell drivers, a bartender in Quatermass II - promoted to owner here pubs while comedian Kenny Lynch in standup briefly appears to provide the best performance as an old school gangster. Oh, and late Gareth Hunt makes his last bow as - oh irony - coroner ... <br /> <br /> Just to complete the package, DVD freebie also included a trailer for the director 's next film with Vinnie Jones, Bog Bodies, Naff - looking British horror movie with transAtlantic scientists and Vinnie in Elmer Fudd hunter duck outfit terrorized reanimated 2000-year-old sacrificial victims from the nearest peat bog ("Be weyy, wewwy qwuiet: I'm hunting dwuids"). I can't wait ... <br /> <br One thing I can guarantee is that every Indian producer in the UK spends the next few weeks trying to figure out how much Mail he has paid for a DVD printing license (paid by Prince 250,000 for his new CD) With so many British tax shelters on the shelf and the hard money to find, this could become an interesting emergency market for British movies.
