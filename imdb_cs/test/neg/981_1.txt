In addition, I was on this film, shot in the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fleeing (mostly Mexican) Bangladeshi refugees running across the runway at Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point in our turbans, while we waited for another shot, one of my colleagues extras turned to me and asked me what would be a step. I told him it would be a remake of Lost Horizons, just as a musical. There was a long pause, then he replied: "Man, this film will suck". It seemed quite receptive to me. I had a good time and made a little money, but even with some interesting personal memories of this movie I can't sit the whole thing. <br /> <br /> If you've ever seen the movie "Swarm", you can pretty much have an idea. You will see a lot of famous and talented people wasting the idea that it's just a BAD. The thought seemed to be that if you throw enough money on the film and hire enough big names, then there's no need for a good story and good writing. Just turn a big handle, and the product comes. It's just not worth watching.
