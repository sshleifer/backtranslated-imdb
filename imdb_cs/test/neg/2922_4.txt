This movie would receive a much higher voice from me in general and I will talk about why, but above all, it gets four stars and should stay in four stars because the directors ridiculously tastelessly display rape and sexual assault. Not far from Oyama, he has sexually attacked a woman he had saved earlier, and while he briefly becomes somewhat confused about his actions, this attitude lasts only about five minutes before the loving adorce gets in and carries her character through the rest of the film. I know that many will argue that it is not so important in kung fu beat-em-up, and as a gender fan I cannot say that it is all so unusual, but that does not stop it from being totally tasteless every time that I see. But what I am saying in this movie is that it is a little refreshing to see martial arts, or even an action movie of any kind that does not provide the viewer with a real hero. behind. Oyama is portrayed as a rapist and murderer; a social outcast whose only student becomes wholly mentally unbalanced before being shot dead by the police. The final footage of the film will leave one feeling that Oyama himself is ready for a major breakdown and no longer seems to care for the woman he had previously attacked to love him, and has since followed him with the dog-dog devotion. Whether it was actually the intended message of the film or not, one can't help but feel a little hopeful that Oyama might be on the verge of suicide while the movie is over. It is a rare emotional treatment from the martial arts genre and its interesting to see a film that leaves you feeling that its violence does not need to be celebrated. If only a Bullfighter karate had to deal with sexual violence better, either by creating more emotional depth and recognition between the two involved, or by keeping it all together, it would be a more interesting film.
