Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really like (even jumped like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). So the fact that I came across "Mr. Magoo" should show that it is a piece of waste. To throw Nielsen as a myopic eponymous figure, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. It seems that the comedy of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two films by Jackie Chan) would make it a merry movie, but not; Looks like they just have people to do anything, and there's no real humor. So the original voice-tagged Jim Backus cartoon was good to see, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen also did much better, so there's no reason to waste time. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; They probably don't want to emphasize this piece of spam in their careers.
