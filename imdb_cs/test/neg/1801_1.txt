Joseph Conrad's novel, The Heart of Darkness, had a vivid sense of description that amazed this book. While reading this book, I had every scene completely pulled out in my head and I knew what each character looked like. This book had many pieces, and when I read this book, the puzzle seemed to be completed. After I finished reading the Heat of Darkness, I watched a movie that was in error. The film cut out so many essential parts. For example, in the novel Marlow he waited very long for rivets to come for him to repair his ship. That was a great source of futility. In the movie that was just left out. The film added other parts that were unnecessary and meaningless. For example, when Kurtz talked to Marlow at the end of the book, and Kurtz barked the monkey's neck and killed him. What purpose did this scene have for the viewer to apologize for the monkey? It is as if the writer did not read the whole book and just put the parts he read in the film. If I didn't read the novel before I watched the movie, I'd be totally confused. The book was amazing and it's really a classic in American literature, but the film could be defiantly nominated for the worst picture in the Razzie Awards.
