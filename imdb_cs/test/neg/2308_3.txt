I remember when "The Love Machine" was first released to theaters. I was only 13 years old, I was too young to see a movie release that was very ballyhooed, but not too old to take my mother's paperback copy of Jacqueline Susann's novel to school and pory over "naughty bits" with my classmates. Br /> <br /> Although I'm not sure what my problem was at that early age, but I was too much in the book. I bought and wore an "ankh" ring, as well as a paperback cover, and I remember perfume ads, "Xanadu", which was cross-promoted and featured clumsy in the film. Despite such an interest, I didn't really see the movie until a few years later. I should have kept things as they were. "The Love Machine" releases the worst of many bad movies adapted from Susann's novels ... which is of course the most fun to watch. His mistakes are many: from his jumping script, which jumps choppily from one incident to another with a nary connecting thread; his old, horny (wind instruments, i think) musical score ersatz Bacharach; flat, first embodiment; Boring Sexuality - I've never seen bathrobes that were so prominently in the movie. It's like a fetish! Whenever sex, nudity or something slimy is required, someone in a blue robe appears! Very strange, that; And certainly, a circus train of a terrible 70 years of fashion that are on the endless display. Poor Dyan Cannon's performance (which is no big shock anyway, but the head over the rest of the cast) is consistently undermined by the jaws they stripped off to wear. However, the main responsibility of the film is stoic, stone-like John Philip Law as (reasonably enough) Robin Stone, the object of every girl (and one over-top-burning male photographer) affection. The law is just terrible and stands out as if it had been pulled out of the street, handed the pages of the script in a hurry, and said to read the cold reading on the spot. Just lifeless! Not only that, but he desperately needs a blood transfusion or something. He looks wan and sick throughout and is several pounds smaller than most of his women costars. Robin Stone should be a piece, not a hankie. <br /> <br /> For anyone who finds the film that goes hard (it's somewhat slow according to today's standards), please keep up with the ultimate "battle scene". Here, Mrs. Cannon (balancing 23 pounds of teased hair) finally abandons her earlier starchy acting style and lets herself relax with this infectiously sad laugh, returning a truly unforgettable free space for everyone to become a movie clip. "The Love Machine", trying to compete with the "incredibly famous" Doll Valley "," The Love Machine "will finally do something right. Jacqueline Susann is a unique brand of basket. Maybe some of them own Rony Barrett's "Lovomaniacs" rights and revive this genre.
