I enjoyed the first "Toxic Avenger", but the sequel simply didn't work. There are some funny gags in the opening, involving house members for the blind, but around that point I was just bored. The sequel is also filled with much quirky, low-brow humor. This time it's not funny! Many of the gags revolve around crusty Japanese stereotypes. Almost every Japanese character seems to be chopping fish. Does everyone in Japan have fish? Troma movies are known to be more than a little disrespectful, but if you use humor involving racial stereotypes, at least do it funny. I can't laugh when I put the same stupid thing I saw a million times before! One thing I must appreciate is unreasonable nudity. There's even more gratuitous nudity than in the first. But overall, I was very disappointed and the movie ends with a lengthy chase that exploded and puffed me, dying of the film fading to black. At least there is one cheerful story from a movie that laughed at me. After the villain tells the line from Shakespeare to one of the local citizens, the citizen (elderly woman) replies: "F ** to you - that's from David Mamet." <br /> <br /> My score: 3 (of 10)
