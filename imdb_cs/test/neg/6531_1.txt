I came out of this movie and I did it only once before the Australian film Sweetie approached 20 years ago. After about three minutes, I felt like I was killing a man, and I just couldn't believe that this movie really showed anywhere and guessed what - it was nominated for two independent Spirit Awards. What???? No matter how realistic the dialogue may be (I will never use the word "Dude" again!) - who wants to listen to these conversations? I don't want to go to the movies to be upset, but that's all I got. The only good thing I have come up with is that if this film can reach Sundance and other festivals, everyone can. Well, wait, it doesn't have to be a good thing ...
