As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a fanatic fan of film, I made a terrible mistake. I went to see "The Women" Remake of one of my favorite favorites. I've seen the original many times, actually I own it. My rush to see a remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown." He must know what he is doing. Well, I don't know what to say. I don't understand what happened. Botoxed women are rather depressing matter. Meg Ryan, or anyone who played Mary - looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan ... another actress wearing a Meg Ryan mask - nothing that Norma Shearer did in 1939. is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce in farce. "Friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith are as detached as anything I've ever seen, and if that's not enough: Eva Mendes as a crystal, a character created by Joan Crawford in one of her best and most entertaining shows. Eva Mendes's casting is indeed a poster sign of how badly this business attempt has emerged. I didn't give him 1 respect for Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman
