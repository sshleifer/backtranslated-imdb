This piece of garbage belongs to the basement of some moldy old mansion where the light of the day will never be seen again. The only thing that was done on this junk was the admission price. I was just amused when credits began to end and I could free the auditorium. What is incredible hole; complete waste 1 and a half hours. When I die, I pray that I may return as a ghost and give the fever to the moron who wrote this foolishness.
