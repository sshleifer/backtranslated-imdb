I went to this movie really want - it headlined the film festival earlier in the year, and boasted an all-star cast. But (and you could say there was "but" coming) it's a film failure. The extraordinary character played by Sarandon and Walken is destroyed by cut and antiquity support. Turturro's performance is bland, and most of the comedy is overplayed. The recurring puppet show is unnecessary and several scenes are totally out of place. <br /> <br /> There are wonderful moments in the movie. A truly moving moment, several seduction and a few comedy colors really work. Unfortunately, they are overshadowed by a diffuse, incoherent scenario and some misbehavior.
