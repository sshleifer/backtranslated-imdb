I was so disappointed in this movie. I am very familiar with the case when I read not only Mark Fuhrman's book, but also a much better "Wealth of Evil: The True Story of Martha Moxley's Murder in America's Richest Community" by Timothy Dumas. Anyone watching MURDER IN GREENWICH should be aware that he is following Mark Fuhrman's story, not Martha Moxley's story. This film is nothing but a trip to the ego for Fuhrman. Just follow his character strut around as if he were the second coming (yes, even women). Actors playing children look too old for their roles, and flashes of the 1970s are completely unconvincing. If there's a hero in this story, it's Martha's family, her mother Dorothy and brother John. They had kept the case alive for two decades before Fuhrman entered it to create a name for himself. They, and Martha, deserve to have a true story told.
