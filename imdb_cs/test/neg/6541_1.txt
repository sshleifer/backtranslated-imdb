Most of the films are lousy with high production values, which is miserable without high production values. Which puts it away from the big pool of horrible movies. Just as bad as this movie, I had to respect Kathryn Aselton, who, if I believe that if she got the right scenario, she could probably turn to pretty good performance. She plays Emily's girlfriend to persistent doofus Josh, who often refers to her as "Dude" or "Man" in a non-ironic tone. But heres thing, Emily is a semi-trustworthy character which means Rhett will soon have to be added to the cast to cope with this almost plausible character with a guy even more absurd than Josh. When we first meet Rhett, we find he is "deep" because he records a lizard that is PROOF that sees the world "uniquely!" Rhett then shows Emily's tape, and in one of the incredible moments of Emily, she is stunned by this amateur lizard tape, WOW I believe it is how she reacts again without the sarcasm, even slightly implied. <br /> <br /> You'll be alerted from the opening scene that working with the camera will be lousy, opening up on a shaky close up Josh trying to win the audience by playing GOOFY! oh how free care this main protagonist is to act GOOFY! Ha-Ha. This film could be almost a case study of just how BAD movies can be (and how bad FAR movies get into the festival circuit, I think by comparing most of the film clusters this film probably seemed amazing). Br /> <br /> I believe that SXSW gave this film a small prize (oh south of the southwest, why you encourage it, its only cruel). But here's where this film gives a compliment, that's the best of the mumblecore movement. Don't forget all the other mumblecore movies that are sucked beyond faith, and generally included grotesque nudity and unintelligible bad play, but it's still good to be the best. I haven't seen a baghead yet, but it looks like they might have taken a few steps forward, at least to show it is acceptable, because even the Puffy Chair couldn't really hide the fact that it would suck. I got here by the way, Rhett is most likely not portrayed by a professional actor, much like Josh is most likely not a real actor, but rather a director (or director's brother, there are some mixed news). I think Rhett was a friend with friends and they said why you don't play with this guy named Rhett in the movie, the fact that Rhett is the name of an actor and character probably means the actor and the character are the same if I'm not mistaken. from the face, you would probably say he's attractive. So, like Rhett, Emily and Josh teamed up to bring the Puffy Chair to Rhett and Josh's father. Some things are happening on the road, bad acting, bad actors, a crappy camera, an attempt at meaning. This film would not be bad if it were not so blatantly persecuting a profound self-importance. The whole thing is amateur, if you can view this movie without paying for it, as if its a TV or for rent in the library, then consider looking at it just to see if you are like this super cheap movie-making style. I like what they do duplass' doing the whole movie with no concept, but I wish to make a movie that anyone would like to see.
