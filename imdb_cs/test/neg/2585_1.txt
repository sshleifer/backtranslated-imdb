Well, of course, everyone has the right to have a point of view ... everything. The presentation was interesting: black and white film, year 1968, student speeches, general strike, youth, ideals, love ..... etc. Sorry, but I didn't feel LOVE, ROMANCE. A lover who's okay that his girlfriend sleeps no matter who? It is love ? But not only that the movie is very long and without reason, I had to stop watching the movie several times because I just lost interest. I waited for something to happen, but ....... NIC. The only thing I was impressed with during the movie: The Gypsy violinist playing in the streets was nice. I don't think art should be complicated, encrypted, hidden in secret meanings, confusing. Great disappointment and a waste of time!
