Bugsy Siegel was 31 when he went out to the west coast. In addition to his dreams of Las Vegas, he fiddled with the idea of ​​acting. He was a good-looking guy and about 7 years younger than his friend George Raft, so it wasn't such a crazy idea. Warren Beatty was 54 when he made this film and, despite hair dyeing, is too old for this part. Beatty was wrong; Bugsy was supposed to be played by someone like Alec Baldwin. Bugsy was a tough guy, feared by his contemporaries; Beatty simply does not emit a threat. It was the vanity of the project for Beatty, who did not deal with the fact that he was no longer a leading man. Another great unpleasant mistake is Mantegna as George Raft. Raft had a distinctive voice and mannerisms from which no Mantegna even tried to cope. You never believe that Mantegna came from the streets. Warren Beatty and Robert Redford both pretend to be younger years using massive hair dye, and now it will be a shock to suddenly go gray and play the character part.
