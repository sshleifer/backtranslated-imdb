This is the worst movie I've ever seen. If I hadn't observed it for free, I'd never finish it. The creators of this film should be ashamed of themselves. It seems to be a Scary Movie and Date Movie (but a 10x better than this one) movie, but it failed. The only jokes in this movie seem to be based on grotesque. The guy falls, someone gets a bus, etc. None of the ideas is a clever, basically the worst assumption of a movie at all. The graph (or lack thereof) is completely slowed down. It seems that the plot is centered around the coach and his family, but there are so many other things going on in the film that it is totally ridiculous. Terrible, horrible movie.
