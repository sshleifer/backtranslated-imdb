Or is it otherwise under a masterpiece of masterpiece? Preferably both! Somewhere between 1969 and 1972, a lot of horrific horror movies have come, all of which are lost again. Nothing more needs to be explained, asked, or shouted out loud. If you've been following my writings about CARNIVAL OF BLOOD or GURU MAD MONK carefully, then you know what's in the SCREAM BABY SCREAM store. The name sounds cool; it's just a weak scenario that should go somewhere else! Even so, it's the hands down, the most abominable piece of filmmaking ever working on a movie! <br /> <br /> If you thought it was an early slashera (which is beneficial for an average IMDb user to write another comment), next time more luck! The true truth behind the screenplay has nothing to do with a film that allegedly tells that a psychopath who prays face to face "kills" and creates ugly faces on his victims. Looks like you're watching another early episode of "SCOOBY-DOO". My favorite scene is a monkey cage playing four young hippie teenagers. And let's go to the actress under the name "Eugenie Wingate" for giving us the worst on the face! 1969 has never been so bad, but it is! Try to find this thirty-year rarity in a convenient basement for five bucks; It's the perfect novelty item to return to those psychedelic bloom days of power, bad fashion, and cheesy music! Interesting note: SCREAM BABY SCREAM is also featured in Troma's film archives on the company's website. Only time will tell when it reaches the top of Bottom 100 List along with some other early 1970s; gosh knows they NEED !!! PLAN 9 is history !!!
