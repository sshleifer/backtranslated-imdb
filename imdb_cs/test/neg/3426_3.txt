Very hyped-up, slick, nervous reinterpretation. They got into "because it's modern, it has to be hyped-up, slick, etc." traps. "Romeo and Juliet" took the idea far more successfully, but I think it's time for us to get beyond two extremes (a piece period vs. a square film). Just because it is a "modern" narrative does not mean that a film must look like a magazine advertisement or has to do with drugs or weapons. Fine as honey words, Macbeth would be a much stronger film. As is, read your Shakespeare. Read it aloud. Ask your Oxford Dictionary for some questions. Skip the movie. Or not, but you were warned. <br /> <br /> Sorry for the extremely long review. IMDb did it.
