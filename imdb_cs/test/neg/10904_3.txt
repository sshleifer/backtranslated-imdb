If the clich√© did not bow, Mr. Shiban could really make a good movie out of this story. It was just different enough to be of interest to you, so for the same amount of time, energy, and money spent on this stinking material, we could have had something good instead of looking at it. Manufacturing-wise, it's as good as one could expect from a handheld camcorder, so it gets good grades. It's really a scenario that is to blame because acting wasn't that bad either with regard to what the actors had to work with. I thought the days were long gone when we saw someone, finding a radio transmitter that desperately want to operate, first turn every button on things from end to end, bash it on top 6 or 7 times, and then expect it to work. This story is destroyed by the continuous chain of silly movements of all characters except evil. It's like we think they're too shallow to understand all the plotter's devices, so we're all fed a spoon to make sure we get them. <br /> <br /> I don't know about you, but it doesn't work on me. My attention ends with being filled with conspiracy holes and over-dramatization, not a story. So, since I found it not so bad in technical terms, I think Mr. Shiban should try again with the next proper script; then he can give us something worth watching.
