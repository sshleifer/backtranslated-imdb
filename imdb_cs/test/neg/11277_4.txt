The previous IMDb reviewer said "Rafter Romance" is a "rip-off" (the second reviewer's term) of the German musical "Me By Day, You By Night". The reviewer does not seem to realize that * both of these films have borrowed their assumption from "Boxing and Cox", an English game written by John Maddison Morton in 1847. This game deals with two businessmen who rent the same room from reckless the owner, every person believes that he is the only tenant. Since these two men have different work plans, they will not immediately find out. This game was once so popular in Britain that 'to Box and Cox to' became a common term for an arrangement in which two people willingly shared one-person accommodation. Innovation 'Rafter Romance' (and its predecessor) is that two tenants are now a man and a woman who inevitably develops romance. As is usual in these ball-ball films, the guy and gal hate each other until they fall into their arms. Hoo boy. The owner of this film is George Sidney, an actor who specialized in playing Jewish stereotypes that were supposed to be nice. George Sidney has never been as annoying as the nasty Harry Green (Jewish equivalent of Stepin Fetchit), but Sidney's portrayal of Jewish characters is still exaggerated and embarrassing. The only remarkable thing about 'Rafter Romance' In my opinion, it's the oldest Hollywood movie that refers to Hitler and the rise of Nazism. At one point in this film, the landlord Eckbaum (Sidney) discovers his teenage son Julius involved in the swastika crossing on the walls. Eckbaum and his son are clearly intended to be Jewish. It is true that no one in Hollywood in 1933 had any real idea of ​​what Hitler had planned for Jews in Europe ... it is still surprising to see a film depicting a Jewish teenager who thinks swastikas are a joke. His father is quite angry with this depiction of the Nazi symbol. A very shameful aspect of Hollywood history is the documented fact that all major Hollywood studios continued to trade with the Third Reich. as late as 1939. Hollywood's main ladies were medically documented as 'Aryan' so that their films could be distributed in Nazi Germany and Austria. For the same reason, Hollywood leaders were documented as "Aryan and uncircumcised." Except for Darryl Zanuck of Twentieth Century-Fox, all of Hollywood's executives who dealt with this policy were Jewish ... but they clearly had no objection to trading with Hitler. I am surprised that 'Rafter Romance' contains a scene depicting the hooked crosses because this sequence would have made Verboten in Germany and Austria. (Maybe the scene was turned off for a German release: it's not crucial for a movie plot.) Besides, the movie contains nothing remarkable. Robert Benchley has his usual unfair characteristics: I have never understood this man's appeal. I'll rate 'Rafter Romance' 4 out of 10.
