I'm still not sure what the movie is about. I think the boy was afraid that he would become blind and imagine all kinds of weird things. however, this does not explain why he wanted to kill his new brother, or the relentless boredom in this film. you want to be blind while watching this movie so you don't have to see this experiment in futility. skip this smoking pile and opt for anything else in the video store ..... anything else.
