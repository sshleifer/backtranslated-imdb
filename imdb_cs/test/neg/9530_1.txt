Variety's reviewer said it was "overwritten and too long", and I agree with that. It has some events that seem to be forced and unlikely like Cal (Crudup again as 'lost, unoccupied and kind of dull' man) and Julianne Moore will find the US map in such an incredible place. The story is one of those 70s "guy has to find meaning in his life" stories, and I found myself imagining Jack Nicholson in his starring role as Cal. But the theme of "all the way to finding the meaning of life" is still a little interesting. Is that all really going back to the family? I wasn't so sure. Acting is fine, especially I liked Karen Allen and James LeGross, who unfortunately only have supporting roles. I'd give it 'five'.
