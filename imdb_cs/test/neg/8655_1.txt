I would give this movie 1/10. This film is free from common movie stuff and focuses too much on the current "skin trend" in Bollywood movies. I would definitely not recommend teenagers to watch this movie. I can feel how depressed I am, how could such an impressive banner as Yash Chopra Films succumb to such horrible production? Perhaps they have forgotten that there is a larger audience than an "adult" audience that, when exposed to this kind of gross films, can destroy its growing set of minds and succumb to things that have no meaning and recognition. > <br /> Overall, movies must not only be fun, but they also need to make sense. Sure, this movie is a huge disappointment for Yash Chopra fans, especially myself. I'm really disappointed with history, acting and everything else. Why can't people give some stuff that could be esteemed after the movie, at least once in the movie? It's clear. I would like to express my opinion in short: "Awful - Disappointment - Lots of Adult Material - Lack of Reasonable" Substance "- Lack of Normal Psyche - Worthless - Could Instead Catch Cornetto or Temptations Chocolate
