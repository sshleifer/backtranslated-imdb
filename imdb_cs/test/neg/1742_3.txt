I thought it was weird and bloody, not scary. I saw a couple of Japanese horrors, Ringu and Juon, and loved them; but this movie was disappointing. She never said anything about the curse. I just didn't see any horror ... it wasn't scary for me at all. All the while I watched, I waited for Kirie to reveal the secret of the curse and why it was happening. If it was an ancient curse, why didn't it happen before Shuichi's father? And she never told us what happened to her father. I waited for someone to tell us the meaning or the reasons for this curse, and then it ended. I was very disappointed.
