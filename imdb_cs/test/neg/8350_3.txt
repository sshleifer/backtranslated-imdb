Although this movie (and I use the term loosely) was made in 1997, we watched it tonight for the first time. My husband remarked that Tommy Lee Jones's movie, which we never heard of, made him a little worried. Still, I watched carefreely about Jones being in the movie, it must be at least two hours of my time. After all, he's one of our actors for years. Although Heche is not one of my favorite actresses, I was also reassured by seeing another familiar face. The list of perfect actors / actresses continued to grow, so I stayed more and more of this movie, sure that if I pushed enough clich√©s and trite social statements, I'd come victorious on the other side of the plot. Unfortunately there was no plot. There were still lying lies of lava lava burning. <br /> <br /> The characters were paper. The story was so full of jam that it literally dispelled me from most of the special effects and playing in the movie. Was the fee for a brief consultation with the elementary science teacher too much for the budget of this film? No acid rain ... no toxic gases (such as sulfur or hydrochloride) ... no deadly ashes ... no heat carrying heat just a few meters from lava. Wow ... it's the world's best lava! Events were no better than characters. Every incident was so fanciful and appealing ... it's like writers said, "Okay, we need to get rid of a little girl NOW" ... and poof, it is sprayed with a lava bomb that burns it so much that it is to be carried to safety (not from lava, but from his own helpless stiffness) ... but only a moment later he has no apparent pain in the car and soon after running through the (moan!) building that (oh no!) is about to blow up. After all this, your reward is a line from a little boy at the end (all the people who look the same) ... who must be one of the worst movie lines I've ever heard. Although it was not so painfully written, it was ridiculous timing for all the characters involved. Boy and cop aside, as if the mother was still in this area and should be alerted because she just doesn't talk ... what ... hopes to fall into the shadows and get away from once and for all? I do not think so. Obviously, the baby's mother will be missing or dead - or shouting her head to find her toddler. Black gangsta token A hard hoodlum with a secret soft point versus a chip on the shoulder of a narrow minded cracker cop with a secret scene from soft spots has caused my eyes to bleed. Even if such stalemates existed, they would not want to behave as the film shows them in the circumstances. Something about the impending fire death and massive destruction tends to catch people off guard, you know? There are too many movie moments like this to mention ... really, it's just an embarrassing movie to watch. The poor writers ... where are they now?
