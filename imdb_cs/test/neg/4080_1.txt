Should it be funny? This is one of those movies that just don't work. The first of them, Bruce Almighty with Jim Carey, had very funny moments. He didn't have one. Steve Carrell, who was brilliant at Bruce Almighty, can't deliver. His performance is very common and he can't take it like Carey did. One good thing about this is that I only paid $ 1.95 for it. It is a film for children ... very young children who have only seen 4 films or so in their short lives. It's interesting to note that where Jim Carey plays in the movie and makes a sequel without him, it's usually a huge turkey. Anyone Remembering Son's Mask? (IMDB Worst 100 Movies of All Time) Avoid this movie lover.
