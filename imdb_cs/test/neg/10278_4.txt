I watched this movie a few weeks ago and I have to say: I wasn't impressed, not at all. When it comes to good performance, I do a couple with other posters, but some good performances don't make a good movie. <br /> <br /> I found a review by an anonymous poster in the discussion forum that captured some of the highlights. He says, '' '' 'Poll' 'is a film that raises many questions, but a couple, a film that is disturbing and over every categorization attempt, experiment and very conventional sexual drama despite some shocking scenes, is hardly responsible. André Schneider, a partially impressive cut and good work with the camera (Steffen Ritter) complement the rough holes and some technical screams (especially in the sound), but the boring with which viewers have to deal with the 40 minutes leftover. " This is unfortunately true. I wasn't interested in the story. The protagonists are cold, people without ambitions. They do a lot of drugs and have a lot of (incestuous) sex. So what? For many times the direction seemed to be virtually non-existent, not to mention the technical aspect: poor sound quality was enormously disturbing. What is the meaning of the movie? What's behind all this? An anonymous reviewer said, "Some Biermann couldn't clearly identify, so the movie will hang in the air without a message. So boring I'm on the film blame. The film is reserved and without emotion, cold, almost neutral, and it doesn't take long for errors to appear : For long stretches, Sean and Ivy characters are not trustworthy (obviously having difficulty with English pronunciation), the character of a silent brother is not developing very well, though - in a scene where a calling boy is withdrawn (one and only true love), the intensity is reached that one would like to see the whole movie for a long time, and as a viewer, I have to regret the chances that were given to him, I have to agree again, the last scene I liked, especially thanks to the beautifully captured faces of Gianni Meurer and André Schneider, but boredom that I had to suffer in the first thirty minutes (but the sex scenes were aesthetically staged and perfectly adapted.) <br /> <br /> Overall Taken together, the "deed of deeds" was not my cup of tea - a good, controversial idea unnecessary - but it was interesting to see how the film can be made virtually without money. Maybe if they had a bigger budget and a more experienced director, it would be a better film.
