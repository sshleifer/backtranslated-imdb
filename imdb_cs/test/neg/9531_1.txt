I am one of those people who respect every filmmaker they have achieved, every film that I watch usually respect (even if I admit that I have carefully chosen) and appriciate on what it is. No longer. This is really one of the worst scenarios I've seen as a movie ... so much I felt compelled to warn others. The dialogue was really incredible, the main protagonist was about the last person I wanted to know more about. The scene was an old friend of the school 'says it's' is laughing at me just because it was a pathetic attempt to uncover the subtext of an already closed plot. The direction is the best and the worst in filmmaking by numbers. To compare this film with the atmospheric majesty of the film as Five Simple Pieces is travesty.
