This movie is a nightmare! The feeling you feel when you wake up from a nightmare is the same as I got when I watched this movie: "Uff? OK, it ended, what a relief!" I felt the pain following this movie, it was so bad! It's a low-cost B-series movie, that's for sure, but I don't think it's an excuse for it to be so bad! I was looking at brilliant cheap movies, with nice graphs, nice productions, nice acting and above all some stuff! This has nothing! The story is merry, almost like an "American guide on how to turn ancient Chinese mythology into a ridiculous teen movie, with some occult kids playing"? I don't know if the Chinese story present in this movie is real or not, but if so, "shame" is even worse! Production is just horrible, simple zero (What "special effects" are you?). There's no tension. The supposed "voltage scenes" are a complete failure. Negotiations are not better; and what about dialogues? Oh my god! A movie that has dialogs several times like: "I'll go there later, OK? It's okay" OK, okay. - OK? I'm sure he doesn't deserve more than a 1/10 score! Too bad to be true!
