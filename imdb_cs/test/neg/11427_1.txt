That's really one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's not funny at all. It simply portrays a lower class Northern British setting. I consider it a very sad movie in places, it should not be for others. One thing that really annoyed me was the proximity of useless objects that really slowed the pace of the movie. I just did it through the movie because I quickly passed certain sequences to the end. This film completely loses audience attention. This is a major problem in that there are several reasons for one action, which in turn tends to weaken this action. However, if there is one reason for one action, it makes it more passionate. Overall, this film is everywhere. I didn't know enough about the characters who should care for them because of shifting lines and stories where I might enjoy exploring the life of one character. For example, at the beginning when a man meets God in a bar, God looks like a great guy. The film could be worked out at that moment and I think it would be much more fun. Anyway, if that's enough, enough. Watch if you want, but I warn you that the movie is crap. I respect the creators who are trying to pull it out with such a low budget, but they could do a much better job. I think it all lies in camera movement and editing, acting was decent. But then again, that's just my opinion.
