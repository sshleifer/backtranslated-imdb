This film was to come up with a disclaimer that was similar to the Left Behind series. I didn't know it was a biblical film. I expected it to be a UFO movie and an alien abduction for fun. As the previous reviewer notes, it would be good to show up in a church, but not in a public theater, at least not without the consumer's prior knowledge of what the film premise is. I felt deceived by my $ $ spent for this movie because nothing in summary refers to its religious overtones. If you go to church, it will probably show some free time. Other than covering his actual subject, the film was fine in terms of acting and script. But I have to say that I went to the film in an hour when I saw the way he went and that I wouldn't have fun but preach.
