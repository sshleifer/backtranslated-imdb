This is undoubtedly the worst movie in the Hamilton sleigh and the worst actor to make Carl Hamilton. \ TPeter Stormare can not change it, with his psychotic look and no style at all. This type of role is simply useless. The presence of Lena Olin has not been used for this film. She couldn't save him from what he was: an American copy of big budget action movies like "Goldeneye", "Die Hard 3", "Broken Arrow", etc. This movie has nothing in it but an actor. some Norweagian director with McTiernan as a model director. Br /> <br /> The presence of Mark Hamill is just ridiculous. 2 out of 10
