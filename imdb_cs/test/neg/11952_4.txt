This film had all the possibilities and assumptions of a great feeling of a good, great love story ... the cast is perfect, working with visual parts, the original premise works, the characters work ... but the story moves from one chess to the next in the most predictable way ... not one the character in the film has no depth or any depth explained by the director. All we know about Catherine Zeta-Jones is that he's obsessed with his world ... no one is allowed and no one is questioning her world ... that much is obvious ... but the remaining characters have their own dimensions, they are never really explored or exposed .... Aaron Eckhart's character had a lot more to offer the story but was not allowed, Abigail Breslin's character is so easy to understand that her performance comes a bit predictable and fake .... in the end everything goes back to the violent stormy world of Catherine Zeta-Jones, which the audience never really falls ... frankly, her turbulent world is no more than a depiction of a selfish, confident, spoiled lady that most people in the real world will not have much time or sympathy. The director needed her to become a hero and never do it ... ultimately it's Eckhart's character who will eventually win because he wins. It's not a lousy movie, just a movie that could have been much better with more personalities, explanations, and revelations. Cheers
