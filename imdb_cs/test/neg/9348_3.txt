Wow. The story was simply incredibly stupid. I realize that this film was supposed to be a comedy genre. But even so, nonsense has to bring at least some vague kind of meaning. Water has become an incredibly precious substance? Well, that's strange, since hydrogenated oxygen (or oxidized hydrogen) is one of the richest substances in the universe. And quite easy. Glomp together hydrogen and oxygen atoms, and voil√†, water. <br /> <br /> Instead of water, the rarity of dilithium crystals or some such thingamajig should be used as a plot device as something that pirates would go after. Water as a plot device was just stupid, stupid, stupid. "Comedy" seemed strenuous and resourceful and forced. The comedy in the television series "Red Dwarf" was strenuous and forced and forced, but in fact it was fun. Here I felt happy when I said, "Ha ha, it was so funny, I forgot to laugh ..." <br /> <br /> Sigh ... all the money put in sets, costumes, actors .. what waste ... <br /> <br /> Rather than just whining and whining and complaining about being a lameness, my recommendation to make it better: 1) Use a credible device plot. 2) Get rid of "comedy". None of the actors was really good at it. The film would work better as a "serious" action adventure. The writers' obvious intention was to make the spoofs comedy, but they couldn't avoid it. It's not likely to follow it again. It's too big work.
