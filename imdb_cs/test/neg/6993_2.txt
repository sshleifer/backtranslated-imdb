So pathetic is not even funny. From the first scene in the movie, I knew I was at a bad time. Thank God, I saw this movie on TV only. The story was horrible, not to mention acting. It was terrible. In this movement, things have become very unusual and unusual. Mistress holds the whip and whips the guy a little bit and he just hands over the keys. I'm like GET REAL. The creators of a lousy attempt to make a futuristic city even deepened my resistance to the film. To tell you the truth, the only good thing in this movie was fighting, which was pretty lame in itself. All I could ask when I watched this movie was "when it will be gone!"
