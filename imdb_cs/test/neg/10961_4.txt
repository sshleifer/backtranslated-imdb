Well, here's a zombie movie that maybe isn't much of a zombie movie. The whole film is set in a zombie-plagued near future, but still a film with this concept very little. Instead, he focuses on a zombie hunter trying to get revenge and money back from a group of other hunters. What money is just as good when almost the whole world has gone to hell and the cities are mostly desolate. And why pay people money for killing zombies first. As if people weren't going to kill this dangerous threatening monster when they didn't get paid. Needless to say, the story of "The Quick and the Undead" is far from a tight story. Of course, it is not filled with the most logical and interesting moments, characters or dialogues. It's still not a terrible movie. Surely it is not as bad as some people are trying to believe you are. It's pretty good looking, or rather, that the film doesn't have a cheap look at it. Its effects may be a bit exaggerated, but still they are pretty good looking as well as makeup effects. The film wasn't what I was hoping for. His name might suggest that the film takes place in the wild, in the wild west, during cowboy days, but its name is only misleading, undoubtedly collected in cash. I fell for it, expecting this film to be a combination of western and cruel zombie-horror film. <br /> <br /> For zombie fans, this movie will be mostly disappointing when you watch. Of course, it does not add anything new to this genre, but it also does not have enough genre to be seen as a good watch. <br /> <br /> Not completely unnoticeable, but also far from recommended. . <br/> <br/> 4/10
