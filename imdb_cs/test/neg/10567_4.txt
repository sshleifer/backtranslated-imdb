From barely foreign sounding lasers, to a "Nightbeast" style primary school crash, it's better to classify as a fake blood and bare chest mix. The almost pornographic style of the film seems to be a failed attempt to recover from the lack of a coherent or effective story. However, playing is not nearly as brutal, many young, beginning actors show off their hidden talent admirably. Especially Don Leifert and Jamie Zemarel, who have thrown on this otherwise horrible film a well-needed shard of light. Nightbeast would never show up on the scene if he knew how horrible the film was about the talent of this small town of Maryland.
