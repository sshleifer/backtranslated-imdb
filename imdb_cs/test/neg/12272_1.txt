Let's face it, a really horrible movie, no ... I mean "truly" horrible movie, it's a rare, weird and beautiful thing to look at. I admire that there is a special place in my heart for movies like Plan 9 From the Space, Half Cast, Kind, etc. Although I give this movie 1, I urge anyone who has a bad movie for what it is. It really is (a bad movie) to find a friend, a snack, something to drink and to make a special occasion they deserve: Aussie Park Boyz. From the first moments of the lead actor to the lateral eye movement when trying to inject intensity directly into the film without ever looking at the camera (slice of ham directly from silent images) - Take your heart out of Rudolf Valentin) to the sudden hey-we're out-of-film conclusion, you ... don't ... stop ... laughing. To summarize the film up, his poor man is Warriors down, complete - and that description himself should be enough, but then comes the wonders of "spaghetti eating scene", "we" have tickets, now Don't Leave The City 'Scene', 'It's Asians! and more. The only really inadmissible part is rape filmed for no reason. Besides, let me watch this movie. And I dare to find evidence of acting or lines, or directing, or those other boring and redundant elements that so-called critics say the film must be considered good. If this movie doesn't cause an uncontrollable laugh before it ends, all I can do is threaten my eyes threateningly from side to side and shout: "You dog! You dog!"
