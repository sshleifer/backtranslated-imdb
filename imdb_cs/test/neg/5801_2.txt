All right, as someone might think this movie is amazing, it's over me ... I can't even understand how someone can remotely find this movie witty, the only character he has for him is the evil superhero game designer , and it gets old after a while. This movie is so predictable, punchlines aren't funny, they're forced to see better acting in the red light district, and the story sucks is so predictable, you know exactly what happens. Even the characters do not react as they should, try to go to the hot chick, who is your boss at work, and tell her to hit two crazy chicks with whom you live at the same time, her answer would not be (smile) "ok let's get back to work ". I wasn't once allowed during this movie, and I'd like to never see it or use $ 3 for a rental because it's not worth it. Adam Sandler made this film, I lost all respect for him. All his films are the same, his comedy style has been old since Waterboy came out if I knew Adam Sandler had made it before I rented it ... it's not a way of wasting my time on it. This movie is as bad as it can get from every aspect ... ace ventura wasn't a clever comedy movie, it didn't have a plot killer ... but it was original and it was merry. I'm not knocking on a movie because it has a 'low-level' humor, I'm knocking because it sucks, it's a piece of Hollywood crap. If this movie was presented to a production company and not "ADAM SANDLER" behind it, it would be thrown into the garbage faster than the used condom. If you want a good movie about pot culture watches Cheech and Chong, or Whitecastle. If you rent this movie, all you get is a generic comedy that targets children aged 14-17, with loud rock music on every possible cut that makes your eyes squint and your stomach turns, and comedy, which is equivalent to watching your stolen friend eat mcdonalds in an hour and a half. Don't do it ... for God's love ... this movie is angry, treats it, and watches all the Hollywood glory behind it ..... Hercules in New York was the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's actually so bad it is good. Instead, it was a very expensive movie that sucked in if not more.
