As this movie could be classified as Drama, I have no idea. If I were John Voight and Mary Steenburgen, I'd try to erase it from my CV. It was as historically accurate as Xena and Hercules. Abraham and Moses went to Noah. Lot, Abraham's nephew, Lot, appears thousands of years before he was born. The Canaanians wandered the land ... really? What do screenwriters think? It was just ignorance ("I remember something about Noah and the animals, Lot and the Canaanians and all those things from Sunday school") or tried to offend as many people on the planet as possible - from Christians, Jews and Muslims to historians, archaeologists, geologists psychologists, linguists ... in fact, wasn't someone offensive? Anyone who even had a taste for it would get this one!
