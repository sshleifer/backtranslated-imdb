Like many others, I was counting on Dennis Hopper to do it so that it didn't mean a complete waste of time. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Everything negative about this flic is more than true. But what's on the cake is a terrible, horrible story for the main character. Here's why: The planet could be destroyed, ONE way to get out of it, to save the entire human race. pleasant, competent people. And Dennis Hopper is a lone scientist / scientist with a vision that has been prepared for the worst and who realized it. But what is Stevens' main motivation (Sonny D'Angelo)? He is angry because Dennis has decided who is to be saved or condemned! While clearly explaining to Stevens that Dennis's character had done everything to warn people of danger, he laughed. Hopper's character was a boy with a finger on the dike, and now Stevens accuses him of choosing and choosing ??? And if that is not enough, he wants to prevent everyone from entering this shelter because "it is not fair!" And .... he is responsible for the death of one man who is the savior of mankind! OH MY GOD, How stupid can you get? What's so crazy that IMDb makes one write at least ten lines about this piece of crap. TWO MILLION in the budget, what could be done about it? Think Clerks, Blair Witches, and lots of other movies that were made for less than $ 100,000 and were even better. AAAAARGH! I reckon I was lucky not to pay a penny to see this crap, and to sit at the end of this total removal is one of the most Hertz things I did this year. No wonder the writers of this pile of dung had a job as a cameraman and title designer before ...
