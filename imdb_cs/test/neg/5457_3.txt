The TV director uses astral projections to kill people who are blue men. A blunt, unwavering horror movie that just sits in front of your eyes and wonders why you're watching it. I sat in the movie to the end and I really can't give you more than just a cursory description of what the movie was about, because I still found my attention diverted from other things. <br /> <br /> I can't really recommend it. I think my feelings are best summarized by the fact that I paid the dollar for a DVD as a dual function and I feel a little torn.
