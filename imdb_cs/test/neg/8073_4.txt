I remember a vacation in Florida when this movie aired. I set my video recorder to record it. Expectations killed me. I knew about the movie since it was announced six months earlier. We returned from Florida 4 days after the film was broadcast and I watched it immediately. I tried as hard as I could, but I didn't. I'm a huge 3 stooges fan. And I know quite a bit about them. It wasn't as if I expected something to learn from the movie, and I didn't. I was more interested in viewing and saw how accurate their information was. There were many bad things with this movie. Actors, screenplay, reenactments, all could be much better. Paul Ben-Victor is an extremely talented actor. But let's face the facts, Moe Howard was out of the way. He doesn't look like him, he doesn't sound like him, so he can't act like him. Michael Chiklis is also very talented, but his portrayal of Curly wasn't enough for me, though when Curly got sick, he did well. The picture of Shemp John Kassir could be better rehearsed. It was rather a bad impression than a display. The worst of all was Joe Besser. They made him thin and annoying than he was. It was simple laziness. I don't like Joe shorts because, as the movie illustrates, hardly EVER got hit. But he wasn't that annoying and DEFINATES wasn't so thin. Best performance belongs to Evan Handler. He had the most accurate stooge display. The problem with Larry's character, his hair is too fragile and too red. I know it's too technical, so I won't count on my list why I didn't like this movie. It is written as whining, trembling, chicken. True, he had many phobias, but he wasn't that bad. At first he didn't leave the band because he was afraid of Ted Healy, although he didn't like it, Shemp left because he got an offer from another studio he just couldn't refuse. Instead of the truth, this film decides to moisten it on the bed, on Larry, not to go into the closet and shamefully lean out of the group. Another problem is that Shemp made almost as many Columbia shorts as Curly did as a stooge, but only one, Fright Night, which was his first short, is shown. His career was almost completely ignored. Plus, miserable editing has caused a terrible and most unforgivable mistake. Shemp was born in early 1895 and died at the end of 1955. Would that make him old at death? Well, here's a hint, it's not 59 as the movie states. Now for writing that I think was wrong just because this movie was rushed out. Some lines are stupid and could be developed and / or implemented much better than they were. One line that really got me was at the very end of the movie when Moe shows the promoter how to make an eye. <br /> <br /> "That's what we do, we make contact with eyebrow bones, not eyes, it looks really on the film." This line was badly written and poorly placed in the movie. OH! In awe and I'm sure he did it with some people, but the very end of the movie wasn't the place for that line. A better place to ask? And how about when they first appear in Columbia and are introduced by sound machines. I know that at first there was no sound for the eye, but Moe could say, "What about this?" and eyepokes Curly or Larry. Jules White then says, "Are you okay?" or "How did you do that?" there were a lot of badly placed lines in this movie, which is a clear sign that the script was run out, the other includes the origin of the name Shemp, even though it is not so bad, so I leave that picture. <br /> <br /> This illustrates how columbia was bolted to col I'm not sure if Moe was an errand boy, but that was a kind of dramatization of things to make the viewer sympathize with them. I know this film was a dramatization. I know that not everything will be sharp and clean and perfectly perfect. However, some of the things they created and the real things they ignored were in serious conflict with each other. For example, Curly's stroke is not so close to how it happened in real life. I know, I know, dramatization, but the purpose of dramatization is to make real events more dramatic. Curly's stroke in real life is more dramatic than what they showed in the film. Here's what really happened. Curly sat on a chair off the screen when the scene was shot, called him to the last scene of the fight, but did not answer. Moe followed him and found that his little brother's head had collapsed, half paralyzed, unable to speak, and tears flowing down his face. Moe then said, "Babe?" and tried to help him out of the chair. Poor curly drops on knees. Then the ambulance was called. All in all, this movie wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't good or even OK. This film portrays helplessly and inaccurately meadows and sometimes overcomes dramatization. There is a very, very long list of inaccuracies in this film. If you don't believe me, check out the fella named Stooge's list at threestooges.com. It's about one page and a half long. Some things in the movie I can let slip. But the others were unforgivable. Three Stoogs were geniuses, and many of today's comedies are based on what they did. Do not believe me? Check out Simpsons and more and Ren & Stimpy. But this film cannot capture their genius. It's rather inaccurately capturing their hardships, which is important, but if the film's title is Three Stoogs, it must portray its ingenuity and originality more than anything else.
