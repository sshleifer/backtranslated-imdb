hey .... i don't really know why this movie was so appreciated so much, maybe i missed a point. , evoked by emotions and forcing viewers to withdraw from their own reality and thinking ......... while it is true that the aparni dream effort was ambitious, in the light of all other films, this one is short ... ...... it was too slow, there was no details about anything and the end .... was totally ... useless ...... open or anything .... just useless ..... so beware if you want to see a good concept completely useless .......
