Anyone who thinks Kool Moe Dee, Carol Alt, and Corey Feldman have a list of good actors must smoke something I'd like to try sometimes. Where to start: a lousy soundtrack, hammy playing, "action" in places. This is a typical amateur-written hack feed that has been washed and never loved to get involved. Actually, I felt embarrassed for the "stars" in this "movie". The only thespian missing on top of this turd was Gary Coleman, who if he was in the movie, it would at least a little howling badly, rather than just bad. There was one part in the movie where Carol Alt shouted, "Do you think I'm IDIOT?!?"? Yes, Carol, I do it, your agent does, and PLEASE love all that is decent and holy ... Go on and stop like that! This movie is something Anna Nicole Smith has been involved in. I'd tell you what a conspiracy it was, but that would be one more fragment of the sentence to this article, and my mind hovered so many times during the movie so I barely paid attention.
