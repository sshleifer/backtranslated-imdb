Since I am from Norway (one of the ten richest countries in the world), it was fun to watch how we use trucks from the 1950s and live in medieval houses. And because we have very strict laws on weapons, it was fun to see how many weapons there were in Norway in five minutes of shooting. Mr. Direct-to-video has even been able to bring his silencer in a short time, so he must have powerful friends in the customs. <br /> <br /> Before you go to an "exotic" country, do at least _some_ research, Dudes - you can hurt the feelings of old fans. Sverre - an old fan with wounded feelings.
