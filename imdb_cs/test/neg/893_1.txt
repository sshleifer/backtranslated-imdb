I've never seen the first three, but I know they're better than this ... garbage. It's about a guy who throws a party. Wow. Sounds amazing (sarcasm). It is? NOOO! It starts with a guy lying in bed and he wakes up with his mom. The kid pretends to be sick, so he doesn't have to go to school. He goes to his uncle's house and rounds a few people and throws a party. I wasn't allowed to watch this waste at all. I can't imagine anyone sitting down and writing this dialogue, thinking, "Man, dis! I wonder if they even had a script for this movie. I watched it because I knew it would be bad, but I usually watch the wrong movie. It just disgusted me. TWO THUMES DOWN!
