Caddyshack II is one of those images that makes you ask "Why?" As in; "Why was it financed?" "Why was it?" and 'Why was it released into the public domain?'. At least it's a bad movie. It serves a small purpose but underline how superior its prequel was by setting an almost identical set of characters against each other in a similar story as the 'new money' land developer tries to buy out of the device's shrine golf course. Right from the bat, which will follow 8 years after the original, it is a bit bizarre. I mean, if you're going to cash on a very successful picture like the first one, you've got a window for a few years. However, if we leave it for 8 years, it means that the formula is barely fresh enough to simply follow up, or a bad imitation, as is the case, so your kind of obligation to reward the original fans by at least referring to them if not really real posts. actors who have made the first so unforgettable. But it's a little if anything out of it. Instead, we get cheap imitations. Well, when Ted Knight was lost in the past years, it would be impossible to bring back the unforgettable judge Smails, but the inclusion of Robert Stack as "Chandler Young" (a colleague of WASP elite-like Smails) is unimaginable and seriously missing. anarchic frustration that has made the knightly turn so remarkable. Jackie Mason's 'Jack Hartounian' is a weak attempt to recreate a non-stop wisecracks released by Al Czervik (Rodney Dangerfield) character first. While Dangerfield's role has been endlessly cited, Mason is completely forgotten. Bill Murray is a ridiculously ridiculous sad groundskeeper 'Carl Spackler' and his contemptuous war with an annoying local gofer replaces his Ghostbuster's co-star Dan Ackroyd role as a militant 'Capt. Tom Everett ', who is a high pitched voice just divides your sides with frustration, unlike the intended laughter. Randy Quaid, brilliant as Cousin Ed in National Lampoon's Vacation, is just the opposite of Hartounian's unstable state. lawyer. The view of disbelief that shows the actor as he looks at the character of Quaid is intended as a jolly act of inappropriate violence that is reflected by the audience. Your laughs. Your simple question: "What the hell is he doing?" Chevy Chase will appear, occasionally and wisely, in view of the catastrophe around it, as a club for 'Tye Webb' movies are only a direct reference to the original that cannot resist the golf course itself . With her deeply tanned skin and loud Hawaiian shirts, Chase seems to have just returned from a long summer vacation and needs a paycheck. He distances himself from the real-image events so much that he takes little guilt and leaves some, with little, credibility still intact. Jessica Lundy as Mason's daughter 'Kate' takes on the role of Danny Noonan when the teenager fights class division. Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? At least in the first Danny (Irish Catholic Blue Collar Family) and his ridiculous attempts to break into the world of white-Anglo-Saxon-Protestant world golf club players and shakers were played on some unforgettable tracks, such as being rejected by resident Lutheran bishop and scoffed descendant of local yacht club. Lundy's embarrassment of his father's inability to fit in is indicated by their being rooted in his Jewish roots. In addition, it may also have the impression that it is a formless moron, but such complexities are repulsed, even though I have stopped worrying long before they were resolved. At the end of the day, Noonan tried to get into life. Miss Hartounian's biggest problem is that the hob be bred at a local golf club to love her multi-millionaire father so she can get a date with the wasteful white club boy. Or I gathered. Anyway, in sum, his poorly written, poorly written with lame pieces, wastes a lot of talent. Really Kudos, if you were able to sit over that it was the conclusion. It's really repentance. But there is a question mark as to why so many original actors did not come back, as opposed to being replaced by artists who at least looked like equals on paper. Maybe they asked them. Or maybe I suspect they actually read the script. Hold on to the original !!!
