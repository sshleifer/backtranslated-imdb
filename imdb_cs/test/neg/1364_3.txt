Being a big fan of horror movies and always finding something good in the photo, but I wasn't interested in this movie. This story revolves around his father and his daughter and girlfriend because his wife died a few years ago. These people encounter a terrible situation in the city, where they stop and visit, and all the seniors in this city get together against these people and almost kill them. This film reminded me of a movie called "Children of Corn" because they are children who are presented to Satan and are his instruments of terror. There are plenty of songs, mambo jumble and a toy tank that will completely destroy the whole family in their estate as well as the dolls who kill the husband and wife.
