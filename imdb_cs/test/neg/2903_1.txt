You can only describe it with one word and that would be WOW !!! Wow, I really didn't think it could be released. If you're looking at a movie called ninja, then you expect to see at least some great martial artists, right? However, none of these guys know any martial arts at all and seem to have gone to China and picked the first people they saw on the street and trained them for a day in martial arts, that's the level of their martial arts skills! Actors are so excessive that special effects are ridiculous and there is no conspiracy that makes sense. This is the worst martial arts I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot!
