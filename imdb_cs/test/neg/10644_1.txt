Hellraiser: Bloodline is just such a movie. I believe this is the fourth installment in the Hellraiser series. <br /> <br /> I missed the start and everything I remember was a few sleeveless women and a box on the computer screen. But with my joke and intelligence (and the Info button), I soon found out that the Pinhead was released from Pandora's box, which in my opinion is a gateway to hell. So Pinhead somehow comes out of the box and terrorizes "Toymaker's" family. And that's about it. And not to mention the random torture of various people crossing his path. Yawning. What's happening mainly in this movie is that Pinhead captures a baby, and then unleashes a dog on his wife, and then kills a random person. Then the husband comes, blah, blah, blah. Who cares? Why does it fail because Hellraiser: Bloodline is too scaly to be scary. Look at Pinhead's minion creature: a cheesy dog ​​that looks as if it was turned inside out, two men whose heads and bodies are joined together, (Siamese twins in a horror movie?) And some person to be a princess of some sort. (I haven't seen previous movies.) Now look at the main villain. Her name is Pinhead. Isn't that the name someone calls when they're stupid? He has pins in his head and hooks coming out of his fingers and has blue skin. I suppose he would make a decent villain if he didn't have such a name and he would be excited. Two cops approach him somewhere in the movie and say, "Don't make us do any pain on you!" Answer: "Pain? How dare you use this word! I AM pain?" blah, blah, blah, blah blah. It sounds a little cliché when you ask me. <br /> <br /> Don't forget the last half of the movie. Characters (and viewers) get further tortured when Pinhead attacks some futuristic asylum. Someone we don't know (Maybe he was in previous movies. I don't remember him at the beginning of the movie.) This scene is basically one thing to play over and over again: mysterious noise. Some other guards: "No no! He's down. I'll check on him myself?" After he dies, the same thing happens again. <br /> <br /> (SPOILERS) Here's what I didn't get. In the movie, Pinhead is reportedly sent to Oblivion at the end. So how will he return to the next four films? Are they prequels? Why didn't he die in the previous ones? Oh, God. The creators must come up with an idea for another series. (END OF SPOILERS) Hellraiser: Bloodline is full of torture scenes but has little excitement or frightened value. Forget it. Bad special effects with bad ?? Everything else to make it more snooze-fest than good horror. Good: Well some people can enjoy topless women in the beginning. Plus, Pinhead's voice is pretty cool. I think that if you like ultra-violence, you may like it. Bad: None of the above reasons make it a very good movie. Cornea and repeatability are pretty bad. And who names his villain Pinhead? <br /> <br /> Feel free to send me a private message regarding this comment.
