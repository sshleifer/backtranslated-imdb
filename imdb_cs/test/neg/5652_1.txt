Nickelodeon went down to the bathroom. Have kids say things like "Oh my God!" and "We're OK" <br /> <br /> This show promotes hate for people who aren't good looking or not in the crowd. It is said that sexual promiscuity is fine by having girls drying up on boys without a shirt. Not to mention the overweight boy who takes off his shirt. Essentially, the main characters avoid anyone from the ordinary. Carly's friend Sam, who may be a lesbian, beats the power of anyone crossing her path that says it's okay to be b ** ch. This show has so much negative in her that no one should watch her! I give him 0 out of 10 !!!
