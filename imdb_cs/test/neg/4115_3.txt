In the future, when a hardworking travel agency uses time travel technology to send rich clients time to explore the age of dinosaurs, the future is inexplicably changed when one of their clients violates the cardinal rule to stay out of the way. In an effort to repair the damage, experienced time scout (Edward Burns) teams with technology inventor (Catherine McCormack). The assumption is pretty good and engaging. It could have some drawbacks, but it could be an interesting movie. Unfortunately, A Sound of Thunder can't really hit the audience inside. He suffers from a number of problems and takes so seriously that it's hard to really have fun watching a movie. Personally, I thought the script was the biggest problem of the film. They were more holes than expected, and the film was a bit lazy in explaining things. I was hoping to look deeply at the "butterfly effect," but the movie was more fun than anything. That's okay with me because 90 minutes of mindless fun is still a nice way to spend the evening. But all the entertainment this film offered was unintentional and lame. There were several scenes that I enjoyed, but I was pretty bored. Acting isn't much better because most of them are more interested in payout than anything else. The only one who gave a good performance was Ben Kingsley. He kept the first half of the film pleasant and it also seemed to have the funniest fun. Edwards Burns was pretty pale and bland. I don't think she has what it takes to be a leading man. But he could do a decent side actor. Catherine McCormack was just annoying and not very believable. I had never seen her in anything other than she could have the potential. Other actors also give bad performances, although most of them are quite unknown, so they shouldn't affect their careers too much. <br /> <br /> Most people complain about special effects when looking at the message boards. There is no way to sugar them and they are terrible. All dinosaurs look really bad. Gibbon-lizards (part of the monkey, part of the dino), while the creative idea, become obsolete after a while and they are most likely to encourage laughter rather than fear. Green screen work looks terrible and unprofessional. I was really interested in what director Peter Hyams was trying to achieve here. He fails to provoke tension, action, and excitement, making the film a long seven. However, the film is largely harmless and far from the worst film of 2005. Hopefully this film will be revised in the future. There is potential in this project, but so far it is the best we have. Finally, if curiosity doesn't improve, there's no reason to see Thunder Noise. Rating 4/10
