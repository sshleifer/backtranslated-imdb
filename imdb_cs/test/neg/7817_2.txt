This is the first time I've been posting a movie commentary I've never seen before, up to credits. The reason for this is simple ... people must be warned: this is one of the newest millennium's worst comedies. I usually stay away from a lot of comedies that are in bad taste, but I figured it would be watchable. It is a regrettable decision that was based on other half-pleasant Ashton Kutcher comedies such as A Lot Like Love and Guess Who. Where these two movies had their charm and laughter, it had nothing (and I mean no !!). Acting is terrible, especially 'boss'. Tara Reid was no surprise, how dare she actress? The assumption is thin and the plot does not dense at all. It's not a problem if you manage to keep it funny and / or sweet ... but as you probably already guessed, this wasn't a cast at all! The script felt like it wasn't finished and I wouldn't even be confused if the director rewrote on the set. My dog ​​could have written a more complete script, really. And it's not even Lassie :-). Stay away from this trio, though sometimes (like me) you like to do silly comedies. Many people will not enjoy this low quality movie ... <br /> <br /> I (almost) never give it up, so ... and 2.
