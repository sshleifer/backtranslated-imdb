I have read the 28 most recent comments from various people about this movie and I was surprised that no one mentioned that the first victim on the bed with "missing eyelids" as the camera moves up and away from the face flashes! Yes, BLINKS! I noticed how it came to HBO last weekend, and when I saw it, I had to play it several times and focus on one eye at a time to make sure I didn't see things! Of course, it was hard to take the film seriously, though there were some interesting and intense scenes with Julian Sands. Very disappointed and give him 4 mostly due to the fact that 1st victim flashes in one of the last shots as the camera pulls away from the body / face. Very bad.
