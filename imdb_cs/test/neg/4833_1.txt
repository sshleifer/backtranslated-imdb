Actually, I'm not telling the main plot in this commentary, but with just 2-3 sentences I can make it a spoiler. OK here are these - <br /> <br /> Speed ​​is only 85% conversion of Hollywood flick Cellular to Bollywood using Vikram Bhatt software. The title has no match with the story, it just goes in the direction of the thriller. Jen to !! He doesn't deserve a single star for his imitation, imperfect casting, bad standard and predictable story. Undoubtedly now I can say that Viram Bhatt is slowly disappearing from his director because no mature audience will appreciate his recent works including this one. Besides him, Aftab Shivdasani also make his view as a cartoon-comic type. Who knows how long will it take in the film industry? Sometimes the standard in shows and cinematography seems inferior to the class C film. But the most supportive role was played by Zayed Khan which was somewhat identical to Chris Evan's role as Ryan in Cellular. With an innocent face, Sanjay Suri has no post in the movie because he has nothing to impress. That's why those who have already watched Cellular advise you never to waste time with this imitating bag.
