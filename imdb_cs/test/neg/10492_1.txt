Imagine what it must have been for John Agar. One of the pretty Hollywood leaders. He married Shirley Temple for five years. He makes this film himself. I remember him in "Tarantula" where he wasn't bad. Unfortunately, there is nothing to recommend this movie. The monster is stupid uninteresting and incompetent. The police are boring. Teenagers are boring. The story is stupid. People running around. There are events that do nothing to make progress on the property. It dances on and on, and then there is no attack. There is an idiotic love triangle that no one could care for at least. It's not even camping or outrageous. It's nothing. The agar could also be mailed. He has nothing to do.
