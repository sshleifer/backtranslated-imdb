What a sad surprise. Being a big fan of the original series (with Don Adams) was really looking forward to it. The poor man deceived me. This is a stronger and more dead brain than the monkey's bottom. To say it was bad would be a heavy understatement. This is / was the worst movie (well the first 30 minutes) I've seen for a long time. I couldn't last more than the first half hour, I was looking at my hard drive that was broken. I can tolerate bad ... bad is O.K., sometimes cute. But with fancy Hollywood crap (and it must be the worst in many years) I won't put it. This film is a gross insult to humanity's collective intelligence! My five-year-old daughter could write better - and she is not even dislexive !!! I'm really tempted to try the rest, but I'm afraid I have better things to do ... like making pizza dough and watching it rise. What a sad disappointment. No ... I'm snorted! What is Scam! As Mel Brookes once said; "Shirt shirt!"
