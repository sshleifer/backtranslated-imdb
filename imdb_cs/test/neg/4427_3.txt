Early Jackie Chan movie where there is no sign of Chan personality we know. This is Chan in the full story of the traditional revenge of the kind that has been cloned and re-cloned by countless producers and studios across Hong Kong and mainland China. It's a very serious story that shows no humor and warmth that Jackie Chan would catapult to super fame. It is also clear that he would never have discovered him because his career would be painfully short. As a film of its own merit, it is a good looking but extraordinary film. I watched it in the midst of everyday martial arts marathon and it would blend with every other movie I watched that day if I didn't notice Jackie in the movie. I honestly don't think the movie is really worth bothering (there are too many other better variations) except if you're interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started.
