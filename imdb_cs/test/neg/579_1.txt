I'm a huge Robert Taylor fan and I've been trying to find all his movies. I didn't have this, but I recently watched it on Fox Movie Channel and I was very disappointed. I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but acting was as bad as the script. Victor McLaglen was even bad and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable. Taking off-screen relationships between Taylor and Stanwyck, it was surprising how small the chemistry was on the screen between the two of them. But the idea of ​​the film was so ridiculous: that the President of the United States would order the Navy Lieutenant to secretly leave the service to get rid of bank robbers and report only to the President that it was hard to appreciate anything else about the film. The death scenes were completely immobile. All that was worse than Taylor's meeting was Stanwyck's singing. She later improved in Ball of Fire-thank Heaven.
