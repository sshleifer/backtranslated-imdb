American paleontologist Donald Sutherland, who has visited England, takes a tramp on a stop one evening. Two years later, when he discovered a man's address book in his car, he returns the book to a man's rich house just to find out that the man was murdered. No one in the family or one of them seems to care for a hiker not to commit a murder (his own stepmother) because he was in a Sutherland car at the time of the crime. Sutherland's man is an alibi, but he has appeared too late. She feels guilty about the real killer. The Secret of Agatha Christie usually includes a number of diverse people, all with one or another motive for crime, all suspects, and puzzles that depend on the construction of a strict timeline. There is often, not always, a sidekick with whom an investigator can talk things through. spectator. Redundancy is perfectly fine. We have to keep the characters and timelines straight. Christie's films are of a rare kind in which the use of famous faces in subject characters is actually useful. (Jacqueline de Bellefort? Oh, yes, this is Mia Farrow.) But this version of "Ordeal by Innocence" is the production of Golan-Globus with all that means in the production of values, thoughtfully prepared screenplays, and camera skills. The first few minutes that Sutherland finds out that an innocent person has been hanged is fine. After all, the viewer throws himself in incoherent pieces, often in sudden memories or in confusing voice messages that don't tell us anything. The script has slapdash quality as if it were thrown by two hacks overnight. Few faces are familiar and this will not help. Everyone drops notes about everything else and names become hopeless confusion. The musical score consists of four instruments that make irritating atonal jazz riffs. Some nudity is thrown in to awaken bulldozers in the audience. If Dame Agatha were alive, she would be among the spectators who had to wake up. Dullsville.
