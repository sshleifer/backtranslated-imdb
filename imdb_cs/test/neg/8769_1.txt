As a passionate fan of the Christian film and a man trying to keep an enthusiastic eye for improvement in Christian filmmaking, I was thrilled to have had a chance to see this film. I was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. I stayed disappointed. <br /> <br /> The initial scene is great, although the tiny rip-off Leon - The Professional at an angle, it shows off some great cinematography in the early days ... everything was pretty downhill. I was barely able to sit in this, I was tempted several times just to shut it down. Acting, though quite honest, was incredibly awful. But again, the heart of the problem was the script itself. The dialogue was worse than everything I had ever seen, and even my amateur screenplay "Awakening" (soon to be an independent film) looked like a thriller Hitchcock next to him. (That doesn't say much.) The clear side of this movie is that it was shot on brand new Sony High Definition 900 cameras taken in 24P. This movie and Star Wars: Clone Attack were the first films to use this new technology this year. Camera performance seems to have been wasted by poor lighting, poor angles, and inept handling. The only good feeling I watched while watching the movie was how good my newcomer would be. look next to him. ; ) 4/10
