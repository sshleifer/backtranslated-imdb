CinemaScope Color Cinematography Leon Shamroy is remarkable here, including the use of color filters for <br /> <br /> different scenes. Alfred Newmann score must be the most sensual and seductive score Hollywood ever produced. It is a pity that the CD is no longer available. But the actors never got to this opportunity. The accents are so diverse, from subdued Ustinova and Purdom to Hollywood Baxter and Mature that it seems to be a real hodgepodge without a central vision. Tommy Rettig is nervously American. Acting styles range from zombie-to stilted. Only Ustinov as a becoming, one-sided servant steals the show - what's there to steal. Assumptions - The story of a young Egyptian doctor, seduced and abandoned by the rich - and a parallel theme of a single God cult, Ra - persecuted by the authorities, has its interesting points. However, when the film's story melts away, it remains scary music and visual effects.
