I found the tape from this long forgotten 'show'. In addition to the theme song DISCO BEAVER FROM THE OUTSIDE SPACE. This show is barely observable. You will browse through the channels as well as the couple fly through the TV channels. This is a television parody. The beaver is fine. Homosexual Dracula, a cub discussing her experiences with Peria and a lady with too big lips who discuss homosexuality, show us everything that is wrong with television. It's all BAD. Just like a beaver from space that seems to be lost in this new world, you'll be too. *** outside *****
