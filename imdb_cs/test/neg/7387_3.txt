Super Troopers was an instant classic. Club Dread, though for many disappointing, had its moments. Puddle Cruisers has fewer moments. I saw this movie on the shelf of my local video store, and at the bottom I saw it was Broken Lizard, which did Super Troopers, so I naturally picked it up. I found only one scene to laugh loudly. Far from Super Troopers. Overall, I was very disappointed. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you have enough free time and you really need to kill some time. However, it is better to play video games or watch something that might laugh or think.
