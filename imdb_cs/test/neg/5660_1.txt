The first off playing is so awful except for the actor who plays Spencer. Mirinda Cosgrove doesn't deserve her own show She should have a stick with Drake and Josh. The only person I like except Spencer's Nevel Hes Super Bad @ $$ He dug Carlys Crews @ $$ And I like it <br The Episode I Hate Much Is Imyourbigesstfan I Hate That Young Icaly Fan She Made Me Almost Kill Fake Is Well The Word To Describe Please Don't Look At This Nothing On TV It's Good To Go With Classics Like Family Matters Good Show Ban Icarly Lets Everyone Go Back to Doug Nick's Version Only Please Don't Watch I Hate Icarly Oh Also Nathan Kress's Wannabee Fredie Highmore
