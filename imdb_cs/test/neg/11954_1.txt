I have a friend who works on the blockbuster, and he gets 5 free movie loans a week, so one day, when we were washing the aisles for something interesting, I came across 18 Kung Fu weapons, and judging by boxing alone, this movie seemed to be it's quite a jerk, but yet we got into temptation and rented - in the end, it was free ..... and thank God it was .... it is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. the budget had to be a cucumber and a piece of string ... the conspiracy was ridiculous, the only mention of "18 guns" is that there is a book that teaches how 18 weapons are an evil person - and that's it! There is not even any weapons fighting in this movie ... it and the action sequences are just flat-out BAD .... 9 times out of 10 the next guy is punches and kicks come about a footprint from landing on the other guy, and there are QUANTITY Times when the movie skips frames (the result of ridiculously bad editing) .... dubbing is also ridiculous and it is hardly understandable .... and we don't even get into acting. .. the end will definitely let "wtf" say, but to be fair I have to mention that the techniques used by the actors were somewhat decent, and the old man is a crazy chump .... but that's about ... fortunately I didn't have to pay for this movie, but I think at least now I know exactly how bad the movie can actually be.
