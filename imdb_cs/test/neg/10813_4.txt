I totally agree. This is a "Pitch Black Underground" and a well-worn plot. The best scenes I thought divers were exploring the caves, the impossible underground passages, some of them pounding their hearts. The scenery was great. If they got rid of the basic "alien" jagged CGI badboys, the movie would be much better. All they have to do is never show any monsters at all, but everyone would be interested, and follow Jack's descent into madness, and this could be a hitchcock-style thriller, maybe a material award. Negotiations are not bad. But the rubber bats only reduce it to standard fare.
