My jaw fell so many times when I watched this movie, I got bruises. Okay, I granted, I really didn't expect quality, say, Others or even Thirteen Ghosts (the new one that was just terrible and still being the head and shoulders of this madness). Someone noticed thin figures ... I wouldn't say "thin". "Thin" means there might be something for them. What almost nonexistent? We do not have any particular order: A girl who will scream; An American who portrays it all; Macho Guy, who will just beat over everything until he killed himself: A wise black man who will die soon; Extra Guy Who Is First To Die; Extra Woman Playing Tough. And it is done. This is your character list and that's what they are and what they stay from beginning to end. If they were "losing", they could at least change a bit from start to finish. But not. Well, well, the American decides to stay with the terrain at the end, and the Screaming Girl returns anywhere she came from. That's a change. In addition, they all act on their assigned roles and rarely betray any real emotions when they finally encounter a threat. Now, producers get props for an original threat, I say. I understand that the story will be "Tremors" but ants instead of giant worms. I give credit writer: these are very cool, very scary ants and what they do with bones is excellent. (For the first time, when a "cockchafer" appears, I admit, I jumped a few feet.) Unfortunately, the very cold concept quickly becomes Alien in the desert. We get a lot of comments about ants who may or may not be true, but we do not get much of the mythology on which the threat is based. And we get every monster cliché. People go to places they know they shouldn't and when they have no convincing reason. Moronic characters try to defend our heroes and die for it. One character has a dual duty as a "scientist who doesn't want to kill a monster but study it". A very cool gadget is only introduced so that the American can tell everyone about ants, right, I hope everyone knows anyway. Then the gadget is broken. Our heroes exhaust one thing that can keep the threat in check. And then there is the last, annoying moment when we know that the threat is still with us - and we wonder what exactly and how the hero or heroine came. It completely portrays everything that went before, as unnecessary and false. Three stars for cold use of ants and bones. Nothing for cliché, clunky dialogue, and dimmed light bulbs.
