I saw this movie in part because some positive comments here about IMDb. After I wished I had the 90 minutes of my life back, I feel it is my duty to come here and say ... Please don't bother to watch this movie. I can't argue with the actors' efforts - they did what they gave them, but this material is terrible. The pace was deadly - slow, meandering, and you saw everything coming for about an hour, and then it lasted forever. The dialogue was boring, unnecessary, even funny. The characters were completely unsympathetic. And in my opinion, cinematography was a very low quality - clich√© "used by a home video machine!" he was used to a very bad effect. Yes, Jeri Ryan is a great guy. Don't let them waste your time on this movie.
