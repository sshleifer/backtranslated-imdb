This movie is one of the worst remakes I've ever seen in my life! Acting is ridiculous and Corman has not improved his piranha since 1978. 90% of special effects are canceled from Piranha (1978), Up from Deep (1979) and Humanoids From The Deep (1979). This makes Piranha II: The Spawning Looks to Belong to the American Film Institute List.
