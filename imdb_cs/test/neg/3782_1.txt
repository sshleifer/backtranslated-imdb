This is a very bad movie. However, I read that a high school teacher did it, so I should give him some praise for his ambitious (yet terrible) special effects. Here's a conspiracy: a monster emerges from a pile of rubbish and pollution in Milpitas, California, and sets out on a destructive rage. I'm going to spoil the "big surprise" about how the monster looks, so read the rest at your own risk. You were warned! The monster looks like a giant, two-legged fly with a gas mask. In some scenes a monster is an actor wearing a costume. In other scenes, the monster is created by stop-motion animation. Acting is terrible. Dialogue is terrible. Special effects are terrible. The graph is predictable. Keep away!
