Make a few dark and tumultuous nights, coming from the coast, the obsession and doubts, two brothers who have a mysterious connection based on hatred, suspicion of disappearance, a shoe at night, a quiet thrashing cigarette, and finally, a tormenting heroine who has been threatened by her with one's own doubts as once - but which one? - men around her. Sounds like we could have a good 80 minutes noir. Instead, under the guidance of Vincente Minnelli and the two leading A-sheets, Katharine Hepburn and Robert Taylor, Undercurrent becomes an almost two-hour matin√©e melodrama, a long slogan of impending anxiety amid a perfectly groomed, dressed and dressed cast. If you look at the watch in the middle of the movie and the sinking heart you see that you have one more hour, you and the film are likely to have problems. Minnelli, in one of his oldest non-musical films, does not consider the Rococo greenhouse approach as strong as it was known later. But what is essentially a simple story of greed, murder and obsession has turned into an endless vehicle by Katharine Hepburn. Hepburn shows us in carefully illuminated details how to show fear, love, anxiety, dizziness, happiness, doubt, suspicion and horror. Robert Taylor is more or less together to ride. Hepburn begins a film like Tomboyish Ann Hamilton, an energetic young woman in pants that helps her father with his inventions. Their housekeeper is determined to take her. When Dr. Hamilton decides to sell an important formula to Alan Garroway (Robert Taylor), it's love at first sight. Garroway is a smooth, handsome, dynamic inventor of the Garroway distance controller, which was vital in the war and which made him a hard-charging millionaire manufacturer. He is the captain of the industry, as one of his many friends in Washington says. Ann Hamilton, now Ann Garroway, may still be a bit of a savage, but her husband shows her how to dress and how to be a successful social hostess for all these congressmen and judges her husband knows. They learn fast and eagerly. Both are clearly and blissfully in love. But wait. Canker is about to gnaw. Ann realizes she doesn't know anything about her husband's family. None of his employees or friends seem to be willing to talk about them. When he learns a bit by bit that Alan's mother died in an old family house in Middleburg when she was sitting at the piano, or that she had a brother, Michael, who disappeared, Alan becomes very quiet ... and sometimes gets into anger. She always apologizes. But wait once more. Did his mother really play the piano? Didn't she really die in bed? Wasn't Michael caught taking family money and Alan sent him away? All this takes place in the magnificent hotel apartments, in a noble country house in Middleburg with a horse stable and a tasteful ranch house by the sea. All in the movie except the staff are dressed up to nine. There are exclusive cocktail parties and an intimate dinner for twenty. Even in black-and-white film, Minnelli can't help but give us dining tables full of crystal and china, tasteful and elegant furniture and lots of dresses. By the end of the film, when everything is finally known when Ann is riding a high, extremely well-designed mountain trail, a bad guy on another horse when threatened. death by a boulder and her pursuer finally meets the death of a horse, it is a relief. Even Robert Mitchum, who plays Michael, is not able to bring much tension into the film. What might be a tiny little B-movie in smaller hands, instead of A's list is just a redesigned melodrama, too big for his bones.
