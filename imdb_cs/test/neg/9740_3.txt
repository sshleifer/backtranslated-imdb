That's a silly movie. When I saw it in the cinema, more than half the audience stayed before it was half. I stayed at the bitter end. Want to show bravery? I caught it on TV again and it was much fun. Still nothing means classic, or even hilarious, but the family grew up a bit. I love Jessica Lundy anyway. If you have nothing better at t.v. it could be worse.
