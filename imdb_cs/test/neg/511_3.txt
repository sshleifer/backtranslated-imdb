Attention, possible spoilers <br /> <br /> This movie is so miserable that it actually becomes funny. The director has put all the clichés that have ever plagued B-series movies. A stupid bimbo (a pretty rack) who has caught himself again and again between the bad guys, the top villain and a grin and revealed his plot before they become so they can be destroyed and who, of course, , bullied / killed the hero of the hero in a vague past, a side kick in a policeman - small, bald, whose only preparation for the last battle (another cliché) returns his baseball cap-back, etc. <br /> <br /> The end of the movie really overcomes. After the main villain dies when the hero Paralised Stoneface Jack or whatever throws him off the roof of a ten-floor building comes out of the building. Which exterior looks just three-storey high and very much like your regular town hall. When they leave the building, the side kick cannot walk because its right leg appears to be injured. As no one can say: ten minutes earlier he fell into his shoulder and his legs were fine. There is no further explanation for the viewer's inquisitive mind to wonder how to know such trivial things as "Where is the thief's body that should be near the building?" and "Why didn't the cops or curious people meet around that body?" <br /> <br /> I could go on with the list forever. Why does one of the bad boys say they invented martial arts when he gets his ass when he is dug? Why do bad people generally make stupid moves in horrors? Why does the hero look so faggy? Is anyone really wondering "yes, these characters and this plot is that movie to remember"? And the actors suck. Our hero and savior of the day wear the same expression on his face. The whole film. That disgusted, trying to be a sad grin, must be some of his authorial performance. He also thought that as many as 12% of the people who rated the film gave him 10 to fill me with fear. Maybe they were serious and then we are doomed.
