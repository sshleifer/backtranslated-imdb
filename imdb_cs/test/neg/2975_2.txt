Okay, so I'm Singapore and I'd like to say it's time to stop stereotyping Singaporeans and making such movies. In fact, some actors / actresses have a talent, but unfortunately there wasn't much to see in this movie. As I watched that I was quite young in my youth, my parents pulled and saw me. I could honestly say I fell asleep. And there was this arrogant boy who got nervous. Overall, the boring film and the general waste of actors' talents. I've seen better Singapore movies than this. War chicken rice was good. But I can't believe it would be a better Singapore film. Sorry, I wouldn't recommend it.
