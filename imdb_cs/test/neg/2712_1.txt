This is the epitome of a bad 80-year-old, if you're not in front of a teenage girl. Riding a big name like a madonna, a story that physically challenges the intelligence and humor that is best suited to kindergarten. If there was any doubt, I think this film from the film clearly shows the complete lack of the Madonna's acting talent and I felt very embarrassed in her interest. The only thing I can't believe is that they sometimes left the director close to another movie. Madonna spends most of the film hovering around like a baby rag doll and talking like a child. It is painfully obvious that the only reason this film was made was that Madonna was a big name in pop music at the time. SHOULD NOT BE BACK TO THIS FULL CONTINUATION TO CASH POP STARDOM. Stay away at all costs!
