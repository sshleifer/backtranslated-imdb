First of all, Katherine Hepburn is badly blamed as Clara. She just can't be convincing as a devoted, selfless, somewhat smarmy wife that writers have created. But the real weakness of the film is its shallowness in the face of a potentially great drama. Schumann's bipolar (manic-depressive) disorder is "Oh, oh, I have headaches" and an occasional angry word. Suicide? This word is used, but it is not a hint in the home scenes, and when we see it in a psychiatric hospital, it is calm and subdued and smiling and optimistic. Superficial treatment. And Brahms is so upright and bourgeois - no hint of his husky humor, his love for tuning the noses of the device, no hint of his tortured attitude towards sex and women resulting from spending his piano playing youth in brides. And was Clara a long concert career entirely about supporting Robert's music, or was she, in fact, a remarkable pianist who wanted a career for herself, a female pianist who carved a place for herself in the male world? Any way of dealing with the lives of great artists is better than none, but it's a standard approach from Hollywood, in the middle of the road, especially disappointing, because the real story is much more dramatic, much more interesting, so much more human.
