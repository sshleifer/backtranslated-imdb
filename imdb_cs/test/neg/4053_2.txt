In the only act they have ever done, NSW Film & Television Office has refused to fund the film. The producers dug a big stink and in the fire of publicity they took their production to Victoria. In addition to lost work for technicians, NSW was lucky not to be involved ... <br /> <br /> The film failed at almost every level. Postmodernism fails, casting fails (what is Rose Byrne's character about? 1 dimensional snarling ugly made Hugo Weaving Channel? What the hell is Pia Miranda?) And the story is a clich√© of messes. In fact, the story runs like a pulled out prelude rather than a complete plot line. It could have had a chance if "pop culture encounters depression" style was better thought and executed. If the casting were crazier if the style were less serious ... if it were something else. Apart from the usual excellence in costumes, design and cinematography (as with most Australian films), the film is just a mistake. With a reported budget of over $ 7 million, "The Tender Hook" is a sign of Australian film industry nausea - bad people and bad projects are funded. Compare this mess with "Noise" (under $ 2m) or "Cedar Boys" (under $ 1m) and get an idea. Hard, interesting movies are faced with funds and shabby, crowded projects called cast are still money. Financing entities that have invested in this deserve to go the same way as Hugo Weaving's character on film.
