I saw it late at night on a smaller channel, and I put it in anticipation of laughter or two. Martin Lawrence is a good comic actor and I figured it could be a good stand-up comedian / actor in the style of Richard Pryor. <br /> <br /> I couldn't be more bad. This concert was terrible. He was full of racist comments directed against white people, Muslims, and people from India (Muslims and Indians are the same in Lawrence's mind) and fragile, clich√© philosophy (Lawrence, like many black comics and directors, can't resist We really need a lecture on Martin Luther King and the fight against civil rights during a stand-up comedy show?). Then his comments appeared to purify him from women, which allowed me to walk through the skin and listen to it. The worst of all was that the show wasn't just funny and I found it boring. I turned halfway and turned back to find him either still preaching or going on and on about the birth of his baby (there was no humor in his child's birth story and it was self-evident). He hated us with details, but he definitely didn't have much to say, or he would cut this section of the samples. This show was meaningless: Runteldat!
