I'm not quite sure if I agree with the director of this version of The Scarlet Pimpernel. I imagined Sir Percy Blakeney being a very calm, seemingly lazy nobleman. This particular Sir Percy Blakeney seems to be teeming with stunning energy and volatility. I didn't appreciate Houdini, James Bond, the Mission Impossible style that escaped that Sir Percy created. In previous versions, the joke was a tool to escape, not technology. The characters of Marguerite and Chauvelin were not even sufficiently depicted. There seemed to be little energy or chemistry in the interaction between the characters. <br /> <br /> I don't want to be blamed because the reason I don't like this movie could be just a matter of the difference in interpretation. If the director's interpretation matched me, I might not be irritated by what seemed to me a bad portrait portrait. I highly preferred the 1982 version. Anthony Andrews was quite effective as a quiet, quiet fop. Like Jane Seymour and Ian McKellen. In my opinion, the style of this period piece seems to be lost with this latest adaptation. I recommend sticking to previous versions, either since 1934 or since 1982. <br /> <br />
