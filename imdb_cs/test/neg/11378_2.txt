In the Farcic Key, Gaudi Afternoons can be considered an average exercise. Marcia Gay Harden and Judy Davis have made a good cast (Juliette Lewis's newborn character has been incredibly taken from reality, I know an American young lady who resembles her!), But GA doesn't show much more than her predominant plot. Although filmmaking is primarily about believing, there have been some inconsistencies in the script. Two samples: you pay 14 euro for entering the chapel where Cassandra and Frankie met, NEVER at 7 am and you cannot leave the terrace without paying the bill (they will charge you on the spot if they don't know you) or get off the THAT taxi quickly (you Americans always tipping taxis, even if they don't expect, but the sequences displayed in the movie were ridiculous. Don't trust me, readers: come and see for yourself. <br /> <br /> If you've never been here before you care about it, but good movies should be believable no matter what your origin. Nobody knows about GA here and I'll make sure it doesn't change in the future.
