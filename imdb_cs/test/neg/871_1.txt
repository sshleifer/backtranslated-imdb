This film is the last straw. As two devoted fans of romantic comedy, this film finally realized that nothing good came out of this genre because of Love Actually. There was nothing good about the movie. It was an insult to love, death, and everything in between. Including horses and beaches. There was no chemistry between the characters. This film took a spark from Nicholas Sparks. Diane Lane can't save her life. She was not convincing in her laughter, crying and dancing. And she needs a better hairstyle. There's no reason to watch this movie. Zachran se. The romantic comedy is officially dead.
