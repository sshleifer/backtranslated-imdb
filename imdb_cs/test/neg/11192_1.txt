If you want a great April Fool joke, please show this movie to someone by all means. However, it is important that you do not criticize the film in any way, but instead talk about what an artistic triumph is and how "they just don't make such big movies". As your victim looks at many detached and senseless scenes (such as a Cute Dog who is condemned for no apparent reason, a cow standing on the bed, a woman licking the foot of a statue or Jesus apparently raping a woman), they make a lot of comments using words like "brilliance "," juxtaposed "or" transcendent "- all the time when the film really makes perfect sense and is not a complete waste of your life. Also, make sure you keep your face straight and pretend to be shocked when (and if) they say they either didn't understand or thought they had all the art of cow patty. Then, to keep up with them mess, show them all the comments on IMDb, as almost everyone (except for a few problems-makers like almagz and rooprect) talk brightly about what genius and art this movie is! By the time you are done with this little charade, they will most likely think they are idiots and will talk to a psychologist. <br /> <br /> This is the only possible reason for me to watch this horrible movie mess !!! That, or you can show it to Guant√°namo prisoners so they can talk! <br /> <br /> If you ask me, the famous picture of dogs playing poker or the velvet image of Elvis is artistically superior.
