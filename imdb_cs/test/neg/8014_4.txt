I saw this TV movie, Hallmark, when it was aired. I lost interest in the story because it was said that the character was a witch. I just wasn't in the right spirit to watch this movie. But Hallmark means the best, quality movies. Now is the reason to give this film a second look. Clive Owen, who plays "Damon Wildeve", may have a chance to be selected as another James Bond 007 when Pierce Brosnan passes him on. Maybe Clive Owen will have to wait until 2008. Another reason is female leadership, Catherine Zeta-Jones is now a celebrity (she was unknown at the time) and in 2003 she became Academy holder. Plowright as "Mrs. Yeobright" is also in this movie. I like the opening line in this movie: "Give my heart out of this dreadful, lonely place. Send me a great love from somewhere or I'll die, I really die."
