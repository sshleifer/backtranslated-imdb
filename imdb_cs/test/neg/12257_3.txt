A really strange, unreal laugh of visual ideas that seemed to be very mysterious on the printed page; exactly what Robert Redford brought to the project will never know. Sidney J. Furie directs this journey from an Egyptian motorcycle racer who takes a juvenile milquetoasta under his wing; the child looks up to this anti-hero and finally begins to appeal to his immorality. Incoherent and disapproving - though for someone, the look at Redford, who was angry, could be closer or torn, enough to deserve attention. Lauren Hutton is nude too, but all the sexy flashes are just puzzles for a seductive mind; there is simply no story. Perhaps Furie made an esoteric note about helpless wheels and their herd around 1970. If this is true, then this pre-production approach turned back because the film was not successful. * 1/2 from ****
