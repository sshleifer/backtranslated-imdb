This is a nice run of a miller family movement that I am sure most children will enjoy, but not so much, to please all the adults watching the film. The film's premise is that Belushi's cop character takes his retirement but gets drawn into a case that results in him becoming a private investigator. The movie's plot is so obvious most kids will surely choose the end before it happens. But besides, they seem to be story arches and a partial plot that is forgotten during film development. This along with the sub-plot where the titular K-9 gets out of Belushi. I'm afraid it should be avoided.
