Obviously, many agents have not seen dollar signs when they subscribe to their clients for this 117-minute tour of the Kurtizan complex. The movie could be fine, $ 1 million was left out. Seriously. The amount of check does not matter, prostitution is still prostitution and no amount of "love conquers all" can change the fact that no marriage vows ever meant "for the richer for the poorer, for pimping as in loyalty". Picture story differently, though: 2 children, apartment broke, borderline "desperate" and completely stupid. He collides with a rich business man. The marriage of children is tense with imperfect times and the fact that the husband is something like a loser. Enter Mr. Tuxedo, radiate magic and stability - a virtual magnet for ticking biological clocks - and with it the temptation of a woman, tension, tension. Who chooses? Maybe I could really look after these conditions. Honestly, Redford's selfish and manipulative playboy builds on the likeable character. The woman who sells herself is just about what one deserves, and who frightens his wife. An indecent statement makes TOTAL's husband defeated, lacking all the positive male features, and makes the wife a cheap money-stricken strump, rather than confused by another potential love, a woman without a moral center and self-respect. All the impressive talent (acting, directing, cinematography) wasted on this film - and that was an impressive amount - couldn't save his splashy-but-too-burdensome $ 1 million pitch. If I see this turkey on another wedding shower, I'll bake it! (Or maybe cross with Titanic and pitch tape in the ocean!)
