Not only does VHS and DVD cover (at least in Europe) show a scene that has nothing to do with the actual storyline of the film, acting is so bad that the film calls for it to be fun. If you have nothing to do, you are with some good friends and you want to laugh with the movie to be serious, watch Tycus and Peter Onorati, the man who will teach you how to flip over the empty cardboard boxes! Shame of Dennis Hopper, following the Travoltas example by playing in his own "battlefield land". For those who want to watch a good film about a country that has been destroyed by terrible force, please don't choose Tycus, but do yourself a favor and watch "Armageddon" for twentieth time!
