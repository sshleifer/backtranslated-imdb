You expect it to be youthful, but at least you expect a complete and coherent movie. What a shame. I am extremely disappointed, not just watching a bad movie, but when I had such a great concept, it was a common movie we all saw earlier. If this crud were $ 1 above its budget, the studio would be wise to declare victory, round off all available copies, store them deep in the nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain, and then never make another film again. Most of this film will think of you: "This is not what I wanted to see." This film appeals to unintelligent and possibly teenagers. It's a real shame because most movies are made for this demographic group. I had a much higher chance of this film.
