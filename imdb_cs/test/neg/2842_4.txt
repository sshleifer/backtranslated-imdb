The best thing I can say about this porn-horror movie is: boobies boobies boobies! Besides, this movie is made by some Hindu / Indian guy with some background in porn movies or something. Plot: Talk-Show guest and girlfriend are being watched by a psychopath who is angry at the homeless situation and marries, guessed, beautiful ladies of real estate agents! (movies like these are the reasons why slasher films of the 80s has a rep for misogyny) This film is not really a Slasher, but it has the same kind of implausibility and stereotypes: Dumb-Ass cops, villain is old white man and women are busty babes. <br /> <br /> If you like porn-horror, it's your movie, otherwise stay away. (Adrienne fans will see her breasts bend for a second or two)
