The first 2/3 of this film was not so different from the American films of the Mummy of the 1930s and 1940s. Two lovers in ancient Mexico dared to defy the law and were sentenced to death. One became an Aztec mummy whose job was to protect the sacred treasure and its love. And the lady is reincarnated nowadays, and her mother naturally attracted her. So far, it's a typical mummy movie ... though it's a bit slower and more dull than the American version. Oh, and of course the Aztec mother looked really, miserable. But it's a super-villain to this standard but boring movie. Why? I don't know - it certainly made no sense. It looks like the villain wants a treasure, and she can hypnotize her and let her show where the Aztec treasure is buried. Why does he need a treasure? Well, buy the equipment needed to create an army of atomic robots, dummies! But first he has to build one mummy to defeat the mummy because the mummy has been unstoppable. but Flash Gordon robots and other BUT series have a rubber head of supposed dead man inside! They really look cheerful and see the conclusion when there is a huge battle between a lethargic mummy and an equally slow robot worth sitting in the rest of the boring movie. Both fighting in super-slow motion, such as taffy baths ... and it's done in such a helpless and stupid fashion that she's obligated to make laughter - certainly not excitement. Overall, the film is a very boring and confused mess - especially at the end. However, for bad movie fans, it's necessary to see - it's bad, but unintentionally funny and great to watch and laugh with friends.
