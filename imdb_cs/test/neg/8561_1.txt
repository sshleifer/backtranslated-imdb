I can only say this: ee03128 from Portugal, I couldn't say better. The worst movie I've ever seen ... and I've seen a lot of crap! When I read the comment, I was thinking only of the thoughts I had when watching the movie. When I saw who one of the writers was, I understood. Balaguero uses the same tricks in all his films. Even his scenarios are not much better. And of course, in Barcelona we have a lot of temples and churches all over the city to scare the cursed nuns into the young Americans on holiday. Be serious! And I don't want to talk about the quality of actors ... There's also something remarkable. It is fair to recognize it. Compared to the usual level, all Spanish actors use quite good English
