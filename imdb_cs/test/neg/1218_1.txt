This is the worst Italian movie ever, maybe the worst movie ever! Of course, Joe D'Amato is no film genius, but many of his films are interesting and attentive. Unfortunately, it's not one of them. Its cheesy and boring .... boring boring. If you want a MST3k movie, you get Troll 2 if you want a movie to get someone into a coma, get deep blood!
