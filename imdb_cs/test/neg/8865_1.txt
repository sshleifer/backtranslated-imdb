First tell me that I love divine horrible movies. Mainly horror movies. I watched hundreds of movies at Mystery Science Theater 3000 without pain. But this is the absolute worst movie on the planet !!! I had to turn it off, it was so bad. It was rude and simply unnoticeable. Give me 3 backs backstage Manos Hands of Destiny or Monster A-go-go over this day. Avoid this movie as a plauge !! Now, excuse me when I go to my eyes to clean them of the dirt I have had to follow in order to get a decent judgment for this film. The only decent gag in the part I watched is that the governors are now the extermination pair for the Hitman. It wasn't even for the big gag.
