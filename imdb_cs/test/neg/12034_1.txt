I'm so glad he didn't see this. This film is the debauchery of his work. I agree with another commentator - this film was a terrible disappointment. I'd give it zero, but I have to give it. The story was weak and reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager who tried to write a film, looked back at it and realized how awful it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid to fund it was how it was. It's really amazing how strings can be pulled out to do something. If this film proves to reach the general public, it hopes for other independent filmmakers who have a talent worth the struggle! This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. Apparently it wasn't really a comedy. Scary movie is a better horror game - this movie just pisses off.
