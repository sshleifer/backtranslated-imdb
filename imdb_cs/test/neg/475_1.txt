I saw this movie last night at a midnight insightful look (I'm working for an independent theater chain in Colorado - it's one of the benefits) ... I'm sorry, but this is one of the movies I've ever seen! I know there are some Bruce Campbell fans who you (like Star Wars die-hards) push you out of the nearest tree if DARE talks about some unpleasant movie icon ... however, Campbell-teers, this particular work from The Chin is celluloid black hole. Before you make any assumptions that I am a fake film movie fan who just watches "real" movies like "Ladies in Lavender" and "Sideways", think again - I'm a huge fan of B-movies and especially Bruce Campbell. His character Ash is one of my favorites and his depiction of an aging Elvis in Bubba Ho-Tep was phenomenal. But hey, B-movies still have the potential to be retaliation, ominously bad (and not that "good" campy way we all love) ... and that's what this particular was as for me and my fellow collaborators. Except that one tracking shot, where Bruce runs through the square and scares the kids, there was no laughter. Overall, we found out that this story is clumsy stoopid, templar shampoo and so-called humorous dirt than a bag of hammers. (I'm sorry, but Ted Raimi's "Paul" character wasn't a comic relief ... he was just retarded!) Believe me, we all really wanted to, but we left ourselves incredibly disappointed and robbed by Two Hours. <br /> <br /> If you really loved this movie, plan to see it several times, want to marry and have children with it, etc., that's fantastic - we all love what we like so you don't like it court. But don't ask questions about the sense of humor or loyalty of those who don't have more orgasms than the latest Campbell movie coupe. This movie was in my humble opinion ... and as a true Campbell fan!
