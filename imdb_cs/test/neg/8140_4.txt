It's a story as old as a man. Jealousy for woman and property of another man. There are even commandments against him. In this story, Raymond Burr ("Perry Mason", "Ironside") is a plantation manager runner who longs for the owners' wife and feels he's not him. t treated with respect. Wife, stellar Barbara Payton, who was trying to make a comeback after sordid affairs, was a desire for Burr, who killed his husband Paul Cavanagh. But lurking was something strange, a housekeeper (Gisela Werbisek) who sees everything, and who was able to avenge some voodoo for hurting, even another young woman (Carol Varga) whom Burr also professed love. Burr is poisoned and becomes or thinks he's gorilla. Payton will have to pair with Congo if she wants her marriage to end when she goes to the jungle every night. The end is predictable. But the question of this film is why Payton would ever be afraid. With those sharply directed rockets protruding from his chest, no animal could reach her to hurt.
