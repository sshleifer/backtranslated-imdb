I have to comment on this film because I gave it 4 ratings, and in my opinion it is quite a bit for the softporn movie. The real plot is a bit hockey (who would expect otherwise), but Hafron is so incredibly fun and adds everything in the cyborg voice, making it easy for him. Whoever wrote the script had a joke! I had to mock ten times, and that's not why someone would pick it up. The only movie I have seen that has had merit other than beautiful women (and believe me that Emmanuelle is an amazing drop drop ... just look at the cover!) <br /> <br /> Any movie that can entertain me Given how bad the storyline was and how bad the negotiations are, also given that the film was not designed to entertain, so to speak, it would get at least four in my book. Who wouldn't see this before Stop! Or my mom will shoot?
