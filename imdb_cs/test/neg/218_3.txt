Incredibly disappointed. The pace was slow. Incredible characters and throughout the movie let me feel bored and unfulfilled. There was no real plot that could turn you around the movie and keep your interest. The robbery itself never offered any excitement and it didn't seem to be very good. There was not enough depth or background for any character, and Laurance Fishbourne was one I was eagerly awaiting, unfortunately Laurance has no idea how to play thuggish brut and is much more likeable than that. Columbus's short one of my favorite actors (in the stomp yard) left me down with his performance, his character was dark and you barely saw what was driving his thinking. The only character I think offered something was Milo Ventimiglia (Peter Petrelli in Heroes). Although his character is relatively small and insignificant, I think his touch has been added to the ubiquitous film. Finally, buy a DVD if you want to find a new way to waste your time.
