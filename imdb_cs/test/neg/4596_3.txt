Rented it out of my local blockbuster SPECK - it can be a way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review. It's a movie about serial killer Richard Speck, who killed several sisters in Chicago in the 1960s. Watching the movie, one gets the feeling that it follows crimes on the letter. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean a good movie. Another problem I had was the almost constant music that let us know that it was SCARY MOVIE, and some god-terrifying narrative that gives us to know what's motivating Speck. The effect was average for this type of film; To give credit where the debt is due, the film is very beautifully photographed for my taste. The mileage may vary. <br /> <br /> If you're interested in the subject, it might be your time.
