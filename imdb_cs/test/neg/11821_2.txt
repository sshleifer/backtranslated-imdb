Imagine an exploitative remake of The Defiant Ones with a black chicken and white chicken attached to each other. Set a story on a Caribbean island where drug traffickers reign and revolution. And having a black girl from Huggy Bear and ladies and a white woman connected to Patty Hearst and you have a black mom, a white mom. In those diminishing days, the theater had to be this old big hit. All the hot buttons of the seventies will be pushed into this. Though they both fill their clothes better and get a couple of whistles from men in the audience, no one will ever let Pam Grier and Margaret Markov make a mistake for Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis. Okay, Halle Berry and Jamie Lee Curtis. Margaret and Pam are prisoners, where the guards and guards look closely at the new fish. Margaret is a wealthy girl from a state who has taken a "revolution", while Pam is your basic cost-effective girl girl who serves the local drug backbone and tired of trying to leave the island. Margaret's fellow revolutionaries ambush a bus that transports them from a female prison to a city, but gets lost in the run. They both have their own different program, but like Sid and Tony, they can't agree on what the program is first. She does some interesting times, such as the police, drug dealers, and revolutionaries looking for these two sick chain friends. Just to get no bad ideas, the head of revolutionaries and Markov's canoodling partner is named Ernesto played by Filipino actor Zaldy Zshornack. The whole mess was shot in the Phillipines who started their own film industry began. <br /> <br /> Nice location of the photo in the Phillipines is everything Black Mama, White Mam has to recommend. But if you're a fan of really bad black exploitation, it's not for you.
