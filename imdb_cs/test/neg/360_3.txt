This is the story of a maniac who for some reason has a young college student and his friends. After reporting him to his supervisor, who pauses him again, until a psychiatric assessment, he finds an opportunity for psychological torture when he stakes, the children get stuck in the safety of the department store and unlock the door. Only, they are locked in the store, along with the weirdo. Murder and chaos are on your feet, and kids running around trying to survive until dawn when they may be able to escape. 'Dangerous Game' would be a successful cat-and-mouse psycho thriller probably if it was set up elsewhere. The idea of ​​a psychotic cop chasing a lot of innocent teenagers in a department store just didn't work. Especially when he comes face-to-face with lousy prey quite often, and yet nothing serious is often done. There was no real confrontation that would be sufficient for this kind of story, and maybe it would work better if, for example, it said that teenagers were free in the neighborhood and let themselves take care of themselves (especially if it took a few days while he makes them increasingly paranoid ... though awarded, even that is a cliché. What a pity, too, that it couldn't be a better thriller, considering the funky cast of a young Australian character. Even a light adventure, despite the madness of a villain scattered by the image, could even make him a more satisfying picture. Instead, it started freshly, and he certainly had a lot of action sequences, but they broke into ridiculous.
