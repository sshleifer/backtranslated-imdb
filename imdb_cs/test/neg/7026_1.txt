The Lucille Ball version of "Mame" in my opinion is one of the worst performances ever made. After seeing Lucy more than astronomically in her various sitcoms, I can tell you that I really love Lucy, but this film is a fiasco of incredibly bad casting, music and dance. Robert Preston is the only saving grace with a little work that you miss when you blink. I don't know what she was thinking, and I can't imagine how the studio or director would recommend her, but I was actually deaf when I watched this awkward performance. I could be really cruel and suggest that I watch him for laughter, but it's too lame, even if he has to qualify for it. Don't waste your money or your time.
