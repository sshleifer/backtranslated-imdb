Terrible writing, directing and playing! The writer / director portrayed Southerners, especially southern law enforcement as ignorant, backwoods, homophobic and racist (a very popular but ignorant, stereotype that the film industry loves to maintain). Negotiations (or overclocking) and writing came as an amateur and low budget. The plot line is the same old story of Hollywood Hollywood story about "racist and homophobic digs that are eventually defeated by enlightened people from the Newwww Yoke Ceety." I was brought up in the small town of Louisiana where this film was filmed and looked forward to seeing the movie but was immediately disappointed during the first few minutes of the movie. The beginning of the film depicts a gay bar located in the "swamps" of Louisiana. How ridiculous concept! There are many gay and gay bars in southern Louisiana, but no gay bars in "swamps" or small cities of Louisiana. Then we are introduced to the sheriff, who uses the phrase "homuh-sex'l" in the worst of the southern draws and exaggerated performance. Then there's a scene where the local police are watching the police station. I could go on and on about horrible kitsch acting or outdated stereotypes or ridiculous scenes. This director and his crew were greeted in this small, friendly city and showed true southern hospitality. The townspeople of Lake Arthur, and the state of Louisiana were only to be offended and degraded in final editing. The good people of Lake Arthur were excited and in love with "Hollywood" in the city, who didn't know they would be portrayed as unconscious, racist and homophobic bumpkins in a low-budget amateur movie that went straight to DVD. My advice: skip this or watch it late at night if it sometimes makes them spin.
