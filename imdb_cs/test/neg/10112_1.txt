Hey guys and girls! Never rent or let God buy this piece of waste. I seldom saw a movie in any genre as bad as this one. Acting is actually worse than me and my friends, when we were 7 and in 1.grade they had to act in front of all parents and siblings. In fact, we would be admitted to the Oscars if we were to be compared to the actors in Darkhunters. The story is terrible, make-up is terrible, filming is horrible, set is terrible, directing is horrible, etc. I can't actually find anything that is worth seeing the movie. that is a little cute. Please use your money for other things than this movie .... I couldn't even see the last 15-20 minutes of the movie, it was so awful .. If this movie really liked, I'd really like to hear from you, I will try to find out if I can advise you in a psychiatrist's office near you. <br /> <br /> 0 out of 10, if possible, not for the price of a DVD or tape is on ..
