This is to be based on Wilkie Collins '_The_Woman_In_White_, but the only similarity that bore that story was the characters' names, time period and setting. If they're going to change the story so thoroughly, I don't understand why they needed to keep up with pretending to come from Wilkie Collins. Go read the book. It's much better.
