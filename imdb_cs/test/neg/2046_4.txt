What is really scary about this is that filmmakers thought they were doing something smart and sexy. Instead, they made the dumbest horror picture of the year! This movie begins with a lot of snob art friends in the gallery. This strange European weirdo goes upstairs and starts talking about the flashy fruitiness of the main character, sounding like he just came out of the Dark Shadow episode. Then she offers her a wand to smoke (yes, a crazy wand) with which she eagerly agrees! She chooses some red bullshit and puts it in a spoon so she can freely find it! If this ever happens to you in real life, don't do it! It is transported to some strange wannabe Jean Rollin who is supposed to be sexy, but not where the thing that looks like a rotting black lagoon creature is! Soon he turns all his frightening muddy friends into her new form of supernatural crack. It doesn't matter how much these idiots spread and blue, they can't leave it in hell. He even sets out with a rotten creature in one place! After the final battle and a foolish woman evaporates or whatever, the so-called hero will remain alone to wrap up his copy of Dude's Michael Moore, where My Country is, and I can't resist smoking that holds once more to try save his friend. What's the drug. The prices for four stars are for unintentional humor.
