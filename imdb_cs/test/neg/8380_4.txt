First, several universities allow students to take courses from their parent's lover. Secondly, few female professors are sleeping with dorm cooks. Third, a couple of brass graduates have a father who cooks in the dorm. Fourth, once a small team of team members from a small group of projects encounters a violent demise, the PRESIDENT College will dissolve the class and not open its eyes when the professor happily directs the rest of the group to terrible deaths. Since the CULT supernatural elements make no sense, it is useful to explore the mundane content of this film to really realize how much this movie really sucks!
