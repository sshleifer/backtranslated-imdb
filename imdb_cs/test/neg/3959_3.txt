The word honor should be deleted from the dictionaries of all nations. It worsens male stupidity and is responsible for the death of millions of innocent people. Anyone who disagrees with this should not worry about continuing to read this comment. As expected with these screenwriters, the Yakuza is an engaging thriller of crimes with quite a lot of respect for the ethnic background they've been dealing with. Nor will gore friends and violence be disappointed, but especially towards the end, violence will become somewhat useless, superfluous and totally stupid. Unlike other reviewers, I found out that Robert Mitchum's performance is not very good. This is an actor who has definitely not improved with age. He seems to be a tired janitor (not too well with the part), and his enthusiasm, which made him such an amazing presence on screen in earlier years, comes either as confusion or lack of interest. Ken Takakura and Richard Jordan are very good as a man of honor and young, intelligent, feels like a robber. The best way to build this movie is to see it as a tragic comedy. Things are set in motion by Mitchum, who asks Takakura for favor based on wrong assumptions. The error will quickly manifest itself, but it requires a sense of honor not to retreat. So they begin to sneak around, shoot in all directions, control the swords and destroy your friend's arty apartment (though the guy begs them? Stop, please, "through all the appropriate struggle.) The points begin to accumulate and the story ends with Mitchum's character, who makes his point: If you put HIM your little finger, I'll give YOU MINE. Well, it's the least he can do, can't he? So he pulls out the knife, takes the resigned breath and starts cutting from that end. the moment that was supposed to be a festive one just made me laugh. <br /> <br /> The use of places in this film is very good at and around the international conference hall on Lake Takaragaike, an interesting futuristic building by architect Sachi Otani (signed Kyoto Protocol) The introduction of architecture seems to me better than in the newer Sydney Pollacka Sketches of Frank O. Gehry which is about architecture and nothing else.
