There seems to be a great potential for the story of this movie to be something worth watching. Acting was flat and the story lacked depth. They relied too much on working with a camera that had some high points. I have to agree with the other negative comments. I just wish I read them before buying the DVD. The film is worth watching for free and you can get bored with tears. There could have been a much greater development of the conspiracy with why there are homeless people in Moscow (ie Post-Soviet "capitalism", uncontrollable drug use (ie, increased heroin trafficking in Afghanistan), the USSR, archaeologists themselves, or even more so nihilism.
