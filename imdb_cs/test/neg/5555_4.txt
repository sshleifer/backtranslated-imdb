Some may remember when they saw the Juno scene, where Ellen Page has a moment of praise for her favorite horror movie, Darpir Argento Suspiria. Jason Bateman's character then asks if she ever saw Herschel Gordon Lewis, and has a joke that she has a copy of the movie (forgetting at the moment) and shows her. At that time I saw Juno seeing Suspiria and some Argento movies, but not Lewis. Now I see that it is not just another of Diablo Cody's pop-in "links," but something that is actually an indicator of character tastes and perhaps even more subjective how to judge them based on their tastes. In other words, Herschel's reputation, Gordon Lewis, is maintained several years after he has finished filming his films - and that is Schlock-Meister, nothing more. Actually, less. It is interesting to take Argento as a basis for comparison because both filmmakers approach, at least in the case of Gore Gore Girls and, well, any image of Argento, similar to the material. Where Argento is extremely conscious of his craft to wrap the audience in any small story about the power of camera movement and music and style, Lewis takes the easy way to reach the audience who is with the immature scenario. and (light putting) a slight direction. Gore Gore Girls reveals a filmmaker who doesn't want to entertain his audience in a real way as a horror movie, but as a side show or brothel. He can't drive actors who are worth the hell, he lights up like it was a porn movie, and for anyone who might be smart or funny, there are ten that either stink or are too smart about half or not so smart. As mentioned above, perhaps as the best thing to say about Gore Gore Girls, about the mysterious film about a detective (Sherlock Holmes's 2nd year, played by somewhat funny Frank Kress) and a journalist (Amy Farrell dummie) ) Investigating a series of go-go dancers is that it serves as a template for countless other Troma-style pictures. Perhaps it is a weak praise, and indeed the best thing that can really be said is that Henny Youngman - "Take my wife, please!" - has several scenes and steals each one without having to try it. It is sad because it can be a picture that could be fun at a terribly bad level. But even on this score, one may laugh more of the embarrassment for production, some actors (ie, the guy who plays a cop, my God) than from any sense of pleasure in joy. Gore itself is somewhat down. Initially, he thinks Lewis is at least at this end, at least, and shows that these women are being murdered in crazy and malevolent and exaggerated ways. But with murders it all takes longer than necessary; I don't mean it in terms of shock value because it's okay. But there must be something else to make it really a "stick" to see that the faces of women are falling apart and the eyes are irritated if you have 12 and see it as one of the first "horror" movies. It happens, I dare say it, boring. Dangerously boring for such a "daring" so-called film. This was Lewis' last film until 30 years later apparently worthy of a swan song came up with a sequel to the film he made earlier earned him from his retirement from movies and work in writing books about how in business. However, any experience he has come to does not show up. It's not a failure, but it could be and it's just ... schlock. Take it or leave it.
