This game comes from the genre of games that tried to make the most of the trend inspired by Mystem - to walk, talk to people, solve puzzles. The puzzles are absolutely terrible, but I will stick to the act itself, which is only slightly better. If you are looking for a convincing performance from one character, you will not find it here, but this game is worth it if you are witnessing a truly hilarious performance by Christopher Walken. His acting is so horrible in this game that he seems to imitate someone who is pretending to be. It is a cartoon of itself. So buy this game if you are masochistic, Walken fans, or you just want to hear a F-word a lot.
