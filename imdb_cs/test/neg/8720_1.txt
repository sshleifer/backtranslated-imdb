That's a bit of crap. It's an insult to Frank Herbert's amazing book. They devoured the story and the characters. The effect is average to bad. The only character he did right and played well is Duke Leto, played by William Hurt. Unfortunately, he dies very early in the story and then crashes (not that it should be a high hill). The 1984 movie was directed by legendary David Lynch. I wasn't overwhelmed by the film, but because of the time constraints of technology, they tried the best. Surprisingly, the crappy mini series makes it look much better in comparison. That was at least somewhat true to the book I really like. This time they had the opportunity to do it right, unfortunately it was not accepted.
