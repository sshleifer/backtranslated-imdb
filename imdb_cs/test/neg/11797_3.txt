Obviously, someone was looking at the "Blair Witch". get a kick out of these) but this movie is much cheesier! Probably the first three quarters of the film are filled with "participants" who walk through the house, WHINING. Give me a break! Spending 10 minutes whining about how to go to the attic is not my idea of ​​good time. Some paranormal events are obvious. No strings, but too perfectly captured by the camera to be real. "Participants" were not very likeable. Two pissing guys who don't take it seriously, one girl who scares at a drop of a hat, and the supernatural played a "paranormal" person. Does it become a "formula" cliché for a ghost movie? I have to admit that the last 15 minutes was pure tension. They took every ounce of tension in the film and got stuck in the 15 minutes. I admit I spent the time in the kitchen. I really wouldn't recommend this movie to younger audiences, even though it's PG13. <br /> <br /> If you're looking for some fun, if you don't take it seriously, you'll get a kick. of this movie. There's a lot of situations to crack around! If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere;)
