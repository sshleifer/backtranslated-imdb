I don't know if I hate the movie just like I did when I watched it two weeks ago, but if you expect the events described on the box, forget it ... that would be a good movie. The great descent described on the box is nothing compared to the descent into the utter contradiction that I have seen this film. If you've seen HBO Taxi Cab Confessions, it's just the same, just fictional, and not remotely interesting. If you really want to see something interesting about a taxi driver, check out the 20 minute time that runs on Encore from time to time. I've never asked for money back to film until I saw ... the thing. Boring, boring, boring. This offers one unique feature that is this: This allows you to decide what happens to each of the passengers, so your imagination fills the gaps. Which would be great if you really care about one of these people. Instead, I found myself screaming at the screen, crying like a child, praying for either the end of the movie or for my own death. The cab driver himself (though playing well, considering) goes through emotions seemingly random, from sarcastic to sympathetic to furious madman to apathy. Sometimes it's appropriate, most of the time it's just a display for your own use. "Damn, I've learned all these emotions in the acting class and I'm going to use them!" Now that I think about it again, I hate this movie just like I do!
