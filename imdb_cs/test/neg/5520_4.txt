Oddly enough, it's Fred MacMurray, who plays a "helix" part in this comedy. Carole Lombard shows great performance that combines brighter moments with drama and seriousness. Fred MacMurray is usually a mystery to me. The camera is not a fan of his, it is not so attractive and has no style and panache to get rid of this role of Cary Grant. Ralph Bellamy is an excellent friend of his return to life through his relationship with Lombard's character. We can only wonder why her character would not want his soft, soothing love instead of the almost certain destruction of MacMurray's inaction. But that's Hollywood! <br /> <br /> The image almost works, but lacks a brand, especially thanks to MacMurray performance. It would be nice to see Grant or even Clark Gable in his role. Lombard and Bellamy are very believable and likeable; MacMurray is stiff and makes him hold his arm.
