Emperor's (Richard Haydn) dog is engaged to Johanna (Joan Fontaine). However, when Virgil (Bing Crosby) comes to town to sell the record player to the Emperor, his dog is attacked by Johann's dog. After a revenge attack where Virgil is deported from the city, the psychoanalyst insists that Johanna's dog has to face Virgil's dog to overcome her dog fears. It is arranged and the dogs fall in love. So with Virgil and Johanna. The rest of the film goes through with romance, and Johanna is born at the end. But who's the father .......? The Dog Story is a very weak vehicle that is used to try to create a story between people. It's a terrible story. There are 3 main music tracks, all of which are garbage - bad songs and horrible choreography. It's just a very boring movie - Bing has too many words in every sentence and adds them to an almost shocking, irritating way. It's not funny ............ EVER .......... but it should be. Bing and Joan did much better.
