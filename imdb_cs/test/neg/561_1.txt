The scenario is the worst part of this movie because it moves from one place to another, missing all the important pieces that would allow a variety of different stories. (This movie is confusing because viewers don't know what the story is.) I didn't have a problem with low production values ​​and acting wasn't great, but that's telly, so it was fine. I don't mind that some scenes looked like they were done in one step. But having such a nonsensical scenario is totally useless. Did an executive read it before giving money? Avoid it at all costs. The prologue was especially poorly written, he needed a voice to fill in all the details that were left out. The prologue was rushed, it was not clear what was happening, ie the Russian Revolution was reduced to "some riots happening in Petersburg", with another scene being soldiers to arrest them. I know the basic history of the revolution, so I could fill in the details, "those annoying communists". The prologue is best ignored. It could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who he is. It sets this assumption in asylum. Then she could try to identify for the rest of the film. No. The film assumes that it is what it says is (although there is no empirical evidence yet.) It creates a melodramatic romance, a love so strong that it will believe everything it says. Okay, fleeting romance. No, because it doesn't make sense. The interest of love appears to be crazy (and, by the way, sleazy) madman who sprawls in wild gestures. It also does not work because the film foolishly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end. They never married and returned to America. Love story collapses. Despite the fact that there are lots of love scenes, I've never been convinced why they are in love. Rom-com romance is more convincing, although there are only one or two scenes that show that they have spent some time together. It could have been something that could be said The film assumes it is what it says it is, and tries to prove its identity. No, the case is summarized rather than solved. The bizarre voice returns, filling in the details of a better movie again. <br /> <br /> The funniest thing to consider is what really happened. Anna Anderson was a loony who went to America and married other crazy things. During her life she had bouts of madness. None of it even in the movie. There is a really annoying character in asylum that emerges from nothing and declares itself "One flew over the informant of the" Cuckoo Next / "twelve Monkeys. Fortunately, it will disappear and bring nothing to the story.
