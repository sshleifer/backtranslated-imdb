Revealing Se7en and unable to clean shoes. The word "predictable" had to come up with such an opportunity. Lambert is wooden, as always (his moments of "emotions" are ridiculous, as well as his accent). The "highlight" is not at all what we have had so many signals, and eventually we're just immune to body, rot and otherwise. Overall a real mess.
