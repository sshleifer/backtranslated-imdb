I love ghost stories and I'll sit in the movie when it's over, even if I'm really enjoying it. I rarely feel like I've wasted my time ... But this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was terrible! It wasn't scary at all. What's with comic moments? The dialogue was lengthy. Inconsistent Film The film was too long and some scenes were unnecessarily pulled out in my open space. (Just like a birthday party) <br /> <br /> The only good idea I think of mentioning is that the costumes and props were well done. I'm curious about the next adaptation, but until then, I'll keep reading about the story.
