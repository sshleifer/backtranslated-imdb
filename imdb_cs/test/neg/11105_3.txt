Seriously, Sci-Fi has to stop making movies. They're all terrible. And this one had John Rhys-Davies in it, and the movie couldn't help. Dr. Pena (Giancarlo Esposito) captures the legendary goat eater of Mexico, Chupacabra, and brings it aboard the cruise ship Captain Rudolf (John Rhys-Davies). The creature then escapes and begins to kill the crew and passengers. Captain Rudolf and the crew then follow the creature, weapons ablazin '. But they can't stop it. So they call the Navy. They can't even stop it. Then the thing kills all 5 (or many). Then the captain and his daughter, along with some other guy, will figure out how to kill him. Stay away from this movie. Chupacabra looks incredibly cheesy, navy men shoot at the slightest movement, throwing grenades at the ship and acting is terrible. 3/10.
