I have to look at this without a commercial break, and let me tell you that it was quite predictable even for a TV movie. The actors did the job of working with what they had, and the cast was pretty perfect - Barry Bostwick, Jane Seymour, Frances Fisher, etc. However, the script was not only predictable (except the last scene), but the dialogue was treacherous and sounded like was taken out of the novel of the third grade novel. Jane Seymour's psychotic monologues were ridiculous. I am sorry, but it is difficult for me to believe that anyone who would spookyly suspect. Just as bad was Theresa Russell in the "black widow" - and she certainly crushed it - at least it made sense to play pseudo-characters somewhat straight. Seymour is a much better actress, but the material did not overcome it. Finally, the music score is incredibly ugly. It's almost the satire of his genre, like Kenny Gen's collapse. A film with such a bland and derived scenario should be more challenging for something.
