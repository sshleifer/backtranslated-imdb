I've seen the original "Jack Frost", I never thought "Jack Frost 2" would be as absurd as it was. The boy was wrong! And then, A-PIX movies have a way to show incredibly bad material, even worse than you'd expect. I believe this is the first installment of A-PIX, and this may be an indication of what to expect in the future: more A-PIX sequels. It's hard to watch without laughter, especially during the later part of the movie in which Jack Frost's offspring (which are essentially snowballs with eyes, arms, mouth and sharp teeth) start killing people with typical comic dialogue and stupid voices go with it. They are shown both by puppets (with their wand below them to move) and by computer animation, which I have to say, looks very cheesy. Computer animation surprised me because the first "Jack Frost" had no such effects. I recommend you to see the original "Jack Frost" before you see it (both more appropriate to look at with a group of friends) to get full fun, and because it would make more sense ("Sense" is a relative term). Now, only if it existed. Uncle Sam 2 "...
