Nobody has anything to do in this movie. That's about the longest 65 minutes I've ever spent watching a movie. Make-up effects on a pianist with macromeglia are pretty good, but that's the only thing that keeps it from being speed 1. The physician's assistant is going through extreme fluctuations in mood from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to have forgotten where she was in another scene. The director gathered a lot of the right ingredients for a mad doctor movie, but somehow he forgot about the skeleton of the story to hang it. If you don't know someone in cast or crew, I wouldn't recommend sampling.
