That was so bad, I want God to give me two more hours of life that had to sit through it. Firstly, the negotiations were uniformly wrong. There was hardly a plot, unless "Shaggy dog ​​story with a guy in the rain poncho and skeleton mask instead of a dog" counts. The adjustments were everywhere, and slow-mo shots of "gore" (red corn syrup flying through the air - no doubt thrown by a spoon) irritated after the tenth time and got angry at the time. <br /> <br /> I like Michael Rooker. He did a good job. That wasn't good. That was less than good. And I mean, it was sucked. Hard. <br /> <br /> For God, don't take this movie.
