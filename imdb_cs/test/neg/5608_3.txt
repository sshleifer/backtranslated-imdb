Simply put, movies are free of any substance. Take my word for it and save yourself the time when it's a complete DUD !! I would say that the characters are one-dimensional, but that would mean that there was some character development. I thought Eric Roberts was going to jump every second so close to the B-movie. The 70's girl is beautiful ... but if you're not a stalker, this movie has nothing for anyone. Avoid ... Avoid ... Avoid <br /> <br /> This movie was right on the DVD for ... it's ... it's a train wreck !!!
