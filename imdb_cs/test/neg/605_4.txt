"When a killer calls" is an unusually ugly slasher swing, with some very unpleasant and disturbing sequences. The decision was made unambiguously to try cash on the remake of "When A Stranger Calls" by putting - almost a word for the word - phone calls from this movie. They seem to be very forced. In addition, the filmmaker commits a cardinal (but all too common) to have friends of the heroine who are repulsive. So for the beginning of the movie we are really happy and are rooted for babysitting (nice trusted work Rebekah Kochan), but then joins the standard slasher-flick teenage friends and the mood is destroyed. <br /> <br /> A quick kind of job, but it's probably much more unpleasant than you expect, so be warned in advance.
