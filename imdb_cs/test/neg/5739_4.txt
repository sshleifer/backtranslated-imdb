This proved to be a rare case of poliziottesco with British funding; unfortunately, the result is indistinguishable (with the exception of its excessive inconvenience and cross-border camp approach) despite the stars and the director. The first is led by Frank Nero and ultralight Telly Savalas as a couple of wannabe thieves (if anyone is able to believe either an actor who generally radiates cool - more gullible than me!). <br /> <br /> Their "work" happens (ends with murder and saddled cutlery instead of jewelry!) ??? however, dissent criminals see the opening of their dilemma when they inadvertently 'kidnap' the son of a British diplomat (miscast Lester, who even gets kick trigger-lucky Savalas where it hurts at one point). But they never buy it, and their only intention is to cross the border to France; Marking along with them is Nero's girlfriend (useless Ely Galleani): soon, though, she has enough and decides to run away while the others sleep; Crazy Savalas notices and follows the girl, kills her. Meanwhile, Nero and Lester woke up? the former thinks his accomplices may have doubled him, so he goes with the boy to the tow; after a short spell on the rich, ancient country homestead (which has absolutely no grounds behind Nero and Lester!) Savalas catches up with them. They continue their trek, where the trio runs into the family of German campers: is the situation going to the point where Savalas closes them in a trailer and throws them into the river? even if he is severely injured in this process; typically, it all ends up with a 'heavy' get to kill just as they want to reach the border. The film, therefore, contains most of the typical genre elements? sleaze, sadism, violence, persecution (the consequences of opening a robbery when a car on the run causes confusion in the narrow streets of the city and even disturbs the funeral procession is downright farcical), etc.; One of the most interesting aspects is that at the end, Lester himself is seen to be (irrevocably?) marked by experience? feel excited when a violent act is committed.
