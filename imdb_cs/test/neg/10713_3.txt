Three-quarters of an hour's story gradually evolves towards a key point of some sort. Although it is overloaded with scenes that seem to be intended to shake the viewer and lure him out of a real plot, something is happening. It's not much, and it's definitely not obvious. The combination of palace impressions and story scenes does not add any depth or look to the entire cast of characters. In fact, they keep them sterile because there is no character development at all. Everyone just keeps spinning and concentrating around their own clichés and roles - a cute little stubborn girl; martial überwoman, snobbish aristocrat. The male leadership seems to have no difference at all, it's a shallow presence that doesn't really matter how it is there just because the script needed it - it seemed to be on vacation and grabbed up. When it comes to revolving what's happening, the movie gets stuck for a few minutes and then becomes ridiculous. It solves - or better - dissolves - itself with Deus Ex Machina, more clichés and some of the most serious devices and options I've ever seen. It's history, all right. First the film is a drama though it is supposed to be comic, and then turns into a farce. The protagonists do what is expected of them and they are not surprised. However, the first set of somewhat serious antagonists will be replaced by a pair that was literally bored. Maybe it was some kind of nod to the audience. This movie doesn't get any bonus from me for basic philosophical meaning (because there is none) or for its technical execution. Animation and editing is fair and so is sound mixing; but it is by no means superior to the average Japanese production of the late 1980s. In fact, visual enjoyment seems to be static, uninspired, and unoriginal. Worst of all - he can't talk totally, even if you don't bother with characters and all things. Here's too little and the rest is at best. Instead, get the real Ghibli, leave a feast with it and keep your fingers.
