I agree with what many others have said about the shallow and offensive nature of investigating the racism of this film. It's confused for me that so many people seemed to be deceived by his arrogance. I want to comment on the character of Matt Dillon as an example of what is most annoying about this film. Here we have a man who, in contrast to the basic message of the film, that "we are all LITTLE racist" - effectively rapes a woman in public, cruelly humiliates her husband and deliberately guides him to take a step that, like him, will lead to his arrest or even death. He does it all after pulling out a couple without a legal reason, but because, as we understand, they are black and rich, and he's a wounded little boy who is now police, so he can do what he likes. This behavior is not a LITTLE racist. This behavior is bad. It is worrying to me that this extreme of racism is being held next to the behavior of another character - pouring out her paranoid stereotypes about gang violence - to illustrate that everyone is a LITTLE racist. Later we fed some brazenness about Dillon's poor old father and how the black people took him to a poor house. Does it explain, or worse, excuse this behavior? He wanted to redeem Dillon's character himself by committing a totally unmotivated and incredible, laughing accidental act that saved the woman he had sexually attacked the night before? Please. The fact that so many people seem to feel some admiration for this film is sad for me about the shallowness of our understanding of racism and our apparent lack of determination to condemn and end it.
