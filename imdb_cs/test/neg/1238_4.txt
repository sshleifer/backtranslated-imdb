I'm not sure this review contains spoilers, but I'm playing it safely and suggesting it might be. Regardless, it is unlikely that anyone would watch this movie, which is not familiar with the book. There's an old wisecrack about mighty work and a mouse call. "Comanche Moon" is such a mouse. The novel focuses more on Indians than on Americans. McMurtry and Osanna had adapted to the TV correctly, and so they correctly concluded that viewers would be more interested in white than red. Unfortunately, there is little in the novel about Gus, Woodrow and their friends. Thus, the film usually gives us a tremendous prejudice over what will happen in "Lonesome Dove". The Indians - who have their own story - are largely pushed into the background - so much so that someone who has not read the novel will be rightly interested in why it is called "Comanche Moon". The novel has no general story line, or a lot of "point". This could be fixed in the film, the more strongly to draw the contrast between the Indians losing their land and the way of life to persecuting Americans, who bring "civilzation". This opportunity was wasted. Unlike "Lonesome Dove", "Comanche Moon" has several extended scenes that develop character or relationships - at least among Americans. Extended scenes with Indians have been largely eliminated or shortened. And for a (clean) four-hour movie, it's remarkably episodic and choppy. One gets the feeling that the scenario was originally longer, thus reducing production costs. The script mainly includes clich√©s of dialogues, aphorisms and phrases. It comes from "The Last Picture Show", a surprisingly bad script. McMurtry and Osanna had the opportunity to fix story and character problems, but not. Some of the best novel dialogues are missing or altered, for no apparent reason. For example, Clara (Cassie) shows her intense hatred of Woodrow (Jack) by denouncing Guse (Ennis) for always running away being with his "pard". This little Clara revelation with sexual jealousy is gone. Then there's a scene where ur-dense Woodrow warns Maggie not to let Jake Spoon "compromise" her. The exchange in the novel is shorter and tougher; the film dampens it and does not depict Woodrow as a pretty socially stupid, emotionally frozen stone that is. (When I read the scene in the novel, I wanted to throw Woodrow into my stomach - or worse.) There are other changes, some of which are understandable. Inish Scull eyelids are not cut off; to do so, they demanded expensive CGI. But Buffalo Hump has no hump! (Maybe it was unreasonable to ask Wes Studi to hide around such a huge prosthesis.) And Buffalo Hump's character is "kinder and gentler." He is nowhere almost as grotesquely violent as he was in novels. The only good thing about this nearby Turkey is Steve Zahn's remarkable performance - not as much as Gus McCrae, but as Robert Duvall playing Gus McCrae. It's mysterious. It perfectly duplicates Duvall's mannerism and manner of speech without ever appearing as "intentional" or self-confident. Like Duvall, he is completely "inside" the character. And in fact it shows us that Gus becomes "more Gus" in the third part. The best thing about "Comanche Moon" is that it won't spoil the affection for "Lonesome Dove", not just a great Western, but a great American movie. PS: For those who think Rachel Griffiths was at the top - that's the way she was in the book.
