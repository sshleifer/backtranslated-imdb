One of the low budget horror schlockmeister actor, John Carradine is a more animated role as an implied Nazi scientist who is turning people into zombies to serve the Reich. Mindless brain skuling dead, just able to listen to the simplest orders .... a little like the staff at McDonalds. Hitler is not mentioned by name because America was not at war at the time they were filmed, but it's pretty clear who the bad guys are working for! There seem to be two types of zombies in the movie, a traditional voodoo type popular in old 1930s black and white movies. and 40 years. Empty eyes and just follow someone else's orders when they stumble. And then there's the type we know from later movies like 'The Night of the Living Dead' and 'The Evil Dead'. Still roaming, but only with the intention of killing and eating the flesh and brains of their victims. Both have their moments in different movies over the years. 'Revenge' is a former type of zombie, although it is mainly a goofy look and would look more at home in an old magical series that appears as a geek when chewing chick heads. One black zombie named Lazarus with wild hair looks like a young King Don. As for the conspiracy, the evil doctor decides that his wife will become a zombie along with others, and that is where he makes his mistake. Although she lets her keep her in her belts as a nice female touch when she turns her into one of the dead, she's not happy about it. It all goes terribly wrong and ends with tears and the morale of the story has to be, never, never, your wife will not change zombies, it's just a problem .... <br /> <br /> The film is quite interesting and quickly moves to the goal, but never increases over the origin of poverty. It's not a patch on any real zombie classic but fun anyway.
