Hubie - like Stanley's troll in Bluth's Troll in Central Park - lacks a personality spark that is the main character that carries the entire film. We should love him because he is nice, but that's all he is. <br /> <br /> His character design is unpleasant. The top of his head is a dome that is narrower than the murky lower half of his head. And penguins should not have teeth. I know Iago's parrot in Aladdin had teeth, but maybe it worked because it looked more like his voice actor, Gilbert Gottfried. Hubie, with his little voice (according to Martin Short), looks funny with a large set of chomperos in his beak. Tim Curry, who is usually great, makes some dippy surfer Dude accent as a villain (maybe he was a good voice for comic companions, not supposedly a menacing main villain). The whole plot revolves around the hero and the villain's love for the female penguin Marina, who is as dull as both her suitors. <br /> <br /> The worst of all is stimulation. We continue to go back to the villain to see him threaten Marina - this time in a dialogue, this time in a song ... Barry Manilow can be a great composer, but in such an animated movie Thumbelina , his songs feel flabby and harsh - especially ballads. The only song I liked was the song "Good Ship Misery" from the 1930s. I read that the distributor has made some cuts to the film wishes in this movie and that it may have caused some problems - though I believe the real problem is that they didn't break the rest;).
