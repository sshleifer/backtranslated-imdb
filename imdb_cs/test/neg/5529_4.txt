Victor Jory has never become a star. He is better known for later character roles than for his early lead. But he was a very handsome and excellent actor. His love scenes with Loretta Young in this romantic adventure thriller are passionate. Their kisses look very real. And very modern. Vivienne Osborne is also excellent. She plays a woman with a reputation. But the character has a good heart. <br /> <br /> The print I saw was not clear. But what a joy that such rare movies are appearing! And they are, in some attentive state, still unaffected. It's nothing special. However, if a person is willing to go through films of his era with similarly interesting titles, they are likely to find some suprtb movies.
