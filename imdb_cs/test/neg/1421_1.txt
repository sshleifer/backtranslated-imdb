It has one of the most pathetic, predictable and poorly played movies I've ever seen. Clint Eastwood has never been worse, I've never seen anyone less convincing on the screen. I laughed at him all the way. Then there is this romance between him and the wonderful Rene Russo who was even more pathetic than the one between Mr.Connery and Mrs. Zeta-Jones in Entrapment. <br /> <br /> One IMDb questioned: What does this movie not like? I ask: What is it about? The answer is: John Malkovich. He is an absolute genius and probably the best film thief ever. But that's it. This film is called On Fire, but "Bodyguard 2: rip-off" seems to be a more appropriate title. Watch only if you're a John Malkovich fan. Otherwise, avoid it at all costs. * 1/2 (out of five)
