This is an admirable attempt by the first filmmaker, Hama Tran, to offer a little handsome look at the victims of the Vietnam War who are seeking liberation, but playing like a glorious history. With a clumsy, self-confident informative dialogue and a subparpar, even a relatively impressive detail-focused budget will not lead to the life of this flaccid, though historically worthy, melodrama. Let's not forget the often distracting disconnection with the actors on the reality of the screen, and you should be left with an informative, if somewhat impersonal, educational lesson in Vietnam's postwar history.
