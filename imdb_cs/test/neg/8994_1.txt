Ram Gopal Verma usually makes a so-so cookie cutter formula price, raised from any Hollywood movie. His every film after Shiva is in the cookie-cutter genre. Sometimes he makes a really horrible movie like this. <br /> <br /> For the first 55 minutes we met the only 2 characters, a fighting gymnast camouflaged as a qualified dancer (go figure!) and a wannabe actor trying to hit her rich in Bollywood. They fall in love, zero becomes a hero, the dancer does not get any break, gymnastics, anxiety, usual break, more gymnastics, anxiety, song, dance, anxiety, more gymnastics, more absurd gymnastics and before you know it, you 're sleeping . And this despite HOT SEXY HOT HOT SEXY HOT point the ladies-cum-gymnast-cum-dancer. But hey, you're not alone !! Editor, director, photographer, actually the entire cast and the crew sleeps the entire production. The only difference is that they paid for paying the money for this bullshit, so you lose. Ha, the joke's on you. Don't be excused by yourself, but for our poor broken gal when you tones daily in her tall penthouse in sexy sexy leotards and workout clothes. Puh-leese, when a poor thang gets a break, is STARR-VINNNG?! Antara Mali can't act. RGV has lost its balls. Abhishek tried but failed. No plot. No story. Nothing. She had to pay RGV playfully to give it all-nonsense stuff in addition to free gymnastics lessons on his couch. What's cool. No need for an acting career. Of course, such an absolute waste can be "Made in Bollywood" of course!
