My God. And here I thought there were no directors worse than Uwe Boll. <br /> <br /> Imagine how many decisions are needed to make a movie. Conceptual approval. Writing the script. Editing the dialog. Casting. Assembly and prop design. Choosing a location. Acting. Timing. Cinematography. Lighting. Music. Edit audio and video. Direction. Imagine that each of these decisions was wrong. The result: Dracula 3000. <br /> <br /> For a film allegedly based this film looks surprisingly as a cheap 70s gangsta. The set is ridiculous for this time. Dialogue is cruel. The timing of each scene is ridiculous. The deal is out of the abyss. Everything stinks. <br /> <br /> Let's take props for example. If you have a movie on a spaceship built in 2900, how likely is it to have exposed pipes and hydraulic doors from a 60's oil tanker? What has not changed in 900 years? "Professor" uses a standard tandem keyboard and the Radio-Shack switch reprograms the computer. What, they haven't understood the voice control yet? Of course, the professor is tethered in a wheelchair. With wheels. Although, you know, they have an intergalactic hyperdrive ... but apparently not a motorized wheelchair, much less floating or bionic feet or something. And apparently this cargo ship carried an intergalactic shipment of rosewood coffins. How convenient. Then there are weapons - the crew carries standard weapons from the late 20th century. On ship. In the vacuum of the universe, where all the bullets would kill them. Nice planning, prop department. Oh, why next.
