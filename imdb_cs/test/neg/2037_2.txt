I had nothing to do before I went one night, so I didn't want to watch anything too heavy, I chose the perfect movie. It must have been a Barrymore gift from someone she slept with, director Raja Gosnell did nothing but stupid crap and writing on this is just cruel. In which high school can you register without the presence of parents and without proof of age or previous education? Have all the kids come to the shirtless shirt, skin tight tricks, butt shorts and one girl was dressed like Eve wearing only fig leaves? She announces that she is 25 years old and her brother is 23 years old, but there is no retaliation from school, parents, or any kind of court against fraud or spying diaries? The head of the newspaper wants to catch a teacher in a minor sexual scandal, but he doesn't realize the teacher is coming for 25 years, so every case would be caught? Do they allow the camera and record private conversations with children under age? I wonder if I hired my younger sister to return to HS with a camera on her and shoot under girls girls for my personal use I wouldn't get into any trouble ??? NAHHHH No problem. Didn't you have to take a gym or go to the bathroom? The secondary characters in this were like cardboard cutouts of what high school students were all considered, and they were all stereotypes. Jessica Alba is just so embarrassingly bad at the camera. In what world do parents not look suspicious when their uber-geeky daughter is miraculously asked by the school shame for the ball? And they don't ask the guy to meet him like any other parent in history. If a guy at my school or at another school that would care for it summon my sister and throw eggs at her prom dress, he would be in the body for the rest of his life. This film is so fanciful and predictable that it's nausea, and why in the end everyone (including Alpo girls) cheers for this chick when two days before they hated it ???? <br /> <br /> DUMB, DUMB AND MADE.
