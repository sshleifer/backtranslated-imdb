So you have a lot of models on the island and one by one are chosen from the Agatha Christie style. We get someone who is lost at sea, torn off a cliff, poisoned by a solvent, expelled from a cliff, blown up, etc. Nothing terribly graphic. Before you start, one woman inexplicably dreams of a killer in a strange human face mask. The magazine owner is a sleaze who had an affair, and someone took photos of her before she was an age. Finally, it's all about the shop, or something, <br /> <br /> 80's style photomontage is available, most of them surprisingly surprising. The pair is quite translucent. The camera clicks on the camera while it is mounted, which appears in the image as a white square or rectangle. The photographer is somewhat bad for framing!
