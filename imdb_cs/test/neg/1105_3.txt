I really wanted to like this movie. A movie with zombie kids who got out of the mine to kill people at night looked like a great horror idea. Unfortunately, the film was at the bottom of 3 movies played on the horror fest. a lot of money. They must adapt to the new environment. They end up fighting for everything around for various reasons. children do what to do ... Kill! With a bigger budget and better casting, this movie could have hope. In the meantime, pass it on. 3.5 / 10 in fact.
