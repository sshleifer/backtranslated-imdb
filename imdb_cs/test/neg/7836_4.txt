He helped his brother's girlfriend, Alain avoids Russian gangsters and corrupt FBI agents and tries to find a list. . As for things, it is strictly wording. The script keeps cliché and acting is average. There are some nicely executed action sequences, with a resourceful car chase, a fight in a burning building, an escape through the roofs, a brutal fight in the elevator and a JCVD ​​fleeing its enemies through an elevated train line. Director Ringo Lam keeps everything at a reasonable pace.
