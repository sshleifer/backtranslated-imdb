So many people took shots on the platoon and were born on the fourth of July among the others who called them "leftist propaganda film". Now it's up to me to take a political look at the movie. For me, this film is very impressive about certain religious beliefs and its political views. Playing and writing was a bit of a cliché I like. Mel Gibson seems to be playing in these unnecessary violent movies, and he proves this again by joining his partner, Randall Wallace, for one more. During this film, this prototype of the prototype "Just tell my family I love them" or "Tell Ronny to pray before the hoe gets to bed". He was so overloaded that I felt like I had to vomit. And what the scene was, Gibson's wife was going to do his laundry and that "no color" refers to what to put in the washing machine. In the mid-sixties she was somehow stuck under a rock that had not noticed the racism around her. The next scene is when Gibson's daughter asks what war she is and the scene is filmed in such trivial matter. <br /> <br /> Directed it all perfectly. Countless scenes of Gibson and his family or soldiers pray. I'm fine with that once or twice, but after a while, I'm wondering if the movie is trying to shove anything into my head. How many scenes with the American flag in the most beautiful hour were recorded with melodramatic music. The director also seems to have won some victory in Vietnam. What exactly they won. Cinematography was the worst of the fact that the slow-motion scenes see the American flag on distance scenes. I love America, but movies like this seem to celebrate every little thing we do. This may seem like a boast and maybe it is, but I can't stand it when such a film makes people who are not religious. they are not so patriotic that they will agree with whatever their country looks bad. This film is narrow and limited to me in many ways. For me it says if your Christian your bad. God or Jesus would want people to kill, I don't think so. For me, this film was offensive. Initially, this movie was funny with countless clichés and overworked scenes, but when I looked at what this movie was trying to say or not, it's really frustrating to watch. I think it's my fault I decided to watch this movie. I hope that nobody takes this note offensively because I am not criticized by religion or patriotism, but by some of those narrow-minded people who are so into both, and everyone else is discounting. <br /> <br /> If you want a genuine depiction of Vietnam War Patrol Platoon, born July 4, Apocalypse, Deer Hunter or Killing Field. Even Full Metal Jacket, which I absolutely hated, was a better view. I read a quote that in the context of saying that a real patriot does not go with everything a government or a country does, but questions him when he is wrong. A real patriot loves his country too much to see her do bad things.
