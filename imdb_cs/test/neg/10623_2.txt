When I borrowed this movie, I didn't expect quality performance, but it was just sad. Most games were so incredibly bad that you couldn't get into this movie, you tried. There is nothing to see that a child has reported things like "Oh no! My dad is invisible!" or "I wonder what he's doing?" In the same monotone it would be possible to announce traffic advice via radio with. There are some good actors, but they are unnecessary on smaller parts. The story is decent, though it would be pretty easy to guess, given that there aren't too many real fence changes. Lots of holes, too. For example, Dad is invisible and the inventor finds out what part is needed to be visible again. So the boy goes and stole the piece from the electronics store. Couldn't he ask his father for money? This appears in the Comedy category, but most of the comedy in this movie was pretty stupid, like the Invisible Dad who took off his clothes when he was invisible and then almost reappeared naked during a meeting, or dating head covered all the time. At first funny but aging. <br /> <br /> 2/5 because it's observable and it's one of those movies that are kind of fun ... like monotonous line recitation.
