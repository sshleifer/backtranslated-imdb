If you are a healthy person and have seen movies earlier, you cannot tolerate this piece of idiocity for more than 20 minutes. And if you stay there longer, it will not be because you expect akshay or paresh (not govinda please!), But because you value your money too much and want to take a brief nap at the plush multiplex session for the money that robbed you! It's hard to believe that a director who gave us a cult film like HeraPheri can fall to such a level. No, sir, this won't work now. Especially with your stupid script! Even comedy movies can have meaningful scripts (Lage Raho Munnabhai anyone?). <br /> <br /> Govinda has a lot to do so I can't comment..Ashshay Kumar was boring, Paresh Rawal cracked some of the worst possible jokes. (maybe) it's Tanushree's playing, but it's only the first 10 minutes. <br /> <br /> I don't think this movie has more space ... (probably not so much!). So the last warning - don't look at it!
