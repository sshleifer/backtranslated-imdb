who reads these comments may think we can have a great movie in hand. I am a Portuguese and I am ashamed that this film has become a blockbuster in Portugal. He can't really call this movie. The direction and "mise-en-scene" is basic (even Ron Howard better!); the script is bad and pretentious (really bad Tarantino); The cast is covered with TV stars, models and reality show stars that have nothing to do with acting. Of course, if you put these ingredients into the movie, fans of this kind of TV show will all be visible. I am also surprised that the people who comment here in IMDb say that this film is a masterpiece. I thought this site is just for people who really like cinema and understand a bit. All movies that become blockbusters in Portgal always use the same ingredients and are always terrible. If you think this movie is reasonable, please don't tell your love movies and cinema.
