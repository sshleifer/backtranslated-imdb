Put this movie out of poverty and burn it. What I say? The whole movie was negative. Fortunately, very few people would find this film the least attractive. This is what a great American majority would call too much sex and violence. Probably appears on some non-premium cable channel once just because of the shock value, but after adjusting the nudity (most of the violence remains), all that remains is 45 minutes of really bad play, which is scattered by 45 minutes of advertising. There are just too many starving actors in Hollywood.
