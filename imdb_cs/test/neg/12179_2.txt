Jay Killion (Charles Bronson), a secret service agent, was charged with protecting Jill Ireland's president's wife. She is a very difficult woman and Killion's hands are full. She is the victim of numerous assassination attempts, all driven by the Presidential Chief of Staff, who wants a dead first lady. This film offends your intelligence not only by story but also by the lack of realistic places. For example, in the scene depicting the opening show, First Lady is in Rolls Royce convertible with Agent Killion and without President. We also know what is Washington, DC, is like the weather wise in January, and not only that all "top coat less", you can even see palm trees in 70 degrees and sunny weather! (Apparently he was shooting in Hollywood, not Washington, DC). This movie is a joke. It's not worth your time.
