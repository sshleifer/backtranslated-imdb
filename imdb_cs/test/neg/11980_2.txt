I'm a huge fan of Farcry games, a huge fan. It still holds a place in my top-10 list of games ever! The story was new, fresh ... The really great foundation on which the film was based ... or so I thought ... Farcry the Movie is no less than another director trying to o Collection on a successful franchise game (see Doom: The Movie, and many more ...). The video game begins as a player (Jack Carver) wakes up in a cave on the sea side after being shot down from his RPG ship by an unknown soldier. Jack then finds a communication device where he (Harlan Doyle) leads him through islands, wrecks, jungles, installations and VOLCANOES to find his (friend of mine) (Valerie Constantine), all mutated combat super soldiers and genetically enhanced animals. The film takes place very differently: 1: Until we get to the scene of "throw a boat", there is an unnecessary 30 minutes (1/3 of the movie) "behind the scenes". 2: Jack then walks to the beach, kills some goons, then leaves ... Nothing like a game ... 3: There's no communicator with Doyle on the other end ... 4: 'Modified Soldiers' look like an albino with tank tops. And no mutated creatures came out of the bushes. Part of Farcry I enjoyed ... 5: There is no beach scene with filled sun, no carrier, no communication stations on huge cliffs, LITTLE link to any content in the game (characters / items / vehicles), the fact is, that no attempt to continue the story. 6: The Climactic Volcano scene from the game is replaced by an old industrial building. 7: There's an Ending scene ... where everyone (except Krieger) lives happily ever after ... WHAT! <br /> <br /> I recommend avoiding this movie at all costs! If you are a player, you hate this movie all over your soul. It's a movie clearly designed for both men and girls, keep on ... So if your man, 12-29 years old, never played Farcry, and they're not disgusted by the directors trying to transfer books / games to the movies ... then he is for you ...
