At least for me. From the beginning I watched Mr. Almdovar's career and I wasn't crazy about this movie. I think Penelope Cruz was wrong, the type of woman she portrays doesn't look so good. Also the singing scene was just strange. I don't understand the point and the synchronization of the lips was terrible. As a Spaniard, another thing that made me accent. Why do people coming from the same place have such a different accent? The difference between the two sisters is remarkable and makes no sense. And the village? are we in 2007 or 1950? I found myself trying to explain to my American husband that many things in the movie are "old school", things are no longer that. I waited more, but this time Mr. Almodovar did at least for me. I'm not saying Miss Cruz is doing a bad job, I say she doesn't belong there, she doesn't mark her.
