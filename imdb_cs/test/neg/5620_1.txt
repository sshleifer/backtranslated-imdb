Who wrote this movie? Uninspired 15 year old? Could be written by one of the kids who made Columbine shooting. Absolutely nonsensical, not funny all, boooooooriiing ... <br /> <br /> In addition, the French don't give their flag everywhere. You don't have to go to a French bank and see such a tricolore flag. Even on Bastille Day. I have nothing against the blood thing. It's just that none of this is either credible or funny. Or parody, or something like that. Ok, those who like this movie will tell you that I have to be some kind of fascist, so don't forget my comment.
