Chuck Norris plays like Danny, a cop who took off a massive serial killer, but when he said the killer is missing, Danny knows he's the only one who can stop the horror. But Danny's a secret, he knows it was all lucky enough to get arrested terror and even more fortunate that Danny survived, now the last battle is being conducted, but Danny is ready? In my description you'll find out what the problem is with this movie. Norris plays a stupid hero who still suffers from psychological trauma. In the hands of a better actor, this concept would be interesting and could be a big thriller. In the hands of the Norris thriller it just makes it ridiculous and hopelessly unheroic. Also on board is the American Ninja Steve James and Superfly Ron O'Neal, but every attempt to develop characters is defeated by a cruel scenario. Also, there is hardly any action, and I have always preferred Norris with more fighting and less speaking. Due to the rating on this website, I may not be alone. <br /> <br /> * off 4- (bad)
