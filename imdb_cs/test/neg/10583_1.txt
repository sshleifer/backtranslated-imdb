The film starts with Spiderman, a spoof that introduces you to Rick Riker (played by Drake Bell from "Drake & Josh" fame, personally I would give Josh a movie that is much more fun) and "Rick Punchers" got off the Airplane, so writers probably already they scratched the barrel for ideas for this movie. Rick's class is on a scientific trip to the Amalgamated Genetics lab, and that's where we get to meet the first name in Dr. Brent Spiner's "Drama" movie. Stroma. Rick is bitten by a genetically modified dragonfly from which his powers come. In Rick's home, his aunt Lucille (Marion Ross of the Happy Days fame) and Uncle Albert (Uncle Albert) we meet our other big star names. Leslie Nielson from the airplane, police unit and naked weapon of fame). And we are introduced to Carlson at the Mixed Board of Directors (Dan Castellaneta of The Simpsons), who is then very quickly killed. We said Rick slept for 5 days and got some cheap, miserable sexually oriented scenes designed to keep teenagers paying attention. The scenic scene of Stephen Hawking is painful and is a really bad idea that doesn't work and is not remotely entertaining. We get another Spiderman spoof (Rick catches a girl and all the planets) but the movie should end there because Jill was hit in the head by a falling bowling ball that would break her skull and kill the dead stone. You can see how Rick's first powers appeared (grip and speed), then his first rescue, which is very bad. We also get a reference to incest, which is in a very bad taste. We get a flashback and a lot of Batmans in which Rick is responsible only for the death of his parents. Spoofing Again Spiderman Ricks Uncle is shot by Jeffrey Tambor (from Hellboy) playing at Doctor's Hospital. Then we get the X-men spoof (he did very badly, as Patrick Stewart is about as white as they come), Barry Bonds is playing another lookalike. Meet Invisible Girl (played by Pamela Anderson looking stunning in his costume!). Ricks 1st outing in his costume (once he removes his ability to see and breathe through him) is another Batman spoof. Tom Cruise YouTube clip clip is played yet another lookalike (and not very good at it). There are plenty of modern references like Youtube, Facebook and Wikipedia that show that the film is set in a modern day. There is a very weak gay joke (never a good idea to do those both) when Jill helps Aunt Lucille do Thanksgiving dinner and the pissing scene is not very funny, just infantile. Auntie Farting Scene It's not a strange fun, just incredibly childish. Anyone who finds it funny must have a mental age around 12. She is killed and then we have a really bad necrophilia joke (there is no topic that these people will not try to use to make cheap laughs?) At her funeral, and even worse cremation joke. At the ceremony, we get 2 worst shows in the whole movie (Prince Charles & Nelson Mandela) and if you haven't yet known how infantile or stupid it is. The film's Landers wins the "Douchebag of the Year" award. The Landers are revealed as an hourglass (in a very bad scene where the same girl manages running around Jill twice in the same direction). Apparently the hourglass is thwarted, Jill is saved from certain death, and only the funny scene in the whole movie is the last.
