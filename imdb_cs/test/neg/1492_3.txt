I'm really disappointed with this work. It is quiet shallow, repeats, usually not accurate and sometimes on the verge of bad. I think it's for elementary school, especially because it's constantly repeating while leaving a lot of gaps. A young guy could enjoy it and learn from it, but a better way to realize a child is theoretical physics, such as "A Short History of Time" or "Tao Physics". If you are familiar with the theme at a very basic level, you will not get any new information or insights from this series. Don't waste time with him. Nice eye candy.
