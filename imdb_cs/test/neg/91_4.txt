Beware, My Beautiful (1952) director: Harry Horner <br /> <br /> Production: Filmmakers / RKO Radio Pictures <br /> <br /> Thriller from the thrilling producer team Collier Young and Ida Lupino. , aka Filmakers (with Lupino pitching with some uncredited direction). Robert Ryan is a "Danger" and Ida Lupino is a "woman" in this record in "Woman in Danger". Ryan plays Howard Wilton, a tightly wounded drift drifter (noooo, Ryan? I know, hard to believe). Lupino is a lonely widow, Helen Gordon, who hires Howard to do some work around her house. Things go down as Howard makes Helena a prisoner in his own home. Howard has a nasty secret, not that he could reveal it. Consciousness is a real challenge for him. Keeping it is. He has an unfortunate habit of coming and finding his employer dead. This is part of the movie. The nature of Howard's psychosis is so extreme that it is almost impossible to believe that he could move freely from city to city, even in 1918 (when the movie is set up). He can't remember anything that happened ten minutes ago. His violent, threatening, antisocial tendencies stem from the smallest and most common things (a young flirting girl, a lack of war, because of his refusal to serve). I don't know how he did it for an interview with Helen. There are other options. If you were locked up in your house with a madman, but for a while you stayed alone, could you not figure out a way to escape? I think Ryan is defeated by the material. It feels like he's flipping his hand. His series of tics and cramps and tightly twisted flashes of dementia all have these qualities that behave to them. At this point in his career he probably played this character, to some extent, ten times and that shows. We are encouraged to empathize with Howard (not shown) through the pieces of humanity shown, as if he were stopped in his music box and his relationship with a group of children who would not judge him. Lupino must act fragmented and in need, which is more than capable and does. <br /> <br /> There was one thing in the picture; what would be the possible resolution of the conflict? So naturally there was an unsatisfactory ending that was sudden and ineffective. There was a mild interest in the repetitive motif in which the camera captures Howard's reflection (in mirrors, water, Christmas tree ornaments). This suggested something was going on in his head, or he was going to go on. Horner (1953's Vicki), who made his reputation in design making, does a good job of making the house feel a prison. Credits also, always reliable RKO art department for work on the house. At the end of the partial work from the directors who have much better films for their credits. <br /> <br /> * Â½ of 4
