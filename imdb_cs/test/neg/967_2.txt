For all intents and purposes, Showtime was the worst movie I've ever seen. Why? Because Deniro adds instant credibility and wants to watch the movie. I also made a mistake in having recently watched for 48 hours and Beverly Hills Cop before I saw Showtime and for some strange reason thought Eddie Murphy was still funny. Well, it's not. It almost seems like he was castrated. As I watched this movie, I was astonished that Deniro decided it was a good enough script to lend him his name. No chemistry between him and Murphy. Terrible writing, horrible jokes, a movie that you think is supposed to be good can not be much worse than this. Not too long after I was sitting in a poor fate that was Showtime, I noticed that National Security was playing with Martin Lawrence. The movie had its funny parts, but it wasn't great. But it was still 20 times better than Showtime. Please if your Deniro fan DOES NOT LOOK THIS FILM !!
