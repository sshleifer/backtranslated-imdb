I watched this movie at the Edinburgh Theater along with three other Americans and a friend from Manchester and we all thought it was a waste of time. We should rather spend another hour to watch the unfortunate Star Wars dialogue III. Opening with one of the worst jokes I've ever seen bound to celluloid on a large screen. during the movie we felt that jokes were trying too hard, the writers were thinking about setting so much that you could see a joke that was approaching 2 minutes in advance, then when it came, it was so bland that you couldn't even smile ; As a main example, I mention a giraffe. The plot itself creates some interesting thoughts in my mind that I enjoyed much more than what happens on the screen. I think much more could be done with this angle (two different worlds, water and water experiences, confusion and surprise when people try to understand and distinguish characters and writers from each other). But too much time is unnecessary when you push this painful plot to the end with "bizarre" and "skilful" as humanly possible. And in order to say that 16th-century figures show more talent from writers, it is an insult to intelligent writers and editors who might think about this film forty minutes later; but no, his feature film torture of discontent. When we left the theater, which was publicly not allowed, I heard a young British couple electro-suddenly with an electric clash say to me, "It was pretty good that it wasn't. what comes next. "And the girl replied" yeah, quite surprising. "And that was it. If that's what's to get out of the British people from watching comedy: no laughs for 90 minutes, but a little communication between the two lovers at the end, then But this film has succeeded, but I have more faith in British life than that. <br /> <br /> I wasn't laughing so hard on an American Pie II comedy movie.
