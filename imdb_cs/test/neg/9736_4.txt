Despite the fact that he worked for the worst government of the 20th century, Erwin Rommel is generally well-regarded by historians and enthusiasts of World War II as a gentleman, soldier soldier, and brilliant tactician in the field of mechanized warfare. If only Hitler gave him the army and the technique he wished in Africa, the argument would go, things would go very differently. And that's probably true. Rommel was actually a military genius, and apparently he's a sincere, honest man. But this film goes out of the way to portray it as a saint. He's doing his job, trying to win the war for Hitler, but the FÃ¼hrer keeps intervening and giving him ridiculous orders that Rommel (James Mason) expresses astonishment, but seldom actually questions and never, never hears. Only when it is clear that Hitler leads Germany to doom, Rommel thinks of betrayal against him; This dilemma takes place as the main theme of the film, a good man in bad circumstances trying to do the right thing. Mason is fine as Rommel, but hardly an unforgettable performance in the mind, George C. Scott as Patton. Of course, Rommel wasn't as colorful as Patton, but the film is so focused on looking like a decent human being forgotten to be interesting. He occasionally fails to some heat when with his wife Lucy (young Jessica Tandy, well-cast), but usually Mason is called to give tough British performance? as if the British were attempting Rommel for themselves (though in all justice all the Nazis had English accents except Hitler). Doubling Southern California for Tunisia is nothing to recommend this movie. The remake might be interesting (I would choose Ed Harris just because of the slight physical similarity, and Harris can act), it was a little spicy, but this film mostly showed me how much more challenging we were as viewers. over the past fifty years; a resume that would never fail.
