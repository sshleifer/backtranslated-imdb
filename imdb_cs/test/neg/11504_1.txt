When I first saw this show I thought of my own "What is it !!!!!?" His one of those shows where the perfect fake high school world is with stupid problems that are considered "huge". Then there's Sadie. This complete misfit for her friends and her family. She is absolutely obsessed with nature that it is not a bad thing, but compares high school with animals! like what it is!? Also they made her another Lizzie Miguire clone (yeah because the world definitely needs another one of those!) she's also very perfect, like most TV girls that make me sick! So please, this is a silly show that doesn't make sense just to skip if you don't like Lizzie McGuire or other such shows.
