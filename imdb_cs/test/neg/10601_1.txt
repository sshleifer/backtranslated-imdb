Possible Connectors ** The three young people on the wrong side of the law get a chance to turn their lives around and become useful members of society by becoming secret police officers in "The Mod Squad", the resurrection of hit TV series. 60 years, directed by Scott Silver. Because of their less than stellar background and who they are, and the people they know, Julie Barnes (Claire Danes), Pete Cochran (Giovanni Ribisi) and Lincoln Hayes (Omar Epps) can go to places where other cops can't, so they are deployed by Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina) to break into a dirty nightspot that is suspected of being the front of the prostitution circle. To start, Julie gets a job as a waitress, while Pete and Linc just "hang" to find out what they can. Julie quickly becomes reacquainted with an old friend, Billy Waites (Josh Brolin), who turns out to be involved with drugs that are tied to a shady hearing to go down in the bar. Before it ends, the "team" is in it up to the throat, and at the same time it runs counter to a lot of bad cops who are also dealing with drugs, and then tied to the investigation. From the beginning of the film, it feels like you're late; it seems as if you know what's going on in terms of the cooperative's origins and functioning. All you get here are brief footage of the three that give you nothing more than a look into their past; nothing about how it all came. Thinking was probably that by doing this in this way it would lead to the story faster, get things going. While this is true to some extent, some background additions would make the story's structure a little more varied; the way in which it was carried out only weakens the credibility of the whole process. The plot is marginal to start with, and every time spent on character development would be well worth it. What is delivered and, quite unimaginably, is less than a compelling story full of one-dimensional characters. The performances are satisfactory, but the actors from the script do not even seem to help from Silver; The Danes, Ribis, and Epps have come close to Juliet, Pete, and Linz, but since they have been given time, combined with lack of support, they still don't give people life. Farina, a good actor who deserves better than what gets here, comes as nothing but a cartoon of a "good cop." There is a feeling that everything in this film was given once; some details and nuances would increase stocks considerably in this case. Supporting casts include Richard Jenkins (Detective Mothershed), Steve Harris (Briggs), Larry Brandenburg (Eckford), Lionel Mark Smith (Lanier) and Sam McMurray (Tricky). It is a pity to see that the actor concerned is so wasted; Much more ideas and planning should go into making this movie. As it happens, it encounters poorly designed and poorly executed. The Danes, Ribisi and Epps are like Major Leaguers who have stuck on all the balls on the local sandlet; instead of getting on the title, they were all hung up to dry. Like Terry says in "On the waterfront," "You were my brother, Charlie, you should look at me." Obviously, there was no Charlie to take care of them, and after `The Mod Squad ', everyone can only hope that they will come up with something better next time. I rate it 1/10.
