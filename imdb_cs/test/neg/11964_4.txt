This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the series. I know, I know ... but how good is it? Well, don't be stupid. It's still pretty bad, but compared to the first two, it's a great movie. Again shot at digital, with decent lighting and good camera. **** SPOILER **** When a college baseball team envelops new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course he would leave him in a cornfield tied to a bogeyman. In accordance with the legend, the boy's soul is transferred to the body of a scarecrow who comes to life and gives away a terrible revenge, well, almost everyone. Co-eds goes to the beach, which is somehow very close to the cornfield. On the sunny beach, a scarecrow is killed one by one. Writer / director Brian Katkin will do a credible job of bringing much needed drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama skips good and lands in common cheese. Much of the game was fair, but there were some terrible bits, including a terrible piece of poorly done lip synchronization. Some conspiracies were left largely unresolved, and most of them were used to make someone alone to be defeated. Again, better than previous installments but still missing.
