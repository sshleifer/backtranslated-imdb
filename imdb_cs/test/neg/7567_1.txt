If I could give this film less than 1, I'd definitely do it. I read the LA Times movie show and found myself at the theater and remembered the review. My wife and I were in the game and we thought it couldn't be as bad as the critic said - you know the critics. Sure enough ... Give me a break with the horrible acting activity, horrible camera, misuse of the budget (which has been mentioned over and over again as an excuse). I've been working on films with smaller budgets that are 100 times better. He is a director and producer who makes films - they select teams. And it is done. If they don't put it together and let it work ... it just won't. So, they don't - and they don't. I don't think they can ... I had to take the time to write this review ... though I'm sure the film crew doesn't appreciate this rating - I hope I'll do you all a favor with my wish to do well , but - in another career. Good luck.
