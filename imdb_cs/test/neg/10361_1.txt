Nothing's wrong, 5 stupid kids go to Oklahoma to find the magical marijuana forest ... it could be fun if it weren't for the 5 worst actors in the world. And the dialogues weren't half an inch of fun. All I almost pointed to my teeth was when stupid cops stopped teenagers either in Oklahoma or in Kansas. If you even think you could watch this movie, don't. How stupid is this guy going away from the police by telling them he is gay, just like his friend (just that he pretended to be ...) and there is that stupid joke about several meanings of the word "gay" "I laughed my hair ....... NO ....... Anyway ... WORST MOVIE I'E EVER SEEN !!
