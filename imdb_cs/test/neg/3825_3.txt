This film was the first film of the 70s women's genre. This film was incredibly violent, many sadistic tortures were imposed on the prisoner. The film takes place in the Phillipines, which looks terribly ugly. Producers undoubtedly used this factor to their advantage to emphasize the horrible situation in which the prisoners were. Queen of Blaxploitation Film Grier, has a leading role in this movie. He plays Blossom, a renegade who is thrown into a horrible female prison, accused. Her friend, played by Sid Haig, is trying to save Blossom. He and the Blossom are part of the political guerrilla faction, and Blossom's imprisonment was driven by the corrupt Phillipine government. Pam Grier and Sid Haig, out of the cast. The film itself put too much emphasis on violence against prisoners. Their captors used them only as objects of their sadism. This was bored quickly. This movie could use more interesting plot and subtlety. This is not one of Roger Corman's better films. Many women in prison films following this were much better all around. I would recommend The Big Bird Cage, just for Pam Grier fans.
