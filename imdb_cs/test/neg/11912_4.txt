The Shanghai Cobra begins as gangbusters, with a rain-soaked dinner scene straight from Shack Out to 101 or Gun Crazy (first). Unfortunately, the film continues to stretch through the weary way of the standard Chan formula, which is hardly animated by the always delightful Mantana Moreland. It's like director Karlson blew half his budget in the first five minutes. Take a look at the beginning and think about The Phenix City Story.
