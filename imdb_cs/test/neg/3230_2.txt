well, my question; Who is the idiot who wrote this movie, giving it the same name as Dean Koontz is an amazing book? its terrible, nothing like the book ... you got a dog and a guard, but there are similarities ending ... it might be good if you didn't read the book ... but it disappointed me, really. They should make a new one, and let koontz write it ... now that it would be a good movie ... I'll say it again, this movie disgusted me ... utterly disgusted me. it was horrible, it was nothing like a book. I would never look at it.
