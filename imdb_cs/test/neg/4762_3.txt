If you have insomnia, Radiant would be the best way to send you to a 7-year-old coma. The film is so ridiculously crowded and unremarkable that it is hard to imagine that director Steve Mahone could ignore such an obvious numbness. The story has an expelled doctor who we never see to create a vaccine that cures all diseases by filling in hosts full of antibodies that can fight any infection (yes, just like the Futurama episode). Vaccines do not work and human guinea pigs become infected with a virus that kills within 48 hours. They don't want to be caught by government boys in masks that the group heads to the desert to cover, hoping the sun will kill the virus. All of this is told by Michael, the only one who is immune to infection. And it's a boring story. They could attract someone with an interesting voice, but instead we get someone with a less vocal personality than Clive Owen. <br /> <br /> At the top of this editor insists that more than half of the film break up, giving him a strange dream and a sense that viewers are eager to sleep. No wonder half of the audience left it, I wasn't one of them for some reason. But I should have a good blood. The end is supposed to be shocking and clever and foreboding. But it's simple and just not. Relief yes, but not the slightest. The total cheapness of this production and subdued sound that makes many dialogues unintelligible, paralyzes what might be an interesting sci-fi story if it were to be. better actors, cooler places and urgency. As it is, Radiant is snoozefest.
