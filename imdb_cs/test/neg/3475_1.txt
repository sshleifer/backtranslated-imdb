What a disaster! Normally, when one criticizes a historical film, it is always fun to point out inaccuracies that slip, usually added to writers to create "more dramatic" situations. However, "Imperium: Nerone" is the whole "nuther kind of animal." In this film you are trying to find everything that is confirmed by a historical record in the midst of farrago nonsense and fiction presented as the life of the Roman evil boy-emperor. And it's a shame because Nero is one of the most fascinating of all Roman emperors. His life was filled with enough stormy events and interesting people to make a really good movie. Producers of this mess have chosen a different path that only leads the head to an informed viewer. Just a few examples: 1. Nero is portrayed as a 6-8 year old boy when Caligula has his father killed for treason, expelling his mother Agrippina and sending the boy to he was raised by slaves in the country. "Ten years later," the story goes on just before the Caligula assassination. Facts: Nero was born about six months after Caligula began his four-year government, and was only three when he was murdered; Nero's father died of natural causes; Agrippina was briefly expelled for bad behavior, not betrayal; and Nero was not raised among slaves, but he had the typical education of a young member of the imperial family. 2. Well, according to writers, Nero is now about 16 when his great uncle Claudius becomes emperor (in fact he was about to turn 4); Agrippina fall engineers of Empress Messalina and marries Claudius, who receives Nero. Then he goes off to conquer Britain and is poisoned by Agrippina soon after his victorious return. Nero is declared emperor, though he is still only 18 or 19 years old. Fact: Claudius conquered Britain in 43 A.D., two years after his government began. He lived to 54 AD Nero should have 31 years then normal normal chronology, but in fact succeeded on the throne at age 16. <br /> <br /> History tells us that there followed "five good years" where Nero The Senator's opposition to Nero began only when he began to show signs of madness and began killing senators, and this was shown by the philosopher Seneca and the Praetorian commander Burrus. For a real or supposed betrayal. 3. Nero's mother Agrippina is a control species who murdered his uncle-husband to his son Emperor. he sends his followers Tigellinus to stab her to death, everything is true, but the reality was much better! Agrippina was a survivor and did not go easily, Nero tried to poison her three times but as a star The poison itself was all subtle for it, and he failed, then tried to crush her to death by collapsing his bedroom ceiling, but it also failed. Then he sent her on a ship that was deliberately built to disintegrate and sink; as it went down, she jumped into the sea and swam ashore. Finally he let her stab to death. Now it shows everything that this movie would definitely improve! Another bug crawls: Nero Lover Acte was not a childhood slave friend, he never rejected him and there is no evidence that she became a Christian. Nero did not commit suicide by sitting beside the lake as he sat beside his wrist. Etc. Etc. The sources of Nero's life are primarily Roman historians Tacitus and Suetonius, both of whom were senatorial classes hostile to him and his memory. However, the evidence suggests that he remained very popular with ordinary people, unlike one of the final scenes where he is being driven by a vegetable crowd when he leaves the city to commit suicide. and producers take an intrinsically interesting story with lots of good stuff for a movie, and do this piece of crap? Oh, and did I mention how much those pieces and costumes were? Lol. <br /> <br /> One star because it can't be rated lower.
