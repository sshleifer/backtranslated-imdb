The vote was not 0, so I was forced to use another available number. For Bollywood is a sad day when such type of movies that have actors with actors is nothing more than a bunch of teen acting and horrible script. This film is nowhere near the Hitch clone. Salman Khan with his usual start-off-shirt theme and Govinda with his funny laugh. If someone had said two decades ago that I would write a comment on Salman (after his success with Maine Pyar Kiya), I'd write him.
