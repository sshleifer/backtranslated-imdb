some would argue that it is better mainly because of acting; but that is really far worse for reasons that outweigh the improvement. <br /> <br /> the source from which all problems arise; story. besides one of them who was shot, with a shotgun, in the chest and survived for several hours without medical care, there is a bigger problem. Nothing, a gangsta with a golden heart is willing to do anything for a friend he just met that day; and that involves asking the evil spirit for help. Ce-Ce, who comes out of nowhere with the voodoo past, is willing to summon Killjoy if nothing can "lift" her. the negotiations are improved, but they are still terrible. these people could not transfer emotions from the paper bag. the script won't help them either. stupid lines, and I can't take any instruction from the director. This script was read as Shakespeare in high school with a teacher whipping them while they went. While this movie (if you can call it in its 80 minute run (thankfully)) is perhaps even more fun than the first because of all these things, it is definitely more painful to watch. 1/10.
