It may be, even if there are two or three I have missed. This film creates an interesting night cityscape, reminiscent of so many hazy scenes from Sherlock Holmes's movies, and fills him with ominous Kafka characters. By their midst, the film drops Mia Farrow, who sounds like she's still playing Hannah, and Woody Allen, who seems to be reprising his nebbici role from Play It Again Sam. Should we laugh at his stuttering and manual spinning? I suppose if the rest of the movie were probably comedy, but it's not like that. At least I don't think he is.
