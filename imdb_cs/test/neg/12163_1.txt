Well, I think I'm a lot of fan of spindled, crippled and destroyed Stephen King stories (when they get to 'Screen') like any of us sad Masochists. I know that most of them are doing badly. I expect it. PLAN on it. I humbly allow it ... <br /> <br /> THIS TIME ... GEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ ... Okay, so I think I saw it a few years ago ..., fine. I thought I remembered it was pretty good ... AGAIN ... Like I say (I gave it in a fearsome, annoying, roundabout): I really didn't try to be snobbish or anticipated, but what was it Mini-Series? I have only one thing: D ...... R ..... A ..... W ...... NO ..... U ..... T How can you possibly justify dragging a thing from minute to minute, scene by scene from friggin 'ENDLESS, completely MEANINGLESS and mind insensitive SLOW dialogue? I think every bl ** dy scene is two people 'DISCUSSING' how they feel and back and forth ... D ... A ... GI ... T bl ** dy well O ... U ... T After about an hour and a half, which I think is about 1/2 of the run (I didn't check it out, I'm sorry): I finally got enough! After an hour and a half, what happened to the OTHERS than the original accident ...? They ran while the 'Shop' guy killed eye doctors, news photographers, and LOTS & LOTS & LOTS from a meandering dialogue. <br /> <br /> I'm sorry, I promise not to. have a continual thoughtless action; I love LOTS movies, where not much is happening, but in them at least when they talk and such important things are said and characters deepen, thoughts are transmitted ... SOMETHING !!! ??? Well, I admit that the actors and themselves were not too bad (except Stephen King, of course :) I liked the guy, I thought both 'older' people were fine. I like the general and the main woman. It's just that if they can cut out all the FILLING CLOCK, that's all I'm saying. It's SUPPORT to be a Thriller Sci Fi, kind of ... right? You know what really took the price when the Shop Shop was unnecessarily making one of his many time making phone calls, this time he talks to God knows who to get all the emotional (for him anyway) and acts like he can't handle. .. WTF !!! ??? The guy turned out to be a cold-blooded, powerful killer. What kind of hell was that? So just multiply by about 500 and that's basically why I finally turned when I was about half way through; It was either that or hang up, I swear! I think there are other kings adaptations that are lame, but at least they're moving ...! Well, I think if you were to be in the "story" itself and you don't mind browsing together and having the SUPREME & DIVINE wait until the end, it might be useful. But, Honestly and I humbly doubt it ... <br /> <br /> I don't write these things very often, but THIS time when I just had to, or couldn't sleep at night (like I During the show :)
