I never thought the movie could regret me signing up for HBO. Now I know better! Usually, Jack is one of my favorite actors, but even he couldn't save that part. Not that he tried it. Jack plays his usual Eastwick mystery. Unfortunately, it doesn't convert to the Southwest. He's probably just as credible a cowboy desperado as Pee Wee Herman. There is no performance edge and for this reason comedy will fail. He's almost cocky. The rest of the cast was worse. The timing of providing lines is probably something the chief lady did not finish in 1978 and the others seem to be just happy to be there. My recommendation for those of you who are interested in this film is that you will save your precious time for something like observing a dry color.
