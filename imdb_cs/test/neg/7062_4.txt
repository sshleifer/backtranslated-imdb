Some of the first interviews survived to become classics. 1929's "The Squall" is a classic okay, but not as intended. Melodramatic in story and acting, today it looks ridiculous, especially casting Myrna Loy as Nubi, a seductive gypsy. Imagine that Nora Charles smashes a young couple and drives a young man to steal. Inflammatory! However, as many people know when Loy first came to Hollywood, she did some of these exotic seductress roles. Based on the game, "The Squall" refers to the aforementioned Roma, who is now in Hungary (in Spain in play), runs away from his cruel master and invites to the Lajos family house (Richard Tucker and Alice Joyce) basically by appearing at the door. One by one, Nubi seduces a man's family and farms speaks her pidgin of English ("Nubi is not bad! Nubi nothing wrong!") And dropping advice on nice gifts. The son of the family Paul (Carroll Nye) deals with the beautiful Irma (Loretta Young) and can't wait to marry her. He loses interest when he meets Nubi. Except for the beautiful Alice Joyce, Zasu Pitts as a housewife and the amazingly beautiful Loretta Young, acting is uniformly horrible. Loy is stuck in the punch of his character - bad English, whining and hysteria. With dark make-up, peasant and curly hair, she is not only beautiful, but right from the eighties - quite modern, although Richard Tucker put his back on his forehead, reminds us that we are just leaving the silence. Robert Osborne on TCM noted that this film is one of his secret pleasures. While it is deliciously bad, it's not so deliciously bad to sit down again. It's just a bad thing - but a great example of how far we've come, and someone who wouldn't pick up Myrna Loy's sense of humor as her amazing career was limited.
