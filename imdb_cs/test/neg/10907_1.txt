Nothing about this movie is good. It is a formative predictable "romantic comedy" aimed at making women look at their important people. In other words, it is a predictable swing that is neither comedic nor romantic and is exceptionally memorable. If you like the same things over and over, this movie will fit just perfect. I was also forced to watch it with my g / f at the time and it's no surprise that we're not together anymore. I enjoy great movies that are amazing to watch while she wants to see the same thing over and over with only different actors. There's nothing good about this movie. The name says everything. 1/10 (one b / c I can't give zero.
