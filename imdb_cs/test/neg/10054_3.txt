The Bridge At Remagen contains some of the most pointless scenarios of war time I've ever seen. In addition to acting, which is wooden, no tank commander attacks his tanks parked in nice clean rows, in the middle of the roads, and the soldiers are gathered together with hands not ready. The constant suicidal behavior set off my "tilting switch" so I often found it impossible to enjoy the movie. It seems that writers and directors have never gone through a real war and have never bothered to bring the expert they had. This film is very antithesis of excellent detail in Saving Private Ryan. If you're not under 7, I suggest watching something else. <br /> <br /> GB
