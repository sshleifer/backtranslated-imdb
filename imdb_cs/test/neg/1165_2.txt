I just saw this movie and it turned out to be quite poor, as mentioned in other user reviews, and one thing that worried me the most was the southern accent of some characters that took place in Wisconsin, not the south. As mentioned in other reviews, Ed Geine was not a big guy, so why did he who played Jason and Leatherface portray him? <br /> <br /> I quickly handed over most of the fact that there are many slow parts. Hopefully someone will do homework on Ed Geine and in the city and make a more accurate movie
