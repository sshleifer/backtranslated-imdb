Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is back ... for a film tour! He is now in Italy, appreciating our food (including people like Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini)), but returning to states for Clarice (Julianne Moore) and even a score with former victim Mason Verger (Gary Oldman). <br /> <br /> Let me tell you that this film doesn't deserve to be talked about with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter because it's really, absolutely absolutely BAD. I mean, the scene is nearing the end of Ray Liotta's skull and is forced to eat part of its brain that has been roasting? WTF? So why was HELL so annoying (including Clarice)? And why didn't the story get anywhere? I suppose this is a chapter of the Hannibal teenagers; terrible, stupid, bloody for gore's good and totally embarrassing. <br /> <br /> Don't look at it, especially if you like other Hannibal movies (SOTL, Manhunter, Red Dragon, Hannibal Rising). Hannibal: 1/10.
