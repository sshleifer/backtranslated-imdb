I'm a big fan of surrealist art, but this Bunuel movie (with some Dali ideas) left me cool. Bunuel had a lifelong resentment against the Catholic Church and was pleased with attempts to insult Catholics in rather stupid ways. This is one of the strongest; almost like what you would expect from an intelligent 18-year-old movie in class. The last few minutes of the movie, which have nothing to do with anything else, are the ultimate nose-to-thumb of religion. If you read "scholars" regarding this slow-paced, sometimes fun movie, it's all about how church and society commit sexual repression. If it really is the right point, then Bunuel expresses it in the most beautiful circuit. The central male character is a vile brutal who loves digging dogs and knocking blind men on the street. Is this a church error (to break his love) or is it just a jerk? I vote for others. I think Bunuel had to have a lot of personal curtains and chose Catholics like the ones that are to blame. There are a few moments when you could cry: "Oh! Surrealism!" a bed, a giraffe looking out of the window (a bad model), a man who shreds a pillow from a feather, a woman flushes a toilet while we watch photos of lava (or mud pits ... hard to say in black and white). The rest is a forgotten self-confidence. Unfortunately, Bunuel kept chasing the same bogey-men for the rest of his career (Viridiana, Discreet Spell ...). If you are interested in seeing Surrealism on the screen, look at the early work of Jean Cocteau.
