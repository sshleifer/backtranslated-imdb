How can anyone even start to like this movie really behind me. The idea? She has none. "The guy broke up". That's an idea. Wow. Space was killing him slowly ... now it's original and worth watching. This is the first Fasbinder film I have seen ... I heard he was a mission-genius genius, but I saw student films with more attention, inspiration, idea and craft than that. .. this ... nothing. She has nothing! <br /> <br /> Every shot is too long. There is so much emptiness in them ... A horrible act. You see that the actors had no preparation at all, no understanding of their roles, or an attempt to express emotions ... it's so ... superficial ... The lines are so explanatory that you could remove 90% of them and still have the same miserable film. Pace? Who cares. Atmosphere, dynamics, that's for pussies! One shot on the scene, 80% of the time people look unrealistic, have no idea how to represent the emotions and the importance of the moment, except for a blank look at the camera or at each other ... EDIT? All editing rules are ignored without pa pay-off of any kind ... Photos? Half of the shots have a reflection and poor lighting without stylization of any kind. Shadows, shadow play ... who needs it? We need a guy, peeing, drinking, hitting his wife, as if he were ... acting. We need a lot of tight shots of a not so beautiful woman ... we need the amateur climax of his capture by the unconvincing Arab torturer ... This movie has so many bugs that it's not worth it, it's not a budget. it should. Honestly, I haven't seen the movie so bad since American Pie 5. Yup. It is bad. I just started watching his movie "Veronica Foss", which seems to be a lot better, based on the first 15 minutes (because it's unlike what's bullshit), so I won't say that Fasbinder is clueless .... but this .... this movie SUCKS!
