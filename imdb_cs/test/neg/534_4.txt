It's a kinder, gentler Cyborg movie with a love story. Awww. It's not as bad as it sounds. The action when it's there is decent and Jack Palance, Elias Koteas and Angelina Jolie are always reliable. Is it the fact that this is a sequel to the scary movie Jean Claude Van Damme, or is it the captain of the Masters of the Universe trilogy? I'm still confused. Either way, he didn't really need this movie. What was needed? Angelina Jolie. She can play a robot killer who can explode mid-coitus, but, what way to go, even if it's her first movie, she still has a presence that made her a prize.
