I loved the original, I watch it every year. but the other is a piece of waste and should never be made. The other could work if there was another place. The son was not the original or acted as Eddie's children. The third was too clever for Eddie, and his father's role was diminished. None of the other children where it is not. It could be much better. I don't know why they even tried to make this movie. There was no continent since the first movie. I will pretend that this does not exist at all. Sadly, the actors didn't even see them doing crazy. Really bad movie. I just think I've wasted an hour or more on the wrong movie and I really love all the national movies.
