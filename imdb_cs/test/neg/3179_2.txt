I like Wes Studi & especially Adam Beach, but this movie is a costly challenge. Roughly slow. Too mysterious to the point of confusion, not because the plot guarantees, but because there is almost no conspiracy. Even less in the characterization method. This is almost like one of those malicious old mysteries of Charlie Chan (a cheaper version of the Monogram Studio) with lots of red lines and strange characters (like an old ex-senator with a checkered past that is now recluse) and lots of people killed through the objets d'art that you would not be seen in the shop twice. Great scenery. Nice redhead hair, even though I never understood what she was doing. Not even my wife. Sheesh, at least the old B-movies had a grace to be short.
