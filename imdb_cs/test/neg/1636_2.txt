There are a lot of reviews that describe this film as the worst. There are certainly a lot of mistakes: bland playing, somewhat boring and clich√©, and sometimes a paradoxical scenario and the sound of B-movie and "special" effects. As mentioned, there are plenty of shine conspiracies, so _Cave Dwellers_ is a fabric of fantasy film, especially compared to the Lord of the Rings trilogy. However, this movie is not the worst movie ever. Most, if not all (including this review) of these reviews are written by MSTK3 fans. Therefore, many of these reviews are quite a lot of the episode summary of MSTK3 _Cave Dwellers. In the episode, Joel, Tom Servo, and Crow's note to the mad scientists that this is the worst movie ever sent to them. Of course, loyal fans have taken this quote and ran with it. I found this movie cute-not so that one finds _Forrest Gump_ cute-but in an effort to put in this movie some cast. Also this film is ridiculous without MSTK3 treatment. That's because _Cave Dwellers is not taking seriously, and is not trying to import any fair topic into their viewers. For all monster puppets, medieval hang-gliding, and continuity breaks, this movie doesn't disclose that it was more than what it is, a shallow depiction of a somewhat shallow genre. Likewise I may have brought to hate Miles O'Keeffe or Lisa Foster. Instead, this hatred for Coleman Francis, Tony Cardoza, Jennifer Lopez, Arch Hall, Jr., and so on. <br /> <br />
