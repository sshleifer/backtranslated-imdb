Sure, this concept has already been done with Alf and Charmings: he cast a modern society on one or more characters in place. I loved both shows and watched them religiously until the end of 1990. When I learned about Scorch, I was really hopeful for something new, because the new television in the 1990s hasn't touched me yet (but at least Star Trek: TNG and The Simpsons still went). What I got was a big disappointment. Behavior was terrible, but due to the absurd dialogue and the absolutely incredible writing I cannot blame for them to work with. There were a few funny moments, but most of the deliberate jokes seemed necessary. The entire production at the show seemed too low for what was on TV at the time. In the 80's it would fit into the game. Yet it was the first episode and had to introduce the characters and create the whole premise of the series, so I gave her the benefit of doubts. The second episode was not so bad, and I began to get my hopes back that once the action was taken, the show would improve. Sadly, my video recorder didn't record the third episode, I never saw it and the show disappeared from the TV. All I have now are the first two episodes recorded off the air on a VHS tape.
