If you thought it was the French Mummy, and if you hope for another "Vidocq" ... look good elsewhere. It has the same kind of story as the Mummy concerning this book of the dead and the soul that needs to find the 7 missing pieces that are scattered in the Louvre. I found that the movie is a little fun, mostly boring. Special effects are not bad, but it's not spectacular as I expected big explosions and maybe the Eiffel Tower was falling apart until I realized that these scenes were in the Mummy and that's Belhpegor. Apparently based on the French cult TV series, Belphegor could have been much better. I voted for this 4/10 film only for the beautiful Sophia Marceau ... it must be almost 40 years old and looks breathtaking!
