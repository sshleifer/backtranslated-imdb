This movie is terrible, I can't even bother to write a review of this waste! I'll say it's one of the hardest movies I've ever seen. And acting is very bad. The kid who plays the main character, I'm sorry, he has the same expression on his face. I just want him crazy! Basically, 80% of the film is slowed down by skateboarders, strange music and sheer sh * t .. <br /> <br /> Apparently I have to write at least 10 lines of text to post this comment so I will use up to several more lines by that says the main character has one of those faces you just want to slap! Meh I give up .. THIS FILM SUCKS !!!!
