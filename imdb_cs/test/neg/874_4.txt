Not quite a bomb? All that was missing was enriched uranium. Indeed, the "can" scenario worked if the main roles were cast by younger actors, but the drama-aging Diane Lane who acted as if she was a teenager (or even twenty-two) was too much on her stomach. Every time she (Adrienne) leaped into Richard Gere's arms and then lifted both heels behind her, she almost saw a grin on her face as she thought, "Oh, my aching back ... this babe certainly doesn't weigh 125 pounds." Anyway, both characters were clearly unlikely, especially Richard Gere: a self-absorbing plastic surgeon (Dr. Paul Flanner), who was on some sort of "soul-searching" after an operation with abandoned operations, left him a dead patient (an older small farm woman). Then there was her angry husband and son with whom he had to deal with to explain what had happened. Dr. Flanner is on his way to meet an angry husband (at husband's request) when he meets Adrienne. She is recently divided from her unfaithful husband (shock) and helps out a friend by watching her beach-front hut hire. Of course this is where Dr. Flanner ends his stay and they both end up falling FALLS in love (especially after finding out he's a rich doctor and plastic surgeon). Among the romantic breaks and the naughty song / dance routine that Lane (Adrienne) plays while listening to an old LP (without a CD?), They both try to figure out how their lives have gotten right. Dr. Flanner also wasn't much of a father and has a son (who is also Dr.) who hates him for not being there when he grew up. (Of course, Dr. Flanner was more interested in his medical career at the time than to educate an ill-considered, scattered boy.) To make the short (predictable) story short, Adrienne helps dr. The husband and son of a woman who died on his operating table (after going to "routine" facial removal cysts). Dr. Flanner is finally able to tell her husband (playing excruciatingly likable Scott Glenn) that he apologizes for what happened - even though it was the anesthetist's fault. "I told him he was too old for the juice!" Glenn (Robert Torrelson) Apparently Accepts Dr. Flanner. It is difficult to say, because his emotional reaction is so passive at this time that you are wondering if he can hear a good dr. Dr. Flanner then decided even more cautiously to visit his son (who is now practicing pro-bono medicine in the Third World) to correct their relationship. That means Adrienne must temporarily offer adieu. Of course, when he amused the native in Timbuktu, he writes a love letter every hour to Adrienne (who almost faints like a school girl every time he gets one) and tells her that the hardest thing he ever had to do was say goodbye to her. Apparently apologizing to Robert Torrelson for his wife's death was the second most difficult thing. Finally, they kill him in a crazy mud picture (poetic justice like a mud wrap?) And only memories of what could have been ... hopefully no more Gere / Lane sequel!
