OK, we got JP from Grandma's Boy and Chuck, all right, Chuck. I thought this movie would be pretty good based on reviews, and it started pretty high on my movie scale, but about halfway through it was just dragging for so long I was still losing interest. Actually, I was so bored, probably because you see what happens in the end; The story is actually pretty naked, I missed over 15 minutes and nothing missed me! This film was to be a short work, about 45 minutes to an hour. It starts well and ends well, too bad, the filling is bland, boring, boring and lacks everything except time. Some people say they like music; I'm not interested in jazz and I'm not seeing their movies, I'm going to a story and when it's pulled ... well, the rating is falling in my book. <br /> <br /> The Bottom Line: A well open, large, narrow, dull filler. The story was fine, but if you don't know what happens in a quarter of the way, you haven't seen too many thrillers.
