I hope it's not a lot of things to come. High Definition camcorders are getting cheaper (though I wouldn't say the oath), so it's open season for all Scorseses and Tarantinos. There is no hiding cheapness out of this stinking, and telling it 'movie' would make the industry a great service. Photography is the standard you would expect on a family trip to the zoo. I could have built a new house with all the wooden actors. What is remarkable about this is that nobody stands out as the worst. They're all just as horrible. Like a whole bunch of Ben Afflecks. Or Steven Seagals. <br /> <br /> What caught me was the title. I'm crazy for things like Frankenhooker or Monsturd. Frankenhooker was also bad enough, but at least I laughed at it and acting was just bad, not terrible. I can't comment on Monsturd because I still have a copy of it. Anyway, I hope the people who did it didn't make any money out of it. Otherwise they might be asked to try again. Please, guys, stop the camcorder and go back to your normal work.
