I don't see why this movie was released, it looked like something you're showing to your friends after you borrowed your mothers handycam they bought in 1987. I'm an Australian and I work for a video shop in the UK and I thought if will Aussie movie did it to our store it can't be all bad ... boy i was wrong! <br /> <br /> If someone makes a good comment about this movie, they're either lying or filmmakers. The picture was BAD, the sound was HORRIBLE and the acting, oh acting, it was WORST operating in the FILM HISTORY. I'm embarrassed and insulted that they used the word "Aussie" in the title because I am proud to be Australia and this film is seen in other countries and can give people a bad idea. Please, someone who reads and saw this movie, take some time to find other Aussie movies that you can watch because you could choose one of them and it would be better than this one. I could have made a better film if I got a camera, filmed it, but an hour, ate the film waiting for it to pass through my body, and then threw what came out on TV ... no offense. > <br /> DO NOT FIND THIS FILM !!!!!!!!!!
