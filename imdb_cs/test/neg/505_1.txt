Now the infamous Western, which was (at that time) the largest budgeted disaster in Hollywood history. I was "happy" enough to see the full 220-minute version of the theater in 1990. It was really overwhelming how BAD was the movie! They had a great cast, a story based on a true incident (fighting between strangers and Americans in the 1800s), beautiful scenery ... so what went wrong? Three Words - Director Michael Cimino. He was so full of himself after the "Deer Hunter" he went out and made this god terrible Western. It's not to blame. His previous film "Deer Hunter" was considered a masterpiece and United Artists gave him a free government to do anything. They left him alone ... and everything went wrong. The prize went to throw control, and Cimino insisted that it be repeated over and over until it was perfect. First, the sound is terrible. Whole sequences go and you can't discern the word characters they say. For example, Jeff Bridges' character is introduced during the dance sequence, but I have no idea who he was! The dialogue in his opening scene is incomprehensible! This is the director's mistake - he should make sure that the dialogue will be heard. Some scenes are filmed with so much money flying around, you can barely find out what's going on. The story does not make much sense and Cimino has taken great liberty with the facts - only one person was killed in a real story - Cimino turns it into a massacre. There are some really beautiful sequences here totally destroyed by the lack of story and incomprehensible dialogue. Also, bad sound wasn't a theater error - all the prints are like this. This scrap effectively shut down United Artists and was the end of Cimino's career. A textbook example of a director who is so full does not realize what he is doing. Jeff Bridges said it was the worst movie he ever made. This is from a guy who did "Tron"! Clear must-miss. There is a pretty good book called "The Final Cut" that details the entire disaster. It gets 1. I wish the IMDb had negative numbers - it deserves it!
