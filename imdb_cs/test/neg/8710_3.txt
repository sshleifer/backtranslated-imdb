Looking at this series from curiosity, I wanted to see if they could and with all this modern technology, to Cecil B. DeMille is a classic 1956 epic, starring Charleton Heston, Yul Brenner and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. Of course they let me go. Yes, all the biblical figures were correct, but they did not give us any of the spectacular theater scenes you were interested in during the first movie. If you take mini-series, you need to have some "riveting" scenes, "Burning Bush", Parting "RED Sea", Drown "Pharohs Armies", "Build Sethi's Pyramid", could be done with today's technology to scale movies like " Lord of the Rings "or Matrix. Apparently they did not want to leave the last impression of "faith and sacrifice", which is so much needed in these times.
