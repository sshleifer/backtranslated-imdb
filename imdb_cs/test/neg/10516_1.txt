In a movie-filled world - like "You Got Served" - that blows your mind out with huge amounts of bugs, you never thought there were worse movies ... until now. Ron Hall's "Vampire Assassins" does more than just cheese. They know you're angry with it. First, there are no killers in this movie. In fact, there is only one good guy in the movie. Second: The place ... is basically one place: some jackass house (or basement. It's up to you.). Third: Special effects (without cover) can kiss your butt. Fourth: The attacks beat "Plan 9 from outer space" in the worst acting category. Ron Hall can't save his life. Finally (and definitely the least problem): EDITING. Whoever edited this film hopes to never find it. Pieces and shots are HORRENDOUS !!!! Other questions: Lighting (virtually none), the fact that a person is not in the film, and the fact that this film exists. <br /> <br /> To summarize this movie, let me say that I tortured a DVD copy before I took it back to Hollywood Video (don't worry! I used MVP membership so it was free!). YOU NEVER HAVE THIS FILM !!!!
