Carrot top in a feature film, he said enough. The only reason it doesn't get through is through my personal voting system, which has only one 1 and one 10, and that's no extreme ops. terrible god terrible. There are some movies that are so bad that they are unintentionally funny, then there are movies that make you physically sick and then there are those that lead to serious contemplation of suicide. burn all copies of a movie, shoot anyone who has no creative input on this movie, torture anyone with creative input, and as far as the star is concerned, there are so many things to say online, but they should be asking for a finale of ten seconds existence with a separate head in when work is completed.
