This film is in itself a cyborg: half of the nonsense / half-life of the original film. <br /> <br /> As a cyborg, this film has only one goal: that you want the film to be spent all the time in the dark room punching yourself in the testicles. Unlike many people, I can rent this movie because of Angelina Jolie (I'll explain why I rented it briefly). I'm not a big fan of Mrs. Jolie, even if I say her performance was stellar! Her empty gaze and robotic actions really convinced me that she was an android hooker. If anyone has a clip that he learned about 'Inside the Actor's Studio' and explained how she got ready for this role, please send it to me. I'll make sure I use it when I try James Lipton for crimes against integrity. So what brought me to rent this movie? You'd think it was a chance to see Angelina Jolie's nipples, but it wasn't. No, the reason for this lease was based only on one of the images on the DVD cover; what Jack Palance saw! HALF THEIR FACE ROBOTIC! When I saw it, I imagined the "Palances" legions, which were slowly passing through the fiery wilderness and depositing waste to all the people who were so stupid to defend themselves. In my mind, every member of this Unholy army had a Palances red, glowing eye; the red, glowing eye that looked at people and saw only "meat." They were Oblivion's architects ... a cold, huge apocalypse ... a nightmare from which humanity would never wake up. It is a beautiful picture that I will appreciate until the end of my years. Like most things in my life, even the real movie didn't meet my expectations. No, there was only 'one' Jack Palance and the only visible cyber enhancement he had was on his feet. Sadly, these improvements didn't really "improve" anything. That's if you don't count WALKING LIKE POLIO VICTIM as super power. At least their scene where Jack, a smiling Alzheimer's patient, shot hell. I waited for him to shout, "I'm damn tired of paying too much for prescription drugs!" Unfortunately, all incidents of geriatric rage were very few and far away. The film had a little developed love story about a man (Elias Koteas, aka De Niro) cyborg (Angelina Jolie, aka John Voigt's Demon Spawn). Oh man, can the love between Rome Body and Juliet of Silicon ever be able to withstand?!?!?! This can, if you follow the simple advice of Jack Palance: "You must give each other time". Yeah, I'm not sure what that means. But I'm sure I don't want Jack Palance to tell me. Certainly how the hell he doesn't want me to show me! As an experiment, I suggest you ask your important if you "think we have reached the level of our relationship where we can start TASTE each other TIME?"
