I have seen this in what I think was the second screening in the world, a few days after its opening at the Dublin International Film Festival. While I was in another theater two nights later in the same theater, I saw Brendan Gleeson, Paul Mercier and the rest of the cast and crew at the next Stud graduation. I have to say that I was bitterly disappointed with the film, I wasn't expecting a masterpiece in any way, but what I was told, I believe they lack all the key elements of the genre they got into. Before I continue, two things, I agree that some filmmakers wanted to suppress general expectations, here it is just not the case. Secondly, I know it was based on a game (which I didn't read, but I was told it wasn't a shimmering piece of literature), but it doesn't excuse the massive narrative problems that penetrate the film. My main problem with the movie is the script, forgetting that it was game based, like sports comedy it just doesn't work, team down and out trying to win a football cup, a few games (if they are, it's very short ) and we do not get any satisfaction because of their sporting success. So far, you can assume that it is not a strict sports film, but a psychological study of the relationship between a "charlatan" manager and his hopeless team. It certainly does not, I'm not even sure it was. Any attempt to shed light on the history of any character is shabby and peripheral. Overall, I found the scenario missing in many ways. I think the show and the music was good and technically, the movie was well done. Apart from the points that should be expected from any Irish film at this stage, I have left the theater feeling very disappointed. My judgment may seem cruel, but I think there is some hope for a strong national Irish cinema in the near future, and this claim doesn't just return. Since Studs became the recommended Dublin Cineworld movie (I was part of this series), most people disagree with me, so that means you should do the movie yourself.
