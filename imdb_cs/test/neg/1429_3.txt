Strangeland (1998) D: John Pieplow. Kevin Gage, Elizabeth Pena, Brett Harrelson, Robert Englund, Tucker Smallwood, Amy Smart, Dee Snider (Twisted Sister), Amal Rhoe. The disturbing scenes of torture "emphasize" this dark, disgusting film about a sadistic psychopath who attracts teenagers to his torture chamber via the Internet. Snider (ex-80s rock band Twisted Sister) plays hannibal Lecter, a rotting psychopath who is a grim "twist" (no pun). Pena is wasted as one of the victims' mothers. Harrelson (brother of Woody) brings one of the worst performances I've ever seen in the movie, and Rhoe proves why it's her only film credit with the same pathetic performance. The heavy metal soundtrack is eventually numb, the torture scenes are very graphic and crude, and the end is just angry. RATING: 3 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence and torture, strong language and sexual situations.
