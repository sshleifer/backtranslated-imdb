Space is vacuum, right? So he sucks the space. Vampires also suck. A really bad vampire movie in the universe would have a double sucking power, right? It started with what could have been a fun prerequisite. Telling the story of Draco Brama Stoker in the future. There is a rescue crew that is sent to investigate a cargo ship that has been lost in the universe called Demeter. Fans of the original novel unknowingly believe that this is a straightforward story about Dracula, which takes place in the future. when Coolio becomes a vampire. Believe me when I tell you he's the best actor in the movie and he doesn't say much. Casper Van Dien should sell his goods on daytime television. Erika Eleniak should quit after leaving Baywatch and poor Udo Kier has trouble reading cards. The one who plays Dracula in this one is more ridiculous than Frank Langella in the 1970s. If you go through the whole movie, you'll be rewarded with the worst end you can imagine. The end makes one miracle when the actors and crew realized what they had done a piece of waste and left the set. Pay attention to vampire fans. This is twice as hard.
