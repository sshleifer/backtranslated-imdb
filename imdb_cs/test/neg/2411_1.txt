I'm sure I saw FUTURE KILL for the same reason as most people: the amazing HR Giger poster. And like everyone else, I was disappointed to find that the film couldn't live up to the poster (Giger said that director Moore was actually begging him). When I first saw it at age 14, I thought it was the worst movie ever made. I would still think if I hadn't seen any MST3K movies ever since. The storyline has a lot of annoying college students going to the "mutant city" to kidnap the gang leader. their brotherhood. That's when they meet Splatter (Ed Neal), a mutant / cyborg / psycho who kills the gang leader and accuses him of brothers as an excuse to hunt them and seize power. The rest of the film is mostly chase. Hand-full frats try to fight their way out of the mutant city (which I think is supposed to be LA, though it was made in Texas). There are a few pseudo-political things that frat boys are pro-nuclear weapons and that a mutant society is against nuke. Talking about how Splatter became a mystery about radiation. Most people develop cancer from radiation, but spray just shoots the tips and slaughter girls. Yeah, that makes a ton of sense. At one point, our heroes save the mutant girl from two pro-nuke police, and she shows them "how the other half lives." It turns out that the other half are all punk kids who dance around a bad pop band. So our little epic is both stupid and dated. That's really all there is to it. Frat boys are running around in broken buildings, while boys who look like cyclists are trying to kill them ... Oh, and it's the future. I don't think you will have any doubts about why Ron W. Moore never made another movie. The thing is real stinking. If you like Giger, buy his books (have a poster without horrors from the movie), or just watch ALIEN again. THE FUTURE OF KILL is a waste of time that no one needs. <br /> <br /> If this description makes a good picture, there's another crappy movie that does the same thing, just bigger and better: AFTER NEW YORK FALL. It's stupid, but the FUTURE is blowing from the screen.
