I have to agree with what many other reviewers have concluded. A theme that could be provocative and shed light on the inverted double standard fails miserably. Rape is a crime of violence and violent violent control, the scenes were mostly pathetic. It would be better to conceal short glances at what is happening and let the audience imagine the deed. And the victim's laughter with the cops when he interrupted his police complaint seemed to be as original as the cops. No embarrassment, no hesitation, just join. I don't know if it was bad behavior or bad leadership, but someone completely escaped. As for his half-awaited search for his attackers, pathetic. They should have skipped most of the sexual scenes - another monumental failure in themselves, and when he first went to the police, he met Colin Friels. The story could then be based on good dialogue and occasional flashbacks - and saved by the outstanding performance and presence of Colin Friels - the only reason I watched this movie - brings every project he does. The only concrete revelation of this movie was that it was stupid.
