I remember that Hey Hey Fuss & I saw Jackson Jive, it was pretty straight forward Skit comedy but I saw this & it is free & is out in clear? Did I lose anything? If the black community were to complain about all the racist comments on the TV show that should be & if you read my earlier comments I'm not an easy-offend guy. The basic Plot is that the African / American moves close to this white guy and make these comments racist as the value of the house will fall just because of the black neighbors & White guy makes links like (if your slightly offended racial Slurs No Read On) Nig-Nog Jungle Boy Sambo. (I'm sorry, but that's really happening on this show I'm really a guy who's fine with the black community) People can say that Hey Lighten Up, But Even If You Take Racial Slurrs Away It's Un-Funny No New Jokes Incorrectly Involved & I swear in one episode I saw someone's eyes focusing on something unrelated to the situation. All In All Horrible Comedy.
