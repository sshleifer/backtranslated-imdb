Interference begins as unemployed Martin Sanders (Andres Bagg) hears something special on his phone, hears a mysterious man talking to a prostitute named Diana and preparing to meet her. Soon after Martin reads the local newspaper and sees the story on the cover page about the prostitute's murder and thinks about what he heard. Martin entrusts his friends Laura (Virginia Lustig) and Aaron (Oliver Kolker) but doesn't trust him. Then shortly after the same thing happens again, the phone call, the man, the prostitute and her death in the paper. Martin decides to find the killer and stop his deadly spree, but who is he? This Argentine production, which was apparently in just eight days (for how long? about $ 3,000 (why so much?) was written & director Sergio Esquenazi & I can't believe some shining comments Interference has on IMDb From a total of 195 user ratings, of which 113 rank this pile of 10 crap of 10 out of 10, I'm sorry, but no one should be a movie that would be a bad, literally a perfect score of 10 out of the 10th IMDb movie score it is solid, then this is it, I honestly do not believe that if you showed Interference to 195 average people that even more than 100 of them would rate it as absolutely perfect, no way on Earth. all IMDb users who only wrote comments on one movie, this one user (except me) who actually wrote more than one comment gave him a rock bottom of 1 out of 10 that sounds almost right. He has the right to think, but I would bet my life on the fact that most of these positive comments are from false accounts based purely on this big piece of crap. Where should I start? How can I describe enough on Earth how bad Interference is? The plot is a mess that basically lives or dies by being terrible twists, while most twists turn a conspiracy over its head and change the view of everything that went before they cleverly and reliably get in the way, and they are the true surprise on the Interference of the first half of the film & makes it totally unnecessary in 'it actually didn't' the kind of way & twist is so badly worked out that lets you ask more questions than it matches. What made Martin mad? Why did he imagine phone calls? Why did you imagine a murderer? Why did he imagine headlines? Martin's behavior in the first hour of the film is not explained, it's just such an absurd revelation that it was in his mind and that's all it's exposure. Then there's a conspiracy about Martin's missing wife, and her lover in front of Martin for unexplained reasons starts killing his friends for no apparent reason. I'm sorry, but Interference is so bad, it's so boring, it's so badly written and thought out that I honestly can't think of the positive thing to say about it. Sorry guy, but that's how I feel, quite simply Interference is one of the worst movies I've ever seen & is a complete mess both conceptually and technically. According to IMDb Interference was hot in just eight days To be honest, it doesn't feel at all. No, it's more like five days! The whole movie is in the eyes, Interference probably has the worst night shoot I've ever seen. It is as if no attempt was made to ignite the scenes, it is as if the creators simply went into a dark room or basement, or anything, and just filmed a scene no matter if you could see something. Outside the day scenes have this horrible unnatural blue green shade no apparent reason for them that just looks stupid and becomes increasingly irritating. This strange shade is not repeated on indoor scenes, so they are also quite unpleasant and noticeable. There is no real horror or terror, in fact I would say that Interference is more a thriller than a horror movie. As far as gore goes there are two decaitated heads in the refrigerator, the knife is stuck in one's mouth and nothing else. <br /> <br /> According to IMDb, it had a budget of about $ 3,000, which makes Interferencia one of the lowest budget movies ever published? Some people think that just because the movie is a low budget all reasonable observation standards should go out of the window and we should accept all the old crap, wrong! If you want to see it on DVD, you'll still have to pay good money and I personally think we have the right to expect a good product. If it can be released and praised like it's an Oscar worthy, then we can all release our vacation camcorder shots (including awkward karaoke shots and scenes from sheer darkness as we forgot to take off the lens cap) and win the best prizes at the next Cannes Film Festival ! Acting is terrible, although Virginia Lustig's female management is actually somewhat sexy and helps relieve the pain of the last twenty odd minutes when it is justified. Interference is a horrible movie, please do not really have to be confused with all the false positive comments, there is no way anyone would participate or have a program that would give him 9 or 10 out of 10. Amateur mess that is really awful sitting over. Sorry, but that's the way I see it, sometimes you have to be cruel to be kind.
