Frankly, the only reason I took this movie was that it was Aaron Carter. The first thing is first. Have you noticed how ugly Aaron Carter has become? He wanted to be so cute, but now .. with body and blotchy skin - EW. I think he should stick to singing and film directors could find a much better looking guy who could sync his lips. No offense. I thought this teen movie was largely lame - and that's me when I'm alone. The "average girls" there are oh-so predictable, the acting is so amateur that sometimes it tears (especially from Aaron) and I enjoyed it overall. Although, I give points for the storyline - it was fine but not realistic at all. By the way, stay away from this movie by all means, you can, if you happen to have money in hand and have absolutely nothing better with 94 minutes of your time. It's not worth $ 6.50 !! <br /> <br /> (P.S; this review may not be applicable to younger children under 13!)
