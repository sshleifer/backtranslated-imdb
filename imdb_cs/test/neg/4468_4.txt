The previews were so funny that I couldn't wait to see this movie. I just got home and I have to say that I couldn't be embarrassed in this movie. Yes, there were times when jokes were funny, but stereotypical roles were painful. Joan Plowright is a great actress, but the "negro spiritual" scene was just in bad taste. Needless to say, the laughter was very little and was in a movie house for a largely white crowd (I was one of the very small blacks).
