How much do I love this movie?! Now I'm not a fan of bad movies, but I love a movie that's so bad it's good. That's one of those. Juan Pablo Di Pace has a great ass, looks great on the screen and will definitely not make a bad turn on his acting debut (I believe). Billy Zane is appropriately reasonable and whimsical, though I still feel there is more to it. I felt it in the Titanic, on his face, when La Winslet spit on him, for example, totally broken, shocked and delayed ... wild! Kelly Brook is a pretty face ... not seriously, I think that's it! It's worth catching it to see one really hot guy, some big bra fills from Brook, the nasty growl from Billy, laughing out of dialogue, enjoying the scenery and the madness of the whole affair ... I'm gona to go look again now - Yes, bought i did it !!!
