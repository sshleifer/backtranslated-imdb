Lord David Cecil wrote an interesting book in the 1930s by EARLY VICTORIAN NOVELISTS, where he looked at the works of Dickens, Thackeray, Eliot, Trollope, Mrs. Gaskell, Charlotte Bronte and Emily Bronte. He chose these writers as popular favorites of the first half of the Victorian era, and he explained their strengths and weaknesses (as he saw them) to the reading public. Some of his comments are quite relevant to date, but, like all critics, he gives an idea of ​​the spirit of criticism. Cecil highly respected George Eliot (Mary Ann Cross), who wrote about seven or eight books (including sketches and poetry). However, for most modern readers, they are usually familiar with its shortest book, SILAS MARNER, which is still read in some high schools. Other books, FELIX HOLT RADICAL, DANIEL DERONDA, MIDDLEMARCH, MILL ON FLOSS, ADAM BEDE, ROMOLA, SCENE OF KLERIC LIFE, are still in print (for example, the penguin has most in print), but are mostly unread. One of the most interesting today is her latest novel, DERONDA, where she discusses Jews in English society and the beginning of Zionism of the Hertzl type. ROMOLA is her only attempt at a historical novel (about the Savanarola experiment of a religiously pure republic in Florence in the 1490s). Her cutest novel is MIDDLEMARCH, which deals with English society in the provinces of 1832, the year of Lord Gray's Great Reform Law. I had to read MIDDLEMARCH at a college for literature. It is certainly a thoughtful book (Virginia Woolf called it the most mature English book). But he suffers (like all Eliot's novels) from one flaw - he can't write a lively, exciting prose. While Dickens is sometimes too lush and Thackeray can become pompous and prolife and Trollope can become (as Lord Cecil says) very common in his discussion, and Charlotte Bronte can't explain certain relationships well and Mrs. Gaskell seems best. with female characters, all (and Emily Bronte in her only novel) hold the reader's interest. Reading most of Eliot's novels is like trying to cut sentences from marble blocks with a toothpick! To date, I've read about fifty pages of MILL OF FLOSS. I noticed that one of the other reviewers never finished the novel. But I've read about what it is about. Tullivers (Maggie and her brother Tom) are the central characters - their own title in the title. Although close to the beginning of the story, Maggie falls in love with a neighbor's son, whose father is dealing with legal problems with Mr. Tulliver Sr. Tom looks at this relationship barely and the tragedy of this story relates to being divided between siblings, culminating in their demise at the end (Maggie runs back to the mill to save Tom during a severe flood, and they die together). This must have been successful with Victorian readers, but it is very gloomy and depressing for a modern audience. The film changed the end of a bit - Maggie (Geraldine Fitzgerald) dies in the end with her lover, and Tom (James Mason) notices their death at the conclusion in his book of records. The story is completely rewritten, with the exception of the double death in the flood at the end. In fact, it doesn't help. Although Fitzgerald and Mason behave quite well in their works, they can't just pull the movie out of their own. The end result is a relatively smaller film, which fortunately did not hurt a leading career. The only other thing to note is that a friend played Frank Lawton, who two years earlier played David Copperfield as an adult against W.C. Fields, Lionel Barrymore and Maureen O'Sullivan. But then, Lawton had never really had a great movie career - he was always always in pictures, some good, average.
