Isn't It Depressing How Is The Strongest Cartoon On Cartoon Network Focused On Girls? While I was not watching the soldiers firing and blowing up Saving Private Ryan or the Band of Brothers, it would be nice if there was a cartoon or something on TV that I could watch to satisfy my violent desires. And something I don't have to talk about. I saw some episodes (I should be really shot for it) and I had to sit in a movie (now where can I find a gun?) And it is quite clear that it has lost its spark after the first few episodes. If you like to see a 500-foot monster that can destroy huge cities in seconds to get a loser toddler about one foot tall, that's a must-see. But after a while they are very bored and with such a show the original ideas become the main boring ones. The film only felt like one overlong episode (I can't recall any of it), and the villain would have been far more intimidating than the green monkey. This show is laughter. After the episode after the episode, the same premise episode will appear, and although it may try to have some secrets and intrigues once in a while, the end will always be the same - "Powerpuff Girls Save the Day!" Everything is good and nice, but everything is very, very repetitive ... I give it 3 out of 10 for being the only CN cartoon crowd that revolved around violence, even when it is aimed at girls, so I won't tune into it at all. I started as a fan of war and violent movies and I will not destroy this reputation ... 3/10
