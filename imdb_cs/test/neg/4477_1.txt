I was really looking forward to this title. It sounded and it looked fun. The idea of ​​someone who would make a 50,000 monster movie would cost a few, but this title was bored instead. First, there is hardly any Froggg in the whole movie, which is the biggest disappointment. I have to sit over 75 minutes of lame drama and dialogue to get a few glimpses of Frogg who has been bare breasts. Why? Moreover, the film has no fun plot. Give me something that is a little more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads. I wanted to see a couple of hot chicks looking for a creature in the swamp, I wanted to see some cats that retreated to his lair in desperate need of salvation (Creation of Black Lagoon Things), I wanted to see a couple of goofy Froggg action scenes continued maybe he escaped from a silly trap. Something exciting! Geez, have fun with it, be creative! Who wants to sit in the endless and tedious dialogue scenes in creation? My advice to the creator: Continue, your concepts are good, but your execution must be much more inspired. Have fun with the creature, imprint humor into action and most important ... put more creatures into the movie of creation !!!
