A summary of the IMDB plot erroneously makes it sound like it's Noah Taylor's movie when Fairuza Balk is the central character. It is incredible how such a cast of well-established actors could be in such amateur, senseless, non-film films. Balk plays with friend Taylor, sleeps with the devil (I think - played by Dempsey) and accidentally kills Taylor - who watches her for the rest of the movie as a ghost. It may be the worst movie I've ever seen.
