The costumes are outrageous and the Australian outback is fun to look at, but there's an edge to this story - the average edge - of queens. Especially I noticed that in Terrence Stamp's character, "Ralph Bernadette Bassenger." Maybe it was appropriate because there is nothing "good guy" about Ralph-Bernadette and his group "queens". Again, we get a strong liberal inclination that says anything goes, and if you're not "with him" - or in this case pro-homosexual, then you're homophobic. (Gasp!) What is really worrying is the end when a young boy leaves with his father an "alternative lifestyle" and embraces his homosexual lifestyle, not because he fits into the story, but because that fits into the program of people who wrote the script. Poor.
