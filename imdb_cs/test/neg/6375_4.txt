Don't get me wrong, this guy is a dynamo of success, but he got to the top by selling overpriced plastic toys to impulsive brats. So I looked a little, looking at comic fans as an extension of the same market. Look, "The Invincible Iron Man" wouldn't be bad if it was Saturday morning. and aimed exclusively at minors. However, it is not exclusively aimed at children. Peripheral characters are killed every five minutes and there is enough bloodshed and topless bodies to make the network censors twist, so it is not completely cut out for children. So what is the audience watching then? It's an audience that has very understandable storylines about reviving the tyrannical Chinese emperor with five mysterious circles, that's who. And I think the audience is restrictively small. Many great writers have gone through the decades through Marvel's skins yoni. It's a pity that Marvel would risk his precious animation investment on so many questionable storytellers and writers who, like Mr. Arad, are more used to going to action characters during a Saturday morning cartoon. How many lukewarm banquets must endure Marvel before they come up with a better strategy? <br /> <br /> *** <br /> <br /> Animation: only passages, some segments are better than others, low budget looks all over - it's not Bakshi (Ralph) and it's not Bluth (Don )! CG animation is fine, but not impressive. Story: The litany of clich√©s, everywhere, intricate, inventive and uninspired. Characters: Why is Rhodes here, if all he does is add to Stark's sexual ambiguity? Hmmm ... her dad is in a wheelchair ... Tony misses his mom ... Asian chicks are hot and probably little; the female lead is thoroughly objectified by the end of the function. Performance: Can't blame the respective voice actors for the wrong scenario. Art: very western musculature, very clean lines, cheeks are very derivative of Eastern art, very boring mats, very bland CG. Conclusion: It's not great, but it's worth watching fans and those who love superhero myths. It is necessary to "buy" for collectors. Valuable "Don't Do" course for junior animators.
