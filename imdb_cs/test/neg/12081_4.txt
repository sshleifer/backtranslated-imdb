"Hardbodies 2" is harmless, aimless and plot less. I would add "mindless" to this list, but the film trick, though not doing very well, helps him escape this label. The scenery has changed from California beaches to Greek islands, and the only returning members of the first film are Sorrells Pickard (Bearded Guy) and Roberta Collins (who in one place falls into a mud pit, recalling her memories) Classic Cat Fights with Pam Grier in "The Big Doll House"). All the other actors are new, but apparently Brad Zutaut is supposed to play the same character (Scotty) as Grant Cramer in "Hardbodies". This sequel lacks the energy and attractiveness of the first film, and it does not come close to the "hotness" department. Of course, Brenda Bakke and Fabiana Udenio are very nice, but Teal Roberts - Cindy Silver - Kristi Somers is unbeatable. "Hardbodies 2" is by no means the worst of its kind, but if you want to see just one of these movies, it's the original one. (* 1/2)
