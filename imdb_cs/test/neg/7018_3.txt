Lucille Ball can't sing or act or dance. This makes the performance of MAME even more horrible. It is not allowed to do a low-brow slapstick that hits it on TV, so it has to rely on character building. Unfortunately, Mrs. Ball never learned that none of the tender moments had any heat. How do they really feel about Patrick or Beau? We never believe the words he says. Mrs. Ball's free space assumes she will convince us that she is emotional, but there is no chemistry between her and Bruce Davidson, Robert Preston or Bea Arthur. For this reason, every scene in which it is is flat. In addition, when Ms. Ball opens her mouth to sing, we immediately realized the reason why the studios dubbed their voice for every other musical she played. earlier in her career. It has been said that she demanded her voice to be used so this is an ego mistake as well as leadership. It's worse when he sings in voice and has to "act a moment" without words. The one who thought he'd forgotten forgot who played Mame. I understand that Rosalind Russell played a part on stage and in AUNTIE MAME. I am also aware that Angela Lansbury won Tony for her performance in the original Broadway 1966 musical. Why they went with her is the worst in blatant miscasting. The only person who gets out without blame is Bea Arthur. It is big and beautiful, feline and common in all the right amounts. Unfortunately, you are waiting for this movie to take off and invite you to join the fun. But the movie will never do and you can't. No one but Bea Arthur seems to have fun. Another bad review is dedicated to director Gene Saks. Saks is known as the award-winning director of stage and screen musicals and comedies, including the Broadway musical on which this film is based. None of these skills and expertise helps here. Poor editing and narration in this film is under the direction of his caliber director. This glaring mistake in making the movie isn't a mistake of Mrs. Ball.
