A paranoid scientist creates a wolf by transferring wolf blood to a humble, quiet but very large gardener to prove the hypothesis. So the gardener begins night fury and the scientist tries to use him to regain his credentials, but his former colleagues are refused to manipulate nature. The island of Dr Moreau, Frankenstein and various Tolfman films have combined into a terribly dated, goofy, moral play. Although the subject is pedantic and unoriginal, this film is not very poorly made, and interesting to watch as the horror film of its time. Like most crazy science films, it's a weak warning of stupid things with Mother Nature. He has neither the power nor the intellectual challenges of Frankenstein, but he never reaches his reach anyway. Acting is passable, just like cinematography, and the film moves along a fun clip. Some of the dialogues are totally ridiculous, but hey ... it's just a movie - and B minus one. There is also some nice wolf shots, and splashing humor thrown-in to avoid the film seems to be too serious - always a plus for this genre.
