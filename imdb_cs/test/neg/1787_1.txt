This movie is so incredibly bad, it's not worth seeing. No effects, no tension and poor dialogue delivered poorly. Oh, and neither CAMP nor any fear it does. Do yourself a favor and go check out the original Friday 13th or (best) Sleepaway Camp, but what ever you do, DO NOT DISPLAY this movie. Even the appearance of Michele Bauer at the very beginning can't save him. You usually expect violence, tension and some gore and some T&A in these movies. Violence was wrongly executed, "tension" was ridiculous, there was no gore, and T&A is abundant in FIRST 5 MINUTES, then NIC. At least one of these things, properly executed, would at least follow her. <br /> <br /> To say at least one nice thing, Buck Flower is great, he seems to be the only one who understands that they're doing schlock and fucking him right. If everyone else had the tone, it would be fun in the camp, no pun.
