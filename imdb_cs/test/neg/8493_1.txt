I can only imagine how this movie came: <br /> <br /> "How else can we eliminate our careers?" <br /> <br /> "I know! Let's take a movie that was wildly successful and made him continuing! <br /> <br /> "Perfect! We get class B actors who have half charisms and want only 10% of Carrey's original salary. We save millions and rake in a massive profit, no matter that no one wants to see a second course continuing with any of the original actors who liked him first! We as executives still sincerely believe that the film was popular on the basis of name and story, not actors who did it in the first place! "<br /> <br />" Brilliant! Let's give a huge budget and get the cheapest actors we can find! "<br /> <br /> And indeed, that's what Son Of The Mask can describe as. Just a simple B-grade movie that tries to suck life from the original. <br /> <br /> However If the movie did not include the words mask, or anything with a mask, it would be a nice baby movie. those 8 and younger will really enjoy it. Jamie Kennedy is the only one worth mentioning in this film is that trying to do tangible work, playing a desperate father, but the script is so bad that the only thing that is out of it, my drink is after I saw it mention, because he was the most enjoyable character and really one of the only reasons for older adults to see this movie. Instead, we are approaching the end of jokes and humor u for toilets. <br /> <br /> The story is so much in the books that I won't bother to mention it here. It's all so obvious that Disney's performance will be green with envy. Save your money, this goes to DVD in three months of its appearance. It is a pity that the studio again smeared with a decent film with a terrible continuation. Didn't the stupid and stupid thing teach them anything?
