Do not be fooled by a plot out of line as described on the cover (at least in the Swedish version). The story looks interesting enough, with speculative allusions. Nothing can be further from the truth. This is the most sad movie experience I've ever had ... It's simple and right AWFUL and shouldn't be sold or rented to anyone. If you still think the storyline is interesting, think about it: phones can move, run, and kill people just like other electrical appliances. He can throw things at you, chase you, and run for you. PLEASE DO NOT REPORT THIS FILM, it's a shame for horror genre ...
