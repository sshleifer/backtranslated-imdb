Once I heard this movie described either I will love or you hate it. Since reading some other reviews and ratings, I would say that is true. I'm putting myself in a hateful crowd. I've seen some really bad movies, boring movies and even low budget movies. This movie is bad on all three fronts. Exeter of this Earth Island (Jeff Morrow) returns to his sci-fi / b-film roots as Dr. Forest (minus giant head). The doctor and his assistant, Arnie (George O'Hanlon - aka George Jetson's voice), along with assistant Les' girlfriend Vera, are watching the meteor. This is the core of the cast and is almost double. Les has Vero and Arnie has "Susie" (Synchro Unifying Sinometric Integrating Equitensor - aka computer). Let's say that the relationship between George and his robotic maid, Rosie (and his relationship with "Susie") is more believable than the cold, clam-like feelings Vera has for Les (and vice versa). But their interest is no ordinary meteor. It is a truly extraterrestrial Art Nouveau / Art Deco energy storage device that moves around like a three-legged dog. There is also a small extraterrestrial "energy" being that drives Dr. Hubbel (aka, principal scientist there). The alien is clearly and out of the way, harmful and evil. Is it the science we are giving away? No wonder foreigners scared us from explorers. From watching some of these movies, shoot first. Then there is no need to ask questions. The whole movie is synonymous with watching some truly boring scientific experiments like egg cooking or adding food to celery. It's not that it's a low-budget sci-fi movie, or it's a little shabby and outdated. It's really, really, really boring. The whole movie is about trying to figure out what's going on. This is it. Most of the things we learn about is happening through monologues and dictation. Now add a lousy dialogue, cardboard gaming and cheap sets, and you have an Ed Woodu clone (by the way, Ed did some really boring movies - please avoid Orgy of the Dead). Dialogue ... oh, dialogue. Jems, such as: <br /> <br /> "from less than 2 miles of ocean? <br /> <br /> Why not? He came over a billion miles in space." <br /> <br /> or <br /> <br /> "Do you think you'll be able to respect a husband who has probably pulled a scientific boner of all time?" This film seems to be trying to pull the Forbidden Planet, this island country, a magnetic monster, or in the same light as the outer border, the twilight zone. Namely, a low-budget sci-fi movie (or television episode) that is convincing enough to get through technical difficulties and strange situations. At the core, these films are enjoyable at some level (story, basic meaning or sheer comic nature of dialogue or situations). This movie has none of it. It's just 90 minutes of boredom. I couldn't enjoy Ed Wood. I definitely recommend skipping this and seeing one of the movies I mentioned instead. It's so bad that if I was named Dr.
