A man builds a hotel with a partner. He finds out that the hotel is connected. Things are just getting worse. This movie has a huge number of scenes. They had to be put together in someone's sleep. Jumps from place to place. It won't stay focused for long. The end begins on Christmas morning with hotel fire. Then it breaks into the night scene of the fire and then returns to the time of day. The DVD's soundtrack is terrible. It takes a fair plot and turns into the worst movie that I have scene in a long time.
