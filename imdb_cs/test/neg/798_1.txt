I know that so many reviews on IMDb are extreme, with reviewers either praising the film on the handle or inarticulatly tearing it to pieces. I do not find any of these types of reviews useful, so I will not give this movie a terrible assessment that I am going to. The film is an art-house science-fiction of the worst kind dressed as a Hollywood blockbuster. Trailers will draw you by showing you what seems to be a cohesive plot, but in reality it's just a small part of a deliberately confused series of events that are never properly resolved. I like movies that call on the viewer and I don't need to be a spoon-fed spoon, so my complaint against this movie isn't that high. No - the movie is just terrible. Since credits roll you will feel real anger at the fact that you wasted your time on the wooden acting Cameron Diaz and plot plot-line. Avoid.
