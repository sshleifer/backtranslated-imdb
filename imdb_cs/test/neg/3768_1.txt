Experimental film director Nathaniel Dorsky believes that some movies are structured like a camera mounted on a dog's head that goes down the aisle and smells it all along the way. So that's the movie's. The structure is "Kurosawa started as a child, then he became a boy, then a young man, then a film director, then began doing" masterpieces ", then aged, The End." The word 'masterpiece' is widely used in this film to describe Kurosawa's output without explaining what makes his films so good / great. Just because the storyteller says on the screen that the film is a masterpiece, should we kiss him and accept that a film is one of the greatest artworks of the 20th century? And one more point. Paul Scofield's voice is used as Kurosawa's voice when extracts from the director's memories are read from the screen. He brings pear shakespeare tones to the lyrics ... but why? If you were making a documentary about Billie Holiday, would you use Dame Judi Densch as her voice ????
