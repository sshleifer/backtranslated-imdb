"Marathon" has a very interesting assumption, excellent ambient sounds and good scenery. Unfortunately, the film falls on the face in addition to these aspects. For a woman trying to complete so many crosswords in a day, she spends a lot of time around her, mourning and not making a puzzle. I believe there is more walking in the film than her work on these riddles. Even though I understand that it's so much scenery, it's just too much. The film is incredibly boring and restless. It's not worth buying, renting, watching on TV, or viewing in any conceivable way. I lost interest so fast that I'm not sure why I was sitting in the first place.
