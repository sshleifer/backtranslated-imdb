Overall, it was a traceable movie. I did not stop it, nor did I stop to come back to him - a clear signal of boring film - so it passed the first test. Best of all, he got into the story quickly, no boring unnecessary back story for the characters. It will never go down like a big movie. Not even as a big movie B. I would recommend this movie slasher / horror fans who don't mind straight on the video news. Unlike some movies, it's ilk, not nudity, just a mild language and somewhat subdued gore. There is violence. Unfortunately, death was rather dry and unimaginable. Computer special effects were actually pretty good. The way "creatures" controlled their chains in some scenes reminded me of the comics 'Spawn' and 'Ghost Rider'. She seems to speak with some accent. I had to watch the credits to realize that it was filmed in Lousinia. <br /> <br /> Like most low-budget movies, there are little things to do in the filming. Lack of time and money would be a major factor for stupidity. For example, in one scene it went from mid-afternoon to black in a few seconds ... within a short drive. The second instance was a sensation double for the "creature" that did not have "creature" on the makeup when it dropped out of the towing vehicle ... it also seems to have a shirt in the scene. In short, I hated this movie, but I also didn't love it. I will probably never rent it again, but if a friend owns him, I can follow it again in a few years.
