Normally for movie reviews, I try to be constructive and objective, but there is only one word for this, uh, "movie": SUCKS !!!!!!! Dialogue, acting, special effects, conspiracies, characters and characters seem to be made up of my potted plants. You don't see it for all that is good and right in this world! :)
