"Graduation Day" is the result of "Friday 13" success. Both of these films are more about creative, bloody murder than tension. If you like this type of movie, I would recommend "Graduation Day". If not, no. There's nothing new, the same old murder. Although I gave the movie 4 out of 10, I say it's not a repulsive movie. It's observable if you're curious about it, just not creative.
