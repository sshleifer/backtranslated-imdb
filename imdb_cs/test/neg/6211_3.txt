First, let's talk about the story. It's a copy of "Hitch" with Indian flavor. One guy who is a love guru, and another man who is seemingly crazy about ladies, and how this seemingly fool becomes charmer with the help of a love guru, creates a story. Salman Khan is a guru of love and Govinda is a lame guy. Now coming to the performers' performances, Salman Khan outperforms the film, trying to be funny, but failing in big times. You can see Salman screaming throughout the movie, no real acting is seen in his performance. Govinda's pair opposite Katrina Kaif (Oh, my God, she's one hell of a girl. Real Beauty) is a real life 50 year old dude, and Katrina is a girl in her first twenty years. She looks like Katrina Kaif's grandfather in Govinda. What a shame! Comes to the movie. This film feels like a B-movie and a bad imitation of Hitch. Where Hitch looks like a film with a goal and depth, this film is shallow and pointless, there's no justification or clarity. Just forget this movie because it's nothing but boring, typical Bollywood fare. Actually, I give 3/10 because that's the lowest I go.
