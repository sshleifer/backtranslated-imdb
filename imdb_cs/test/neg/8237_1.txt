This film smells. No money, no gaming, nothing. I caught it tonight on a 3-hour film and felt the need to comment on it. This film has nothing to recommend. I can't believe it got into American TV! No one in this movie can get out of the paper bag. Poor comedy attempts are falling on their faces, special effects consist of a worm "handraup" monster ... I can't even start saying how rock-bottom this production is. It looks like it cost maybe $ 50,000 to shoot, but just because it's at 16mm, and that's probably a generous estimate! Anyway, I quickly lost interest and had to settle for watching "Matlock" instead of completing it. This is how BAD this movie is !!!
