This film is a perfect example of the fact that a film cannot only be successful with a high budget. Obviously, there was a lot of time and effort: the animation is smooth, detailed and great - the soundtrack is not very memorable except for the final song Celine Dion (at least I think it was her). The musical score is a strong orchestral material. Kudos for animators and composers! 9/10. However, the story and characters fall. It is very "there, done", predictable and simple uninteresting. Characters have different personalities, but nothing too sympathetic. I didn't like the fact that no one would end me. I really tried this, but I didn't care about the story - it was an action-adventure plot cliché. They were jokes that weren't funny. This was vomiting inducing predictable from start to finish. The dialogue was cliché and terrible - especially the last line "It's not ... it gives you wings, it's love!" Whatever it was, I remember how I crouched. I wished it was rushing and over. I wasn't the only one - the people I thought was boring. Watch Asterix and Obelix Cleopatra if you watch. That was a waste of time.
