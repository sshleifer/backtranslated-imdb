This film is incarnate. Nevertheless, I have seen this film several times and I plan to watch it several times because, despite its utter stupidity, it is very fun. And she has one of my favorite hockey movie actors, Casper van Dien, who is here in her full-fledged hockey movie. Here is Casper van Dien fully Casper van Dien and you have to love him for it. If he hadn't been in this movie, it would have been totally imperceptible, or at least by far the smallest than it was in the past. The cough used here is of no use at all. No one else in the world noticed that a large asteroid was approaching Earth next to that small group? Even with thousands and thousands and thousands of professional and amateur astronomers are they constantly looking for heaven just such a thing? A large asteroid that would be quite obvious would be obvious to anyone with a pair of eyes that is even vaguely visible. And a piece of the asteroid bounced off the atmosphere and no one noticed? The rock that the great atmosphere struck would cause enormous shock waves that could cause enormous damage to the planet's surface. Sure, someone would notice such things. Bwahahaha! The "science" used in this movie is so absolutely ridiculous that it somehow works to make this movie fun as it is. One thing I noticed is that, despite the pulse of uber, all the characters did not drip with sweat and their clothes were soaked with it. The characters most looked as if they had been lightly embittered by someone outside the camera with a water bottle to give them a "sweat". Authenticity was not the * goal that this film steadfastly pursued. Which, in a strange and cheerful way, gives this movie its magic of fun. Is it really worth watching this movie? Definitely! Assuming, of course, that you have absolutely no expectations of anything that remotely approaches reality. And it's your desire to melt and flourish in total hockey.
