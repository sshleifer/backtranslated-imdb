Mainly biographies of a desirable doctor, "Robert Merivel," (Robert Downey), who has his way in the royal palace for the first half of the film and then helps the oppressed in the second half, mainly "Katharine" (Meg Ryan). GOOD - A fantastic set of decorations (ie a lush royal palace) and costumes make this a visual treasure. The tongue is also very tame. Ian McKellen and Hugh Grant provide interesting support. <br /> <br /> BAD - After 50-60 minutes this movie just gets bored. He desperately needed to be given a spark after an hour, but that is the opposite: he goes on and on. Surely the scenario needed some badly needed "restoration", say? The movie may look pretty, but it's two hours before you can walk ..... too long.
