The hottest movie I've ever seen is not scary, just bad. The first WWE movie, and believe me, the only person this movie could reach is a fan match. She has terrible acting and the worst direction I've ever seen. I found the story with laughter and bad actors. I saw that WWE people really tried to put a lot of matches into the matches and some camera effects. I think they copied a lot from a quiet hill. Even this movie isn't interested, so if you see it, you'll find yourself in a mood for lack of sleep. The end is the worst, no matter what you come to want your money back
