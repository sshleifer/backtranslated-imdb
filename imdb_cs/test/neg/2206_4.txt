It was a modest attempt at a film, though it seemed more like an extended television pilot. Some may consider it unfair, but someone seems to have seen "The Brothers" and "Save the Last Dance" and thought, "Hey, I could do that too." Well, not quite. Although I personally found the movie to be predictable, somewhat misbehaved and invented (pay attention to cookies), Carl Payne shows he can do the lead and should be back. on the TV. The senior lady (she can't remember her name, sorry) was also plausible, but you're still thinking about Julia Stiles (she was the only one in "Save the Last Dance", isn't she?), Because she was really stuck in a "white girl". .
