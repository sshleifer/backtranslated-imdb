Okay, a movie about a movie that has cracks in creating a Video Movie could be fun. It could be, it should be funny, nervous, even controversial, or at least interesting, and yet ... This movie is so bizarre. Hamlin was entertaining as a producer of 'B' film. Shatner played crazy but nice and had all the best lines. The rest of the characters were boring, predictable, boring, undeveloped, boring and boring. The value of production was poor. You will see that the boom descends in one scene. The sound was terrible in some scenes. Hey, I'm a big fan of Shatner and Hamlin now, but their talent is useless here. At least the story was clich√©.
