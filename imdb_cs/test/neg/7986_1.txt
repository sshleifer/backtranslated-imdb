Thomas Edison can have a lot of great inventions done, but WTF is it !! I'm sorry, but this movie is just awful. The fence is that this elephant goes to a certain point and gets an electric shock. Good image quality looked like someone used it for toilet paper. I thought the early Charlie Chaplin movies were terrible. Well Thomas Edison may be an inventor, but why did this film he could have filmed a child to be a Fed and that would be better. People might say I'm tough at times, but you should get something like that from what I said Edison could have had a light bulb, but why did this particular movie do it. Well I Might Sound as a complete hole ## But watch out for Youtube, then you'll see this abomination. I still can't believe this movie is completely awful. I've ever seen everything in the worst short movie. <br /> <br /> Rating: 1/10
