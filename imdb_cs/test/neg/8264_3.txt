Masters Horror: Sounds like it's set up in Seattle, where Larry Pearce works as a call center manager for computer software when he lost his six-year-old son Michael (Nicholas Elia) to a rare heart condition that he found to be very sensitive. Larry hears everything tenfold, from people typing on a computer keyboard, people whispering in the room, people tapping their feet on the floor, taps tapping, and finally the people who breathe are unbearable to Larry because he is constantly bombarded with noise from his mind. In the end, Larry decides he has enough and if he can't stop the sounds himself, then he can stop when he hears them with the help of a big smart flesh ... <br /> <br /> This Canadian American co-production was episode 4 of season 2 in general the hit-and-miss television series Masters of Horror, written and directed by Brad Anderson, I thought the sound was definitely wrong. The script was based on the story by Mike O'Driscoll & I am really surprised by the amount of very positive comments she currently has on IMDb. a horror movie and the feeling that it's like some kind of bizarre sentimental drama until the last 5 minutes, when Howard Berger, Gregory Nicotero and the guys from KNB's effects really do a job. Larry has this strange inexplicable ability to amplify the sound and sounds from the beginning, so this episode ends up as 55 minutes of exactly the same kind of rebuilding that leads to a cruel end, even when it comes late to rescue the episode. This is quite slow, and when it's well written, it's not meant to be a horror theme & I'm a little confused when it comes to who it has to appeal to? Director Anderson does OK, but he just keeps repeating the same things over and over, until the last 5 minutes there's not a single drop of blood in the whole thing. There is no horror, there is no fear or tension and absolutely no atmosphere. <br /> <br /> Technically, it's very well done, has good production values, and doesn't look like a cheap TV program. Acting is very good and it is a pity that the story is somewhat limited. Sounds like it's one of the worst episodes of Masters of Horror, and it seems to be a lot of people. not for me. Another Masters of Horror, another disappointment.
