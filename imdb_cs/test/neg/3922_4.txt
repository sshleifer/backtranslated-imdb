Early 1950s Sci-Fi directed by Lesley Selander. Of course, special effects are very primitive, but they are pretty good compared to what's out there. Drive-in Movie Double Fare Function; still interesting enough to watch. Two leading men, Arthur Franz, a brilliant young scientist, Dr. Jim Barker and direct spokesman and provincial journalist Steve Abbot (Cameron Mitchell) joined the crewed flight on Carol Stafford (Virgina Huston) another scientist and two other space experts Richard Gaines and John Litel). After landing on the Red Planet, space passengers meet with people who are friendly and mentally advanced. In fact, the Martians are led by the Ikron (Morris Ankrum), who has the concept of conquering the Earth to revive their civilization. There is a beautiful Martian (Maruerite Chapman) that Dr. Barker intends to take him back on his way back. She is the imaginable element of the film.
