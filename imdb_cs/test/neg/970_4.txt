Eddy Murphy and Robert De Niro should be a combination that results in a great comedy. Great expectations often lead to despair, and it turns out to be the case. When Eddy, as a policeman, destroys a drug deal done by Detective Robert, it's so bad that the reality of a TV police show reality ends up doing it. Logic is not a big part of this movie. The super-gun he spends the second half of the film, chasing down, confirms that. Twelve machine guns that leave large holes in the metal plate and three destroy the house in about a minute (without reloading) is more fantasy than science fiction. The five pound gun, which shoots hundreds of shots per minute without any recoil, is certainly a weapon of the future that uses past technology. It is clear that this movie was intended for both adults and children, so if you're somewhere in between, it's a movie for you.
