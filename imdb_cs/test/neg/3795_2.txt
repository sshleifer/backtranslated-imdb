I was utterly disgusted with this unnecessary sequel to "The Poseidon Adventure" which I wrote a great commentary about. <br /> <br /> The film is incredible from the word GO! I agree, why were there no other rescue ships and helicopters in the area? The one who saved the original survivors had just flown across the ship, where Michael Caine & Sally Field was located. THAT ARE ONLY RESCUE CREW? Hard to believe. Acting is generally bad and the show looks cheap. I really hated wasting the talent of some good actors. Don't follow this movie if you can't catch Sally & Michael as a lover. <br /> <br /> gord
