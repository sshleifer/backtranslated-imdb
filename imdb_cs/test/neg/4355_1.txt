The quality you will probably remember after viewing the Great Knife is as claustrophobic. Its stimulation is sacrificed to a unified dialogue structure. It's talky in the extreme. Modern viewers will feel every point was made (and then some) but the movie will still not move, or make the viewer a favor and change of scenery. It's very inert. For the 45 min mark I was sure I was watching two very slow hours. My determined answer was, "Good God, where is it going?" It is a feeling that Odets was paid for by the word ... <br /> <br /> This is a good place to see the drama fall from its highest point in the 1940s through projects that took place in the 1950s. and the 1960s. The real film merits were rediscovered in the 1970s, only to disappear again. Here we get show-offs, conventional, emotional explosions from Steiger, Lupino et al. and the camera moves in a pre-arranged manner to accommodate excessively practiced blocking. This is due to the emergence of a method; the regrettable trend of sacrificing all the other merits of the film, giving the actors their selfish wish. "Great acting," ho-hum, killed thoughts in movies. Jack Palance's forehead and pompadour pulled and pushed forward each time he reacted to something. It's distracting. This is terribly boring.
