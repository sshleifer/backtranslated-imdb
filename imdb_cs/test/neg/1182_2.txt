I stopped watching this movie halfway. It was just awful! Boring, fancy subplots. The total lack of pathos seen in Norman Bates, Buffalo Bill, or Steve Railsback's portrayal of Ed Gein. The film may not be historically accurate, but the real story of Ed Gein is much more interesting than this third melody, which was not entirely for good reason! Ed Gein, as depicted by Kane Hodder, is a cartoon sadist. Attempts to show him the trauma caused by his mother are only weak exercises in a recycled style. And this movie wanted to be stylish, but it did. Fortunately, there is a better film for this story. 2001's Ed Gein told the story effectively and offered some real frosts when we watched a sick person who wasn't under his control. Steve Railsback, this time played by Ed Gein, was already famous for the memorable portrayal of another famous serial killer, Charles Manson. His Ed had pathos. His film is one that can be seen. Avoid this mess.
