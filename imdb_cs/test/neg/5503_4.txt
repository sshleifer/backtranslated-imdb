The original review I planned for this movie was perhaps a little overlapping, so I'm talking to a good one: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer and pizza or a sleeping movie you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no one really focuses on film. The visual elements are beautiful, and that's a bit of fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it's not. I made a mistake when I watched that something was trembling and all the lights went out. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and offer you a list of alternative recommendations. (By the way, this is a serious offer. Real horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, supplemented by SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother making a film based on a classic story if you don't even try to stay true to the sense, feeling, tone or the theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of the misspelled dialogue and hear the slow movement of Washington Irving rolling in his grave. I'll even receive a Big-City detective, but ... Ricci draws dirt around the bed? Come on now. Not only is "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow" nothing at all, but it's a historic BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan ax you have to grind, but in the 18th century "witchcraft" meant selling your soul to the devil in exchange for the devil's powers; all this fluffy goddess-worship service worshiped the "witch-no-harm" approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, to the British invasion. (Parties interested in genuine old pagan practices are referred to by James Frazer "The Golden Bough" if you don't believe me.) This creates a discordant element that is thrown into the context of the movie itself, the Sleepy Hollow Legend is broken. So we've finished a completely different story. If it were Burton's idea, I wish he had warned us in advance. I would also like him to come up with a better story than the one that is more for pedestrians. Likewise, he could drop Irving's predictions completely. And in any case, the film is not scary. Not even once. Not at all. The twisted tree approached, but was more than balanced by the laughter that sounded Hessian's farce comedy. Finally, yes, I also wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God never meant her to be a blonde.
