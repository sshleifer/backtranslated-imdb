Scott's 80-year-old collection of icons can't save this teenage catastrophe. But then I suppose that was why it was just a TV movie and not a main movie. William A. Schwartz (writer) comes up with something closer to "Stewardess School", in addition to this film is more boring. This film is not really stupid, just boring and completely infertile. The only reason to see it could be to see Tina Yothers play a real role in family ties. After this movie and the same stupid "Class Cruise", I think Mr. Scott is awake and has returned to directing sit-coms, which was his best move yet. 4 out of 10
