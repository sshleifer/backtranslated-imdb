This must be assessed as one of the hardest TV shows in the long run. Jose Ferrer played the title character Nemo. He did some justice and certainly looked at the part. But nowadays, it seems to me that Nemo, who was invented, will have more than just a resemblance to the Bird's Eye captain of TV commercials. Or maybe it's the other way around. His nemesis, Professor Cunningham, was brilliantly reworked by Burgess Meredith. He had never managed to get out of Batman on the days of the "penguin". Although he does not do his penguin here, he is like a manic professor without a parallel position. Only John Colicos, the glory of Battlestar Galactica, chewed the scenery better as a manic despot. I can never remember what was between Nem and Cunningham, but it had to be difficult because prof. He never missed a chance to try Nemo and vice versa. The effects were nothing special, even though the submarine prof. Cunningham was much better than Nemo. She also had a crew of strange amphibians similar to the fish who served Cunningham and each did their design. However, the most memorable aspect of the show was the secret weapon of prof. Cunningham. Delta Beam! He was forever saying "the fiery Delta beam!", Whereupon, the fishing crew would terribly overwhelm the gunfire's movement by using a full shoulder shrug. Really priceless! They won't do it like that anymore and maybe just as well. But like other series of this era, for those who remember it, it will always be in love if it is covered with cheddar, a place in our hearts.
