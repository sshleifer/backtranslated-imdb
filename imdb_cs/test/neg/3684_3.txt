The gate to hell opened under Moscow. The priest, played by Vincent Gallo, goes to the city to find a friend who has gone missing in the tunnels beneath the city in search of a gate. Wandering underground with your colleagues has to deal with the inhabitants of the tunnels, both human and demonic. A good idea with a good cast of second-tier actors is nowhere like the tunnels that set it up. I watched it twice, and I still have no idea why it is supposed to be frightening, when there is not a lot of other things happening than people talk about evil and see shadow forms. Nothing is clear, and I honestly didn't see the point of anything else than to provide a check for the participants (the second billed by Val Kilmer is in a few fleeting scenes that are not much different from allowing him to be) The invoice is really good, the performances are All right, the script goes nowhere. Take the advice of several characters in the movie and don't cross the river to see it.
