Nightscream is a TV movie so it must be pretty horrible, especially since it's an alleged horror movie. This young girl is being chased by dreams when she comes to a small town where a woman was murdered a year ago. She is impressed when everyone in the city thinks she looks just like a murdered girl. The townspeople are stunned as they still enter the dream as a trance, revealing the exact details of the murder and the murderer, because the police saw it all wrong. They think they are in danger of learning about them, the murderers (two of them) start to hatch a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth. Until then, you will probably fall asleep and why the filmmakers have a machine to create full throttle in dream sequences.
