Tycoon will never be listed as one of John Wayne's better positions. It's good in places, it has some fine action sequences in the cave and also in the flood on top. But the plot leaves much to be desired. What we have in Tycoon are two men who don't really like each other and that don't stop them from working as a team. Multimillionaire Cedric Hardwicke hired John Wayne and James Gleason to build a railroad. But then he refuses to give them the necessary funds to do it right. When Wayne falls to Hardwick's daughter, Laraine Day, things really get complicated. After a night of spending time alone in the Inca ruins, under a South American convention, Wayne and Day will marry a shotgun wedding, though nothing has happened. What should happen is that these two should be locked in the room for 24 hours together to resolve their differences one way or another. Their petty spits cause deadly consequences for Wayne's crew. But what's best known about Tycoon is another thing. Laraine's day was married to Leo Durocher manager of the Brooklyn Dodgers when this was filmed. He was a constant presence on the scene, insanely jealous of John Wayne who he thought might have an affair with his wife. Nothing to do, but he made his wife's life unhappy. It's not one of Duke's better efforts.
