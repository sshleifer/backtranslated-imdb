I'm trying to understand what people like about MirrorMask. I am an avid film viewer and filmmaker enthusiast. As I told my friends during my midday hour, MirrorMask may be my biggest film disappointment of the year. Like the short Moongirl, the movie lacked its mark. He made humor attempts several times during the film. He sets you to laugh. Instead of laughing, it leaves a feeling of emptiness. Jokes resembled one of the recent Star Wars movies. They weren't funny unless there were five of them. And acting was just as terrible. I saw the actors appear in front of the blue screen. And I believed it. But not in this movie. Not per second. <br /> <br /> This movie has a formula and tries to apply it with a nice drawing? And even though the script is completely functional and the special effects are pretty beautiful, it doesn't have a heart and fails. I left the movie as he shook my head and thought about leaving the theater. I felt mocking and miserable, and I still didn't get a sour taste. I like independent film. I encourage people to view independent movies that support them. But not this movie. This film should not be made. At least not like that. Why was he so clearly lost to the director? Were they clearly set? Not just humor. But emotion. Drama. Even the lines were badly timed and delivered. It was as if the film was going on three legs instead of four. His steps are uncomfortable and missing timing. And could it fall with the slightest pressure? I don't see this movie. I don't care who you are. It's not worth your time.
