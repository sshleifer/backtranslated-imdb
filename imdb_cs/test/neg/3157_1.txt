I do not get it. I just don't get it. "Barney and Friends" have been imprisoned for millions of years over the years, and I admit that I was one of those lambasters. Every child watching this show doesn't realize that what they're watching is just a piece of waste. Barney is very annoying and very selfish. Add Baby Bop, and it is even worse. Add B.J., then you have a very spooky television nightmare. Then you get the kids. They are old enough to know what Barney is trying to teach them! What are they doing there? It would be fun if Barney and his friends appeared on the Jerry Springer show. That would certainly be one of the wildest moments in TV history! More importantly, this exhibition marked the beginning of the end of public television, as we knew it, because we saw less and less informative and interesting public service television programs broadcast in the 1970s and 1980s. What is the huge difference that makes selfish son weapons. When this exhibition leaves PBS, there will be a great sigh of relief among millions of people, but a huge veil will be made in the annals of television history. Message to Barney himself: You may not realize it, but YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBER. <br /> <br /> In short, there are other options. Better choices.
