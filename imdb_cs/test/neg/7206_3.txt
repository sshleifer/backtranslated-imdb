OK, I gave it three three! He deserves only one star without question. <br /> <br /> If your movie is going to really watch the movie and take it as a B-Horror movie, it will have one star. But I believe it is clear that during the first minutes of the movie, what we have to do is a piece of crap. <br /> <br /> With this movie, I and my friend watching him could shut down and put on a little more "Hollywood", but instead we decided to tear the whole movie apart from the beginning to the end. We laughed so many times that it was almost when I was watching a comedy. Acting is awful ... The effects and sequences of death are so bad. ... <br /> <br /> But the fact that he's trying to make a serious horror movie .. Defenseless! The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters go through the supposed "dark basement", which is brightly lit, pretending not to be able to see the bumps hanging from the bahahahaha ceiling just awful. So <br /> <br /> So if you want to laugh how crappy this movie is, along with the fact that it was in 2004, than to see this movie .... <br /> <br /> Wait Why am I writing so much? Nobody knows about this movie ... I doubt anyone will read this hahahaha.
