My wife rented this movie and then never saw it comfortably. If I wanted to torture her, I would watch her this movie. I watched many movies with my 4 year old and I can take almost anything. Barney is refreshing after Quigley's shot. The storyline, dialogue, cinematography and acting were one step higher (or equal) to the cheap porn movie. I feel cheated of $ 3.69 that we paid to rent and then I will never return 90 minutes of my life. I will say that I enjoyed it for 4 years, fortunately it was a rent we had to return immediately. I hope that the career of a younger actor is not destroyed in this film.
