The cast of "All That" returns to good humor at "Good Burger" instead of the old fashioned fast food restaurant. The comedy is amazing, the fun is non-stop, and although clich√© is a passerby for the child and family comedy. A movie for all ages, this movie is meant for joy, laughter and a pretty much lazy movie on a rainy day, as is what I would have saved the movie, rainy day. The US has aired it today, and since I know that the cast of "Everything" is in it, I thought it might be a bit of a burner laugh, but in good fun like Keenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell (probably one of the best young duo they were amazing together, the pieces joined together and everything worked, and that made her a good family pastime along with some lazy daily effort to lose a bad day. <br /> <br /> Can I take your order?
