Ditzy girl (yes, ditzy is about as complicated as her character gets) will not insist on answering and doing quirky things to make her husband back. It is too attractive to be believable with such fragile characters that go through the movements. But not far enough to be fascinating in a way that says: Being John Malkovich was. So it ends up boring. sv
