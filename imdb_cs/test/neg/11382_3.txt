Unfortunately, it seems that the golden times of a stylish Italian cinema have fallen into oblivion. And the recent brain of famous filmmaker Lambert Bava is another obvious proof of this premise. I felt lucky to be able to watch many films from this prolific director (such as Body Puzzle, Delerium, Macabre and both Demons). Although it wasn't entirely satisfactory, it was never so boring. The suspicion that this new entry into my DVD collection was blown into the wind was created shortly after a car crash scene appeared that had a clumsy and unlikely situation. the position of the body under the tipper. During the heavily narrated chain of events that followed, a sense of shallowness grew. Stupid Dialogues, A Lack of Scenario and Total Loss of Talent from International Cast. The only character that gave more or less throughput was the mischievous Mark's son, who took all the boredom. Unfortunately, the work of Mary's son on all accounts could hardly be welcomed. I look forward to the fact that his murder house is likely to improve.
