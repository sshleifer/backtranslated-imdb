I'm sitting here watching movie, Tango and Cash. This led to a discussion of other great films from the 1980s. It was ridiculous, Tunrer and Hooch, the K9. I admitted I never saw K9PI, and if I still appreciate my life, I'll never be. Joshua quotes it as his film of the year. Wow. Wow. I am absolutely amazed that this film exists. But much more than Joshua likes this move, I'm destroying me. I think Joshua is one interesting guy <br /> <br /> K9 <br /> <br /> K9
