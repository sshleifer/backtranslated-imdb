It seems incredible that in the same decade that brought the Star Wars into the silver screen, such unpredictable insolence, like this and many other "adventurous" films, has ripped. I remind myself of a similarly rich but equally poor 'Ashanti' described elsewhere. Whatever the A-list-motivated actors who subscribe to such celluloid waste, sincerely outside this writer. They had to be very, very desperate. Being perfectly honest, Roger Moore's appearance in any movie is a death kiss. Although he was very handsome in his youth, his whole acting career was based on the ability to raise one eyebrow. Every emotion from A to B is mediated by this simple loss. It was James Bond's Dog Day. Lee Marvin on the other side featured on some very worthy trips, perhaps most notably 'Paint Your Wagon' and 'The Dirty Dozen'. He has a comic strip, but he is much better off playing it straight. Excellent Ian Holm is throwing, barely recognizable obscured as African mute. Everybody else just signed up for pay checks. The only credible element is the German cruiser. It looks like a very big model. But he is credibly massive and looks authentic - just like his crew. The rest is not even terrible. A childish comedy with brutality and violence in a story that clumsily stretches, as if the scenario itself had too many Lee Marvin gin gusts. Here's a director who just doesn't know where he is going. There are hints of 'African Queen', a snippet of 'Pride & The Passion', 'Gold', and one or two other rip-offs from movies that do not come in mind. Oddly enough, I saw it three times, whenever it was shown on television when I was laid down with cold or flu. Maybe it affects my judgment - but not much. <br /> <br /> Compare it to any Indiana Jones movie and see what I mean. I gave him two stars; one for the battleship and the other because it finally ends, though the sky knows it takes a long time. Time for another Lemsip, I think.
