Get a CD instead. The show is tame and edit sucks. The crowd is getting too much screen, just like Till Lindemann. The cameras spend more time on the same guy shaking his head in the same way (which makes me believe it is exactly the same) than it was during the solo solo by Richard Kruspe in Weisses Fleisch. The scenes change so fast that it's impossible to find out where the camera is aimed, and the records are simply useless. It is not worth the tape on which it is recorded.
