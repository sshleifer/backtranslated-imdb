Of all Perry Mason's movies I've seen since 1985, this is my favorite. I admit that Diana Muldaur never liked me as an actress. He only seems to know how to play one type of character - a hard woman who has an undefined chip on her shoulder, which is extremely difficult to sympathize with. This is no exception - it is true to form. The only thing that will save this film, in my opinion, is the serious performance of Scott Baio as a prosecutor - I actually found myself rooting for him to win, and the film is worth seeing for him alone.
