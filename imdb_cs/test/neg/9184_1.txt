"Wagons East" is widely known as John Candy's last film as he died on set. That's just what makes it so sad: not only did Candy suffer a deadly heart attack, but it was on a set of such a confused movie. Seriously, I don't know what they thought when they came up with this piece of bullshit, but the swing doesn't have any redemptive qualities. It's like they took every unused script for silly Westerns and just mixed and filmed. No wonder John Candy didn't want to make a movie; Perhaps his contractual involvement was what made him. Anyway, the thing is, Candy did much better than that during her career. To be sure, he has already completed Michael Moore's "Canadian Bacon", in which the United States declares war on Canada. Just stick to it and you can say that Candy ended her career honestly. As for Richard Lewis - who previously played with Candy in the absurd but cheerful movie "Once On a Crime", which appeared in Eugen Levy's film - he invented this piece of crap by appearing on Countdown with Keith in later years Olbermann ".
