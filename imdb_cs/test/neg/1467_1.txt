If you want to see the worst movie you've ever done, look no further. Some poor movies are traceable because they are unintentionally funny. Unfortunately, American film has no joke at all, no unintentional humor, just the obscure thoughts of its director to be ridiculous. <br /> <br /> For those who like this movie, I recommend watching Kevin Smith "Clerks," similar in tone. At Clerks you will find creativity, wit and enjoyment - all on a handy budget. It should forget this awful effort.
