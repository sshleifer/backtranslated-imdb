Terrible, Terrible, Terrible performance. The issue of the "real world" dealt with the obvious non-originality. Stereotypes galore. What the hell is going on with African-Americans (blacks), eyebrows? Tyrone too! Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, Terrible, Terrible performance. The fact that it took three seasons of beggars. This show is really a slander for the brains of dead mediators of mediocrity. Saved Bell almost seemed funny compared to this. Well, not in retrospect. It is the same banal ilk, and therefore no intelligence. The only thing missing so far is Jesus is God's message. Mentality and deliverance are the same, yet they feel bad and mindless. You will almost hear the television managers covering each other with buzzing words. In fact, I felt so upset in this showing excremental existence, I felt compelled to comment. Awful, Terrible, Terrible performance.
