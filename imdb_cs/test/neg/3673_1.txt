This is by far the worst movie I've ever seen that has next to any conspiracy and conspiracy it has is very scattered. The story of the story lacks content, tension, and subtitles because what seems to be a story is in Russian. The set seems to be just one room with different lighting effects, and the moment you think something good is going to happen, you will be tempted by the total lack of acting, drama, tension, horror, gore, story, and mythology. The style of directing was made to death (fisheye camera). It would seem that the only action in this movie is in the last 10-15 minutes and the action is even worse, the actors inability to display the voltage correctly. The only interesting thing about this movie was my dog ​​barking on surround sound.
