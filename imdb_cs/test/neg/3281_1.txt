This is a piece of celluloid CRAP. You can tell when you watch "want" movie mafia ... and that's it. It did not mean any SENSE, did not start at the beginning of his life, charactors were everywhere in place ... and TERM "GODFATHER" didn't even EXIST until PUZO wrote the book! ... THEN, the real mafia, he borrowed PHRASE and did it after the movie ..... This piece of claptrap would think the phrase (representing the mafia don) was used in the 1920s ... when these people they were just called "DON" .... outside the original movie Godfather, if you want to see another decent movement of the crowd, check out Puzo The Last Don (Part 1) Part 2 sucked.
