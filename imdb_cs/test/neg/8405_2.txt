I think "Rosemary's Baby" is the most overrated horror over there. It's not scary, interesting or anything. It's pretty well directed and Ruth Gordon was amazing, but that's about it. But this sequel makes it look like "Gone With the Wind"! I caught it on TV when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remembered it. From what I remember, Rosemary's child Andrew is now an adult and the coven wants him to take over (the world that is). But there are forces that try to stop it ... and Andrew has doubts alone ... <br /> <br /> I give it 2 for several reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually pretty good as Andrew and at the beginning there is one ghostly moment when Rosemary (Patty Duke) "kidnapped" by bus ... without driver. Besides, it's boring. , stupid and useless. The original didn't need a sequel! Watching Josef Levin's book in 1999 wasn't much better. <br /> <br /> At the beginning, tune in to Duke ... then tune in. It's not worth the effort.
