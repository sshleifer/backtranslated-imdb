I can't remember the last time I filmed a movie that I went out. The Weatherman and the Island were both so bad that I thought about it, but I stayed there until the end. This film was incomprehensible, not humorous and went on and on. Like some other commentators, I was wondering if the parts were just French humor that I didn't get, or if the characters were serious. I finally gave up and tried to nap, because I didn't want to disturb my husband if he enjoyed it, but he noticed and let me know that it was OKAY if I wanted to go out and out of the door we went. He would like to know how it ended ... if Denevue lived or died, etc ... (I don't care).
