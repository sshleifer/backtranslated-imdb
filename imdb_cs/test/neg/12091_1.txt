***** SPOILERS ********* <br /> <br /> This movie was really awful. This woman deceives her employer right from the start and then selfishly continues to tear. In the end, you see her doing a business call that she learned from her "pupil" father. I put the pupil in quotes because the governor never made a child at all. She seems to hate her and can't be near her. I felt sorry for the little girl who wanted to be loved, absent, understandable to say and do things just to get attention, but the viewer was not supposed to sympathize with the little girl, the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the governess who hated her pupil she manipulated and deceived her employers. I just couldn't. It was not the story of a woman who made herself, but it was a window to the mind of someone who uses others on every occasion without thinking about anything outside her own family. I couldn't build a governess! That was a really horrible movie. I only paid one dollar, but it was too much!
