Hair, a Broadway hit movie, cannot achieve any redeemable movie qualities. you can't really play the game and make it a movie. Whether someone is so tempted by rock music to see this movie, it's really at the expense of Broadway show quality. worse than seeing sitcoms. music fiasco and cant believe others rated it so high.
