Predator Island begins as six friends, Eric (Tom Dahl), Chris (Dan Gordon) along with Heather (Iris McQuillan-Grace), Kim (Iana Baker) and Denise (Melissa Roby), who are invited to spend some time at Kevin's ( Michael Wrann) Father boat party on the open sea. What could go wrong with such a super sounding idea? Well, to begin with, a big green meteorite could crash into the sea near your ship, and an extraterrestrial life force could emerge from it and try to kill you all, then it's just a ridiculously stupid idea, right? Co-edited, written and directed by Steven Castle I thought Predator Island was stupid and it's simple and straight as it really does. The script is of the worst kind, you know what kind of abomination is full of highly annoying teenage characters who do and say the stupidest things, is full of clich√©s and is completely predictable, makes it meaningless, things just suddenly happen without any build or explanation, it's boring even at just 70 odd minutes and has virtually no entertainment value or unintentional laughter value. In fact, the film does not have much of what I would call a conspiracy, there is no explanation as to why or how this alien creature can take over the minds of the people or why it can be selective in the sense that one moment will be a person. Normal 'next when the story calls for it & without obvious cause, suddenly your green glowing eyes & sudden urge to turn the cannibal. There's not enough horror in it, so-called action scenes are pitiful and I really don't want to waste another second thought about Predator Island, let alone wasting my precious energy that wrote these words ... Director Castle does nothing to this thing was watching, and "special effects" are absolutely terrible, this alien creature wouldn't even get into the sci-fi movie of the 1950s. The filmmakers even play some blooper shots, but this must be the least witty collection of bugs, I think they can't do it badly if you know what I mean! Forget all the decent gore because there is none, there is a bit of cannibalism and some gut placed on the unhappy stomach actors, so another unhappy actor can pick them up and pretend to eat them. estimated budget of about $ 150,000 I have to admit that the filmmakers worked on a seriously low budget, which is no excuse for making such a film bad. The whole thing looks very cheap and acting is bad enough. Predator Island is crap, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is & I just can't see what anyone would get out of it. In my humble opinion, this is probably the one we avoid.
