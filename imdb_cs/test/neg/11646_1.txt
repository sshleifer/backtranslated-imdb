Stay away from this movie! It's terrible in every way. Bad behavior, thin recycled land and the worst end in film history. I rarely watch a movie that makes my adrenaline pump irritating, in fact the only other film that is immediately recovering is the Airspeed movie. Please do not look at this because it is totally pathetic from start to finish. Helge Iversen
