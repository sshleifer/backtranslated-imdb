Why can Canada show decent to good movies in every genre? The next day I caught Dragon Hunt on TV and it was like a train wreck. I couldn't change the channel, it's a total stupidity that cut me off. It's pretty much to say that casting IMDb "credits" with this monstrosity has probably never worked again. Bad play, bad writing, bad narration, bad music, bad hair, bad cinematography. It goes on and on. The film really has nothing to recommend. If you are looking for bad action movies that you can enjoy with laughter, there are tons of other movies that don't require you to burn your retinas afterwards. <br /> <br /> I hope this movie get money from the government to fund it, otherwise I never pay taxes again.
