Despite the many positive reviews, this is a very slow movie with three essentially good actors who improvise the most banal dialogue you ever hear. This is another road movie that really isn't where. The camera often focuses and constant scrolling in some of the long scenes is unpleasant. Three characters are attractive but nice. The cast also determines what must be an intergalactic record for using the tired word "dude". (Even Howard Stern left this tired pesudo pronoun). Three major actors and one minor actor show a big promise. They are clearly comfortable and bravely allow them to be shallow and even goofy. All the actors seem to be impersonal amateurs who have generously volunteered for several lines. Indeed, everyone is sitting well in their roles. <br /> <br /> Everyone in all the boring 90 minutes that look more like eternity. That's among my ten worst movies ever.
