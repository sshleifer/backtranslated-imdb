Stylized Hollywood Westerns, full of familiar conventions, seem to have eternal life, and that is an avatar. It seems that everything in it was scraped from the back of the 1939 drawer, a larger budget was used, and this production was its problem. Gary Cooper has played this kind of role many times - displaced Southerner, fast on draw and tight with honor, though it's easy whenever possible. He plays Blayde Hollister, who travels to Texas and seeks a gang that destroyed his cotton plantation. He wears a shirt lined with leather and packs two six ivory shooters. He speaks with an accented accent - "This could hurt a jester." (Compare, "Sergeant York.") The gang is guided by Raymond Massey's grimace, who buys and sells land, usually carelessly whenever possible. The gang includes Steve Cochran, who cannot play the West, even though he is very good in bags in general. A necessary woman is Ruth Roman, daughter of a Mexican plantation owner who looks and talks about Mexican as a sky-brown betty. <br /> <br /> I don't think I'd bother too much with the plot. There is no doubt that someone has gone into it in some details and it is not worth mentioning. As in 1939, it is a labyrinth. Everyone except Cooper and his friends are deceived and there are several double crosses and switched identities and hidden secrets. Everything is retro. Storyline, dialogue, wardrobe, even music. The score is from Warner's permanent Max Steiner. He's the guy who scored "King Kong". That was 1932. This movie was released in 1950. <br /> <br /> The name of Cooper, by the way, "Blayde Hollister" - prompted me to check out the RACA records - Real American Cowboy Associaton in their archives, dated from the beginning to February 4, 1911, when the last real cowboy died due to an unfortunate clash with the rogue peccary. He has never been a real cowboy named Blayde. Hollister, yes, but not Blayde. In fact, there is no record of a real cowboy named Wade, Luke, Cole or Matt. The most popular names for true cowboys, in descending order of frequency, were Clarence, Mortimer, Noble, Nebuchadnezzar, Plautus, Pinchbeck, and Hortense. If this movie was released in 1939, it would be routine. In 1950, it was a disaster in the history of human recycling.
