Try to see it. I thought it would be good because I am a fan of the films of the 1980s and I enjoyed some of the work of Linne Quigley. I was wrong. I should have said "no" and instead watched Gigli, which is probably a much better film. My biggest problem with this movie was his humor attempt. Nothing was funny or even funny. Behavior is bad, even for the Queen of the 80's movies. There is no story, just random clips. I think I shouldn't hate it so much because it was just a fun and stupid piece, but I had no fun and I wasn't once fun. I even had to go to the end to get through all the bullshit. I'm sorry, but I won't find the zombies that make aerobics fun.
