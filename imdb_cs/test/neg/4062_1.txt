The plane is 747 Jumbo. The cockpit is located on the top floor at 747. In the movie, the pilots do not climb the stairs in the 1st class cabin to reach the cockpit. She goes to the 1st class cabin and through the cockpit door. What is gaff !!! The front of the first class cab has a dressing room for jackets and a TV screen. Behind this is the radar dome. Before the start, it is shown that the 747 will start a taxi on the runway. On takeoff the aircraft has only two engines. Space 747 has four engines. Who had continuity on this film? In the early stages of the flight suddenly includes sudden toilets - another farcical gaff !!! Then the front of the aircraft becomes rearward and vice versa. At this point I stopped watching. Absolute waste !!!
