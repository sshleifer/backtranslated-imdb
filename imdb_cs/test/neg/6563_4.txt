Star Trek V definitely earns a dubious award for the weakest movie in the Star Trek series. Despite the good actors' efforts, the actors suffered from a general lack of funding from Paramount Pictures. Paramount Pictures wasn't excited about this movie at the very beginning. Their departure from the coast is shortened when nimbus III appears, a planet of intergalactic peace. Captain Kirk and Enterprise arrive at Nimbus III just to have Sybok, Spock's half-brother, kidnap their ship. Sybok rinses the Enterprise crew and sets it on a suicide mission to meet "God", just behind the Great Barrier in the middle of our galaxy. Captain Kirk must then figure out a way to regain control of his ship and repel the persecutors of Klignon Enterprise. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley, Laurence Luckinbill and the rest of the cast give good performances. William Shatner also does a pretty good job directing this movie. However, the film suffered from a general lack of enthusiasm and funding. First, part of Syboka was originally offered to Sean Connery, but he refused. This is how Laurence Luckinbill came. Second, many of the special effects have been greatly reduced ... reducing the entertainment potential movies. Thirdly, the scene that captures the arrival of the Great Barrier has remained highly desirable. Finally, the romance between Scotty and Uhura made no sense at all in this movie ... since no such romance has ever happened before this point in Star Trek and it has never been explained how such a romance could suddenly appear between Star Treks IV and V. Overall, this is a very weak film. You should probably skip this movie and go to Star Trek VI. After all, the cast and crew of the Star Trek VI partially rescued after their debacle with Star Trek V. \ t
