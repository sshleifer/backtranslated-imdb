I thought it would be a fun comedy without sex or nudity. Well, there is no sexual content, but as far as the "funny comedy" is concerned, I only remember three times while laughing "The Green Butchers". Glee is centered around cannibalism and mental retardation, which is just a bad humor, in the wrong way. I should have gone out of this movie and I kicked myself because I didn't. In fact, I shouldn't see this movie. The only thing that came out of this film was that Bjarne and his brother finally made a change and their ugly past. I recommend to every well-minded individual to avoid this gross movement.
