It was derived from the previous poster that the army would not be subject to police in disaster as depicted in the film. In fact, the military task would be to provide support to civilian authorities if requested. Civilian authorities would retain primacy. In practice, the army would need 48 hours to mobilize because there was not much power in London, especially with the current overseas commitments. Even then they would be dependent on calling in TA. As for COBRA, we thought it was a full-blown government emergency department on its own - even a reference to the Met Police Cobra division. In fact, COBRA stands for Office Briefing Room "A". It's just a room where PM or DPM meet their advisors to discuss the current situation!
