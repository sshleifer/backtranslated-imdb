Okay, I saw this movie through Mystery Science Theater 3000, but I saw the movie so I thought I'd leave a comment. Again, I love Joe getting stuck with annoying roles, while his brother and nephews are just getting Oscar's winning roles left and right. Soultaker is technically what you would call a movie that was supposed to be good. The director and the actors seemed to take this film very seriously and had very cheesy effects, a story that doesn't make much sense, and not to mention nice playful acting skills. This is one of my favorite MST3K episodes, simple, because much of what they mention is what we think about throughout the film, and explain why in the moment. Natalie and Zach are a couple who broke up and are now trying to work. But since Zach is in the upper lower class and Natalie is in the middle class, it won't work. On the way home, however, they and Zach's friends get into a car accident and now they are followed by the Angel of Death / Soultaker to meet his souulaking quota. But it also seems that he has some other relationship with Natalie and can't go on. So now Natalie and Zach must race to save souls and lives five times five times a minute. Well, I think Zeppelin was wrong when he sang that there was a stairway to heaven, I wonder if Black Sabbith was too bad, lol. Basically, there are plenty of hole holes in these movies like no one can see characters and can't be killed, but in some way they can still press the buttons and open the door? The Angel of Death had a very strange face and was a little distracting from the story itself. Soultaker was just a lousy movie that was hurrying and making you Joe, Brother Sheen / Estovez, so bad. <br /> <br /> 2/10
