Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back! This is a horror movie, not a thriller, not a tension, a horror movie. Yes, this movie is a horror movie. Terribly bad. After many years lurking here on IMDb, I have actually moved to an account, so I (like at least one other reviewer here) can warn people NOT to DISPLAY THIS FILM! WEIGHT YOUR SOUL, or at least your desire to live in a world that makes movies so bad, or at least an hour and a half of life, unless you are wise enough to hit the forward button. Seriously, I'd like to hear the director's voice on the "enhanced" DVD (there's another terrifying thought) to see what the hell he thinks. Producers had to assume that there were enough shoots to get in the name of Val Kilmer, so that the film would break at least in international distribution. on demand, which provided no subtitles for the Russian dialogue. Not that it mattered a lot. I'm trying to hear Russian, translate it into my head (if you can), just to find out how boring it is, it just adds insult to injury. I'll give this movie "1" because I can't give it a lower rating and because it has made one remarkable thing. Almost completely underground, it seemed NOT claustrophobic. Now it's a dubious success. HERE YOUR SPOILER: And the end, holy mother (no pun) is like they run out of money and just decide to stop shooting. The "top" of the film literally occurs seconds before the end and is solved by the simplest escape I've ever seen on film. Also practice your simple escape mechanism if you find yourself watching this button - the power button.
