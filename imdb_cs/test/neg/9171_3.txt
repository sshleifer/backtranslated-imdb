I waited a long time to finally see what I thought was going to be a fun movie swing and I was shocked to find it was an awkward direction, awkward dialogue, lackluster pace, unmotivated grotesque gags, and total roughness that penetrated whole film. It's not funny! The sets looked cheap, the costumes usually of the superb Donfeld are fragile and distracting. Even the title song is unpleasant. The characters of the entire children's book are approaching the idea of ​​a married couple whose life is turned upside down when they lose their jobs. For a film that seems to focus on the injustice of welfare and unemployment systems, filmmakers have no problem of being unfair, allowing Hispanic, black and gay stereotypes to play at such a cruel level. The film looks similar to any Love American Style episode. It's not a compliment. Seventies tacks fashion abound in this world of white collar thefts that lend air to every unlikely situation. Beyond the clever initial idea and the two capable stars in Jane Fonda and George Segal, this dated exercise in social commentary reflects as forced and means moods towards minorities, especially gays. If you want a better caper movie, you're better with Hot Rock with George Segal and Robert Redford or What Up Up with Ryan O'Neal and Barbra Streisand. That's funny!
