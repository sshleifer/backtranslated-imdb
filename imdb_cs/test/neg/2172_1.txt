Why do I hate it? Let me give you ways: <br /> <br /> I have nothing against Mary Pickford, but a 32-year-old woman playing at the age of 12 is just stupid. There is a fighting scene in which kids are throwing bricks on each other and it's considered funny --- and it continues for 15 minutes <br /> <br /> Strange as none of children are not even remotely injured <br /> <br /> The cover cards contain a lot of racial and ethnic hair <br /> <br /> For the "family" movie, the fighting was too violent (he loved it when Pickford did it with a little boy! ) and humor was just stupid. > <br /> Seriously, I gave up and turned off for 40 minutes. Cough me, whores, racism and little kids. Also there was no plot I saw. The only thing worth seeing in this movie was William Haines, who was a top man in the silent era. Just painful. Avoid.
