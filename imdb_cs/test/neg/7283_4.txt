HANA-BI has many quiet moments and relatively slow stimulation. Unfortunately, during many thoughtful intermediate observations, the viewer is left to think about the recent scenes he has just watched and the many issues that touch the surface and annoy. For example, why did a wheelchair man drown in the ocean as he stuck in the sand and the tide appeared around him? There was no rescue or no sign. Could it be true that the Japanese police are so awkward and unskilled in arrests that they will not first remove the suspect's ability to reach a weapon? This Japanese police police seemed to have no suspect experience. Why does the right eye of the lead character not blink? With one eye flickering it was distracting and it was inexplicable. What exactly was the main character spending all his money on borrowing so much from shark loans? He didn't see the gambling. Being a non-entry-level government employee his wife must have full health insurance. What was the only person doing alone alone in the middle of nowhere in a natural park? What was the reason he was there? How could gangsters find a lead character and their wife in a remote nature reserve? It made no sense. And again, how the gangsters could later find a leading character and their wife in distant Mt. Resort Fuji? There were no tracks at all available to these gangsters to know the country in which the main character and his wife were, let alone the right concrete position at the right time! And the third question, how can detective detectives know which few tracks of the Japanese seaside line find a leading character and his wife? The Japanese coast must be huge. Should all these characters have psychic powers? Two last questions: Cute girl trying to fly a kite on the beach - Where did she come from? He seemed to have no traffic with her or companions. And why was the world still trying to fly what was left of the kite after it was torn into pieces?! That was weird. It's unintentionally Python-esque. <br /> <br /> I loved background music positively. It was dramatic and fluent and added a lot to this movie. Photos, paintings and art were pleasant to the eye. One last point, the wife was too pleasing to the eye. She never came close to looking like a dying sick person. She looked very healthy. If something like this, these people seemed to be depressed and mentally ill and not physically ill. Her husband and his wife treated him as if he had treated a respected wife with a newlywed man ... with love for friendship, but not with gentle kindness. Definitely mixed movie.
