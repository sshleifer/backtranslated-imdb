"Stick Around" is one of the short series of movies that paired Bobby Ray with Oliver "Babe" Hardy in front of Hardy's immortal team with Stan Laurel. Several critics have suggested that Ray and Hardy - a helpless boy and a great big man - were a prototype for Laurel and Hardy, but that's just not true. Ray and Hardy play well, but they're not really a team; in each of these films, Ray has more shots and is clearly meant to be a hero, while Hardy bullys him in a way very much unlike his later "Ollie" character treatment "Stanley". It is very clear that the relationship between the little Bobby and the great Babe was inspired by older Chaplin movies, in which Little Tramp was bullied by the huge Mack Swain or the hefty Eric Campbell. However in the "Stick Around", Hardy sports bowler hat, which is identical to his later "Ollie" titer (though with a fuller mustache), and he and Bobby - after spending most of this movie as adversaries - end up drunk comrades. Bobby is a paper representative for Matz and Blatz, with his boss Hardy. When the persistent Bobby tries to pretend to appear immediately, there is some clever physical business between the two men that reminds me of the Roscoe Arbuckle and Buster Keaton routines in 'The Garage'. A little later, Bobby Ray, whose short acting career never developed a persona on the screen, performs an "impossible" gag that would be unsuitable for Stan Laurel by pulling out a long ladder from a much smaller set of instruments. The Rangers go to work in the sanatorium and there are the usual unrealistic depictions of mental illness: one resident insists on sitting on toast because they think it's a fried egg! There are also some howlingly racist (and tastelessly unusual) gags involving a black man who willingly lets inmates crack open walnuts on his head. When he sees a lion * image - not even a photograph, you don't mind - it's all cowardly like it's a real wild animal. <br /> <br /> "Stick Around" is pretty awful. Most pantomime and acting are much wider than needed for a slapster comedy; even Hardy, already a very gentle actor until 1925, pong bad with his exaggerated acting performance. There are some bad examples of shooting. I was impressed by one unusual camera setting when the face of a fat pedestrian is dirty and we see a detail of his reflection in the mirror rather than his real face. <br /> SPOILERS COMING. During their short mating, Hardy typically played Ray's boss or adversary or both; here, once, he ends up being friends. It's a nice end, but it doesn't replace what's really a bad movie. My rating for this is only 4 out of 10.
