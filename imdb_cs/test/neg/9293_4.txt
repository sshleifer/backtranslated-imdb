East Germany's ex-informant ends up in Mexico as a student group spy in 1971, where he falls in love with one of the activists. This is Mexico's first co-production with Germany, and although it is a good image of the ideals that marked and continued to mark (at least CGH), youth, so much ends that there is something wrong because the inner dilemmas face dark brown (Noeth) as the passion of his ideals, which Adela feels (Campomanes) as soon as they see, in the case of him I suppose, a barrier of language; and in the case of her lack of experience. The reason why there is no concrete identification with any of them, which causes what might be a movie that even served as a Red Dawn documentary, ended up being one film; Although I want to make it clear that many assistants in the room were excited to talk to a director who told me they were no longer young or that my ideals had changed.
