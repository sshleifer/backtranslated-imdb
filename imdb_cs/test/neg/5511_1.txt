I'm trying to remember the title of this movie for years (not of course). I saw it at the local dollar theater when I was 11, and it was so terrible that I almost left; I think I didn't realize it was possible to leave before the movie was over. By the way, in my mind, it's just the same as the worst movie I've seen growing up. Finally, I can give him the ratings he deserves. <br /> <br /> 1/10 (that was oddly satisfying)
