I don't see why he loves this movie so much. It is true that it has good intentions and meaning, but you cannot compensate for such a bad scenario. Woody Allen is a great filmmaker, but I'm afraid it's just a piece of waste. It's very predictable and the subject is too visible. I happen to be a huge Woody Allan fan and I love most of his work, but I can't recommend it.
