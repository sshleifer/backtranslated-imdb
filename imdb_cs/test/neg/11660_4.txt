Like most musicals of that time, you need to check the reality at the door. The 1938 Broadway MELODY is not believable or credible, but a kind of fun in its strange way. This film is really just an excuse to perform star talents. Some scenes just happen to be in a review, not a movie-directed plot. Judy Garland shines and it is a pity she has so little to do if there is not much left on the room floor. One of the most dangerous events is the way Eleanor Powell plays the lead role in the Broadway show, and Robert Taylor says it will be work, work, work from dawn to dusk. There are several scenes and there is no work, no rehearsals ... Nothing. He needs money to win a horse at auction. He has no money. Not paid when trying? Taylor has to borrow money to help. He should be a great producer of time. Nemá peníze ??? By the way, this is just two elements in this strange story. <br /> <br /> The music numbers are quite gorgeous that saves it from being total loss. The Broadway MELODY OF 1940 is much better than the Broadway MELODY OF 1936.
