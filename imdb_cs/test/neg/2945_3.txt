TWINS EFFECT is a bad movie in many ways. The only good element is that he doesn't take himself seriously. Other than that, it's not really a movie, but rather a merchandising tool for two movie stars, popular pop idols in their native Hong Kong. The film itself is poorly constructed and acted. Leadership will offer some silly martial arts, which is strange because the action director (and allegedly the director) is Donnie Yen. Like many Hong Kong films targeting a teenage audience, the main "actors" fanbase, such as twins (two girls playing in this movie) and Ekin Cheng, there is so much bad music to help viewers believe certain scenes. funny, clever, etc. <br /> <br /> Final conclusion: It's all for nothing. Even as a fan of Hong Kong films, this is a poor film. It's not funny enough, it's not serious enough, and generally too fake chewing gum for your own good. <br /> <br /> 3 of 10. <br /> <br /> (Go to http: // www. nixflix.com for a more detailed review of this movie and other foreign movies)
