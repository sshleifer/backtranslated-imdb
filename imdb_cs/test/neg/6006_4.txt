This film was really poor. I went to the theater and waited for something exciting, and instead I had the opportunity to refine my "guessing another plot before it happens". Seriously, the plot was written with an extra strong crayon so everyone could see it. Nothing was really shocking. In fact, even gore encountered such a complete suspension of belief that it really didn't add up too much. Excessive wise cracking and cops at the crime scene seem to be all more fake. And the scene where Lambert's character struggles with the clues and reaches his "investigative epiphany" goes to a large extent to indicate the level of intellect expected from the audience - little. Probably the worst aspect of cinematography was the "X-Files" treatment: Every building in the film, whether it is a building in a building or a house at noon or hospital, suffers from a lack of any recognizable lighting (not to mention the lack of patients ) in the case of a hospital). I don't remember one scene when someone switched the light switch. Surely it would be nice. Mr Lambert is not really an Oscar actor, so I suppose you have to take this film for what it is worth. Finally, I came to the conclusion that the only thing that would make this movie more fun is to watch it after watching "The Warriors". Otherwise, you have left an effort that is boring and unoriginal, and nowhere near genre films such as "The Silence of the Lambs".
