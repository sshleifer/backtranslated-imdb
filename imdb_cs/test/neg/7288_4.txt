The main criticism of the film is animation. I totally agree with all the others that it was very bad. Some characters seemed to have darker skin tones than they were in the first movie, which is much better. Also, the background colors looked hasty and somewhat static. It is also a pity that Michael J. Fox did not say Milo, did such a good job, and James Arnold Taylor was not sure whether he should sound like Milo or Aladdin. I also took into account the lack of a good story. the third story was confusing and clumsy, and the second story suffered from bad scripting. To make it worse, the first thing I don't remember, other than the fishing village that is being pursued or something like that. However, there was some nice music, and good voice talent from John Mahoney, Cree Summer, Clancy Brown and Tom Wilson, who saved the film from total disaster. All in all, the unsatisfactory continuation of a surprisingly good film. Bethany Cox.
