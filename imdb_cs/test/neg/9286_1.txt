It's the only nicest thing I've ever watched. It is sad how he tries to come up with a good joke and makes only a curse and thinks that his disgusting vulgarity is funny. He's the worst person I've ever seen. Throughout his actions, he tries to show how much he does not care, showing just how annoyed critics and people with a sense of humor who would rather go through immense torture before watching his "show". There are good comics, they're bad and terrible. But this guy is in his own league. I'm sorry for him and even more for people who consider him funny.
