Ewww! Disney sequel that is waste! Who would have thought that? Actually quite a bit, judging by comments, and not bad. Actually, I was looking forward to seeing this horrible film based on my original ideas. And that's where Disney's "cash-in" mentality is. Throw away all the old junk on the back of success and people will go for it. Don't think they're so cynical? Ask yourself, then .... How many Disney movies have a sequel? And then .... How many of those sequels are developing? Significantly lower number. Kronk's New Groove is just another example. The plot is ridiculously simplistic and extravagant. Even more annoying was the increased number of items and scenes "out of place" - for example, old people at home and God banned the Aztec version of Scouts! Worse still, the Chronic leader, Chippamunk, has an absolutely stunning English accent without any reason. An accent that has been intensely grated on nerves after a very short time. There are a few good things. The animation is very nice and the voice talent is doing well with the dialogue it offers - especially Warburton in the lead role. But besides, it's really nothing to recommend. Sure, young children may like it, but there is little that amuses mum and dad while sitting in this torturing torture of the original concept. <br /> <br /> Avoid this monstrosity with the same zeal you would use to avoid a package of tempting male lions.
