Storyline: Four people are caught in the elevator. One of them is a business man, an annoying species that is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone, and is a demonstration of distilled stress and hostility. Then there is his colleague, a woman who is in her nature much more pleasant. A teenage rebel who just broke into a coking machine and his mere presence drives the entrepreneur crazy, and the older man who just stole 100,000 DM makes the rest of the cast ... <br /> <br /> The film is all about how they cope with their problem because time goes on and without success in reaching the outside world as the lights go out, and how the cables start snapping one by one .... And yet it's not very exciting. Characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how many things could be so bad in one elevator?). You don't like the characters, only one of them hates. And all the plot twists and turns do not add to the excitement, they are just silly excuses for filling up with a few more minutes of dialogue, because the writers are not inspired and have no ink on the feature film in the elevator. <br /> <br /> Hopefully "phone booth" will be easier ...
