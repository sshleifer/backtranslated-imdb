Not surprisingly, it was free with Mail on Sunday, slow running, bad dealings and filming (camera flare, near the start of the movie, not even artistic) = Straight to the video, but not in this case, why not fix some of yours (cost of producing a movie) releasing free with a British Sunday newspaper, at least in this way you get a captured viewer and get back some costs. This movie I did not give 1 out of 10, thanks to trying to pull some old actors out of their shell, it was nice to see some old faces (Vanessa Redgrave, it's not Blow Up), but Vinnie Jones as the leader and I think he was better at Gone in 60 seconds when he didn't talk. This movie is dropping every day in the rating, I think it will be right for 3-4 out of 10, very close to Future
