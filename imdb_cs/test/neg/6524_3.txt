Loving andersian fairy tails as a kid, and recently I saw some interesting documents about this strange, though brilliant author, I was eager to see this movie made for television. Unfortunately, experience was nothing but disappointment that left me in anger and confusion. First, the story / scenario is filled with inaccuracies and downright fantasies, thus creating an almost completely new story while shamefully abusing Andersen's fairy tales, probably to sell bullshit to babies like me. Secondly, a handsome boy actor (really ... when did he see the picture of the real Andersen?) Kieran Brew manages to portray Hans Christian rather mentally retarded than the brilliant, though very disturbed, character he really was. Although Brew is annoying and irritating as Andersen, it lacks the necessary charisma to create any feelings of compassion that is still present. Third. A love story between Andersen and fictional Jetta (in fact it should be Henriette, wife of Edvard Collin) ... Why? This man lived such an interesting life, should be enough as a basis for a great movie! <br /> <br /> I could continue to be a very long list, but I feel safe to recommend you all spend your time and money on something else.
