One of the last surviving horror giants - Conrad Radzoff - dies and has his body in a mausoleum with snippets of television before the death of the great Conrad, who greets you while visiting. Unfortunately, for him and his captors, Conrad's body is "borrowed" by a gang of four boys and three girls and taken to a huge mansion where they drink with him, roast him, dance with him, laugh at him and at him, and then let him go a bed in a coffin that just happens to lie in the room upstairs. The missing body reports to Radzoff's widow and her girlfriend (who becomes proficient in black art) and holds a kind of ceremony that brings Conrad back to life so that he can get his eye in his own words. eye, tooth for tooth. "Well, Frightmare is an interesting" bad "movie. Sure, it's cheap. The sets look as if they were borrowed (which I am sure they were.) Special effects and blood and intestines are made liberal and with little credibility. under average with a few exceptions Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator of Fame is in tow, but he really does little in this somewhat ungrateful role as a horror-obsessed teen who needs to steal a dead man's body for kicks. Nita Talbot plays a "friend" of Radzoff with overwhelming interest. Also, look at the big - I mean big - guy who plays a policeman. That's Porky himself from Porkys fame. Ferdy Mayne, who overlooked an actor from Germany who had Christopher Lee and made a star as a vampire in The Fearless Vampire Killers, does more than laudable work as an icon of aging horror in public life and a real human demon in private life Conrad Radzoff in a bad human being in life, living just for his own pleasure and we see him kill twice before he is still dead (apparently none of the rocking teens) at this point). Mayne is able to look very regular, speak very elegantly and communicate with ease. If for another reason you should see Frightmare for his performance. I do; however, believe that when they showed black and white clips of Radzoff, they used Christopher Lee footage (anyone has any thoughts?). Anyway, it is possible to guess what happens, and indeed: Radzoff goes out and goes to the children who have disturbed his peace. Again, the formula is banal and overused. The activity is largely anemic and the direction oh so ridiculous. But Mayne gives good performance in a sea of ​​incompetence. Definitely worth a little look. Watching Mayne appear on the screens in her mausoleum always brought a wise smile to her lips.
