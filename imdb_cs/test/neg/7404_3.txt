I was hoping it would be the Das Boota caliber and the echo of the extraordinary realism created by the acclaimed German director Leni RiefenStahl in his documentaries, unfortunately I was monumentally disappointed. The story is unlikely and defies credibility. The RAF is shot down and somehow gets to the hospital in Dresden. Anna a nurse whose father runs a hospital and intends to get involved with a doctor with whom she falls in love with an airplane and loves herself. The next night at a spectacular engagement, the aircraft appears camouflaged as a German officer and dances with Anna. Even though it is well directed and acting, it is the lowest order soap opera.
