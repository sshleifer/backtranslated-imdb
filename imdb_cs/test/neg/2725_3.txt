Vindicator opens with a memorable cage-like scene that attacks a torn little toy robot as part of a scientific experiment. The accidental violence that happened to me sold it to me, and I am glad that the rest of Vindicator provided a real feast of cheese. Vindicator is about a scientist (David McIlwraith) who is almost killed by an explosion in his lab, whose torn remains are stored in an experimental suit / armor. For some incomprehensible reason, he is equipped with a Rage Response Activator, a device connected to his brain that turns him into murder when he comes into physical contact with another person. They give some silly explanation of how necessary this defense mechanism is, but I don't see the logic of installing such a device if you didn't want a furious cyborg killing machine. This is especially ridiculous when it is stated that Carl's suit is wearing an experimental suit. What might be the need for an astronaut to turn into an incredible hull on a mission? Predictably, she breaks out of the lab and continues to fight the devious scientists who put him in a suit, along with the ninja assassin Hunter playing Pam Grier (No, really). Vindicator itself looks pretty damn goofy. It's basically a dude in a gold foil suit. He also has a perpetually confused look in his eyes that does not lead to fear or compassion. I don't think you can blame him for it, most people watching the movie will have the same look on their faces. Playing is really bad, driven, 'I'm not sure what emotion characters or thoughts are, this point will take my punt and crush my dialogue with a random tone of voice while I don't watch acting school. The actor playing the funky black scientist even struggles with this last part. After this initial accident, Vindicator died as a scientist. Oddly enough, the whole Rage Response Activator 'touch me and I'll kill you' thing doesn't play as big a role as one would expect Carl to be after his former colleges in a reasonably separate way. There was one scene where he was more brutally killing some street punk who pushed him around. I know it's de rigueur for street gangs accidentally attacking leading figures in the 1980s movies, but surely one of them had to realize that it might be a bad idea to attack a massive cyborg guy, even though he looks like a retarded cousin of C3PO. It does not seem to be surprised that a broken golden cyborg would appear along the street as if it were a daily occurrence. The only other time this rage activator comes in is when old Carl can't give his wife a hug. When Hunter tries to turn it against him by throwing it into him so he will be forced to kill her, he reminds himself that he has reprogrammed himself (naturally on the screen), so it won't happen. They could miss the whole Rage Response Activator thing and just walk away with a revenge story and that wouldn't mean a huge difference in the movie. <br /> <br /> Grier is a fun sequence in the channels and her friends are watching the Vindicator. With their armored skin, they are all armed with weapons that burn "vaporized acid." For some bizarre reason these guns are firing, red lines are drawn on the screen, spreading toward their targets. Vindicator struggles by pulling a gas pipe out of the wall and burning all Grier gorans in a huge strip of flame that comes out. The resulting fireball is so vast and powerful that it comes out of the manhole from a man's hole and throws several scientists into the car. Surprisingly, Grier escapes by plunging into deep water, even though it is closest to Vindicator. This is one of several fake fire blasts throughout the film, including the funky black scientist's death when vindicator sends his reef supply. (This is after they have captured the Vindicator by grabbing it in a huge piece of gel, seriously). There is also one disturbing and long and out of place order in which Carl is a treacherous overweight friend who looks like a poor man is Ned Beatty, reveals his infatuation with Carlo's wife and tries to rape her. It continues for about 5-10 minutes and is full of disturbing shots of a guy who clutches over the woman's face, crouching on her and trying to pull her clothes off. This is icky to say at least and seems to be really from the morning with most of the rest of the movie, which is a kind of cartoonish and bigger than life in its violence. The film finals include Vindicator fights a whole host of other dudes in battle suits. For whatever reason, all these other crooks are less kick-ass than Carl, some of them being sent by their wife simply by having a protruding tube in their side ripped. Fortunately for Carla, the suit he wears is missing this crucial mistake. The only really unforgettable part to end is the death of Grier. Doing something I've never seen a nerd do in a movie before, in the midst of her confrontation with Vindicator she decides she doesn't really stand a chance against him and in the rather factual fact of blowing her own brain out with her gun.
