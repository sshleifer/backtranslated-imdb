Thanks to this film, I officially vomited in my mouth. <br /> <br /> I was expecting the absolute worst with this movie, but I expected it to be the most enjoyable one. This is just awful. Absolutely terrible. Terrible as the Nazis spread the Black Plague. Let me explain: Ewoks speak English. It's scary. The little girl seems to have traveled from the future Power Rangers series. I really want her to get off the ground and say, "Finally! After ten thousand years I'm free! It's time to conquer Earth!" Dull ... Um, I think the big evil is what the hell is ... they growl a lot. Many of them look like even more lazy versions of the crypt. Cryptkeeper was pretty cool, but these guys weren't. The only credit for this film was Paul Gleason. This movie could be better if he went to the bad guys and said, "If I had to come back here, I was a cracked skull." It would be even better if one of the Ewoks played Judd Nelson, who spoke his words when he said it. Also, that fast creation is nice. Word to it. However, no word for the movie, though. I want to give this movie two. I want it so bad. There is a passage I remembered: The path of this film is plagued by the inequalities of fright and the tyranny of horrifying horror on all sides. Blessed is nothing, blowing for this film.
