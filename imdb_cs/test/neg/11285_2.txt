As someone who loves baseball history, especially at the beginning of the 20th century, in which Cobb was the main character, along with a ton of colorful characters, I was looking forward to seeing this baseball film. It wasn't a baseball film that was disappointing. No, it was just an athlete's account that I was with Cobb in later years, while the two worked on the book. Even in this, it could be a much more appealing movie than they did. Granted to Cobb was something other than a nice guy, an extremely talented player, but brutal to do anything to defeat you. ... and was viscous, intimidating, and had a lot of demons to fight. He was so hated by his own teammates tried to resist his chances of winning the batting title one year. However, this over-the-top depiction of a man. He makes him almost like a cartoon. Watching and listening to old man rant, rave and profane for two hours is fun? No it is not. One day I would like to see a real biography of Cobb that would show him in his days of play, and if they wanted to portray him as an evil man, be it, but the way they did it with a bitter, blasphemous old one. man making his ass alone before a reporter is not fun to watch.
