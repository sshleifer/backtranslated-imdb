His significant charisma and commanding presence are about everything that keeps this over water, but Fred Williamson has done much better urban action movies, including many of his later, vid-freed fare. Williamson's films of major studies from early to mid-1970s seldom had a blow to their Central European counterparts, which is a great example. Clumsy action, small violence and PG assessment are far from questionable. It's worth a look at Hammer completists in any case.
