Multi-millionaire marries a female doctor. He did not work in the day and devotes himself to his profession. She sees her every day. He has to give something. Our hero, Henry Fonda, finally decides to do something about his life. He becomes a merchant in a department store, but is soon fired because poorer people need work. Meanwhile, Dr. Helen Hunt (Barbara Stanwyck) gave up her practice? What is he supposed to do? Kirk (Fonda) buys a failed hospital and the two will now be happy to help others while they remain alive. <br /> <br /> What's this writing here? When angry with her husband, Dr. Hunt says, "You acted like a Gestapo." It's supposed to be a comedy. Hogwash. Very boring, boring movie. Very little here.
