First, the title "DAILY" is LIE. <br /> <br /> Each "Daily Show" program opens with a visual image of the date it was created, followed by a pause and opening announcement. For many days, when RE-RUNNING daily shows, they slip on tape and OMIT date and begin by announcing the false impression that the show is new. That's a lie. There is no mention that it is a rebroadcast. And this kind of crap is just a small indicator of how tricky and deceptive this show is. Furthermore, it is only 4 nights a week. This is not entirely "daily" - which is Monday to Friday - another drawback, but I'm grateful for that. It is sad to think that many clueless young people use this fake news program as their main, often just news source. This gives them a pitifully ignorant and much worse - misinformed. Although politically that liberal left, this show can be fun at times. But his truth is low. Facts and information are often cleverly twisted to fit into the writers' agenda. It is often difficult to tell where facts go and start writing fiction and comedy. The result is pre-spent, reinterpreted information for belief and influence. This is called "PROPAGANDA". Long-distance talks are heavily wobbled in adjustments. It's really losing me when it's bashes to God and Christians - which makes it too often. But you never hear anything vaguely anti-Semitic. If Jon Stewart and the company attacked someone other than Christians, it would be considered offensive. Names in credits explain the source.
