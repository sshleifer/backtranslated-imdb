I saw only the first part of this conclusion and concluded that I wouldn't miss anything if I didn't look at the second episode. Cinematography was fine, but contrary to it, the storyline was just as common and run-of-the-mill as any other war story. Actors and actresses play their characters without any passion and make-up is really bad (Heiner Lauterbach with white hair and Kai Wiesinger as if some colored white hair could give them more dignity and common sense). I mean, if you've watched more than two or three World War II movies (as most of us have), then you would only get to see the third or fourth movie problems if it promises some new insights or twists. However, it seems that Roland Suso Richter is afraid of it, you can almost feel his fear of not living in accordance with the bourgeois and seeming expectations of the conservative TV channel ZDF while watching this film. Millions of euros have been spent on keeping boring and unimaginable German filmmaking. These millions of dollars could be spent on creating three or four independent films, but no, let's say some director who makes a movie telling people that war can be explained by rational means. My advice: Instead, read Joseph Heller or Kurt Vonnegut. They will tell you what the war is! Or give me one million euros and make a better film than this BS load! And another thing: Why is it that German films will only be nominated for Oscars when the film deals with World War II or the Holocaust? Probably because it's the only thing German filmmaking is good at. And that should make us think, right?
