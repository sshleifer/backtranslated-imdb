"Tart" is a pathetic filming attempt that travels around and among a bunch of teenage Manhattan who are exploring all the usual things for a teenager ... sex, drugs and classical music almost entirely without story, focus or purpose. Griffith is in the movie for about 2 minutes, while Swain obediently works her way through the others in her long list of fast dog movements. Nothing in these movies works, and Wayne should consider getting real work. Not recommended to anyone. PU! Ugh! (D)
