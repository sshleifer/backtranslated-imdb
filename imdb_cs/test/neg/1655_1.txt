This is one of the worst pieces of cinema I've ever seen. This is also my first review so you can say I have to hate this movie for a lot. Don't get me wrong, I love my serious movies. I don't like Hollywood very much, I tend to like French, Italian, offensive USA or anything that tries to communicate something meaningful. But it was terrible. Why? 1. The storyline (such as it was) was absolutely incredible, though the director seems to be hiding everything from realism. <br /> <br /> 2. The main character recommends nothing to him. Does he smoke for cold or does he show us his anxiety? For the sake of good, this person is designated as a former mafia lawyer. Would we care more because it is also one of the most hostile people you have ever met? And he smokes ... so he must have deep personal problems. Pop psychology is the best. In the last moments, I was almost pleased to be buried in cement. Best place for him. And I thought it was the only good scene. Or maybe it was so close to closing credits. 3. Tired and incredible interest in the main character of the beautiful girl. She was there simply because beautiful girls always have special sexual relationships with old, old men with a deep and meaningful personality (as shown by smoking). It's happening all the time. In really bad movies that are. 4. The tempo was so lead. I like it slowly, I like caution. But it was only deadly. 5-50 bunch of other things that I really can't bother to write about. Awful.
