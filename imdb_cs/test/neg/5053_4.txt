I did it in about half of this movie, and at that moment I realized I didn't mind how it ended. It's basically a faint teenage comedy I just watched because I like Helen Mirren, who is actually very good as an incredibly cruel teacher. The basic idea of ​​a movie (or let's say the first half) of a movie because I don't know - or care - the other half goes) was done earlier, especially at 9 to 5, and the comparison between the two shows how thoroughly Tingle gets sick. You have to feel that things are out of control in a way that makes you feel that events are inevitable, and you need well-defined, interesting characters that matter to you, and you don't. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it never grabbed me for a second.
