If you and your friends find out as much humor and enjoyment as horrible acting, jokes, props, and overall movie creation like me and my friends, you have to rent it. <br /> <br /> From the simple reading of the tag line and seeing it as not funny, you should assume more than funny, poor quality, great, hilarious content over out. It is the story of some children who resist all the laws of physics and reality and fly back in time through a modern television screen with a big screen into the world of dinosaurs who eventually become their friends. Not to mention the cheerful scene where T-Rex becomes the paternal figure of one of the children. Yeah ... <br /> <br /> It should be in the comedy section, but you'll find it's with the guys if you ever find it. So call your friends, sit down, relax, get ready to laugh and enjoy. You will quote immensely horrible one inserts in this movie for weeks. "What's with the ruus?!"
