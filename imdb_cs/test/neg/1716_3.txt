It is definitely a direct video, but the story is not as bad as most other reviewers think. I really like the hero doing the wrong thing most of the time. The heroes' reactions and rebel reactions are just human. Hopper's character actually plays God. That could be the right thing, but you don't like it anyway. Finally, a god player is sentenced to death and a hero who lives his own life can live. Pretty morale. :-) <br /> <br /> The most realistic thing I've seen is that the country is doing so well that no moon stabilizes its rotation.
