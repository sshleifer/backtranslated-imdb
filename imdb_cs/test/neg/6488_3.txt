This film is about a group of women (perhaps not the highest reputation) who are heading for a small fort to take over the recently leaving uncle of the property, where they plan to set up a shop. When you arrive in the nearby town, there is no one (even if it is only 15 miles away) so they walk. When they get there, they find that there are no soldiers, but enough people to take over the fort and build a small town around. He soon discovers that something isn't here and Fort McMillan (Ft. Doom, as the locals call it) is in some serious trouble. Instead of going into the plot, I'll make some remarks about the things I've noticed about the movie. First of all, acting is very flat, few people seem real enough to believe. But my first was a bad act, but in the end I watched some of the outtakes and the same people came to life. So my only thought is that the director wanted it. In addition to bad behavior, I have a big problem where people do not respond properly to a given set of circumstances. Consider, for example, no one would take them to Ft McMillan at any cost, even if it is only 15 miles away. However, when we reach the fortress, we find that it is well maintained by a decent population of people, all of whom have to get supplies from some, not to mention the post office, etc. It is to take place in 1867, but we can see the railway car has electric lights (they are not at least ) and the locomotive engine, which is at least 30 years later, not one of the general style locomotives so popular at the time. There are also places where you can see a paved blacktop, (and maybe a car in one place, didn't want to bother to go back and look) and other anachronistic items. If they followed the rules of the "world" they did and let the actors become actors, maybe they would get me 4 instead of 2, which I gave, and rewrite it about 4 times more than it could do any better.
