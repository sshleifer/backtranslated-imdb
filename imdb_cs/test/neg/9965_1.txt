This must be the most horrible piece of film I've ever watched. This makes Mel Brooks films Oscar-worthy comparisons. Jim VanBebber has to be publicly lamented for trying to pass it on as any form of entertainment. While some may say that this film is true to the low budget genre of such classics as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Night of the Living Dead", the value of production is not in doubt. It is VanBebber's ability to cast and present a credible storyline. Casting is pitiful. For the role of Charlie, he had to choose the first actor he saw with a beard and long hair. It doesn't matter that the actor's hair came halfway through his back, (Manson never walked around his shoulders) this actor spoke terribly monotonous without being a fraction of the person Steve Railsback or even Jeremy Davies lent to Manson's portraits. . The actor elected to play "Tex" Watson had curly blond hair instead of straight dark hair, the fact that anyone who showed even the farthest interest in the case of Manson knows. He looks like a Minnesota Farmer on a "Little House on the Prairie" Actress starring Susan Atkins's ass wider than Oprah's, while those familiar with family members know that "Clem" was considered somewhat retarded, the actor portraying him did so in such a campsite, Chaplinesque the way it was like watching the old act of vavevile. She looked like a beautiful pregnant woman instead of Sharon Tate, and the actress looked like a bloated, alcoholic trailer. VanBebber accelerates filming in some places for artistic effect, but this technique has not been proven remotely useful since "The Munsters". The final credits show all the familiar family members we have never introduced into most of them, and the ones we're introduced to are not sure who they are. The facts are also destroyed in this movie. "Lotsapoppa" did not die in real life, Steven Parent was shot four times, not twice, Abagail Folger had no throat where Mary Brunner and Bruce Davis were during the Himnan murder? Patricia Krenwinkel never studied hairstyle "Dorothy Hamill". The most confused aspect of this movie is what modern day "madmen" had to do with this movie? Why was the girl wearing a rubber mask with a dildo attached? What was their problem with a journalist? What was the purpose or purpose of the last confrontation? Why were the periods included? The viewer never knows! Holy mackerel, I could go on and on, but the space is preventing it. Do not try to eat popcorn during this waste because your hand will be too busy scratching your head while you repeatedly say "What does it f ---?"
