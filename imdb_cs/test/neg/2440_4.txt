Justine can't find a perfect friend to become perfect for the first time. With a geek friend in the ball, she enters the virtual machine to improve her appearance. When they see the opportunity to create their perfect man, they explode and the results are left to your imagination. The problem is how many apparent sex jokes are left? How predictable can they get these movies? A few funny moments here and there, but not much blatant or other than jokes in other movies or even a normal life. If you like WEIRD SCIENCE or "fish from water" jokes combined with a "gender identity crisis", then you can enjoy these 90 minutes.
