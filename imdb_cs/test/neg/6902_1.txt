I can't find any redeeming value in this movie. It appears to be loosely based on the Lion King School of Thinking. The father is killed, the son cannot fill the shoes and tries to escape, etc. Etc. The only difference (except for being in the barnyard instead of the jungle) is that Barnyard is trying to "revive things" with the club. -type music. He walks over the top and tries to be cool. The problem is, it's really not cool. It's like "this guy". Everyone knows at least one of those "guys" who are older and still hanging with a younger crowd in a futile attempt to keep up with youth. They're trying to be cool to fit, but they really aren't. This is the movie. But hey, if you have the money to burn, and you feel you would pay someone who leaves you for 90 minutes of life, don't let me stop.
