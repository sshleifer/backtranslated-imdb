And you know why? Because they thought (or at least did horror fans think that) that a lot of unpleasant, outrageous, screaming teenagers, stupid demons (where they come from? What's their purpose? Who knows?) And the dark mansion are all you have to do horror. Needless to say, they were wrong. You also need a script, some logic, some rules, and some invention. This movie has one scene that lives up to its reputation (of course lipstick), and a few fun moments (a description of his mother's brother, cookies, Linne Quigley "don't look at me"). It also has more profanity than any movie I've been watching since I last saw "Reservoir Dogs". Literally every fourth or fifth word is "f ***" or "b ****". Then, when the film starts in the first five minutes with four false fears, you know you don't expect anything to resemble good filmmaking. (* 1/2)
