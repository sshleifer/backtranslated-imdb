I've been watching "Fuckland" for a long time. I lied if I said I remember it in detail; What I remember most is the irritation that provoked me, and the sense of complete waste of precious money and time, not just my time and money invested in watching the movie, but the director. Probably "Fuckland" is a critic of Argentines who present us (I am also Argentine) as small people who praise and even boast small, ridiculous victories and believe that we are the best thing God (which is also Argentine). I'm not going to say that. It is probably a true statement about a relatively large part of the population (by the way, the part I despise). And while it wasn't true, it's not my opinion. The worst sin of "Fuckland" was to express such a statement about his own director. The constant impression I received was that the director was too busy trying to impress us as the camera sneaks over the islands, taking care of a good (even average) movie. Many shots with a hidden camera are useless. The director decides to show off with a silly release of old war matters and his own. And there is no plot at all. In addition, this film proudly presents Dogme's certificate before the opening titles, only to disregard its principles afterwards (for example, by including the director in credits - another sign of his pride?). <br /> <br /> I found a film offensive, not as an Argentine but as a guardian. I felt underestimated. "Fuckland" is just one of the worst movies I've ever seen.
