The first half of this movie was pretty good. It was interesting and exciting. The other half was pretty bad. The comic book revenge story has come true and we see a lot of comic Nazi characters and some bad "good guys" who blew them away. There is a lot of violence in this movie. I am not indignant about violence, but I think he should have some purpose in the film. There was little purpose for violence, except to create a genre film where we see a lot of people meeting rifles. We should definitely have fun. I recently watched Reservoir Dogs. There was a film where violence was employed effectively. The film was realistic in the world that made the film. There was never any sound effect. It was a crime movie that played it straight. Unpleasant Basterds should play straight, but not. I moved my eyes over how the violence was exaggerated by the sound effects and other bullets in the head and face. Just Nazi Hunters. In fact, we don't like either of them because they're too busy cutting scalps and shooting people in the face. It's all about "revenge" and very little else. There were 2/2 hours working with here, but few of Basterds were really explored in depth. It seems that it was simply revenge pure and simple. We saw it in Tarantino's latest movie, "Death Proof", which I didn't care about. He suffered the same problems. The characters were almost interchangeable. The first half was good again. I wanted to see how tricky shepherds were used all over Europe. I was presented with a much more frivolous film about the resistance movement, which depicts vengeance against some of the Nazi comics when they all go to one film premiere in France.
