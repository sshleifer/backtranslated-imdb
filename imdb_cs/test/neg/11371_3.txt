While not as bad as some movies (like the terrible "Atomic Twister"), "fusion" still relies on common misconceptions and inaccuracies about the nuclear energy industry to cede its plot. I am currently studying nuclear engineering for a Master's degree and it has been easy to point out the shortcomings that would be obvious to anyone involved in the industry. Riding on the false fear that a Chernobyl-style collapse could happen in an American race, the film states that any collapse (even partial, according to one of the guest commentators in the film) would be a disaster for this region. In fact, a partial collapse in an American factory that would destroy the core would not pose any risk to the surrounding area. Three Mile Island have experienced a partial breakdown and no radioactive material has ever been released into the environment due to the inherent stability of the fuel and core construction used in this country paired with substantial constraints. The security steps in the movie were perhaps part of the film furthest from the truth. In every important strategic location - be it a power plant, a chemical plant, a military base, whatever - you'll never see staff responding to an alarm by talking about how unannounced exercise would be. This is especially true in a nuclear power plant, where the reactors would be immediately SCRAMed and turned off after the alarm. SCRAMing can be done by pressing a button in the control room (you do not need to put the core in "shutdown mode" as shown in the movie), and the fission chemistry prevents the core from being undone. power up to about 9 hours from SCRAM. Therefore, if this scenario took place in real life, the attackers could not cause a significant breakdown. Theoretically, they could still cause partial residual heat if they immediately revealed the core, but that would be almost impossible due to the numerous backup systems available at the plant - there is much more than the only back-up pumps they talk about. in the movie. <br /> <br /> As for the spent fuel pools, it is possible that the pools will turn into a dirty bomb by blowing them up, but it is much more difficult than simply parking a truck full of explosives near pools. Fuel is below (approximately) 18 feet of highly purified water. Water cannot become radioactive (no radioactive vapor being spoken of in the film). Particles dissolved in water can, but water alone cannot; the reason for the very thorough cleaning. The only way to turn a fuel tank into a dirty bomb is to get the fuel out of the water. This is not an easy task because the water is very heavy and the pools are underground with very thick concrete walls. Explosives would have to be in the pool under the fuel (which is securely fixed). And it would have to be a hell of a lot of explosives, because the water is very difficult to move. Even if this were to occur, the spent fuel is not extremely radioactive, and the explosion would not cause nearly the same high number of casualties as mentioned in the film, especially given the small amount of radioactive material that would be spread. From a basic film perspective, I got somewhat tired of the style used. The constant fading and departure, the use of bold black and white and fast tracking and panning looked amateurish. The characters were one-dimensional, especially those in the US government. I have some problems with the twist thrown in the movie but will not discuss how it would be the main spoiler. <br /> <br /> Overall 3/10
