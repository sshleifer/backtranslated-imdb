Evil is about a big house where a bad spirit is silly unleashed to torture inside. How was the movie! There's no one scary scene. Not one! Richard Crenna has no role. There are several animated spirits, a disfigured powerful saw, and a rape of ghosts. After almost nothing happens for almost the whole movie Evil gets the embodiment ... Victor Buono. Great! Where the makers thought Buono was scary. Looks like he was on the ass for a guest who played a paycheck to pay his alcohol bill. In the meantime, it's too late to turn it off because the damn thing's over. I felt I was throwing a videotape out of the window. Avoid this waste! Hopefully he will never see the DVD light and disappear into the dark.
