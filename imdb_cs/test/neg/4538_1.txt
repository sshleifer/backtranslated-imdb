That was a horrible short film that was trying to be funny in a dark way, but it wasn't funny at all. Speak at the Chicago Film Festival. It's actually what the title says, and I wasn't at all. Bad storytelling was what it was doing. If you typed it again and re-shot, then it could "work". This attempt fell into a "hole". Terrible filming.
