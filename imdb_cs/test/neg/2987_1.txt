I have no idea how high it is rated (5.8 at the time of writing), but this film was absolutely terrible. Behavior was not completely wrong, but it had no meaning at all and the overall quality was bad. It's probably movie B (or C if such a thing exists) and it looks like it was made over the weekend in a friend's house or something. Im all for low budget movies and i am generally watching all i came across but this is really bad. I mean "Fanglys" bad. I don't know what else to say, but trust in how I really sat through this horrible horrible movie and can save you effort ... Don't bother. Seriously ... Just not.
