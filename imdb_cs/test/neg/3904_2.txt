After losing 2 hours of my life watching this movie on late night television, I came back and read some IMDb to remind myself why I watched it first. In retrospect, the only thing I think is that the genre generally appeals to me. But this film was a waste of effort. It fails on every level and see that it is described on IMDb as comedy really leaves me to lose. I don't remember more than a few laughs. There is more laughter in any episode of law and order than in the last man. Seriously. Too much interaction with the characters does not seem to have any basis, so it was very unlikely / incredible. <br /> <br /> If it weren't for almost gratuitous bikini shots, well, what can I say? Avoid this movie as a plague. Or tape and just fast forward on bikini shots. Don't Spend $ 1 to Hire Though.
