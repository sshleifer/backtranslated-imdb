This is a fairly watchable movie (+1). After watching the UKM: Ultimate Killing Machine, this looks good in comparison. There are no obvious technical gaffs, even though vampire teeth look weird. The story doesn't make sense. See you. American GI fights vampires. He returns to the states and is rehabilitated to see ... Vampires. His commanding officer is his aunt's aunt's aunt. Who happens to do some research on South American biodiversity where vampires are. Huh! Don't touch too many coincidences. Who cares for the vampire's head? Or, his daughter? Or, someone in this movie? The only originality in this is that most of the myths about vampires (allergic to crosses and garlic, can't come out in the day, etc.) are bad. However, they cannot be killed, except that the wound or wood is curled in the heart. Yeah, right. Obviously, they just did not want to film a dark movie because it is a movie made for a TV movie. Oh, they have Lynda Carter (Wonder Woman) and a big black guy with an extremely deep voice that snorts appropriately to show off their vampire teeth prosthetics. But otherwise you would never know that they actually paid people to read these lines. There are more than enough fighting scenes and some blood-gnawing neck bites, but no real violence.
