Though he debuted in Australia and went to the UK and America to continue his career, Australians will tell you that Errol Flynn was the biggest movie star they ever made. I'm not sure he ever came back to Australia after the success of Captain Blood. I still attribute this film to the known Aussie's disregard for getting rid of the reputation of one of them. As part of this story, which told Errol Flynn about his life story, it was that he had told enough high stories in his life law. until the very end in his book, My Evil Evil Ways. I saw that a lot of the movie was based on being read between the lines of this book. His infidelity to his father was not written but could be derived when reading My Wicked Wicked Ways. In particular, she did not like a woman, it is clear from several sources. I would like the film to focus more on its adventures in New Guinea, which was the most interesting part of my Wicked Wicked Ways. As for his street fighting in Depression, I tend to disbelieve it. Even if he was successful, I guarantee that it would destroy his appearance enough and he would never have a career as a leading man. Sydney's atmosphere during depression was captured well and Guy Pearce is a charismatic Errol Flynn. American viewers know him best as a sincere but honest Lieutenant Exley at LA Confidential, which was released in the same year as Flynn. However, LA Confidential was a much better film.
