In 1970, feminists invaded the 'Miss World' beauty contest in London and brought an opportunity to stop by hurling on the stage with flour and eggs. Why? Because, right or wrong, they felt that the event was humiliating and humiliating for women. I do not provide any criticism of their actions. It is the free world we live in. Do I want to know why their modern equivalents do not fall into studies where such programs are exhibited and the like? 'Sex & The City' is about four self-absorbed women from New York: Carrie is a slave to a fashion that turns into a cat when she applauds so much, Charlotte longs to find a perfect man (they don't exist) , love) to use sex to grab a poor devil, Miranda's lawyer scares the man away by disappearing nonsense like "out of touch with my emotions" and finally we have Samantha, The Live Old Martini Advertisement "anytime, anywhere, anywhere" Feminists hold these characters - especially Samantha - as a brilliant example of modern womanhood. If the screams of harsh words in busy restaurants are progressing, I think feminists should look at themselves and what they have to represent for a long time. You were a 'Sex & The City' creature man, it would be pulled out of the airwaves for being a sexist. Instead, like Charlie's angels in front of him, intelligent women are responsible for thinking that they act as a positive force for good. There is something very clinical and cold-blooded at the show. "The Benny Hill Show" was also sexist, but at least it was funny.
