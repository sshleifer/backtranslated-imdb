Somehow I really thought I'd like this movie because I love climbing pictures and a great mystery on the land. I have to say that the photo was fantastic and that some scary scene captivated me. I thought Nicole Eggert (Diana Pennington), "Thank you, good night", "01 played a very convincing role for a young girl who had a tragic loss in her life and encounters some characters who want to lead her up the mountain. Marc Singer, "Angel Blade", '02, played a very unconvincing strange guy and went to many scenes with a bad character that looked comical.
