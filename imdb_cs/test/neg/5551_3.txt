I was somewhat debating over what rating I should give to this, because it's my favorite movie, Herschell Gordon Lewis, who is different from The Gruesome Twosome but has the best performances I've seen in Lewis. However, we all know that it doesn't say much. Once the movie was done, I was happy because I felt I was sitting in a 4-hour movie, though it was only 82 minutes. I'm trying to see all the HGL movies and that's probably the only reason to see it. Gore is good as usual, one thing that Herschell seemed to be right. The only exception is as bad as usual. The exception is Frank Kress. Would I say he's a good actor? By no means, but it is good compared to others. The story is boring and flat and doesn't go where it ends, not caring about what happened for as long as it ended. I know it's a cult classic, but I didn't like it. I hope you will.
