The first thing I saw when I looked at the DVD box was "Best Screenplay" and I think it would be a good rental. WOW, I was wrong! I'm sure there was a good movie at that time, but after the incredibly bad video game production and production values, it looks like a retarded Tron's half-brother. The first scene sets the overall atmosphere of the entire movie. Five minutes to go, you'll ask yourself, "What the hell am I watching?", And it will just be a snowball from there. The terrible soundtrack that makes every song sound like Robula Zombie's "Dragula" rounds off this unhappy piece of crap into a ridiculously bad movie. On the note side, the # 3 most romantic quote in the movie - "I think you're the ultimate goal."
