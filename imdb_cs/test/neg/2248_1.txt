This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. What is the purpose of this film? A bunch of Americans enter the Nazi occupied France and begin to defeat the Germans. You can see how they scalp their enemies and beat them to death with a baseball bat. Of course, when making jokes. Some say this film is a parody of a particular genre. For a parody, it's neither funny nor funny. The content is zero. It's extremely brutal and disgusting. Below it lies a subtle political message because it is again "good guys" killing "bad Nazis". The whole plot is unthinkable when you turn it around. Can you imagine a story where the Nazis (at jokes) would kill everyone in the Warsaw Ghetto with a flamethrower? Probably not, but this film is about it, except that it meets the strange moral expectations of a particular audience: defeating people is so cool when the right people do it. because of the hidden Nazi ideology. He does not consider the enemy to be human. And if this element is to be an element of entertainment, I'm glad that this kind of fun will always remain a mystery to me. the crowd while a little nudity scares them. But if the naked body is pornography, this film is all the brutal purity of pornography in the worst case.
