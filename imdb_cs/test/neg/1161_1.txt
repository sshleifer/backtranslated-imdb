I did some research on Ed Gien and I found some interesting things. As well as the fact that Ed Gien, he was quiet and loner, not some buff over carrying a jerk like in this movie. I'll say I didn't finish the movie, but I'll be. I'm going to feed all of us, the Wisconsinites, like Kentucky. You know, funny, but oh so sad factor in this movie, Wisconsin is not as hot as it made it look. This film is not just an insult to Wisconsin people, being Wisconsite itself, but it is an utter insult to a man who has emerged as a mad, lonely man. He killed two people and the movie couldn't get it. Ed didn't get such close and personal and frightened people, he shot two and one people, he killed. So why do these movies lie and say "BASED ON TRUE STORY"? This is not based on anything other than the lie the director came in in his foul head. Joke and nothing more! OK, I'd like to join this one. I finished this sad movie and I want to laugh at the director. Do your homework while shooting a movie. I would like to inform you that there are no mountains (for those who have never been to Wisconsin) and that it is NOT DESERT! To hell, there were more pines and snow in Ravenous and it was supposed to be shot in California. OK, for those who don't know about Ed Gein, I'd like to give you your history lesson. Ed Gein thought he had killed his family, but it was never proven. He killed the bartender, was shot at a bar close by when no one was around. He took the bartender DEAD back to his house. Ten years later, SHOT and killed a salesman, stole a cash register and a truck. He was caught for this murder, came the day before when her son was there and asked about the antifreeze. On the day he killed her, he was where he bought the antifreeze, and the income that only antif had ..... was the only proof they had to start hunting around the world. He robbed the graves, actually robbed 56 graves. He hates the people he dug, and he did despair; lamps, couches, chairs and other things. He had a family with whom he had dinner once and for a while, and they threw all the meat he'd ever given them when he was caught because he was trapped in their house. He was arrested and hidden in the back of a police car in fear of what might happen to him. How do I know all this? I read the book of the judge who tried to write it. After this movie, after watching the horrible thing, not only did I offend the director a terrible look at what Wisconsin women look like. I think it was hard to tell who the guy had on board for half the time, you know that Wisconsin women are all BLONDES. Please! I am overly offended by the lack of homework that this guy has done and the bad work he has done in making this movie. I have no idea who this Kane is and I think he may be fine in something else, but he did a terrible job with Ed Gein. <br /> <br /> After all, I'm so sad I wasted 3.99 in the movie. The film was completely untrue after completion, this film is like I say the world is flat and George Washington was not our first president. Come to people, that's your history, and that's Wisconsin's history. To end this scream, how everyone would feel if I did a movie and George Washington looked like Brad Pitt (some of you may think it's okay, but it wouldn't be true) and lived and wasn't president and To is one. Unable to override history.
