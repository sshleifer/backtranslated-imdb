I went very little to expectations in this movie. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain the story of Grudge 1. Well, if the first one couldn't leave them an impression to explain the plot, then I doubted this would be a little better. <br /> <br /> Let me summarize what these trailers are telling you: The Asian lady is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Luckily, she's not too long for her. This decision could save her career. The film has three story lines and none of them makes sense. Worse still, none of them is developed. You almost start to understand and then someone dies and the story stays behind. Well, killing people could be scary, but I was more confused about trying to develop the land than I was scared. They jump back and forth between all three story lines that don't concern ... OR ARE?!?! * SOUND EFFECTTT * ~ ~ ~ The timing of the three stories is relocated and you can say from the beginning that the movie will have a twist at the end. READY. OH Wait. Sorry, this is not Fight Club or Vertigo what you would like. And he probably imagined a much better turn in his head ... they should hire me. Instead of the girl looking like "SURPRISING", maybe it could be Michael Jackson? That part of Scary Movie 4 scared me out of the mines. The killing sequence was terribly done. Unlike past horror movies, when a killer emerges from nothing, such as a wardrobe or behind the door, and everyone in a theater jump (and then that fat guy behind you breaks the popcorn by the neck) - it lacked the creepy pop UPS. They approached where a random Asian woman or child showed up, and you knew exactly what was coming. Instead of really loud music, then quiet, then jumped on the psyche you gave, the music actually gave you the timing for a scary scene. If I know it's coming, it won't scare me. The film began to explain what "Grudge" is; when a person is killed during a tantrum, a curse is placed where he was killed. So why does an Asian lady, cursed by her mother, have any meaning for the story? And why are the countries that are moving now? This movie was absolutely awful. All I did was let me piss off my friends to make me - we should have seen one of those Pixar animated movies. It would be scarier.
