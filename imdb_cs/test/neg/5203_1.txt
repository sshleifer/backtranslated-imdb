As a huge fan of Delta Force's original operation, I thought I'd choose this movie. I thought it couldn't be bad. But here is a list of things I learned while watching Delta Force 4: Deep Fault. Delta Force, despite being an elite in the US armed forces, are mostly mildly obese men in their late 30s and early 40s. Delta Force, despite being an elite in the US armed forces, carries a standard police pistol or AK-47 on its most important missions. Delta Force, despite being an elite in the US Armed Forces, did not learn that during secret missions they wore bright red jumps and running in open air would not help out of sight. <br /> - When you release the Molotov cocktail into a tank, it explodes externally like a grenade. <br /> <br /> - When you hit a tank fire, you can escape even if the smoke can cause minor breathing difficulties. - You can die on one standard gun shot, but you can live despite being hit several times by a sniper rifle and several AK-47s. In hand-to-hand combat, Delta Force members, despite being an elite in the US armed forces, are regularly injured by railroads. > <br /> - If bad guys are approaching on a slow train, there is nothing to worry about - among them, four are unable to figure out how the automatic weapon should be fired automatically, let alone anyone from 5 meters (16 feet) with at least 50 attempts between them. <br /> <br /> - If you're just an actor, you just need to recycle them - a bad guy from Operation Delta Force 1 plays a good guy named Mac in Operation Delta Force 4, and one who played Mac in Operation Delta Force 3 now plays Skip Lang, another good man. Delta Force's not right. an unarmed terrorist, even if he tries to reload his weapon to kill you. Grenades explode when they hit the ground when Delta Force fits them. When thrown by personnel outside Delta Force, they explode exactly where Delta Force members have thrown grenades back at the bad guys. <br /> <br /> - Tanks can run faster than standard cars. Militias and personal armies use exactly the same helicopter used by the United Nations in Delta Force 1. <br /> <br /> - When a helicopter arrives, a bad guy in the helicopter can't see you, lie face down. Shooting multiple times on the chest will cause less damage. The position that a person in the knee kills them within 5 seconds. Delta Force steals old people's cars to get abroad because the US military doesn't provide them with any resources. transport. It can also explain why they caught public transport. As you can see, it's not really the best moment in filmmaking, but it's good for laughter.
