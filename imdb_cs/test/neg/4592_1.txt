This movie is terrible. A true hockey fan would have to assume that people who appeared and produced this movie never played or followed a real hockey game. I was hoping it would be a "kid movie", but the only people who would probably enjoy this movie are women aged 13-17. Hockey scenes are terrible, defenders play as if they were 5 years old, goal scuba divers on shots that are 10 feet wide, etc. It's so hard to predict the end of this movie, though! For those who saw it, who would guess ?? For those who have not seen it, do not waste your time! I lost less than half of the film. To call this movie drama is ridiculous!
