This movie is terrible - honestly. Acting is horrible, the scenario tousled me, the effects are totally miserable (which usually doesn't bother me about older movies, but it only happened two years ago), and I'm sorry about it. Several friends go out to the woods for Halloween and meet the witch and her cannibal son. Of course he has a clich√© "Do you really believe that? Ha ha ha, it's just a story" the routine pulled out for a while. The witch's son of the cannibal was retarded (I don't know if it was for the comedy or to scare it, but this movie failed in both). It has minimal gore and no nudity that made the wrong movie worse. Damn, the only good thing about this movie is the foot eating scene, and even that could be better. <br /> <br /> Honestly, don't waste your time watching on the cable, and definitely not consider buying or renting it, otherwise you'll dig yourself for a waste of time that could be spent doing something more constructive or fun.
