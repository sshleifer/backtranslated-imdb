I think only a select number of viewers were really interested in seeing how a male cheater works in New York, but I would be willing to bet that even these brave souls were turned off by patchwork irritation and deliberately muted audio. view here; The fact that these inherent "defects" were the direct result of the low-budget / underground / experimental nature of the film is, I think, next to the point. By the way, for those who are so inclined, the film is a huge male nudity, and Joe Dallesandro, of course, has become an underground? and gay? icon! The episodic structure that shows the daily routine of a heroic hero offers several slightly interesting scenes: his encounter with (and ultimately pro) an eccentric older artist; the one where Dallesandro expresses her views on her unusual line of work and defines her particular way of working for several potential "colleagues", including perhaps the most likely fraudsters? obrýlený blbeček! Perhaps mercifully, the film ran only 89 minutes against the IMDb claim that its total length is 105 (but the second might be a mistake)! I've been looking at several other Warhol movies and it's definitely not as satisfying as the most acceptable example I've ever encountered, BAD (1977) and just a little bit better than the one I love MY HUSTLER (1965) ), which was mostly a desire to sit. The fact that it was only the first part of the trilogy failed, but as you say, you have to do what you have to do, and the next two chapters must follow in rapid succession ... <br /> <br /> Despite my however, the generally negative response to this is still FLESH valuable as a 60's time capsule and as a prototype of the underground scene of that time, both in kinematic and real life. For the record, Dallesandro's picture of this film adorns the sleeve of The Smiths' self-titled 1984 debut album and transsexual Candy Darling (who appears rather unusual here) was immortalized in "Candy Says", the opening track of The Velvet Underground is the cover album of 1969 Even though this group is my favorite favorite and one of the reasons is that through their absolutely unique and breakthrough music they have described a lifestyle so totally different from my own, that is really the case when I am. d much more to experience something visually instead of visually!
