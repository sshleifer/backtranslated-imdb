I hope that Matt Dorff's original script for this was much better (there are indications that it should be well before the big f / x scenes (to introduce the characters) that would make sense much earlier, stuck later in time. Maybe the original script was running for a long time, but maybe not - anyway, it smells, every character is uninteresting, and * everyone talks about shop windows as if they were speaking the word of God. Dianne Wiest's secretary "is just awful, explaining things to her assistant (and, by the way, us), in endless speeches that no one in the real life tells anyone. There are characters who are completely one-dimensional and focus on his work. er-hacker-powerful enterprise that can crash <br /> <br /> * all * in Chicago (including phones) - and then gives oh-no-what-have-I- talk (but didn't leave the back door? ). Crusader reporter who abandons his principles in a drop of hat? A powerful supervisor who ABANDONS HIS POST in the midst of Chicago's worst crisis - no consequences? Hospitals FOCUSED BY Doctors And Nurses During Crisis (I'm not kidding, that's in the movie). evil, unless influenced by a woman (the ultimate is punk with a pistol - stripped of the influence of a woman, he literally goes insane); a bad stupid act (like what a reporter did with a hacker-god) is fine if you think well. Evil people die, capitalist evil people die as badly as possible, everyone else lives (well, except Randy Quaid). And I heard someone said nuclear power plants had to shut down because there was no electricity to control the safety systems (think about it)? There is one ray of sunshine (if you pardon the expression) - Randy Quaid basically plays his character from "Independence Day" (you know - "Hey guys - I'm baaaack!") - this time like a storm hound with an infinite range of SUVs and a superdooper battery for its camcorders. However, they kill him - mostly, the viewers seem to appreciate that tornadoes are pretty dangerous things (a little shallow, that.) <br /> <br /> Give this passage.
