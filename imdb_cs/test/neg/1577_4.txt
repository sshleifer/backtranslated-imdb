After a snowstorm, the roads are blocked, and Jason (Adam Beach) patrol arrives at his friend Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow) for dinner and advises his clients that they will be able to follow their trips the next day. Among the strange aliens, Jason meets his former heart of Nancy (Rose McGowan), who has just left her husband in Los Angeles. Throughout the night, without communicating with his base, Jason faces anxious and suspicious situations with clients, and finds some corpses, suggesting there is a killer among them. "Last Stop" could be an average thriller, but the script is just terrible. Most characters are despicable, and the motives of a surprising serial killer are never published, and viewers have no further explanation as to why the killer decided to kill the guests. My voice is four. <br /> <br /> Name (Brazil): "Encurralados" ("Trapped")
