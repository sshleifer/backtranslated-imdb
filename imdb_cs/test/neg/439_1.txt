What can we say about "horror comedy" that has neither horror nor comedy? There are no characters in the film, but too many lines of conspiracy - all underdeveloped and mostly unnecessary. Computer generated creatures look bad, kind of like a Disney version of tailless rats. Walking dead are the greatest detachment, except for the title, they will look dead in Landis' film, but they are far away. They just look like bad actors with abit plastic and bull blood added. The two fence lines really showed some promise (love story and "corporate" story), but failed as miserable as director, writers, SFX department, production and actors.
