If you've never read a classic sci-fi novel this mini-series is based on, it can actually be good. Unfortunately, if you're a fan of the book, you probably won't be able to watch more than the first hour or two. All political intrigues were removed from the film, the most important scenes from the book were removed, the motivations of the characters were completely changed, and the words from the wrong mouth figures. Where in the novel Paul Atredies was a teen age boy with incredible political skill and a great understanding of the way the world worked, he is hot in the film and frustrated in this film. Avoid this movie at all costs.
