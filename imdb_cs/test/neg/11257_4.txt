I saw this movie last night at the Berlinale as part of the competition. It was billed as the "world premiere" of the film by the host (though it seems that people here have seen it before). I have to say that I still don't know what to do about the film. I didn't know the book, I bought the ticket only two hours in advance and had only limited knowledge of the plot. Not enough, it seems, because I had problems getting into the movie. The film is sometimes narrated by Jones' character, but some perspective was not appropriate for me. And I really can't say if any of the laughs that the movie got are counting or not. The cuts were sharp and distracting, the scenes seemed to be slammed in some way, and the narration never made sense (even omitting the supernatural parts) - the actors were really good, but they couldn't save the movie. It was fun, but sometimes only in the sense that I was sitting there thinking about the technical details of making a film and what was wrong with it. I still don't know what mood the director intended to have a film. It was a strange mixture of light, dark, supernatural. Unfortunately, it didn't attract me at all and I watched it with a technical eye. But when we think about what's wrong with the movie, it's the best sign that the movie has failed. Surely I would expect something different if these actors were involved ... too bad!
