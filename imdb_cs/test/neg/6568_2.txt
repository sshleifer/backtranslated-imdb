Although they are not fans of "Star Trek" movies or the universe of shows and books, and so on, I still enjoyed the new movie in some of the old cast and "first contact" films. . But this one was a little sad to watch ... it seemed he wanted to be so much, but at many levels he wasn't one of the worst Star Trek movies. The plot is very appealing and seems to want to combine three or four stories into one perfect Trek adventure, but it ends up that when it tries to be, it is not tense when it wants to be and not action-like as it tries to be a mess of irregularities. The whole film, which takes the phrase from Spock, is illogical. The effects are nothing special because I saw Next Generation episodes that are just as good, which means it's good for a TV show, but not a major movie. The story is ridiculous when a gang first tries to stop Spock's brother and then joins him on his way to find God. The Klingons cling to the look that actually creates a much better Undiscovered Country movie. You all know that it's bad when Kirk, Bones and Spock sing the line of your ship, but Spock didn't really sing but rather ask about lyrics.
