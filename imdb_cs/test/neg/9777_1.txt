When I saw a poster in the theater, I thought it was a "new line" of a horror story without a famous cast worth trying. But when I walked in, I wanted to leave after 20 minutes. There was a lot of nonsense and logical flaws. For me, it's a movie that's not worth the theaters. It's not even visible.
