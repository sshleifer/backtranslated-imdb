While I agree that it was the worst movie I've ever done, I'm proud to say I have a copy just because I'm alone and a lot of my friends were extras (mostly in dance clubs, but a few more.) had the potential with Bolo and Enteru Dragon signed, but as someone who was the most every day on the scene, I can tell you that Robert Clouse was an old and confused man, at least during the making of this movie. I'd like to think it might be a better film if many of them weren't destroyed by a fire in the Morning Calm studios. I was sure, but it would be nice to think about it, I was really surprised that it was sometimes released and that someone like Bolo would join his name without a fight. Scott Levy, AKA Raven He was a wrestler in Portland at the time ... a nice guy, very smart.
