1983 was the crash year for Stephen King's books making it to the big screen. Christine, The Dead Zone and Cujo were all released within a few months of each other. While The Dead Zone was easy to pick from the game, Christine and Cujo were both pretty bad, and that's what's less of them. If he asked for an answer, I would say Cujo - marginally - is the weakest. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace, fresh from success when Elliot's mother in "ET - Extra Terrestrial") marries her husband Vic (Daniel Hugh-Kelly) on a thread. She has an affair with a local worker and is now looking at whether to leave her husband. Engaged in marriage sorrow, young Tad Trenton (Danny Pintauro), son of Donny and Vic, and a pretty confused boy with chronic phobia of darkness, often leads to severe panic attacks. Donna and Tad take the family car to a nearby yard mechanic for repair, but as soon as they arrive in the car they stop. Things get a hell of a lot worse when he finds out that a mechanic, Joe Camber (Ed Lauter) isn't there (he was cruelly killed by his dog Cujo, a huge St. Bernard who was recently bitten and infected by Angry Bat). the car and trying everything to get into the vehicle to tear these two unfortunate victims. The weather is hot; not the living soul knows they are there; the car does not start; and the dog really wants their blood ...... <br /> <br /> Cujo has the potential to be a truly strained thriller of siege, but he never really notices. I read the book and it's quite disappointing - certainly for the king - so it's hardly surprising that the film version is so little. On the printed page, the king was at least able to create a degree of tension, but the film is critically hampered by the fact that Saint Bernard is simply not very scary. The "visualization" of the film medium serves as a constant reminder that Cujo is St. Bernard. It was possible to forget about it in the book. Cujo in the book seemed almost to take over the blow of the monster. Even with a relatively short running time of an hour and a half, Cujo becomes a tedious and patient experience, sometimes unintentionally witty and certainly never as tense as he wants to be. They even left out the cruel end of the book and replaced it with the ending "all that ends well", so viewers can go home in a cheerful mood !!! Chalk this as another lower king of adaptation.
