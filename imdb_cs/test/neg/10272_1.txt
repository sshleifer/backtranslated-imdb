Simply put, this mini series was terrible. Let me calculate the ways. 1. Absurd rendering. 2. Excessive action. 3. Scattershot approach to characters. 4. Annoying narration. 5. Inability to create viewer interest. This film cannot even pass the Soap Opera for Dummies test. I'm sorry I didn't read this award-winning novel, so I only judge it as a movie, but it really stinks. Imagine going to a party where dozens of starters will show you. You look at a wide variety and want to taste them, but suddenly they are withdrawn and wondering where they went. It's like this movie, with too many characters being introduced and never pulled out. There are enough stories and characters in this movie to create 20 episodes of the series, but we've given less than four hours to spend it all. There are more facial expressions and an Ed Harris reaction than you find 10,000 monkeys. The pace is extremely slow. Dennis Farina and Helen Hunt are so far away that their characters are not believable. Joanne Woodward's character is one-dimensional. The permanent river metaphor becomes trite. And probably the most absurd part of the movie - the cat. This evil and vengeful cat who follows the hero around to scratch him and seat covers - well, come on - he's not even a good Stephen King! Probably the most interesting character in the film, and the one who is not well drawn is John Voss, a disturbed boy whose last act of despair is responsible for the only plot of equipment that works in this film. Almost everyone in this movie is incredible. To sum up, there is little to inspire you. Drama is a bad melodrama. It's just a terrible effort.
