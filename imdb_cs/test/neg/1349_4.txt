I've never seen others comment on the original movie, so my view is just about this movie without comparison. <br /> <br /> I found the movie's message that :: everything will be fine with the world, everything will be in place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect you and, like you, your employers will be you wanting more, paying you more and even your own children and parents will love you more. <br /> <br /> I find this report punishable and totally false. Kudos for a very funny birthing scene at the end; There is no mother who will not laugh during this scene. <br /> <br /> Overall a very unsatisfactory film fence. In this movie, I didn't find any prey for anyone. I thought they were all pathetic individuals who were absorbed by themselves, not caring about what had happened to them, and that wasn't a movie people would like to see.
