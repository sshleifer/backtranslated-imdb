With several actors (Lance Henrikson, David Warner, Joe Don Baker), why was Jeffery Combs on the lead? Henrikson would be perfect for leading, as would Warner, Baker or even others in a movie such as Charles Napier. Combs was wrong and wrong in this. Everything he did seemed fake or fake. <br /> <br /> The script is bad. It means that if Lance Henrikson (or another) had a lead role, he could save the film (removed from the "waste of time" category), but it would still be a bad movie. The game was completely missing on the screen. The director should have realized this and helped the film.
