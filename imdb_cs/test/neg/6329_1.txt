This is not a new movie. It's a re-cut of the 1994 "Emmanuelle, Queen of the Galaxy," and it has been significantly shortened. Note: There are many characters in credits that have been cut out of the movie. <br /> <br /> If you want to see this character in its original form, pick up "Queen" - avoid this at all costs. cuts make it even choppier than it was originally.
