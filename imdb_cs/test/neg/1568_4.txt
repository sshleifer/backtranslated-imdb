George and Mildred are a really unreal movie. This attempt to translate a successful TV series into a big screen was a desperate failure, as is often the case. Jokes and smart single-layer TV shows have disappeared. The storyline is a typical English farce of confused characters and misconceptions that is not funny or strange enough to provoke a lot of decent laughs. from the output of the couple (Mildred died of hepatitis before release), but others should invest their time wisely.
