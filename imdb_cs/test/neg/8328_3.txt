"Tragic Hero" is a film that is definitely trying to emulate the classic films Godfather, focusing on family, crime, loyalty and revenge. Also, this is part of the two partial series as The Godfather also was (at the time). However, this film comes nowhere near the levels of those classic movies and actually fairs worse than other thrill triads that were released in Hong Kong at the time. One reason is acting. Except for Chow Yun Fat, acting is generally on top and incredible. The audience tends to regard the procedure as funny just because the inability of the actors to maintain any degree of seriousness. As a result, the film is not really emotionally involved or intense because we don't care about what's going on with these characters. <br /> <br /> Another reason is lack of focus. The story tries to incorporate many different narrative elements into the film, but as a result, parts of the film become underdeveloped, as is any real sense of cohesion. Sometimes the audience gets lost in the procedures we follow without knowing what character's motivations are. <br /> <br /> The top of the film includes a decent gun fight, but again, because we don't care about characters, we don't care who lives or who dies; For this reason, the scene loses its intensity and tension. Other action sets are somewhat mundane in nature, feeling too controlled, rather than free-flowing. In general, this is a strictly average movie that is not recommended for general movie. viewer ... The only genre enthusiasts and Chow Yun Fat fans should consider this movie for viewing.
