The goal is the story of a special agent who, after ordering to kill Turkish "terrorists" (note that this is one of those American "movies for boys who love mindless nationalist super-patriotic crap"), returns home to find out that his ex-wife and two children are taking hostages. Charlie Snow has only a few hours to tell what the terrorists tell him to get back. That was by far one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And if it wasn't for someone I know (and probably mistakenly) to take it out of a video store, I'd never follow this huge pile of garbage. <br /> <br /> Playing a movie like any general movie story I've ever seen. In fact, it is the kind of things spoof shows on varieties, that's how bad it is. I was half expecting that In Life Colors is "Homey Clown" on Mad TV's Will Sasso makes his Steven Segal impression to be smashed on the screen halfway to remind you that it was just an exaggerated action movie, but now our characters There are spoof as it is ridiculous. There were no good combat or action sequences. By the way, things are going to happen, nor would you think someone was kidnapped, there were some terrorists, or something remotely happening. <br /> <br /> Not only is the story completely and absolutely absolutely perfect. uninteresting, acting is so awful wooden. Just watch the part where Stephen Baldwin, as former Special Agent Charlie Snow, talks to the kidnappers on the phone. They tell him they have their wife and put her on the phone. He says, "Charlie, help!" or something like that. And Baldwin answers "it's okay, honey" in such a way, you think he read the script and tried to speak phonetically. I imagine that despite such a ridiculously bad film (the one on bottom 100 on IMDb - a list that should extend to at least 250 movies and should contain almost every Stephen Baldwin movie), someone with some at the very least, he made an effort to avoid it. Someone. Anyone. I couldn't get through that everyone sounded like they were reading from the script. Save, this is the only person in the entire friggin movie that has some talent at all (and so shouldn't be in this), Mad TV Deborah Wilson. How truly embarrassing.
