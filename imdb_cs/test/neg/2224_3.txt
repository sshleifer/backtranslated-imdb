Based on the novel Edgar Rice Burroughs, ON THE COUNTRY OF THE EARTH, it provides little more than a means to escape and rest. Victor Abner Perry (Peter Cushing) invented a giant raking machine that he and his American partner (Doug McClure) use to corkscrew deep into the ground to explore what mysteries can hold. Soon he will discover a lost world of non-human creatures that conflict with prehistoric monsters. Cushing comes as an absent professor to the point of being uncomfortable. Instead of a brave adventurer, he encounters an effeminate. McClure, on the other hand, overreacted so much that he also laughed. Caroline Munro plays the pretty Princess Dia who refuses to leave her world near the center of the country. Also in the cast are: Godfrey James, Cy Grant and Michael Crane.
