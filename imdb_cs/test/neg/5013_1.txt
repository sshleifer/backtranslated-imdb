This movie was on the pay channels today and I had nothing to do, so I had it. It must be the worst football movie ever made. This must be one of the worst film periods. The premium service on the cable system has a rating system and two of them have given 2 stars. This movie is not half a star. Bad playing, Scott Bakula is falling as usual, Larry Miller? Sinbad, he couldn't act if he tried. Rob Schneider has one pad completely stinking. Fred Thompson should be embarrassed to be even in this movie. The only saving mercy for this movie was the hope that you would see Kathy Ireland naked in the shower, not even close. Full loss of time and film. If we could give a negative number, minus 9.
