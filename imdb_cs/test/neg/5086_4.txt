** Warning - this review may contain spoilers ** <br /> <br /> The idea of ​​the character Danny (Jet Li) is good - the young man is hoodlum raised and bred like a crazy pitbull. mainly by whether his collar is on his neck or outside. However, the writer did not know how to implement this idea within the limits of credibility. He has Danny's encounter with a blind pianist, Sam (Morgan Freeman), who has to be the most reliable fool ever been - along with his nitro-joke, infinitely crazy, rather unattractive step-daughter, Victoria Kerry Condon). By the way, I was impressed when I learned that Victoria was 18 years old - she looked 25 or 30 years old for me. Surprisingly, there's no romance between Danny and Victoria. When Danny appears again, hurt by what Sam does, he takes him home. Danny's for 2 days, but these stunts take him to the hospital? Nooooo. I don't know if they even called a doctor. Now Danny is clearly not a mentally stable person, that is obvious from get-go, but Sam takes him to his home, where both he and his stepdaughter could be seriously injured or even killed by this rather strange young man. Mr Freeman is certainly not so desperate for a paycheck. Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart, a gangster who "owns" Danny - now you're talking about a son's weapon that's hard to kill. The Bart car is in riddled bullets that would rival Bonnie and Clyde's demise. We think he's dead, but not. Then we have another car accident - and once again, ol 'Bart escapes unharmed. Besides, we also have Danny fighting half a dozen hard guys at once, plus a scene where Danny decided he didn't want to fight anymore. I don't care how much you don't want to fight when it's on the wire of your fight or you die, I think someone would fight. As I said in the subject line, this movie is about 40 miles beyond reality, as we know it. It's not just a case of suspending faith - it's completely out of the question. Besides, I never understood why Danny's mother, who turned out to be a nice lady, rather than prostitute Bart, claimed she was mixed with Bart and his gang and shot. Maybe it was my fault, I was distracted by the time the scene came - but it seemed very unlikely that they would ever cross the road with Bart. 4 stars out of 10 - and that's generous.
