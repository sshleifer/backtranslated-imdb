The film hits the ground and the film begins with three murders in a row. No conspiracy, no characters, no motivation; the second murder takes place off-screen, and the separate head of the victim is actually used to effectively deceive the third death victim! This is the highest point. But the Lewis are obviously smart enough to lead the force; Soon they cover up imitation dialogue scenes with a detective voice, filming an endless handy guarantee in a nasty wide shot. Now, this horror atmosphere Betacam produces a quick way to premium infomercial vibe, with monumental (and rather cute) lead simplicity leading obliquely things further in that direction. Shlub Cop investigates, meat cleaver guy defeats, repeat, climax soon with memorable separate-finger-in-the-lettuce gag. Just how the hell did they get to the salad? And wasn't the goal of Blood Cult to collect the pendants they separated? When GORE makes no sense, you know you have problems. And without destroying the big nonsensical twist, take the word: the fascinating incompetence of the first scenes leads to a deep cathode tube pulse. The basic reaction is to try to put it behind you and get into life.
