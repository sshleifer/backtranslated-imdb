As one who loves movies that attract intellectual fights, as well as those who simply tell stories, this film should be appealing. But as Catherine Breillat wrote and directed, who seems to be playing her own puzzles in film experiences, this boring and talky film does not attract interest. The main character Jeanne (Anne Parillaud) is on the screen of Breillat, the director frustrated in her attempts to make a compelling sex scene with two difficult actors (Gr√©goire Colin is an actor and Roxane Mesquida is an actress). The only "comic" piece is Jeanne in that she used the dildo strapped to the actor to control the sex scene, but even this gag is getting thin and we left a movie in a movie that feels more like a 'Deleted Scenes' featurette on DVD than a solid French class comedy.
