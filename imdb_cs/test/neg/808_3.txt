As a South Africa resident in South Africa again after a 32-year stay in the UK, I'm sorry that this film is a huge disappointment. The three main issues I had with the movie were a) why Swank and Ejiofor - American and Nigerian - play the lead. This country bursts with talent and has no need to import ... b) Gillian Word has been trading for several years with combat mandates. She is a very average writer, and even her novel does not step into Mr. Hooper's flaccid direction ... and c) Hilary Swank, such a great actor as it turned out in Million Dollar Baby (but that's also Eastwood), dressed in contemporary New York while they move freely around Karoo poverty. Where was the attention and sensitivity needed for the customer and the director? Yes, the movie is moving - how could it not be? - but the overall mood at the end is one of the huge downturns. The heart is in the right place, but needs a pace maker.
