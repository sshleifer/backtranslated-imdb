Sad ... really sad. This movie has nothing (hmmm, maybe Sybil Danning) to watch you. It also hurts my eyes to see Linda Blair in this exploitation of the swing. Certainly it deserves better. So what's the story about? Let's see ... Ranger John Vernon records prisoners in somewhat inspiring positions, while Sybil prisoner actually leads prison and little Linda has to fight for survival ... Sounds like B-movie, huh? It is.
