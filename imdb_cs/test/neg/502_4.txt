The film, the Heavenly Gate, was a good view, though it was boring for more than 4 hours. But the film won a big license - as usual with Hollywood. James Averill (Chris Christopherson) and "Elle" actually got married in real life. Their main contribution to the Johnson County War was that they started to hang it. Well, by starting it, I think it came at the beginning, not at the end. Here's the real scenario: James Averill and Ellen Watson secretly marry, because every family could be given a homestead. By serving as the only individuals, they could get two homesteads. They chose the houses at Crazy Woman Creek, actually controlling the water over the ground, which has a powerful member of the Cattleman's Association. He offered to buy them repeatedly, which they refused. Although in real life he is the owner of a brothel (Cattle Kate) and a prostitute herself (and also in the film), there is no real evidence to be true. It is known that she bought many pieces of sick cattle, treated them back to life, and the Cattleman's union later accused him of taking cattle in the shop for "lewd acts." Almost certainly false, so much for this part of the myth of the American West, a myth that overlaps a period of about a hundred years. In real life, she and Jim Averill were one day surprised by several members of the Cattleman's Association, who were taken into their hands and were immediately hung up. and the beginning of the war in Johnson County. <br /> <br /> Quite different from the Hollywood version, which shows her shot at the end. In addition, I think the main problem with the movie was the editor, which could make the action faster with more skillful adjustments.
