OK, yes, I know I am a Philistine, and I have no knowledge of opera or love of it. Perhaps I admit that I could feel different about this film. But I don't. So for those of you like me, skip this one if you don't want to look at pretty (sometimes unclosed) girls. For what was worth, I thought the first segment with Theresa Russell (who I didn't recognize) was the best.
