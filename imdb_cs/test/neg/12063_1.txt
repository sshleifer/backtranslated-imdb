Camp Blood looked great when I bought it, but when I watched it was a bad guy. His cheap, acting performance is unreal and the quality of the film is shocking. Being a movie fan, I usually find humor from tragic horror, but sometimes I couldn't even laugh. Maybe Camp Blood 2 will be an improvement.
