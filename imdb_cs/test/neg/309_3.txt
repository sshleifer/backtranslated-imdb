I agree that this film is too demanding and it is not easy to know where it is going. I have been teaching literature and film for many years, and according to some of the previous reviews, this film is one of the most rated. However, let me remind you that this is the same director who has the L'ora di religione (My Mother's Smile) credit - the jewel of the film! He tried to surpass Fellini's 81/2? ???? The dog scene, which has also been emphasized, is absurd and excessive? just one example. Others would take up too much space, and some reviewers have already noticed them. Overall, it's the most frustrating and unpleasant experience!
