I wasted $ 5 for renting this piece of crap. Dr. Zack is the most notable leader I've ever seen. The film was full of EVERY cliché you could ever think of, and it didn't contain a single OUNCE of originality. There was a typical sexism portrayed by harsh aliens, all the boys were too proud to take positions that are as outdated as grandma's Christmas fruit cake. The concept and death were really great, but when it reveals the monster, it loses all its novelty. (at the end read SPOILER) Nothing else is really revealed, the end is the biggest cop-out you've ever seen. Before it happened, I predicted everything, including who dies and how. The dialogue is missing and that is by far the shortcoming. Mostly it is just about shouting, thoughtful staring and robust sentences. Actors are just a great God! I don't want to talk about this movie anymore, it makes me angry. I was just wondering if the director was watching it, even though it was done. The monster is just a bunch of ants that have "evolved", so now they need bones so that they can move around, (no matter what, that it has no evolutionary advantage, and that the ants have just killed the one who was available, although the movie behaves as if they were killing out of necessity. ants. Quite a cliché? He almost turned away at the end because of a sudden emotional attachment to his mother, who overcomes him. Give me a break.
