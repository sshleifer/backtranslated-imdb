Two days ago I had the opportunity to watch this movie on Cable (TV-Asia). I have been very concerned since then. "Baghban" was very successful in displaying only one side of real life. He is very partial to his parents. Have you ever thought about another party (kids) ??? There are few parents in this world who only give birth to their children but do not give proper parental care. I'm the victim. Why do you want to have 5 children in your life if you only do R 2000 per month? Together with my siblings, I was forced to work on the streets. I have no idea how I got into IIT from here. It's been a long time since then, but I still don't believe it. Now I'm a scientist in the US. Together with my two brothers, who have stayed with them, I have provided my parents with all the necessary needs. When we were children, they couldn't give us basic things. I consider this film very upset. Its very partial. It really hurt my feelings. I strongly urge the producer / director of this film to look at the Indian company in another respect and create another film. I'll get to john_simension@yahoo.com
