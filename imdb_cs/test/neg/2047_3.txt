As Americans, we expected that hippopotamuses were "par for course" in terms of HORROR and unknown directors of directors of unknown actors working for unknown writers. We really expect it to suck & when they don't suck, it happens overnight success. This is not an overnight success, nor is it over the weekend or over a month of success. This blows from start to finish and my only recommendation is this: COME TO THIS SIGN, PLEASE, enjoy what it is for what it's not and if you have something better, hold it on the back. . It's fun when you watch older people walk through a busy street during rush hour, but don't expect much - they almost never get into the car, it's just a lot of hoopla.
