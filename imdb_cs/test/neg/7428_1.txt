I got this thing from a science fiction shelf because I remembered seeing the first of the series when I was a kid. I rented the second and it was a decent "B" science fiction. This one was okay. "Special" car effects looked like something my four-year-old cousin could do. Two auxiliary female cyborgs were so terrible that I literally crouched every time they came to the screen. The plot left so much that it would be desirable for me to be angry. I don't know what anyone thought when they agreed to be part of this movie, but I'm sure they'd do better if they left him on two movies. Films in this series go from good to decent to terrible. I just hope that no terrorist groups have access to this film because it's an excellent torture device.
