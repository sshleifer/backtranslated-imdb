Interesting topic. Pathetic delivery - scenario and direction. Our hero, Miles, drives out and has his rescue operation in the world. The fun begins here. The basic question is that Miles doesn't have SOUL !!! This is used to explain its quasi-irregular behavior being indirectly responsible for two deaths (I think this is the total number of deaths in 104 minutes). Miles prefers odd brandy glass, blazing fireplaces, and his young, mature female cousin. The final really does justice to this film. Some thoughts: 1. The $ $ producer was split to create this audacity. J.D. Feigelson was a screenwriter and (or only) producer. Looks like he didn't learn to learn "how not to bring an interesting idea to life" by looking at his next writing. This will support the credibility of this script. <br /> <br /> 2. Now available on DVD !!! That's really scary. It should be forever "Lower Shelf" in VHS format. 3. A reinvented person without a soul gives up an evil being. <br /> <br /> 4. Scores offer minimal support. Even Jerry Goldsmith, who is in shape, couldn't save him. 5. He earned the 0230 time slot on TV and the touch more fun than infomercials + test patterns he competed with at the time of my viewing. 6. Fortunately, no begining has followed ala Wes Craven's "Nightmare" franchise. Chiller Too: Return Return of Miles or something like that. Despite my ranking 1, I recommend this movie as a great example of how to kill acting or a screenplay career. This should apply to directing, however Wes Craven will be eternally freed for his only good piece of "Nightmare on Elm Street" 1984.
