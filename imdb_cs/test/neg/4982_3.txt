Good Things First: Underdog's voice was FINE. But Jason Lee is amazing himself, it really is no surprise. He kept the part in shock. And Patrick Warburton, a moral assistant. Now it was an idiotic character, but he behaved so well, I actually had a better character than the protagonists. The lines given to him were childish, but funny. <br /> <br /> However. Alex Neuberger did terrible and I hope he will never act again. His "scream" was so disgustingly false. Silence. Silence. "aaahhhhhhh". In the scene where he hears the dog talk, "oh no, impossible!" would be enough instead of pathetic false screams. And then there was a girl and her doggy who chased Patrick's Cad figure on the roof. At first it makes sense, he's a "reporter". School reporter but still questioning mind no matter what. But why, why the hell should she wear her dog? That was worthless, and the damn dog didn't say anything but a heartless "oh, loser!" Her presence was extremely unnecessary. Overall, the script was pathetic. The only reason I gave this film 3 is Barsinister, his help and the loser voice.
