It could have been a great movie with a lot of educational potential for teachers around the world about evolution, biology, creative work in science, research, and Darwin's life, but it's not. The script is mostly historically inaccurate and turns the real story into a Mexican soup opera melodrama. While it is true that Darwin gradually lost his religious beliefs, it was largely due to his findings during the Beagle journey and not just because of the loss of his daughter. Certainly his loss had upset him, but it hadn't really fooled him, he couldn't be deceived and detached from his friends and family. Such a picture of Darwin is the invention of the writer. Therefore, it cannot be used in any way as a place to learn about Darwin's life and psyche. According to most historians, Darwin had a theory ready to end the Beagle sailing, and kept it from going public because he wanted to develop further consequences of it and check against more data. This is Darwin's imaginary conflict with his religious beliefs and mental illness, which evolved after the death of his daughter, which prevented him from publicizing. The film brings a modern situation to creationists Scientists discuss the life and times of Darwin and is therefore anachronistic. It depicts Thomas Huxley not as a man attempting to develop another understanding of biology but as someone eager to "kill God", in his own words from the film, and destroy the church, who would adopt the theory of evolution for such purposes and not. because it was a synthesis of lots of disconnected data. Huxley is presented as a very arrogant and insensitive man, a combination that I interpreted as an attempt to ridicule active atheists who oppose religion. In real life, Huxley received Darwin's ideas after publication only gradually, and before Darwin's work he thought that there was not enough evidence to support evolution. His first evolution support was published one month after the public became native. He was agnostic, but he didn't think it was necessary to "kill God", just thought there was not enough evidence to believe in the supernatural. Debate creationists vs. scientists will appear throughout the film, and creation-catch-phrase phrases like "It's just a theory" are part of the discussion. Of course, there was no such dispute or phrase at that time. In fact, the Anglican Church issued a positive review of origin's stating that they saw God's work in evolution, in a sense, quite in fact contrary to the way that the clergy are portrayed in the script. Another horrible aspect of this film is that it gives the general public the impression that scientific research is being done by a lonely fool who writes a lot. Nothing can be further from the truth. The concept of evolutionary theory was the result of a thorough observation of the living forms of Darwin over the five years of HMS Beagle and was gradually developed as seen from Darwin's notes on the journey. Even though the Beagle Cruise was the only most important part of Darwin's life to the concept of "origin of species", the journey is briefly mentioned only once at the beginning, and no attempt is made to show that the book came as an elaborate analysis. observation. To make matters worse, Darwin is shown to perform one experiment (pigeon breeding) to test his theory and finally end it. And I'm not really sure if such an experiment really happened. Great disappointment. It is by no means a tribute to Darwin and science.
