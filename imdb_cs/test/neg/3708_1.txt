It is a sin how these things are done, but then we would not get back to the best ever made. Ahhh beauty of low budget Bigfoot flicks, you rely on seeing the beauty the more you look at them, that is if your brain doesn't melt first. As I said, this has the best false scene ever! Words I can't express, you have to see it for yourself. Wonderful lines like "smells like meat crumbling", "They're people ..." (You'll know when you see it) Creation makes Blaha, Blaha! The sound and scene where the baby gets shot will make you cry (with laughter) you'll rewind it. He has a car chase, snow scooter chase, folk song Bigfoot and also a song Disco. It doesn't stop there while you watch credits that a friend noticed "K-Mart's Wardrobe". You ask how you could even get credits and then watch them? I could just explain it as some sort of shock to the brain, you are so mentally exhausted that you can't move, and I also think you need to know who was behind the confusion. All that has been said is to be seen, especially if you want to punish mentally. His goalkeeper!
