Demon Wind is about as fun as breaking your legs. It's definitely a terrible example of a movie. It's so horrible that I don't even consider it a movie. I describe it as a thing ... a monstrous thing. Things that must be stopped at all costs. My friends and I first discovered this ... thing buried under a big box of videotapes in my friend's house. It was late at night and we had nothing better, so we decided to watch some kitschy horror movies (unfortunately we chose this one.) Well, in 90 minutes when this thing happened, we laughed so much that we almost broke up . The thing is literally absurd in every sense of the word. It's just cheap, badly done Evil Dead rip-off. The whole "story" seems to be nothing but a man who wants to knock his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting them demons tear them apart. I bet the writers actually wrote the story while it was being filmed. I've seen bad horror movies before (Manos, Troll 2, HOBGOBLINS !!!) (shake) I have to say that Demon Wind could definitely fight any and all of these movies in terms of total stupidity. Watch it only when you like silly movies. Funny fact: This movie is like a steroid cockroach! Like the ouija board, every time we try to get rid of it, it always seems mysteriously rediscovered. What a scary huh?
