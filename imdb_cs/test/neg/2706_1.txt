When I first watched this movie, I was ten years old. I thought it was bad, and at that age I had no cinematic taste. I watched this movie on Cinemax about 3 days ago and reminded myself why I hated the movie in the first place. The Madonna, Nikki, is uncomfortable and uncomfortable. There's no way the main character falls in love with her. The jokes were sloping and the dialogue was worse than the t.v. telenovela !! I'm glad I didn't see this movie in the theater or rent it. I feel bad for my parents who have had to endure with me! Madonna is not necessarily a bad actress, but in this role she is portrayed as a complete idiot.
