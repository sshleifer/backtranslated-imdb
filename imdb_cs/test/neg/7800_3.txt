He almost certainly studied the assembly of women's reading lines (very briefly) and got naked (not too briefly) before the anonymous (and unrecognized) panel - almost certainly including producer Charles Banda. There are random scenes of many Surrender Cinema movies (especially lesbian scenes). Most women as "riding horses" (Hmmm); there is a Polish woman who seems to have no interest in acting through going to audition; secret; a camera that shoots actresses naked behind the screen ... Scenes, the one with Lovell and Vanesa Taylor from Femalian is included and are probably the best looking lesbian 'couple' ever). A strange apology for the film and, in addition to the obvious move of naked women, honestly boring and uninteresting experience.
