Daft potboilers are not much dafter than this, but it's a Douglas Sirk movie that does everything right. Apart from this, it is not. Based on the sanctified novel by Lloyd C Douglas (written by "The Robe") and filmed in 1935 with Irene Dunne and Robert Taylor, it is more of a lifting than a cantilever bra. Rock Hudson is an arrogant playboy who not only feels responsible for Jane Wyman being a widow, but is later directly responsible for an accident in which her vision is lost. If you want to change that medicine is taken, it becomes a big eye surgeon and restores it. (No, it's not that stupid, he planned to become a doctor before he became an arrogant playboy). In the meantime, they will fall in love. Try, as I could not quite find the redeeming social commentary and criticism of American mores, which are to lie just below the surface of Sirka's films, this is not too deep. On the plus side, Rock Hudson is not half bad (I think I discovered him again) and of course it looks great (in Sirka's films, people live in cathedral-sized rooms). Nothing in this film matches the best of his later work, and even in a soap opera, it is definitely a daytime television.
