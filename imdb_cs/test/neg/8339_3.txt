When I saw this movie, all I could think of was: What a disaster! No, I'm not talking about the volcano, but about the movie itself. I've seen a lot of movies, but that's definitely one of the worst. I don't care whether or not a volcano erupting under L.A's center is. Maybe it's not, but it might be a good movie ... but it's definitely not, and I'll explain why. I don't know how many lava flows from an average volcano, but what I know is that the volcano in this movie makes Vesuvius, Etna and Mount Pinatubo look like a small grill. I don't think that as much of the lava we see in this movie fly out of the volcano. I'm sure the director has a lot of money for his film, but I'm really wondering why everyone spent it on special effects and not on script and actors. I'm not saying he should hire the best actor, but this is the opposite of what I would call a good act. Their performances are so incredibly bad that it makes the whole film worse. And what's wrong with this scenario, you ask yourself. Can you tell me who comes up with the idea of ​​people standing a few meters or even a few meters away from lava without burning or hiding the moors? Or do people sink in the ground when the flow of lava is not two meters tall? I'm sure I wouldn't be proud if I wrote such a script, but apparently there are writers in Hollywood who don't mind believing if they pay good money! Very good money !!! When you see the movie, you probably agree with me that it is one of the worst movies in Hollywood, worth not more than 3/10.
