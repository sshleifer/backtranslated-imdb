MARY, MARY, BLOODY MARY is OK time killer. It has a uniformly attractive cast, the action is rarely boring. There are lots of murders. And production values ​​are not bad. But eventually, it plays as a standard television episode since the 1970s with some nudity thrown in. The film is the ultimate product of "author" trying to make a purely commercial movie. There is very little depth and the film spends too much time with chases and action scenes. In addition to a beach scene with an old man, MMBM is almost without any fear or tension or fear. The director has very little understanding of the horror genre. <br /> <br /> It's noticeable, though it doesn't leave a lasting impression.
