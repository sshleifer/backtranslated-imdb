This movie goes to my file "Worst Movies Ever Made". I have a copy of this movie I watch when I want a good laugh and it's not even a comedy. I am disappointed that such great actors agreed to be in such a piece of garbage. This film is inaccurate (in its hockey view), offensive (for Canadians), and I wasn't even what made it. Even the story was a bit weak. If you've never seen this movie, you're lucky. If you do, I'm sorry.
