The concept of this film is unique, but its design is less than special. When I came to the cinema and realized that there were only about 15 people in the crowd, I thought I made a mistake. But the real mistake was made in shocking detail when the film ended and I knew I had wasted two hours of my life. Without the harsh recordings of an old man and a stupidly funny friend, this movie would be rated 1 out of ten. This film is strange, strange, because it's probably the worst movie ever published to the public. There is also the question of whether you could call it a movie, or just an advertisement for probably "crazy" Northwestern. <br /> <br /> If you're considering watching this movie for the storyline, humor, filming, places, then no. On the other hand, if you want to experience both ends of the film production spectrum, then go, take a book or a little game or just something new.
