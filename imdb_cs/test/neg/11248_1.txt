This film was absolutely musty and uninspired. The central prerequisite for this film was essentially a bunch of stereotypical black people sitting around a barber shop and exchanging painfully unfair compensation. I wasn't allowed to laugh during the whole movie. I could sit in every barber shop in America and hear this banal prank, and maybe I even came out with a decent hairstyle. I can't understand why this mess got some favorable reviews, much less why so many people wasted money on it. None of the characters were funny or didn't care about her. I wasn't really interested in whether a street hairdresser's hairdresser would make Nappy Cutz out of the store. Don't waste your money on this, people, because that's the only way to get Hollywood to stop churning out these shambles of scrap. 1 * of 5
