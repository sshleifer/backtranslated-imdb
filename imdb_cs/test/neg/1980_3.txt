I was dizzy with the girl's joy when I learned about this movie shortly after I saw Spirits Within. After years of expectation, they released the release date in November 2005. Well, November came. And he went. December followed. Oh, look, today, January 31, 2006. Well, I'm so glad I had a friend with a copy of the headlines. D <br /> <br /> Well, cg was great. Not as good as expected, but almost perfect. However, I have noticed the unnatural movements of the children throughout the film. I thought we passed it on. I also didn't really care about the anime look given by their faces. I was under the impression that they were shooting for a realistic view of the film, and yet most of the characters have more eyes than normal eyes, especially girls. But they had a personality, but I'll give it to them. Although I'm not a big fan of anime, I have to say I was amazed at the wild scenes. They were beautifully animated and let me hang on the edge of my seat. About the first two. And there lies the biggest mistake of Advent children. It's mostly just a bunch of hyper-stylized battle scenes. FF7 The continuation of epic proportions has been promised for years. Instead, they gave us a nice piece of cg, barely conspiracy to apologize that it's just under-clock time. <br /> <br /> Where Final Fantasy is known for its intricate stories, this film is not enough. You don't really know the characters. The only way you would understand most of what happened in the movie would be to play the game. We hardly had to see them before they fought with any present threat. <br /> <br /> What makes fans even worse is the terrible portraits that most FF7 characters have been given. It was nothing more than Cloud's: "I'll call if I need you, but I guess I won't" back up the singers. And to add to the injury, each character should individually roll Cloud higher and higher. This little part was so shabby that I almost turned it off. I'd be much more impressed if he just jumped on himself, bouncing off the walls to get up. It hurts even more when they reduced the Turks to less than - Just a comical relief. It was okay for the game, but this is a cinema. People don't act like harsh characters in a cruel battle. They took their dignity: / <br /> <br /> A spoiler (yeah, most of you probably already know, anyway). Who remembers Darth Maul as he appears in SW: Episode 1? Yeah, now, the picture, but with Sephiroth. That is right. Maybe he had 5 minutes of screen. Maybe it. End Spoiler: P <br /> <br /> If this movie was created for fans, then head to the square. If there is any indication of the direction you devote to the FF series, I doubt you will see a lot of my money. I played your games for an amazing story and outstanding characters. <br /> <br /> You had a chance to do something epic. Something really beautiful, a masterpiece that flies in the face of all Disney CG movies. Instead, you gave us a nice piece of meat that almost nothing could hold together. The way to go. And I'm sure the rest of the fans stopped for a moment and tried to pay attention to everything except CG, which they know what I'm talking about. Well, I was going to rate it 5/10, but after I thought about it, I'm giving it 3/10 because they could do better. They did better. And that's just sad. <br /> <br /> If FFVII is being redesigned, they have to do it first.
