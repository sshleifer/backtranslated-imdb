You know, I was very surprised to watch this movie. It was broadcast once a day when I was sick, and I had nothing else to do, I continued to watch. This is by far WORST MOVIE EVER! But to my surprise, I was still watching. I sat there and said it was horrible, but I never changed the channel because I was as amused as it was wrong. Maybe it was the guy who looked like the big survivor, or the horrible mustaches and mohawks that had these characters watching me. But the girls weren't bad, but if that's what you want, it's much better. Oh, and there's "NINJAS" and "PAJAMA BOYS!" So if you like a ninja, a bad deal, a hilarious (and terrible) dialogue, and two twins that are five feet high and kill everything in their gaze, then this movie is for you. It's so bad, it's good. But I had to give it 1 out of ten. I couldn't put 10 rings with the Lord of the Rings with me. <br /> ENJOY !!!!!!!!! :)
