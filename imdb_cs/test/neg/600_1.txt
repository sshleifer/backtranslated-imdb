This movie is basically poor on the old urban legends of babysitting that gets cranked calls saying to her to check the kids, she calls the police who watches the call and find there coming from inside the house. when a killer calls a story so simplistic, a small child could write it. There is not much tension, it is clear who is the killer in the middle of the movie. In the beginning, when the first victim is killed, it looks like a slave scene from a porn site or something. What's up with it? the movie is oh so typical slasher fare with a conspiracy like the original as a Beatles concert. even low-budget slasher standards its cheese. Don't waste time with it. said Nuff
