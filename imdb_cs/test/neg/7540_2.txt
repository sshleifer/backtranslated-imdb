The film takes place in Newcastle-Tyne in northeast England, in the city where I was born and raised. The film is also fundamentally dishonest - the way it represents the city, the children, but especially the men of the city. In this film, all are stupid, violent, thieves, criminals. I suppose I could comment on the action (predictable), performance (competitively unattractive), direction (lazy and unimaginable), but that is completely irrelevant to me compared to the director's insult to the city and its inhabitants. Invitation in my review to director and writer Mark Herman will therefore leave the northeast.
