While it's one of two Tales of Voodoo Volume 1 movies, there's no voodoo or something supernatural in it! "Hell Hole" is in the box, but the screen title is Escape from Hell Hole. The title is dimly similar to Hell Hole (1978) aka "Escape from Women Hell Hole." No nudity in this or any other scene, however. A woman named Cardena goes upstairs and seems to be well known and popular with all women. She invites Indri to come and live in the city with her and her uncle M.G. Once they get there, it's clear that M.G. wants to take Indri's virginity. M.G. he runs some kind of prostitution, and he is either in charge of the spoiled branches of the army, or he runs paramilitary clothing, or prefers for his guards to wear military-style uniforms. Women who refuse him or otherwise make trouble getting into jail. Indri is sent there. Women get tortured and sometimes even rape guards. Various failed escape or rescue attempts are being made, but they inevitably fail despite the obvious benefits women have: they exceed the number of guards and relatively few. guards have automatic weapons - most of them have semi-automatic rifles or weapons. WIP genre enthusiasts can enjoy it, and the fact that it was made in the Philippines gives some novelty but otherwise. eh.
