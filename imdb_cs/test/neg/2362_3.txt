This extremely beneficial Blaxploitation / Kung-Fu hybrid basement was released in my country by a questionable DVD label, which usually only refers to the transfer of pure crap to disc, so it wasn't a precious herald. Several other titles have been released in the same series as "The Black Six", "The Black Gestapo" and "The Black Godfather" and judging by all their low ratings and negative reviews, none of them belong to the 70s Blaxploitation elite. , neither. "TNT Jackson" is a pretty lousy movie, completely devoid of significant plot, but featuring too many ridiculous combat scenes and terrible acting to compensate. Apparently Roger Corman? never too embarrassed to make some easy money? assigned two of his most loyal acolytes to quickly invent a simplistic story that would appeal to fans of both Kung Fu Oriental films and contemporary Blaxploitation Trends. The result of Cirio H. Santiago and Dick Miller came up with was "TNT Jackson"; A story of ass-black black child travels to Hong Kong in search of her missing brother. He quickly finds out that the criminal networks of drug smugglers have killed him and swear to avenge him. Mrs. Jackson infiltrates the underground smoothly and meets moss pimps, useful secret agents, lots of evil Kung Fu fighters. The only thing is certain; they all want to somehow calm the body of TNT in some way. I honestly doubt film concepts that are a little more elementary than this, but ?? unfortunately - all other aspects too suck. The battle scenes are elongated and, moreover, pathetically staged. Jeannie Bell and other poor proverbs try hard to look menacingly and take a hard position, but in the end, all they ever do is dig into the air and jump silently across the rooms. Cinematography is terrible, the soundtrack is extremely disappointed (what happened to the soul's music?), Several dialogues are poorly written and the performances are worse. The thing is, Jeannie Bell is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but she still can't hold Tamar Dobson's candle or Pam Grier. There is only one really good and unforgettable scene in TNT Jackson, the famous hotel room battle where Bell, naked, except for panties, turns on and off the light repeatedly while digging into hell. Fun Scene ... I just haven't figured out whether this is due to the ingenuity of a light switch or the perfectly shaped Bell Breast.
