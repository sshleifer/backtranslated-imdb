I can't believe I sat in this total waste of time. I was just too fascinated by how I couldn't move. It reminded me of the feeling that you can't take your eyes off the terrible car crash or the rotting body of a cow. You can't help but look but feel sick and sick. <br /> <br /> Let me explain to you: "Plan 9 from space", for example, is not a bad movie. Even "Star Wars: Holiday Special" is not a bad movie. Both are horrible to watch, for sure, but both have SOME properties and at the very least leave you the power to reach for "off" -button. <br /> <br /> This sci-fi remake made me cry on the couch, trying to cope with why such scripts were filmed, why anyone would forget the original classics and whether I could continue my normal life without my life suddenly wishing a desire for silence and peace of death. Although I realized that death would not provide rest from the horrible memories of this pile of crap, because the poor souls in hell are probably forced to watch them over and over for eternity ...
