The only thing that is more than the hole in this movie is his script. Flatliners is an ideal showcase for Joel Schumacher's famous, spectacular, harsh lack of talent. The plot is totally illogical, but super-fake-cumbersome and everything is artificially oriented to the thumb of your life in the most cliché, overheated way. I love how school autopsy is a room of a cavernous vaulted marble mausoleum with low light in red with huge Rembrandt paintings hanging from the walls. I love Keifer Sutherland driving an army jeep with canvas support. Nobody in Joel Schumacher's films lives in a non-eccentric way. It is always an alternative universe where everyone is young and painfully hip, but hips strictly and obsessively by the middle-aged idea of ​​hip-hop at middle age. And the holy crap! The part where Baldwin's brother # 16 dies and returns to life and then is persecuted by all the women he slept with and intend to "call you" and "I need some space" is the funniest thing in the whole universe !!! ! What world do we live in, where does Joel Schumacher get to have people throwing money at him? "Flatliners" forced me to examine the whole work of man only for the kind of quality yuks contained in it.
