I expected much more of this movie than I actually got. The meeting was just terrible from everyone, and the story was far from impressive. It took a lot of things I didn't even have to follow because it was so nervous. An example of acting is when Paxton's character, Vann, is angry South Vietnamese colonel for so he throws a portion of the sand from the "Sand Map". It was impossible to get an idea of ​​what he felt and his actions were robotic. To make matters worse, I have no idea how I should feel about Vanna. He is clearly presented as a protagonist, but as soon as he gets to Vietnam, he starts with a Vietnamese English teacher. All he did was that it wasn't too boring. I give him 4 stars out of 10.
