The storyline for a movie such as that is giveaway. How can you go wrong with gay graphics and all the colors and music of India - a story like this. I'll look at anything, but this was impossible. The sad thing is that white people are the most colorful in the film. Vanessa was a riot with her mouth like a sailor, and Jack was a great eye candy, but everyone else was so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could, but the story was so boring. In fact, saving grace was background music, making the eye laugh, instead of the film, or not at all. There are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, simple movies. I give a lot of low budget movies, but it shouldn't be done or should be done by someone else.
