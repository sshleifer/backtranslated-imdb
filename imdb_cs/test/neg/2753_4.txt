If you like The Three Stooges, you'll undoubtedly be short of this 17 minutes. There were certainly fun moments in it, but like all Stoog's work, it revolves around their peculiar grotesque comedy style, and I must admit that the Stoogs never really did that for me. Their slapstick always seemed rather angry than funny, and although it was obviously false, their opposites always seemed to be the cause of the injury rather than the laughter. In this short, grotesque revolves around attempts to find Shemp (who is a music professor in this) wife, because he is only inherited half a million dollars on the condition that he marries within 48 hours of will to be read. One of his students is interested, but as soon as the inheritance word comes out, there is a long line of potential brides and a pretty good cat fight emerges between them. Stoog fans will enjoy it. For me, he has all the elements that force me about them. 4/10
