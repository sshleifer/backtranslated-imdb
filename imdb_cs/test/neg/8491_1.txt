Eleven years ago, Stanley Ipkiss published his true inner self and became the Edge City hero by finding and carrying the Norwegian god of misfortune, Loki's mask. The mask helped bring Jim Carrey to the forefront of comedy and achieved a very popular status for its originality and pure entertainment. Everyone knew how to cast a party. PARTY. Why? I must! Now, eleven years later, it seems to me that the same philosophy has been applied to the new film "Son of the Mask". Someone asked Lawrence Guterman, why are you doing this? And he replies "Cuz, I have to!" Unfortunately, this answer does not cover, because after seeing the Son of Mask I still left theatrical thinking, "Good God, why?" Guterman and the rest of the blasphemers must realize that the answer to why you are doing this film should not be as simple as answering a discussion on whether to participate or not. The mask's son begins with Otis, who has found an infamous mask and brought her back to his owner Tim Avery, who is honest with the legendary creator of Loony Toons Tex Avery. Tim, played by Jamie Kennedy, is a wrestling animator who works as a tour guide for an animation company that seeks a one-day draw. At night to celebrate Halloween, Tim puts on a mask and turns into a malicious, crazy character we all expect. After the Tim party goes home, the mask still on and counts the baby with his wife. Nine months later chaos follows, because the baby born in the mask has remarkable cartoonish powers. Otis the dog, jealous of the child's attention, dresses up a mask and participates in the chaos of Tom and Jerry. Meanwhile, Loki, played by Alan Cumming, is in search of his mask at his father's orders, Odin. First, wrong to admit that I respect the fact that this film pays so much homage to classic cartoons such as Tom and Jerry and Loony Toons, with his Wile E. Coyote type of contraptions and the infamous frog dance type conspiracy. However, this reverence cannot save the film and makes it less respectful and more waste of time. The film's assumption is becoming increasingly stupid. Silly is not always a bad thing, but in this movie, stupidity is just a state of affairs. The characters aren't fun to watch, and worse, they aren't funny. The dullness of the characters can also be attributed to the fact that so much CGI has been used. One of the biggest things about the original is that while computer animation was used, of course, it relied on Jim Carrey and his exuberant style of being. Jim Carrey, we were convinced it was a real cartoon. Jamie Kennedy just doesn't have such abilities, which is clear when you watch him wear a mask and his facial features rarely change. The child and the dog were mostly completely animated, which was increasingly distracted in the film. The side story of Loki looking for a mask has become more and more overwhelming. The mask's son is sad sadness. What I suggest is to go rent or buy an original mask and thank the Norwegian gods or anyone for bringing it to us. And he will consider continuing my victim when I ask the infamous question "WHY?" The mask's son gets one star, though this star should be split between the classic creators of Loony Toons and Jim Carrey, who will always be in my book in the mask.
