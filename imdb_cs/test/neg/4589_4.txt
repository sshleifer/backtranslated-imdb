Another horrible movie about hockey. If I had never followed hockey and had seen the Hollywood version, I would hate the game. Even this movie doesn't make Canada so great. I can laugh at her and I don't take it too seriously. The same movie is horrible, with every thing you can put into the 80s. Don't even watch TV in the end. 4/10
