At the bottom of the apocalypse film scale, this piece of pish is called "The Final Executioner" .. at least where I come from. The fool is trained by a former cop to seek revenge on those who killed his wife and friends in cold blood. Lots of fake blasts and repeated missiles. He has one of the strangest costumes that I have seen in the film for a while, and a massive fortress that only 7 people seem to run. Great work on dubbing and guys (!) The best moment: when our hero loses his combat sword and is about to walk through his neck, he gets only a gun and BANG! Why do this before? It's a mystery. What is the reason why someone wants to sit in the first place. Now I was still wondering about the same thing. 2/10
