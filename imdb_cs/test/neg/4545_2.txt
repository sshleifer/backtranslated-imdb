As you can expect, there is a pretty good reason why this film is so dark and unknown, even though they always deal with the popular assumption of zombies and starring the 80-year-old Queen Linda Blair, specifically: it's shit! "The Chilling" is tremendously trying? too hard? Be a story with depth and factual background, while it was supposed to be just a light and fearsome horror movie about frozen zombies. It takes an incredibly long time for something interesting or significant to happen. There's a lot of drivel about cryogenics that I've learned in my class physics is studying products and their behavior at extremely low temperatures. So naturally, in this film a bunch of people studying the behavior of human corpses when deep frozen. Needless to say, it is immensely boring until two out-of-the-night night guards decide during a power outage that it's a good idea to place cool metal-based links outside the thunderstorms. The coolers are apparently hit by lightning and the bodies spontaneously defrost and come to live to go on a deadly zombie rampage. "The Chilling" is boring and surprisingly (at least for the 1980s, at least) a gore-free horror movie that doesn't use a quarter of its potential. All the painful attempts to build an atmosphere of tension and strangeness have failed tremendously, and I can't think of any reason why zombie attacks would have to be so bloodless. Despite the low budget available, they could do better. Pieces, makeup and costumes are sad. For example, a research lab looks like an apartment, while zombies couldn't look less menacing with their green faces and foil wrappers. How Linda Blair was once again involved in such a fearsome horror movie that is embarrassed is a complete secret. She is attracted by a lousy film B like bees.
