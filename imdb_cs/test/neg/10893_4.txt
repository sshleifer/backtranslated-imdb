A young couple decides to flee to sunny California. They never get to their destination because they decide to stop at Rest Stop. After a fight with her friend, Nicole Carrow insists on stopping. When she is ready to leave, she leaves the bathroom to find her friend who has disappeared with the car and left her trapped on the back roads of Texas, with only a deserted caravan van to keep her company. The rest of Stop is one of those cheap and cheap horror movies that could become a cult classic. Will Rest Stop become a cult classic that you can ask? The three elements you need to become a cult classic are gore, sex, and artistic merit. The rest of the stop has a bucket of lots of gore, and while I don't want to give too much away, it contains oodles of blood-soaked ugliness. This film has everything from a bad guy running through the feet of a cop with his car several times to him using a pneumatic workout on a girl's leg. Sometimes it can be as bloody as the movie can get. He also has a gratuitous yet intimate scene of love in the opening minutes of the film. Therefore, sex is covered. Hard now? has any artistic merit? You never see the bad face? you see views, profiles, shadow silhouettes. It is an anonymous, relentless, monster that stands out on an artistic scale. The film has very few characters except the main protagonist? Nicole Carrow (Jaimie Alexander). Since she spends much of the film herself, she cannot reveal her thoughts during the conversation, but she must speak out loud so that we, the viewers, know what they think. Sometimes it may be slightly irritating; however, it is a brave step by the writer (John Shiban) and it works for most of the film. As viewers know that being totally lonely and isolated from civilization is scary enough, even if you are not persecuted by psychotic killers. So does Rest Stop become a cult classic? It will probably be because, along with gore, sex and arrogant artistic merits, it also has plenty of chills, interesting and inventive conspiracy, and a lot of screams on the screen because the main character does a lot of things you should definitely not do while running from a psychotic killer. (What kind of fun is horror if you can't complain about the stupidity of the victims?)
