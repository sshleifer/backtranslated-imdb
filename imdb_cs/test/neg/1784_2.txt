If this movie was made two years earlier, it could have been much better. Unfortunately, it was made in a decade that had no idea how the horror movie should look or act. When I first heard about this movie, people on IMDb classified it as a follow-up to the Cheerleader Camp. Oh, how bad they were. Yes, Betsy Russell was there, but Uma Thurman wasn't. I really would like to find a person who started the rumor of continuing. I'm sure many of us would. I will not give up because, frankly, I do not remember how this movie ends! I'll tell you to look at the real camp horror ... Burning starring Jason Alexander, Fisher Stevens, Holly Hunter and the Fast Times geek in Ridgemont High. The Word Wisely - Just because the horror has a word in the camp doesn't mean it's worth watching. Oh, and another thing, any HORROR FLICK MADE IN EARLY TO MID 90, when it was always considered whether it's good!
