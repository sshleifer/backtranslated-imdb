"Max Risk" is a step for Van Damme and just one of the non-inspired B-movie action films that we expected from films featuring a macho Belgian martial artist. Flick has a gaping plot hole, goofs galore, a messy conglomerate plot, and a gorgeous Henstridge who spends most of his time looking as if waiting for a cue. The maximum risk is by no means differentiated and probably not too attractive than the usual young male audience. (C-)
