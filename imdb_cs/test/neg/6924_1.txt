Owen (David Krumholtz) and Chloe (Denise Richards) are younger spouses living in Manhattan. Owen is a slightly successful magazine writer, while Chloe is an aspiring actress. Fortunately for her, Chloe gets a big part in the sitcom and temporarily moves to Hollywood. When Owen is missing, she will surprise the book. However, when he arrives at his trailer, the "house" shakes because Chloe and her hunks have a little romantic tryst. The writer and actress are over. Owen, wounded and mad as a hatter, returns to New York. The sympathetic friends decide to put him on a blind day with Nadine (Milla Jovovich) to get him out of his sullen funk. But it goes wrong because the duo mixes like oil and water, mostly because everyone has a strong personality and a huge Owen shoulder chip. However, Nadine and Owen, surprisingly, become friends over the next few months, confiding and enduring each other. Can it turn into something more? Who the hell is interested! This movie is so STUPID that most people pull it out of the DVD player after the first ten minutes. The script is pathetic, offensive, and, too, stupid. Then again Krumholtz gives a very unpleasant and offensive performance. Jovovich is not much better, but who could look good with the lines he has to go? William Baldwin also achieves his career with brute and sex-insane roles as Owen's brother. The only cast that is good is Richards, but he has to cringe when he looks at this. Well, the costumes and production values ​​are adequate. Also there is ONE clever element in that at times, characters will speak their lines, but cartoon bubbles will appear over their heads with the words of what they really think. This doesn't save the movie from a "bomb" state. Don't be stupid, dear film and romance lovers. Do not rent, buy, or borrow this huge turkey. Today I am the stupidest person on Earth to follow him to the bitter end.
