Do I have to ask myself to do films like this, get support from people related to the film coming here and criticize it? How can something so terrible to achieve this high score? My parents went to see a lot more adult themed movies when we were kids, something with R in it until we were old enough. I only remember the two movies they called yech! when they came home. This one, and "Catch-22". The film consists of humiliating doctors and employees in a dirty hospital, crazy stories, and a pack of people from inner cities (who look like a rejection of the 1970s). Norman Lear sitcom) performance protest. The worst is "mysterious murder", a crazy old guy who does "God's work" by killing doctors and more. When he confesses, Scott and his girlfriend show little emotions. They just make sure he gets there where he'll be "safe and happy". A doctor who falls from a heart attack is fake as a man, so he can get away. Oh, my funny movie. This movie didn't "think", laugh, or have a different feeling than "It must be better", but it never does. People wonder why it was a mistake, no wonder. I wonder how IMDb has enough members who think this movie is good. YECH.
