Jack Frost returns with an army of polystyrene beads that can only be thwarted by being shot by super-soakers loaded with margaritas. What is it like for the conspiracy? The film relies on such a ridiculous assumption that it barely raises an eyebrow when characters are killed by BBQ pliers and impaled by carrots. You can even say that the whole film is skating on thin ice (ba-boom-tish). Sure, there are some fantastic one-inserts, including notes on Murderous Coconut Shark. Sufficient times are difficult, but this does not excuse the actors' willingness to participate in this sheer trio. <br /> <br /> For those fans hoping to see Jack Frost, be prepared to accept him as just a phallic carrot that crawls on the beach with a commented commentary.
