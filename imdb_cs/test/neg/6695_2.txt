I tune in to this movie not because I am a fan of the US High School basketball (I have rarely watched NBA games), but rather because I am a fan of Gene Hackman who usually manages to bring impressive depth his performances. In this case, however, I was very disappointed. It wasn't one of the bright shining stars of Hackman's career. He didn't have much to do with him in righteousness. As Norman Dale, the new coach of a small city basketball team in Indiana, he was not invited to do much. Basically his performance was to move basketball up and down. I did not consider him particularly believable in the role to be honest. I was also disinterested with the necessary romance between Dale and Myrou Fleener (Barbara Hershey). Frankly, there was no chemistry between Hackman and Hershey. I was never interested in romance, nor was the basketball action that was too predictable. <br /> <br /> There were too many problems with this movie to make it worthwhile. I have never understood the depth of total hatred that city dwellers have had for Dale almost since he arrived. The development of the character was poor and the story itself was poorly developed. Too much basketball and lack of human interaction, in my opinion. How many shots of kids who shoot baskets do we need to see it's a basketball movie? There was no tension: is it even possible to doubt that Hickory will win? I realize it's based on a true story, but I think it proves that not every true story should be a movie. Frankly, it wasn't a very interesting movie. Definitely Gene Hackman would like to forget. <br /> <br /> In my opinion, it's no better than 2/10.
