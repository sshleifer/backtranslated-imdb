Where to start? Someone has some Indian pot that cleans, and suddenly Skeletor attacks. He strikes the woman's throat with an ax, falls, but then gets up and is clearly unharmed. It runs into the forest and it turns out that there is a shopping center basement in the forest. Again, he meets the assistant and Skeletor attacks. Luckily, like any good worker, he has a gun and shoots that guy. It doesn't work, everything starts on fire. Cut for some people walking through the woods. Although they have been dating each other for a while, they sit down and present themselves. Probably wouldn't do it when they first met? By the way, they are "secret" members of the Delta team (I suppose they are secret because they don't have to pay to dress them in uniforms). Cute girls are different things like sniper school instructor, and oh, I can't remember the rest. No matter. In the end, they all take their weapons and head for them immediately. ? Anyway, they meet an old Indian who sits in the woods. He wants beans. You know, like pork and beans? He mumbles some things, I can only assume that this is the premise of the film. I relied on hearing the assumptions of the ads because you couldn't understand anything he said. So they walk more in the woods. The whole dialogue is a burden of quasi-military, macho BS. I mean it all as in every single word. Like "It reminds me when we were in Kabul" or "It reminds me when we were in Laos". Again they attack the skeletons. Let me inform you about the basic attack. One of the female figures is crouched behind a tree and points a gun at the approaching horse on horseback. For some reason, he won't fire, but shouts for someone else several times. After Skeletor approaches, he jumps out from behind the tree so that Skeletor can hold her with a spear. Then everyone starts shooting. Bullets cause sparks to flow from trees. It seems that the people who did this movie never shot a bullet tree. They don't make sparks. Then Casper Van Diem suddenly rides on the truck and tries to cross the skeleton. He is missing and the truck stops. Van Diem is wounded, apparently sliding over the seat and crashing sideways on the window handle, or something, so he climbed out of the car and exploded. Later in the forest dying and all say, a bunch of quasi-military, macho BS. They meet a couple of guys in the woods and throw out their "secret" status by identifying themselves as an army. They beat the guys for some reason, then they go away. Some other things are happening, people are mumbling, the camera is shaking, etc. <br /> <br /> I think it will come to an end eventually. My theory is that the Sci-Fi channel is a little annoyed with anyone who beats on their movies, so they have it out to remind us how bad movies can really be. Do you think our movies are bad? Well, you didn't see it wrong. HERE IS BAD !!! Okay, now that we're out of the way, the rest of our movies are pretty good compared to that, right? Well, it's just a theory.
