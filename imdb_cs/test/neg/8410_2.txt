With its small details of surrealism, LWHTRB works as a low-grade horror movie, but as a major continuation statement to the original, it disappears miserably. <br /> <br /> Things start promising in the opening credits. We see and hear some interesting shots and sounds: Baby cot with overhanging, inverted cross; the kitchen knife Rosemary carried to Castevette's apartment and fell in shock (the container is protruding from the wooden floor); and the emptiness of Bramford itself, without tenants or furniture (voice messages can be heard from the dialogue of the previous film). Also interesting is the Easter egg hunting for the titular baby on which it is involved (eggs and baskets are also black). When the story begins to roll, it never really "wobbles" ... And what happens to Rosemary when he boarded a bus without a driver and is dragged to God - where? Patty Duke (a bad replacement for Mia Farrow), Ray Milland and Tina Louise (as a Southwestern whore raising a child, "Adrian / Andrew"), this almost starry cast, with Ruth Gordon repeating her role "Minnie". Although this is not a total failure, this continuation of the species should first be published in book form, then maybe we could be a little better informed ... and not completely in the dark. A relatively recent sequel to the novel "Son of Rosemary" (1999?) Is a legitimate sequel to Ira Levin himself. <br /> <br />
