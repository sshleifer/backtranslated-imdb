First, the genre of this film is not a comedy, it's rather a drama. <br /> <br /> I had little expectations in the movie and yet they didn't accept them. As some others reviews point out, there are some nice music in the movie. But if you want to listen to good music, I recommend spending time looking at a concert recording with Bon Jovi or MÃ¶tley Crue, it will be a better time. <br /> <br /> Last, if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock'n'roll genre, I recommend "Almost Famous".
