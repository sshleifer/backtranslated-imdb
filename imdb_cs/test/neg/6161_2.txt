It is a film with a wonderful concept, but very weak writing. It should never be released with at least three other transcripts (assuming it's some). The story is too loosely held together, and there are too many 90 degrees turns in the story to make it a coherent film. It would be great to see what a decent screenwriter could do with the story.
