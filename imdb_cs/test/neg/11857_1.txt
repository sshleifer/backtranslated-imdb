Roger Corman enjoyed his share of film shame in his renowned low budget career, spanning more than 300 films. While a few (if any) would call him great, his obscure connection of films with underground culture (through reference, tribute or influence) ensured him a crooked legacy of species. During his career, he also created a bad habit of redoing his own films ("Piranha", "Humanoids from the Deep", "The Black Scorpion", etc.), without making any improvements to them. "Raptor", "written" and "director" by "Jay Andrews" (Jim Wynorski, the man behind one of my favorite movie guilt pleasures, "Chopping Mall") takes this practice to a distressing new minimum regarding Corman's mid-1990s . "Carnosaur" trilogy. Wynorski's credits are in quotes because "Raptor" is not a homage to the "Carnosaur" movies or a remake. "Raptor" is "Carnosaur" movies, or at least the film's dinosaur-induced death scenes, accidentally spliced ​​along with trace elements of the original plot and some newly shot scenes (many of which consist of "looking dino" views in footage. Lame attempt to make the inserted scenes look less obvious. "New" material was written around footage, instead of vice versa, and is utterly extraordinary, with huge gaps in logic (eg, two separate teams are aired by the army simply so shots from sections 2 and 3 where soldiers could have included different uniforms) which is amazing given how small the logic plays in one of the "Carnosaur" movies. The lack of any actor feelings in their characters (though only in fairness, any character dimension in the screenplay, perhaps twice) recalls the terribly wooden play of the b-movies in the fifties, and certainly does nothing between the ripped off scenes that are worth watch it. Even more embarrassing for the actors of the new scenes is when there is a clear contradiction in the physical building between the new actor and the actor in the original scene. When the only scene that provokes any reaction in the movie is the oldest trick in the horror book, "Spring Beast", something is really bad. As it is, it's a desperate practice in two b-grade characters (who don't have to worry about destroying their reputation because they don't have one), tearing their own material, the cheapest and fastest dirty tricks, just Because they can (why would anyone feel obsessed) rip off the series wanted to be a rip off "series Jurassic Park"?). There is not much I can say other than that this film has its highest recommendations against viewing; The only good thing about this (besides looking at Melissa Braselle's navel) is that I don't have to see any of the "Carnosaur" movies now.
