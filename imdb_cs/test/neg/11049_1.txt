This commentary is intended primarily as a warning to people who might be attracted to the title by their (temporarily) high user ratings, which seems totally mysterious. The reasons why I don't like this title are as follows: 1. The director had to have some doubts about whether to make Jackie-Chan's film or the dark Oedipus tragedy. As a result, as far as the genre is concerned, the film falls between two molars because the tragic and comic elements clash and cancel rather than create a harmonious whole. 2. The motives and behavior of characters are incoherent and unconvincing. Unfortunately, the psychological truth and logic are missing. 3. Absurd casting. I don't blame the actors because it's hard to create a convincing character by acting alone if there is a rare logic in the script. But why is the age difference between two leading actors whose film age cannot differ by more than 3-4? <br /> <br /> 4? For me, the film was a bad pastime especially because of point 2. If you can't find a character you could sympathize with, it's hard to follow a story with interest. When you finally learn what happened to the main protagonist, it turns out it doesn't make sense. 5. Some movies in addition to entertainment are also provocative. When I saw this film, I began to wonder if the idea the director tried to provoke was not such that incestuous relationships could be perfectly healthy and enjoyable. At the end I can't build any other structure. 6. The film is full of unnecessary violence. Violence in film (and elsewhere) is a good thing if it serves an important and worthy purpose. Purposes may be different and I do not want to enter this broad subject. Let me say that I do not object to violence in such films as "Saving Private Ryan", "The Passion of the Christ" or "The Pulp Fiction". In "Oldboy", scenes of torture and suffering are prolonged and graphic (or auditory). For what? I don't know. Personally, I do not feel any satisfaction from watching my teeth be pulled out with a hammer, or I can hear the scissors cutting off his tongue and then seeing him suffocate with his own blood, etc. \ t manga in his incest fixation and young Asian girl's panties, peeing and the like. It seems to be a minority that really enjoys this kind of thing. If you are one of them, you can enjoy this movie. In short, I do not recommend this film either as entertainment or as "food for thought". Where it's not stupid, it's disgusting. Don't waste your time.
