I didn't know what to expect when I started watching this movie. This was one of the most attractive films of this year ... in fact for the last ten years. David Dhawan should give up his career as a director. I haven't come across one original script that David Dhawan worked on. This was a complete bit bit blow of Hitch. I have nothing against remakes as such, but this is just so bad that it makes you hate. I don't understand what actors like Salman and Govinda saw in this scenario. I read somewhere that it was supposed to be a Govinda comeback vehicle. If this is true, then only God can save his career. Salman just walked over to the handle. Govinda, who thinks he's a very high caliber actor, was completely useless. Katrina Kaif and LAra Dutta had nothing to do with branded clothing and smiling without a rhyme or reason. Please stay away from this!
