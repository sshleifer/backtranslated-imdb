As someone mentioned on this board, it is very difficult to create a fake document. It requires immense abilities, stimulation, patience, overhead distance, "credible premise, telling" flow "and truly credible action (aka GREAT acting). <br /> <br /> This is not the case with Love Machine. He starts showing his false hand about a 20-minute mark (60 minutes left to follow) and the viewer is beginning to realize that he is in the game. He's down here. Director Gordon Eriksen just got too early. But to be fair to Eriksen, his problems began early: as he explains in the extras, he began to do REAL doc, couldn't raise funds and settled on a cheaper way to make his film. Prerequisite - People who have secret lives by posting on porn sites - may have been more interesting in 1997-98 when the film was made. Eriksen does a lot of tricky things - an ambitious 'guest,' hand-held cameras, zooming, grainy black and white - all I think is creating a sense of authenticity, but it just doesn't work. The film is confusing and forced, but what eventually brings it is the credibility of the actors and a very frightening dialogue.
