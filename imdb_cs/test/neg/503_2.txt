The operative rule in making this movie seems to be "never making a 1-minute scene when you make a 10-minute scene." This was the principle from the outset with an endlessly long view of the 1870 Harvard class graduation. life in Johnson County, Wyoming, but it still goes and goes, and it creates a podium for a film that features repetitive stretches of mind-numbing nothing, which is even worse by finding that a considerable amount of dialogue is almost incoherent. In the end, I couldn't even see it in one session. I got over half and had to put it aside for a few days before I could get back to see how it went. <br /> <br /> My response to this film in many ways is a shame because it's positive here. The performances are generally high caliber, especially from Kris Kristofersson as Averill, Christopher Walken as Champion and Isabelle Huppert as Ella. The basic story - scattered as it is about the ever-present mindlessness - is potentially interesting, focusing on immigrant efforts to establish themselves in Johnson County and local efforts to stop them by killing them. cooperation with government and army. There is also some absolutely breathtaking scenery shots. So the whole thing could be honestly done in half the time - and it should be. Eventually, all these potential positives are washed away - again - by the insensitivity that the film seems to revolve around. Seriously - 2/10.
