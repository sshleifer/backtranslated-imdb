This is by far the worst version of the tragic masterpiece of William Shakespeare I have ever seen. The filmmakers do not seem to have actually read Shakespeare's lyrics. No, they just took what they wanted from Lawerence Olivier. The plot is out of order and dilapidated to bare necessities, but it's time for the neon Olivier to create a hint of incest between Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. Could we instead have something "rotten in the state of Denmark"? Another problem is casting. I understand that a much better film, Branagh, had its weak bits (Robin Williams and Charlton Heston in mind), but this has very few good moments. I like Laertes and Polonius, but the rest of the cast is outdated. The scary stubble of Mel Gibson is irritating, and you often wonder if he has a clue what he says. Many of the actors seem to have just remembered this part - they know less about what they say than sophomoras in high school. <br /> <br /> If you want Hamlet, check out Kenneth Branagh's or even Lawerence Olivier. To be honest, Disney's Hamlet is better.
